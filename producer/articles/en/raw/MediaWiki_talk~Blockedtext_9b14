== Suggestions ==
I made the '''Your IP address is $3. Please include this address in any queries you make'' bold, since about half of the users emailing me dont include their IP adress. Also, should we suggest to log on again for dynamically assigned IP adresses? This would&#12288;fix some problems (e.g. with AOL users). Finally: Maybe we can include a template text to be emailed, e.g.:
:''Hi. It seems my IP adress $3 has been blocked. Could you unblock my IP adress so I can edit Wikipedia? Thanks. ''<br>

== Allow registered users to edit ==

== Proposed rewrite ==
See [[User:Pathoschild/Sandbox2]] (revision as of this message: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Pathoschild/Sandbox2&oldid=34884393 oldid 34884393]) for the full proposal. 

Generally, the text is expanded and clarified, and the page is reorganised to flow more logically. The user is explained the block before the appeal options, for example. The information given to include in any queries is now after the appeal options, and more complete; as well as the IP address currently included, it also specifies the blocking administrator and reason.

Emailing the blocking or other administrator is removed from the appeal options. This option is often slow and frustrating to access for unregistered or new users. Instead, the new instructions suggest the use of {{unblock&#125;} to add the user to [[:Category:Requests for unblock]]. This helps mitigate the possibility of abuse of power both by delegating the review to a neutral third-party, and by making the discussion publicly viewable. Open discussion is particularly important since the only appeal option suggested in cases of power abuse involve the mailing list, and email is very difficult to use as evidence. // [[User:Pathoschild/s|Pathoschild]] 13:02, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

::: Wow how did you become an admin? So rude.

== Unblock ==

I'd like to propose that mention be made in this message of the [[Template:block|<nowiki>{{unblock}}</nowiki>]] template, as a way for blocked users to appeal to whichever admins happen to be around. Ideally, I think it could ''actually'' replace "You can email <nowiki>$</nowiki>4". First of all, as volunteers I don't see why admins should have to deal with Wikipedia email. All Wikipedia business should take place ''right here'', as far as I'm concerned. Secondly, anybody emailing me is likely to have a long wait given that I have 2500 (yes) unread messages in my inbox, and a further 1000 in Bulk! --[[User:Kingboyk|kingboyk]] 15:12, 17 March 2006 (UTC)
:It should definitely not replace the email link. I frequently receive emails when I block people. More often than not, the blocking admin is more knowledgeable of the situation than Joe Random Admin and, if they hae stopped editing by the time the {unblock} is placed, it can cause confusion among other admins. An email, on the other hand, goes directly to the target and may well get read 'in real time' even if the admin is not actually editing Wikipedia at that moment. That you have a big inbox is not a reason to remove email instructions from this message, but it is a reason for you to clear out your inbox. Admins ''need'' to be reachable by email if they are going to block people. -[[User:Splash|Splash]]<small><sup>[[User talk:Splash|talk]]</sup></small> 15:17, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

:::::I don't know. Shall I email the admin? Email info-en? Place {unblock}? Go to IRC? It's becoming bewildering to me, let alone someone more newbie than me.

:It's my personal opinion that if you are not contactable by email or willing to monitor the talk pages of users you block, you shouldn't be blocking users. Adminship is a volunteer thing, yes, but it is a volunteer responsibility. If as a volunteer you do not wish to follow up on blocks, you should not volunteer to block users; there are plenty of other uses for admin tools. There is so much warring over application and lifting of blocks that it is best for the blocking admin to be able to follow up on communication; if because you will not be around you cannot block a user who needs to be blocked, leave a note for another admin to do it.

== Clarification for AOL users ==
AOL users are constantly being caught by blocks, either as a result of autoblocks of registered vandals, or by those who take advantage their round-robin method of doling out IP addresses.  As much as I would prefer to see this page kept as simple as possible, I think it would behoove us to add a link explaining why they are being innocently blocked in greater detail, similar to how we have a '''"Editing from China?"''' link at the bottom of the page.  Best regards, [[User:Hall Monitor|Hall Monitor]] 18:37, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

:I support this idea.  The real question is, what should the page say?  The German Wikipedia [[:de:AOL-Sperre|seems to suggest]] that simply using a different browser (such as [[Firefox]]) will bypass the AOL proxies.  Can anyone confirm this?  Can the AOL standard browsers ([[Internet Explorer|IE]] on Windows, [[Mozilla]]-based on Mac) be configured not to use the proxies?  Where couls we find a few AOL users to help us test this in practice?  —[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] <small>([[User talk:Ilmari Karonen|talk]])</small> 16:49, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

== Some stuff removed and changed ==

I boldly updated this after a very brief IRC discussion.

* Removed link to wikien-l because it makes for a bad user experience.  Mail gets delayed in the moderation queue and many times people make fun of unblock requests.
* Added a link to contact_us/blocked which presently directs people to info-en though hopefully this will change very soon
* Removed a suggestion to contact other administrators.  The policy consensus is that the blocking admin should be involved in unblock requests, and so contacting admins at random is poor advice.
* Added text indicating that the user must contact the blocking admin first before escalating the matter elsewhere
* Added text indicating that the user must include copies of correspondence with the blocking admin when escalating

== Links to block log ==

Making someone look through the IP block list seems mean. Can't we just link to the block log for the IP address? I'm afraid to touch the page for fear of breaking it. --[[User:Deskana|Lord Deskana]] <sup>[[User_Talk:Deskana|Dark Lord of the Sith]]</sup> 23:51, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

:Yeah. The link to the block log should be: <code><nowiki>Special:Ipblocklist?action=search&limit=500&ip=$3</nowiki></code> --<font size="1">[[User:GeorgeMoney|GeorgeMoney]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User_talk:GeorgeMoney|T]]&middot;[[Special:Contributions/GeorgeMoney|C]]</sup></font> 01:09, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

I considered adding something like this in the past, but realized that the value of $3 will always be the blocked user's IP address, and never a username, so that link would only be useful in about 50% of cases. — <small>Jun. 4, '06</small><tt> '''[06:01] <<u class=plainlinks>[{{fullurl:user:freakofnurture}} freak]|[{{fullurl:user talk:freakofnurture|action=edit&section=new}} talk]</u>>'''</tt>

:I wish MediaWiki had another value for usernames, like $4 so we could use some kind of parser function and work something out so if it is a user, it links to the user. If it is an IP, it links to the IP. --<font size="1">[[User:GeorgeMoney|GeorgeMoney]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User_talk:GeorgeMoney|T]]&middot;[[Special:Contributions/GeorgeMoney|C]]</sup></font> 06:04, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

In any case, there should at least be a link to the IP block list. Many people are unaware of the search terms that will take them to it.

== Raw Wikitext ==

On the bottom, it has a link for "Raw Wikitext" that you have to download. Well, some people might not want to download it, so I think the link should point to "&action=raw&ctype=text/css" instead of "&action=raw", so it doesn't have to be downloaded.

An example is:

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:GeorgeMoney&action=raw&ctype=text/css - which is the non-download version

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:GeorgeMoney&action=raw - which is the download version

:The fact that the former works as you expect it is coincidental, and arguably a bug: the "text/css" type is telling the browser to treat it as a style sheet, not as text — a number of common browsers just happen to default to displaying style sheets as text if viewed directly.

:The issue has in fact been discussed above, in the section titled [[#Raw wiki text|Raw wiki text]].  The mailing list link given there is useful reading.  —[[User:Ilmari Karonen|Ilmari Karonen]] <small>([[User talk:Ilmari Karonen|talk]])</small> 22:44, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

==View Source==

You should know that both options are not that great. In one you have to allow a download to your PC (which I won't due for fear of viruses). If you cut and paste the text from Special/Export PAges, you don't get exactly what you would have gotten in the edit box (The headings are not done right for one thing). I still think there should be a way to view the source in an edit box type arrangement, as you can if you click view source on a protected page.  I'd like to ask one of your software guys if they can do this for us, if it is not already possible. Thanks. [[User:152.163.100.138|152.163.100.138]] 15:20, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

As of today, the page shown to blocked users [[bugzilla:4990|now includes the source]] of the page they were trying to edit.  Even more importantly, if the user is blocked ''while'' they are editing, the message they see will show the version they were about to submit.  Thus, '''IE users will no longer lose their edits''' if their IP is blocked while editing.  I'm sure millions of AOLers will appreciate this.  (Ps. Two new messages have been introduced for this feature: [[MediaWiki:blockedoriginalsource|blockedoriginalsource]] and [[MediaWiki:blockededitsource|blockededitsource]].

==Steamlining suggestions==
After spending some time on the unblock-en list, I am beginning to feel that our Blockedtext page is more confusing than it is helpful.  For example, would there be any disadvantage to combining these multiple unblock tags into a single catchall template?  If requests were funneled through a single point of contact, i.e. the mailing list, the verbiage could be cut in half.  I'm throwing ideas out there, but would like to know if there are any other thoughts on how we might make less into something more.  [[User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me|Can&#39;t sleep, clown will eat me]] 22:47, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

:I believe that there are privacy issues that prevent us from having a single unblock template since a registered user may not want to reveal their IP address when requesting an unblock. We shouldn't funnel all requests to a mailing list since a lot of users don't want to reveal their email address either. My feeling is that less than 20% of unblock requests go through unblock-en-l at this moment while [[:CAT:RFU]] handles the rest. -- <small><span style="border: 1px solid">[[User:Netsnipe|'''<span style="background-color:White; color:#003333"> &nbsp;Netsnipe&nbsp;</span>''']][[User talk:Netsnipe|<span style="background-color:#003333; color:White">&nbsp;►&nbsp;</span>]]</span></small> 20:07, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

== Fairly significant edit ==

I've done away with the two-column thing, instead having three linear sections and directing autoblocked users to the correct place right at the very top. I've also tried to clean up the wording of a lot of the page. Further editing is welcomed – [[User:Gurch|Gurch]] 20:40, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

:Looks like someone decided to make it five sections – [[User:Gurch|Gurch]] 03:09, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Appealing a block]]==

Since pretty much everything from [[Wikipedia:Appealing a block]] is now covered by [[MediaWiki:Blockedtext]], what should we do about the now redundant page? Redirect? Shorten? -- <small><span style="border: 1px solid">[[User:Netsnipe|'''<span style="background-color:White; color:#003333"> &nbsp;Netsnipe&nbsp;</span>''']][[User talk:Netsnipe|<span style="background-color:#003333; color:White">&nbsp;►&nbsp;</span>]]</span></small> 12:05, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
:I strongly oppose having policies in MediaWiki-space. It's probably best to leave them both with similar information and to synchronize the MediaWiki page to the policy from time to time (in terms of content, not style, and loosely). If the interface message is saying something the policy isn't, it's probably worth changing one or the other of them (and a difference the other way round is probably OK but is worth thinking about). --[[User:ais523|ais523]] 16:32, 13 November 2006 ([[User:ais523|U]][[User talk:ais523|T]][[Special:Contributions/Ais523|C]])

== Requested edit - grammar ==
The word "an" is repeated in a sentence:

<nowiki>== Unregistered? ==</nowiki>

MediaWiki, the software that Wikipedia runs on, identifies users without '''an an''' account through their IP address. (emphasis added)

Anybody mind if I update the stop icon from [[Image:Octagon-warning.svg|40px]] to [[Image:Stop X.png|40px]] ? -- [[User:Renesis13|Renesis]] ([[User talk:Renesis13|talk]]) 18:41, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

== Suggested Edit. ==

I have a suggestion for this page: I think that: ''If you have just clicked a red link, you were blocked from starting a new page as no article on that topic exists yet'' should be changed to: ''If you have just clicked a red link, it means you were blocked from starting a new page as no article on that topic exists yet.'' Does that read any better? I'm suggesting this because I think it does. [[User:Acalamari|Acalamari]] 18:01, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::You welcome, but I thank ''you'' for actually doing the edit, as I couldn't. I think that sentence reads better now. [[User:Acalamari|Acalamari]] 18:30, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*As I can't edit this myself, here's another suggestion: why not change: ''If you wish to appeal your block, see the following section.'' to ''If you wish to appeal your block, please see the following section.'' I've seen the word please in other notices, and I thought it would be appropriate here too. [[User:Acalamari|Acalamari]] 23:21, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

==Block reason in italics (suggested)==
I believe that it would be better if the reason for the block is in ''italics'' again. [[User:Han Amos|<b><font color="#FF9933" face="monotype">Amos Han</font></b>]] <sup>[[User_talk:Han Amos|<font color="#00FF00">Talk</font>]]</sup> 21:02, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
