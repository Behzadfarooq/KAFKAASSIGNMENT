As the Group General Manager, he was responsible for the adoption of new and modern practices in operational management, industrial relations and marketing management. The development and application of new management and marketing theories have always been of practical and academic interest to him. So in 1994, he enrolled in Keele University, Staffordshire, England, to indoctrinate himself with new developments in the management sector. During his studies in England, he also assisted the management of, the WestCroft Nursing Home, an 85-bed elderly care residential home in United Kingdom. In 1996, upon his return from England to Pakistan, he purchased the shares in a family concern, the Al-Khaliq Patients Care, a 150-bed hospital, and managed the business as Chief Executive. In 1999 after the first medical institutions, the Allama Iqbal Medical College and the 1,100-bed Jinnah Hospital in Lahore, were declared autonomous bodies in Pakistan, he had applied for the post of pioneer Director, Health Care Marketing, in the public sector for South Asia.
