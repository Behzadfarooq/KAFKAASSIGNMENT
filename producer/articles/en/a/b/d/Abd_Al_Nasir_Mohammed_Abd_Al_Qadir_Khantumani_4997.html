Combatant Status Review Tribunals were held in a small trailer, the same width, but shorter, than a mobile home. The Tribunal's President sat in the big chair.

<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p>Khantumani chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.<sup id="_ref-CsrtAbdAlNasirMohammedAbdAlQadirKhantumani_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtAbdAlNasirMohammedAbdAlQadirKhantumani" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>During most detainees Tribunals the allegations against them were read aloud, and were included in the transcript. Since Khantumani had prepared a long written statement the allegations against Khantumani were not included in his transcript.</p>

<p>Since Khantumani had responded with a written statement the Tribunal proceed directly to asking him questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Khantumani answered that he was joined by his mother, his wife, his youngest son, his son <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Abd_Al_Nasir_Muhammad_Khantumani_ce5b.html" title="Muhammad Abd Al Nasir Muhammad Khantumani">Muhammad Abd Al Nasir Muhammad Khantumani</a>, his brother, his brother's wife, and their children. During his Tribunal his son Muhammad said he had traveled with nine other family members.<sup id="_ref-CsrtMuhammadKhantumaniJr_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtMuhammadKhantumaniJr" title="">[3]</a></sup>During his Tribunal Muhammad said he and the rest of his family had followed his father to Afghanistan after he had found a job in <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabul.html" title="Kabul">Kabul</a>,</li>
<li>Khantumani confirmed he arrived in Afghanistan in 1999 and that he was followed by his family in 2001. During his Tribunal his son Muhammad said they followed his father approximately fifteen months after he left Syria.</li>

<li>Khantumani testified that he and his son were separated from the rest of his family because their guides who were helping them escape to Pakistan told them their party would be suspicious if it contained too many men. So he and his father remained behind and made their own way through the mountains.</li>

<li>Khantumani said that he had spent all his time in Afghanistan in Kabul. He chose Kabul because it had the most economic activity, meaning it would be easier for him to find work.</li>
<li>Khantumani initially stayed in a hotel. Then he was visited by four members of the secret police, who told him that he should stay with another Arabic man, named Abu Abdullah Al-Shami.</li>
<li>Khantumani got his own place prior to the arrival of his family.</li>
<li>Khantumani and his son were carrying their passports when they were captured.</li>
<li>Khantumani said that the allegation that he had been present in the bus that was hijacked by prisoners who were al Qaeda suspects was false. He had been coerced into falsely confessing this during his torture sessions in Pakistan.</li>

<p>Muhammad was asked how he and his father became separated from the rest of his family. His answer was the same as his father -- their guides had advised them their party contained too many men, and would attract suspicion that a group of women and children would not.</p>
<p>Muhammad said they learned the rest of their family was killed by the Americans.</p>
<p>Muhammad said that he and his father always surrendered random scraps of metal they found in the prison, that could be turned into weapons.</p>
<p>Muhammad said everyone in his family had valid passports.</p>
<p>Muhammad was also asked about the allegation that he and his father had traveled in a bus which was hijacked by the prisoners:</p>

We didn't know anything about this bus. We tried to say no, no, no, but they just keep torturing us. Then they broke my nose and I said I was on the bus. After they tortured us, the Pakistanis said we were going to America for two days. They said if we changed what we said, they would come and kill you, definitely for sure.</i></td>
