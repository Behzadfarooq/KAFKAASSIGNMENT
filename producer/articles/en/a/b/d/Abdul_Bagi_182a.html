<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>Bagi denied being a member of the Taliban. He denied admitting participating in an ambush on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, or in any hostilities whatsoever. He denied owning a weapon, or throwing one down a well, or hiding when an American convoy drove by.</p>
<p>Bagi’s account of his capture was that he and his uncle were driving his uncle’s tractor to the bazaar to buy oil and filters. They heard an American vehicles approaching them, so they pulled off the road so they wouldn’t be in the way. They got off the tractor to wait for the Americans to go by. But the Americans stopped, and took them into custody.</p>
<p>The Americans took him over to a newly dug well, and asked what it was for. He explained it was a well, for irrigating crops.</p>
<p>The Americans took his uncle and himself to where they had secured the other men in the village. Most of the other men were released. But he and several other men were taken to Bagram. It was only in Bagram, seven days later, when he was interrogated did he learn that his dossier contained the claim that he had hidden in a hole and thrown a weapon down a well. According to Bagi the well only had about a foot of water in it, and anyone could have seen if an object even as small as a pen had been thrown in it.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Bagi_182a.html" title="Edit section: witnesses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">witnesses</span></h3>
<p>Bagi asked three other men from his village, who were captured the same day he was, to testify on his behalf. The transcript from his CSRT does not identify them by name. It is clear from the context that one of the witnesses is his uncle. When Bagi attended his <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Bagi_182a.html#Administrative_Review_Board_hearing" title="Abdul Bagi">Administrative Review Board hearing</a> the identity of his other two witnesses was contained in the summary of his CSRT. They were <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alif_Mohammed_2512.html" title="Alif Mohammed">Alif Mohammed</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baridad.html" title="Baridad">Baridad</a>.</p>
<p>Bagi asked all three witnesses whether he owned a weapon and whether he was a member of the Taliban. All of the witnesses testified that he didn't own a weapon, was just a simple farmer, and had no contact with the Taliban.</p>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings.

<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bagi denied being involved in the attack. He denied being aware of the attack. He denied that he ever admitted any knowledge or involvement in the attack.</li>
<li>Bagi denied being a member of the Taliban. He said he was an orphan, and as the oldest sibling he had the responsibility to raise his younger siblings. This responsibility would not have allowed him to join the Taliban.</li>
<li>Bagi acknowledged hearing weapons fire. Some time after the firing ceased he and his uncle mounted his uncle's tractor and headed to the bazaar to buy oil and oil filters.</li>
<li>Bagi acknowledged that he had heard that Bagi was now working for the Taliban, but he knew nothing about Wahed's men, or Wahed's action. Bagi denied that Wahed was from his village. He was from a nearby neighboring village.</li>
<li>Bagi acknowledged that he owned a green jacket. He said that it was a common color of jacket in his area. The jackets were commonly available in local shops.</li>
<li>Bagi said he was captured in front of his house. He had just emerged from his house. He was not riding a motorcycle, or a passenger in a taxi. Bagi pointed out that his house was on the main road, and thousands of vehicles went by every day. Bagi expressed skepticism that the ambushers would have made the mistake of using the main road, which was sure to have roadblocks on it, to escape from the scene.</li>
<li>Bagi acknowledge calling his uncle, Baridad and Alif Mohammed to testify on his behalf.</li>
<li>Bagi challenged the idea that Alif Mohammed was a military commander. He said Alif Mohammed could not support his own family, and had to beg for food. He said Alif Mohammed was a drug addict. His drug addiction had brought the wrath of the Taliban down on him, and they had beaten him so badly they came close to killing him.</li>
<li>Bagi disputed the allegation that his neighbor Baridad suffered hearing loss from weapons fire. Baridad had been hard of hearing since childhood.</li>
