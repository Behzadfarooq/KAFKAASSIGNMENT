<p>Is this not another name for Fazlullah Astrabadi&#160;? <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPaki.tv_61c5.html" title="User:Paki.tv">Paki.tv</a> 23:34, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Not at all as far as I am aware. His actuall name is Naimi and Fazlullah was his pseudonym after he performed Hajj. He is the creator of Hurufism, yet he is certainly never called himself that... <a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdulnr_9dac.html" title="User:Abdulnr">Abdulnr</a> 02:05, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK thanks, I'll check it out. I agree with the name Naimi Fazlullah (and the problem of whether to transcribe Fadl , Fazul or Fazl as well as ullah or allah arrises - as well as for Ali al-Ala , Ali Ul Ala or Ali El Ala or even my preffered transliteration ALi Al Allah - different writers have used different spellings at diferent times) - but I do think both Astrabadi and Hurufi are qualifications to the assumed name Fazlullah (whichever <a href="../../../l/e/t/Lettrism.html" title="Lettrism">letters</a> are used). In the meantime, maybe we should shift the information on him to his own page - maybe just <a href="../../../n/a/i/Naimi.html" title="Naimi">Naimi</a> for now? <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPaki.tv_61c5.html" title="User:Paki.tv">Paki.tv</a> 10:13, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have set up a page <a href="../../../f/a/z/Fazlallah_Astarabadi_ff33.html" title="Fazlallah Astarabadi">Fazlallah Astarabadi</a> as this is the spelling used by Shahzad Bashir in his book as part of the series <i>Makers of the Muslim World</i> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> which is the most comprehensive biography in English.

<p>I've been slowly going through and editing mostly for grammar and clarity and the article is looking good with the images and the consistent flow. Great work and finally this article will, hopefully, become more presentable for readers and not be deemed as 'controversial' since we've covered as many different points as humanly possible! <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 22:54, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Abdulnr,</p>
<p>I noticed that you like to <b>bold</b> a lot of things, for example on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Azerbaijan_7da2.html" title="History of Azerbaijan">History of Azerbaijan</a>. In all Wikipedia articles, only the title should be bolded, such as in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_b4a8.html" title="History of South Africa">History of South Africa</a>. Perhaps you mean to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikify.html" title="Wikify">wikify</a> something instead of bolding? --<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> 18:23, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Abdulnr. I’m glad to greet my compatriot here. I noticed that you’ve made a great contribution to the articles about the history of Azerbaijan, and I would like to thank you for that. Could you please have a look at <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arran_%28Azerbaijan%29_d4c9.html" title="Arran (Azerbaijan)">Arran (Azerbaijan)</a>. Some anonymous editors introduced dubious facts to the history section, I’m not that good in ancient history, maybe you could expand and correct the historical part of the article?

<dd>Hi again and Happy Novruz to you too. I agree that this article is not worth the attention some people attach to it and it is politically motivated. However, the latest edits were done by an anonymous Armenian editor, some of those guys tend to lay claims on all the territories of the region. Thanks for your intervention, the article makes more sense now, but we should keep it under control anyway. Of course, the history of the region should be described in the article about history of Azerbaijan. Also, could you please have a look at <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safavids.html" title="Safavids">Safavids</a>, some Persian guys try to deny Turkic origins of the dynasty, it’s been a very long debate that's been going on for many month, but maybe you can contribute to it as well. And if you have time, please also have a look at <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaddadid.html" title="Shaddadid">Shaddadid</a>, I’m not sure about the accuracy of information contained there.

<p>Hi, I suggest moving the article <i>Momine Khatun</i> to <i>Momine Khatun Mausoleum</i>, since the article is not about the personality, but about the mausoleum.

<dd>Unfortunately right now I don’t have much time, because I’m involved in editing a couple of Azerbaijan related articles. But as soon as I finish with them, I’ll try to do something in that area.

Right now I’m very busy with <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khojaly_massacre.html" title="Khojaly massacre">Khojaly massacre</a> and a couple of other controversial articles, but as soon as I have some time I’ll write new articles about people from Azerbaijan.

<p>Hello. Since you are Azeri, I thought I'd let you know about a situation on the Iranian peoples page. There's a vote going on there that concerns the inclusion of the Azeri people as an Iranian people (despite not being speakers of an Iranian language). I think that it would help to get the opinions of Azeris who should participate as the voting will turn the page into a Persian platform for how to define Iranian peoples which would be a shame.

<dd>I'll try to do something, but it's up in the air at this point. If you read the article we already have a section on cultural assimilation and discuss the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turko-Iranian_8ff5.html" title="Turko-Iranian">Turko-Iranian</a> situation, which is common in academia to refer to both Turkic and Iranic peoples as one group in some situations, and talk about the Azeris. They don't really fit in the article otherwise, except from a Persian context, but the article is not about the just the Persians as it is about the Iranic peoples as whole (similar to the Turkic peoples). If you have other Azeris willing to put in their opinions that might help and please feel free to suggest some alternative solutions as well.

<p>Could you take a look at the first sentence in this section? It claims that Persians are descendants of some "Aryan tribes" migrating from Central Asia. Sounds like outdated racial theories to me. The same source (Britannica) says Persians are of mixed ancentry, but when I try to add this in people remove it. I don't think this is consistent with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Could you take a look at this and leave some feedback on the talk page?

<dd>Yes, this was sent to more than just one person. Could you tell me what you think about it? Iran has a big Azeri population and many of them speak or identify as Persian.

<dd>Of course they did not. But them being "spiritual descendants" of the Khurramiyyah is actually supported by Roger Savory; the idea was first introduced by the Turkish scholar Abdülbaki Göpenarli (see reference). Of course, this sounds really strange. But on the other hand, it also makes sense. The idea of a "continuing spiritual linage" from Mazdakism to Shiism (--&gt; Khurramiyyah/--&gt; Assassins) and then to the Safavids (--&gt; Kizilbash) is not really a new idea. <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tajik</a> 00:12, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Abdul, sorry for the late reply regarding. I think it's a minor point and I'm glad it's been resolved. The Kizilbash do have an eclectic background that is dominated by the Turkomen ultimately, but due to its diversity I think just having a general opening is okay, while the focus of the article ultimately will be on the Turkic element that was the largest etc. As for the histories of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, yes there is not much controversy there, but that may be due to a lack of people from there who are aware of wikipedia as well whereas the folks representing other regions such as the Caucasus and Iran etc. are numerous. I do believe those article could use some help at some point as well. As for the Kizilbash, the article looks good so far. I'll see what I can add to help out as I think so far you guys have done a good job.

<dd>Hmm, yes that does sound like a problem regarding the Iraqi Turkmen and Turkmen of Turkmenistan. Interestingly enough I often read the term Turkoman for the Iraqi group and Turkmen for the people of the country. Regardless they need to be separate as they are distinct. I wrote to <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> regarding picture collage editing. We both compiled pictures and he used his photo editor to put them together. If you have suggestions, let him know and he'll get to it when he has the time. I'll try to work on the articles (Turkmen and History of Turkmenistan) this weekend in-between doing other work! Yeah too bad there aren't any Turkmen to help out along with Uzbeks, etc. Oh well, we'll do the best we can.

<p>Greetings. Well, I agree with your theory as the genetic testing seems to link the Turkmen more to an Iranic background rather than a Mongol one and since the Turkmen are closest to the other Turkic tribes, I agree. As for the Azeris, I think the northerners seem to still cluster closer with the Armenians, Lezgi, etc. while their Iranic ties are somewhat less pronounced, but this might be different for Azeris in Iran (although it might vary there as some may be identical to Azeris in the Caucasus). We'll need to avoid original theories though, but I think as long as it's sourced we can make the claim that the Turkmen were less 'Mongol' than say the Kazakhs (who show some traces of Iranian ancestry too such as the Scythians and Amazons etc.) and Uzbeks. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 20:00, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
