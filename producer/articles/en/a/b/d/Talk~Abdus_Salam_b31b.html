<p>This article is really poor. It is so sparce on description of his work in Physics.

</ul>
<p>When Abdus Salam won the Nobel Prize in 1979 he called on Gen Ziaul Haq and offered to donate all his prize money to the establishment of a science centre in Pakistan if the government would agree to provide the rest.</p>
<p>Zia?s response was effusive but, as it later turned out, flippant. After an agonising delay the reply that Salam received from the government was that it would subscribe no more than what Salam did. Flabbergasted, he wrote to Gen Zia. It was incredible that a government of 150 million could spare no more than a scientist could. No reply ever came from Zia. Obviously, the government?s offer had his approval. Salam quietly donated his hundred thousand dollars to his school in Jhang where at the age of 12 he had streaked across India for setting an all-time record not in mathematics alone but in English as well.</p>
<p>The tale doesn't end here. Years later, Salam thought of taking up his idea of the science centre with a better-educated Benazir Bhutto. He was here and asked to see her. He was told that the prime minister was busy but he should call the next day. His Government College buddy Dr Aftab Ahmad told me some years later that tears floated in the eyes of Salam when he told him that&#160;?the prime minister has no time to see me even today and nobody is prepared to say when she will see me if at all?. He was packing his bags to leave.</p>
<p>Of course, Salam never thought it prudent to raise the subject with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. He knew that when Nawaz Sharif went to their common alma mater he recalled every distinguished alumnus including his Gwalmandi chef but not Salam. For Nawaz Sharif, Salam just did not exist. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcAurel_f347.html" title="User:MarcAurel">MarcAurel</a> 14:43, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's besides the point. Point is what Abdus Slam believes himself to be and this article is about Abdus Salam and not if his faith was agreeable with anyone else. There are other articles on this elsewhere with all the necessary discussion. As a separate points it amazes me that Dr Abdus Salam who remained Pakistani all his life (despite disadvantages) and brought tremendous honours to the country, these bigots will not even allow him to say what he believes himself to be. No wonder Sunnis are the most backward nation in the world. <a href="../../../y/a/h/User%7EYahya01_fcc5.html" title="User:Yahya01">Yahya</a> 17:27, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for engligthening us with your great observations. Do you know that the bigots in Saudia Arabia and elsewhere consider Shias to be non-Muslims and have laws against them???</p>
<dl>
<dd>in reply: Um, yeah. We knew that. Also, there's a long tradition among Protestant Christians of considering the Pope the Antichrist (I think that makes him insufficiently Christian, though you'd have to ask them). Also also orthodox Jews in Israel often don't consider Reform Jews Jewish. My bet is a similar attitude comes with Theraveda and Mayahana Buddhism, but you'd have to ask a Buddhist. From me: Christians are Christians, Muslims Muslim, Jews Jews, Buddhists Buddhist. Point #1: it's your relationship with the divine that matters, not someone else's opinion thereof. Point #2: Those who don't care about conceptual niceties often define us. If guy read the Qu'ran and prayed to Allah (blessed be his name) then he's Muslim in the eyes of the rest of the world. Point #3: Don't call people Sunni monkeys or Shi'a terrorists if they're writing in Wikipedia. Terrorist monkeys don't type. Remember Salam's line about "the common heritage of mankind"? Remember it.</dd>

<p>Abdus Salam believed in One God and Muhammad (SAW) as His last prophet...end of story. If you look at articles about Jewish scientists, they are identified as such; the Jewish people are proud of thier scientists (as well they should be)...maybe Muslims should be as well!!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmadi.html" title="Ahmadi">Ahmadis</a> believe that <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirza_Ghulam_Ahmad_09f0.html" title="Mirza Ghulam Ahmad">Mirza Ghulam Ahmad</a> was the last prophet. I don't mean to defame anyone, but Ahmadis' beliefs contradict mainstream Islam (both Sunni and Shia). It is unfortunate that there are so few well-known contemporary Muslim scientists. 65.43.146.158 21:46, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Mainstream muslims believe that Jesus will be the last prophet after Holy Prophet (saw). There is no contradiction in beliefs as far as finality of prophethood is concerned. The crime of Ahmadis is that they believe that Jesus was the metaphorical description of Mahdi who was Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian. Thus the difference is ironic. Ahmadis believe in the Mahdi while the rest are eagerly waiting for his appearance to believe in him Khokhar976 16:36, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why does a Qadiani refer to "mainstream muslims" when in fact, your prophet Mirza declared all people who don't accept him as a prophet to be outside the fold of Islam? Muslims believe that Muhammad (pbuh) was the Last in the Line of Prophets to be appointed by God. As Jesus was appointed before Muhammad, there is no issue. There is no irony in the fact that prominent scholars who are very inclusive, excluded Qadianis from Islam beceause they appear in the guise of Muslims, whilst believing in their own prophet and establishing their own religion, which declares all Muslims to be outside the fold of Islam. Your "Mahdi" by the way claimed that all the Mahdi ahadith were dubious - and he also believed that the real Jesus might well come after him anyway.</p>
<p>Finally, it would behove you to discuss Professor Salam, a great scientist regardless of religion rather than spread your hateful and duplicitous propaganda here.</p>

<p>I think the article is the poorer for listing the many degrees and awards, which all major scientists accumulate but which are not listed in biographies. It is considered in poor taste.68.155.76.103 01:36, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
