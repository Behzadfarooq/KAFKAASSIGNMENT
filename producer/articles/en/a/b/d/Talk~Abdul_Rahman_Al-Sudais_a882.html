<p>The answer here is not to keep the article in a stub to suppress information you do not like. It is the responsibility of wiki editors to find other things about this man. And if all there is that is reliably sourced is negative, so be it.</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Editors should be on the lookout for biased or malicious content in biographies or biographical information. If someone appears to be pushing an agenda or a biased point of view, insist on reliable third-party published sources and a clear demonstration of relevance to the person's notability.<br />

<p>The above is upheld in the article; there are reliable third-party sources. Further, this is the view of mainstrea,m Western media, or the majority opinion, not the minority opinion. Your responsibility is to bring OTHER sources that debate/argue the point, not to hide information. Please re-real <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> carefully.

<dd>Allow me to support Avi - you should, Bless sins, concentrate on adding sourced info and not on deleting it. BLP is about unsourced libel, not about well-researched citations. If all articles were to be balanced in your sense, Bless sins, then the article about Hitler would be empty... - I agree with you, Bless sins, that the Sudais article can be better - but this can be achieved only by broadening its scope and not by narrowing it. Greetings and happy editing to both of you, --<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 08:15, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly, according to mainstream media, Hitler is dead. Secondly, BLP says "<i>The views of critics should be represented if their views are relevant to the subject's notability and are based on reliable sources, and so long as the material is written in a manner that does not overwhelm the article or appear to side with the critics' material</i>". Clearly BLP is against overwhelming the article with critics' material. But perhaps you, Ioannes Pragensis, can take a look at the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Talk%7EMartin_Gilbert_c734.html" title="Talk:Martin Gilbert">Talk:Martin Gilbert</a> and take a look at the controversy there.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 16:56, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Last I checked, this article is about <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Rahman_Al-Sudais_681e.html" title="Abdul Rahman Al-Sudais">Abdul Rahman Al-Sudais</a>, not <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Gilbert_6337.html" title="Martin Gilbert">Martin Gilbert</a>. Everything is sourced, so there is no violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. There is no reson to boedlerize the article, because editors are either undesirous or incapable of finding positive or neutral things to say about this man. Your job is to BUILD the article, not delete things that make you uncomfortable. His antisemitism is well-documented and well-displayed. If that makes you uncomfortable, I'm sorry, but it is verified and well-cited, and central to his notability. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 19:54, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again please answer the issue: you are not to overwhlem the article with criticism of Sudais. That is precisely what you are doing.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 19:57, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Firstly, I have asked for comment here <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cff4.html#Criticism_and_overwhelming_clause" title="Wikipedia talk:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia talk:Biographies of living persons#Criticism and overwhelming clause</a>. I hope you join in and we get some form of consensus. Secondly, even were you to be correct, that in no way shape or form justifies removal of the categories. His antisemitism is well documented in his own words, regardless of how much of it will be displayed in the article. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 20:05, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bless sins, I do not think that the criticism overwhelms the article. The controversies about Sudais' antisemitic speeches are just what makes him notable here in the Western world. If you wish to make the article better, please start with adding the reference for his Ramadan prayer and do not delete sourced material.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 21:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have joined the commenting you directed me to. However, I will not settle this issue until a proper interpretation for "as the material is written in a manner that does not overwhelm the article" is provided.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile I have some more objections:</p>
<ol>
<li>BLP says "<i>[criticism] does not...appear to side with the critics' material</i>. BY putting Sudais in the category of antisemitism, we are doing exactly that.</li>
<li>Who is making the allegation of antisemitism "vilifying" anyways?</li>
<li>If we are going to quote Sudais' sermon, we'll have to quote all of it for context. On the other hand we can choose not to quote any of it.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 22:39, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>That is because <b>you</b> are interpreting Category:Anti-Semitic people to be pejorative. I am sure Al-Sudais himself wears it as a badge of pride. Secondly, It is his own words which place him there, not your or my criticism. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 23:00, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree, and moreover the parts of article which you delete do not contain only criticism, they mention more peaceful citations of Sudais and reactions of Moslems. - We cannot of course quote whole sermons (from both space and copyright reasons) but we provide all links and citations, so everybody is able to find the whole text easily and read it. - You used Gilbert as an example, let me allow to use <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalid_Sheikh_Mohammed_74f4.html" title="Khalid Sheikh Mohammed">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> who was on the Main page today. Most of the article about the living person contains criticism - at least from my point of view, because I think that killing innocent people is very bad and condemnable. And still the admins who edit the Main page used this article. Therefore it seems to me that your understanding of BLP is not correct and you should perhaps re-think it in light of this example.

<p>This sermon is an example of his beliefs. Another similar sermon with a reliable source may be used as well. The sermon itself need not be notable, it does not have its own article, Sudais is notable. The extent of his antisemitism is part of what makes him notable for the purposes of English Wikipedia.

<p>Why is this so-called "scholar" portrayed as a becon and a role-model for all Muslims? He is loved only by <a href="../../../w/a/h/Wahhabi.html" title="Wahhabi">Wahhabis</a> and some <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salafi.html" title="Salafi">Salafis</a>, meaning that the vast majority of Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims don't like this man. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmyrifle9_e75f.html" title="User:Armyrifle9">Armyrifle</a> 13:17, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you have reliable sources documenting this man's mariginalism in Islamic society, by all means add it. If you have reliable sources documenting this man's importance in Isalmic society, by all means add it too. But please do not remove informatin because the current existing facts lead to uncomfortability. I agree, this article needs sxpansion; I'm sure there are many more things that can be added such as history, birth, family, etc. That is why it is rated start and not B; we need more; help us out.

<dd>Interestingly enough, at the top of this talk page, an anon said about al-Sudais: "<i>He is one of the most widely respected scholars in the Muslim world.</i>" <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 18:57, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I do not think that the title "Antisemitism and racism" is well chosen. I do not see why Sudais should be described as a racist. He does not slander races, but religions and nations - e.g. not white persons but Christians, not Semites but Jews. It is indeed possible that there is a bit of racism in it, but not clearly visible, at least as far as I know - <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 08:11, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point. The previous title included vilification (which I felt was a more provocative term) of other people besides Jews, so I thought there should be another term besides "antisemitism", but you are likely correct that "racism" is the wrong term. Do you have an alternative, perhaps? -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 12:21, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I think the best title is "sermons vilifing non-Muslims" or "antisemitic sermons." It should be made clear that this guy is an antisemite and a racist.--<a href="../../../s/e/f/User%7ESefringle_0106.html" title="User:Sefringle">Sefringle</a> 21:58, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is blatant antisemitism and anti-hinduism in the sermons, but where is there racism <i>per se</i>. His demarcation seems to be religious and not racial. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 00:03, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">user:Bless sins</a> seems to be perturbed about the length of the quotes sections, yet removing the quotes <i>in toto</i> is inappropriate for verification purposes, I have restored the pertinent quotes into the footnotes of the citations. The article text is now, hopefully, smooth prose and paraphrase, with pertinent quotations down below. This way, the text is not overlong and choppy, yet the information is immediately available. I also fixed a few improper links and updated citation templates. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 15:54, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
