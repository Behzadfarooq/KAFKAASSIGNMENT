<dd>Angie: In some instances, yes (e.g. the Villas Boas brothers case), but mostly by medical extraction. Some abductees have claimed that they have been told that their eggs/sperm were being utilised to create a slave race on the host planet; others have claimed that they were told that the purpose was to create an enhanced human race to replace us, as we have clearly failed to take proper care of this planet. In at least one case, the abductee claimed he was quickly rejected after being told he was too old to be of any use for breeding. <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayoPaul5_b1e4.html" title="User:MayoPaul5">MayoPaul5</a> 23:00, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One view in ufology is that the main purpose of the abduction phenomenon is to create hybrids between humans and the alien type Greys. These hybrids are created through sexual reproduction procedures. During an abduction Greys usually collect eggs from women and sperm from men. They then create hybrids that are half Grey, half human. They may further create hybrids that are one quarter Grey, three quarters human or continue the process so that the hybrid is hardly indistinguishable from humans. Under hypnosis there have been abductees that have recalled having sex with hybrids, but not aliens. Barney Hill 00:55, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Emergency room physician Dr. John G. Miller asks "How can a person have any firmly held belief about this when it's so mysterious? The opinions of the true believers are hard to swallow; and the opinions of the die-hard skeptics are not based on reality either. There is some middle ground ... It's clear that this is some sort of powerful subjective experience. But I do not know what the objective reality is. It's as if the evidence leads us in both directions."</p>
<p>Emergency room Physician? Why does his opinion on this matter? He says nothing that his stated field(Physician) would give him any insight into, and the article does not elaborate on why he is any sort of authority in this matter. Why not quote Emergency Sewer Cleaner John Smith:"All Alien Abduction people are nut-jobs."? Pretty much the same thing as far as I'm concerned, except for the fact that John Smith is right and John G. Miller ain't.</p>

<p>Resited the following comment to here, as it is not well-phrased. It may be true, but is pure unsourced opinion and therefore more of a discussion point:<br />
CORRECTION: 1. The contact/abduction phenomenon goes back to Zarathustra (Iran) who was confronted by entities which are extraterrestrials and they fly what we call UFOs. It even goes back farther then Zarathustra. 2. It is sad to see all these educated comments that they have no right to make or claim because they are using others good or bad experience with what were known as GODS in ancient times for their monetary gain. A visit is good for the good and bad for the bad and all of you are missing out on why we are here. 3. You should all stop referring our great ancestors as ALIENS. 4. CUFOS has no clue to what is going on our planet and to get an award for sharing others experiences is disrespectful.</p>

<p>I added the statement "The vast majority of reports from around the world come from sober, responsible people" to the intro because I have read in several different books that this is so, but cannot remember which specific books. <b>Can anyone help with this source?</b> One thing I read is that the majority of ufo-sighting reports are filed by aircrew, military personnel and policemen - trained observers all, with much to lose in sticking their necks out. Some government ministers including one French minister and at least one US president are amongst those who risked their reputation to file reports of their personal experiences. <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayoPaul5_b1e4.html" title="User:MayoPaul5">MayoPaul5</a> 19:43, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think one problem here is that you have added a statement about reports of UFO sightings, to a paragraph discussing abductions, but you just say "reports".

<p>I would like to see all of Wikipedians over time do their best to put up all of the photos of the unclear and the grey and grainy UFO's that are quickly proven and discovered to be lauaghble hoaxes. Against all of the other possible photos tha were taken over the past 70 or more years that have been critically analyzed by experts and the truth and the information concerning those photos has not been confidentlly reconciled nor been boiled down. I remain skeptical about little green men and flying saucers. I think everything here on earth that flies in the air has been made by mortal men. But I figure that in a observable universe of trillons upon trillons of stars. Not every one of those cases can be isolated down to human deception and bull shit.

<p>I'm not really into this stuff but it occurred to me one day while reading an article on <a href="../../../a/n/e/Anesthesia_awareness.html" title="Anesthesia awareness">Anesthesia awareness</a> that alien abduction scenario's may very well be "inspired" by repressed memories of a surgical operation. A few striking similarities:</p>
<ul>
<li>complete paralysis while being fully conscious</li>
<li>the operation table as the "metal table" of the aliens</li>
<li>awareness of a presence of beings (surgeons)</li>
<li>green and otherwise masked people performing "experiments"</li>
<li>excruciating pain associated with the operation in question</li>
</ul>
<p>The impact of anesthesia awareness is obviously related to the degree of consciousness during the operation. There have been numerous reports of people being fully aware but paralyzed during heart or eye surgery. While traumatizing, these people know what has happened to them. But I reckon there are also a number of cases in which anesthesia was only partially obtained. The "victims" might not have been fully aware but left with traumatizing impressions nonetheless. It is possible that at some point or another in their life, these memories resurface and are miscontrued as an alien abduction. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteerpike_44bb.html" title="User:Steerpike">Steerpike</a> 11:30, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I consider myself an abductee in a sense, but i don't believe this phenomenom has an extra-terestial origin. I had this experience at the age of 8 or 9. Woke up in the middle of the night, feeling a presence in my bedroom. First thought it was my mum checking up on me, if was realy was a sleep and such. The room seemed exceptionally light, and the figure in my room was blurry, long and slim and hard to distinguish, i was sure there was someone/thing there and that is was moving towards my bed slowly. I tried to talk in a "mum?" fashion, but there was no sound coming out of my mouth. Tried to move, then i tried to scream, but nothing happend. The harder i tried, the more i paniced. I realy freaked out that night and slept bad for months. By lack of another explanation at that age i wrote it off as a realy bad nightmare, and after a while the memory faded and eventually completely forgot the incident. You grow up, watch discovery, read science magazines and learn of things like sleep-paralysis and 'electromagnetics fields can trigger out-of-body-, and pressence-in-the-room-experiences' (the experiment with the yellow helmet with spools in it) and such. I remembered my 'abduction' one day, and connected the old digital (always humming) alarm clock standing next to my bed with the results from the experiments mentioned above, enough explanation for me. Only later i realized that my experience matches 90% of the details of most 'abduction' stories i've read, heared and seen on tv. The bright ligt, the vage elongated figure in the room closing in and the absolute terror i found myself to be in.</p>
<p>I've never been abused or such, basically had no traumatic experiences in my life ever (my grandma passing away being the most heavy) and mentally i'm solid as a rock. I really think living/sleeping near electromagnatical sources (digital alarm clock, outlet in the wall, powergrid-lines close to the house, etc) would be a possible (viable) explanation. This is hardly ever mentioned with respect to this phenomenom; it seems explanations always have to have something to do with previous traumatic experiences, mental unstability, etc. Is there any research in this field anyone knows of? I mean, plotting all 'abductions' and comparing them to the powergrid map or something shouldn't be too hard. (disclaimer: no, i didn't do any extensive research, just occasionally read some stuff i happen to 'surf in to', so if there is lots on this, my bad) d_code 05:09, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1. Detailed description/drawings from abductees in non-Western countries, preferrable with no/little western media infludence. This should provide a more lucid description of the type of abduction. Perhaps they have simliar experiences, but not by aliens--instead, something feared and unknown by their culture. Drawings would be important.</p>
<p>2. Subject people to hypnosis and "suggest" they were abducted by monsters, or something else than aliens, to see if a desired response can be elicited.</p>
<p>3. Someone mentioned above that perhaps its linked to anesthesia/surgical operations.</p>
<p>4. More research into sleep paralysis as a related phenomina; although similar in some ascpets very different in others.</p>
<p>5. Further studies into possible repressed memories of negative sexual experiences.</p>

<p><i>In the 1990's the very popular</i> <a href="../../../x/_/f/X_Files_a322.html" title="X Files">X Files</a> <i>television program featured alien abduction as a central theme.</i></p>
<p>It was just put up in the later developments section, and seemed out of place there.</p>

<p>A few years back a TV station aired a show that was supposed to be an actual video taping on an alien abduction. This family was video taping their Thanksgiving preparations when a UFO landed in their back yard. The aliens came after them and the family fought back, shooting an alien with a shotgun in the process. During their struggle it was revealed that they were previously visited by these aliens because there were electronic devices placed at the bottoms of the backs of their necks. Ultimately the aliens prevailed and the family was never heard from again; the last footage showing one of the aliens turning off the video camera.</p>
<p>Does anyone else remember this program? If so, what was the name of the family and the program? I would love to know if the were ever found in another state or country.</p>

<dd>Doesn't anyone here sign their comments? Anyway, as the Duke of Wellington said to the man who called him "Mr. Smith", if you'll believe that, you'll believe anything. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStedder_0794.html" title="User:Stedder">Tex</a> 19:30, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
