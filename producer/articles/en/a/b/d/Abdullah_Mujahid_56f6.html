<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>The Tribunal's President decided to allow three of the other Guantanamo detainees as witnesses. However, he informed Mujahid that they would not be allowed to testify, in person, for "Force Protection reasons". He then informed Mujahid that American officials had not been able to secure the cooperation of the Afghan government in locating the witnesses back in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The <i><a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Globe_1f5c.html" title="Boston Globe">Boston Globe</a></i> reported that they found that many witnesses that detainees had requested, who US officials claimed were not reasonably available, were easily located.<sup id="_ref-BostonGlobe060618_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BostonGlobe060618" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-TheJurist060618_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TheJurist060618" title="">[5]</a></sup> The article particularly the ease with which they located Mujahid's witnesses.
