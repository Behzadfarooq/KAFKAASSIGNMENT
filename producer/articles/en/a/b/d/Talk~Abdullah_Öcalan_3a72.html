<p>This article is absolutely against PKK. You must be neutral in Wikipedia. This Text is 100% pro Turkish military. I will give a appeal to Wikipedia foundation.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fascism means Italian Nationalism that was created my Mussolini and has no connection with the Republic of Turkey. First of all, the article says that Ocalan is a "leader" and it is the best you can get from this neutral encyclopedia because USA and EU named Ocalan as a terrorist. I don't know who you are but because of you and people think like you, PKK is still active, actually the only active terrorist group in the entire Europe, and still kills Military Officers of Turkey! <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeliogul_430e.html" title="User:Deliogul">Deliogul</a> 22:43, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fascism does not mean Italian nationalism, though that was certainly its first form. I am not saying that the Turkish government is fascist, but you are wrong about that. According to this very encyclopedia, Fascism is a political ideology and mass movement that seeks to place the nation, defined in exclusive biological, cultural, and/or historical terms, above all other sources of loyalty, and to create a mobilized national community. Just FYI. 72.255.68.35 12:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>OPPOSE</b> First, sign your comments...otherwise your request is useless and will be ignored.

<li><b>Oppose</b>. Also, I'm not sure this request even belongs here. This project is for moving pages, not deleting them. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 19:12, 2005 Feb 25 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - Sometimes one just wants the biography. If they want the PKK story it can be reached from here, and vice-versa. Öcalan is important in his own right. <a href="../../../d/a/j/User%7EDajudem_fe18.html" title="User:Dajudem">Juanita</a> 03:20, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - Not because they're "notable" at all. PKK continues to kill people while Ocalan is in jail. Each article should portrey the truth about them separately. --<a href="../../../g/o/k/User%7EGokhan_2b6b.html" title="User:Gokhan">Gokhan</a> 12:28, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - Gokhan, worthy of note or notice; remarkable is what we mean when we say notable.

<p>Can anyone explain to me why we have the last two external links on this article? The websites are of course completley POV, but we link to such sites on some articles. But the presentation of them at the moment looks very POV to me as well. There was no explanation at all, just a warning that the links have some disturbing images. Now it reads "These images are a result of what <a href="../../../p/k/k/PKK_1685.html" title="PKK">PKK</a> did.", which also sounds pretty POV and indicates that the links rather belong to <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan_Workers_Party_7454.html" title="Kurdistan Workers Party">Kurdistan Workers Party</a> than to this article. I got reverted with the simple comment "good page.", which is IMHO not a very sufficient explanation, so I'd like to get a more detailed one here. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 13:39, Apr 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>To have a headline that read "Websites establishing Abdullah Öcalan as a terrorist" above the links to websites that is opposing Öcalan, PKK and the rights of the Kurds, is of course not neutral. To make it fair to both sides I would have to change the "Websites supporting Abdullah Öcalan" into something like: "Websites establishing Abdullah Öcalan as a freedom fighter". Supporting/opposing <b>should</b> be enough though. Also, why did you move the picture? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStereotek_fc8d.html" title="User:Stereotek">Stereotek</a> 17:58, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you read the context that picture belongs where it is, it was his capture, and the text talks about it. Opposing is not sufficient. There isnt an "opposition". When a country declares someone/some organisation as terrorist, they are at a state of war with them. US does not allow any activity of this organisation, in EU their activities are at best highly limmited. The websites do establish him as a terroist, Its the content of the website. What kind of a POV are you talking about? Your change is acceptable, I prefer you dont revert but instead improvise/rewrite.

<dd>Err? Thats POV. The claim of Kurds being opressed is POV. Kurds being not opressed is still POV. No need to mention POV, "right to live accoring to their own identity" what were they not allowed?

<p>That the Kurds and their identity/culture was/are being oppressed by the Turkish state, is a fact and not a matter POV. Maybe they didn't arrest them just for speaking kurdish, but what if they wanted to start a Kurdish language TV Channel? A news paper? And what about something as simple as Kurdish names. Where the Kurds free to give their children Kurdish names? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStereotek_fc8d.html" title="User:Stereotek">Stereotek</a> 15:52, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh now you determine facts. No sir that is POV, HEAVY POV. Kurds had TV stations. Most notably, Med TV, was shut after its clear affiliation with PKK, organisation serviced from Europe and some Kurds had it via satelite. After that they created two other stations, thats all Kurdish TV was. This came about after PKK. Same deal with newspapers. They had shows on such stations in Kurdish (what dialect I dont know)/Turkish/ and English. Kurdish names are NOT banned. Kurdish names are not banned either, foreign words like John, George, Newton, Albert, are not allowed, same in the U.S., when Turkish constitution was drafted Kurds were not a sizable minority. The famous "Kurdish" rebellions were based on religion not ethnicity. If Kurds brought the mater to the parliment before grabing arms I dont think this would be a big issue. Also Kurdish seperatists use "Kurdish" as a Nationality, you can have one nationality (unless dual), so this caused major problems. This is explained in the article I gave you on <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_people.html" title="Kurdish people">Kurdish people</a>. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcat_e5e1.html" title="User:Coolcat">Cool Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECoolcat_c966.html" title="User talk:Coolcat"><sup>My Talk</sup></a> 08:26, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>- Kassem 12:37, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I noticed that there have been several edits on this page yesterday (September 1st 2005) from the same IP address pointing to one specific web site. As the site in question is in Turkish then I am unable to verify its claims, however, the phrase:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Abdullah Ocalan suffers from paranoid schizophrenia most probably, a mental disease which Hitler posseses. The ilnesss is characterised by a charismatric leader which leads millions of people for nothing. A summary can be read at <a href="http://www.pkkgercegi.net/" class="external free" title="http://www.pkkgercegi.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pkkgercegi.net/</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Appears to be somewhat POV (introducing Hitler to illustrate a point is often a bad thing). Also, I can find no other references to Abdullah Öcalan having Paranoid Schizophrenia anywhere else on the net, so I have removed the above paragraph. The description of the website "A site in Turkish which aims to tell the world PKK terror that took the life of 30.000 people" also sounds a little POV, so I have changed that too. Oh, and as it appears to be anti-PKK, then it should live in the "Websites with criticism of Abdullah Öcalan" section rather the the "Media" section. Just thought I should explain my changes to avoid annoying anyone as I am a relative newcomer to wiki, and am lothe to dabble in the political pages for that very reason. - <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxhead_d800.html" title="User:Tuxhead">Tuxhead</a> 09:46, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Again, I don't want to offend anyone, so I am explaining my actions here. I am removing "Abdullah Ocalan himself clamis to be Kurdish but he cannot talk Kurdish himself." because it implies that Abdullah Ocalan canot speak Kurdish at all, where as this article&#160;: <a href="http://www.meforum.org/article/399" class="external free" title="http://www.meforum.org/article/399" rel="nofollow">http://www.meforum.org/article/399</a> from June 1998 states that " In the first meeting, Öcalan spoke in Kurmanji Kurdish, a language I was told he had recently learned to speak much better; the second day, he spoke in Turkish". Which, if it is true, implies that he can speak at least some Kurdish. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxhead_d800.html" title="User:Tuxhead">tuxhead</a> 13:32, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am going to revert the last couple of changes by the anonymous user at: 85.103.61.67 because I think that there is some POV creeping in. I notice that a previous change on this persons introduced the term "baby killer", which (with a little wriggling) could be aimed at any number of politicians, so is probably not helpfull. It would be useful if the user concerned were to clearly and dispassionatly lay out reasons for his changes, which appear to me to be somewhat one-sided, in these discussion pages. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxhead_d800.html" title="User:Tuxhead">tuxhead</a> 10:34, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Have reverted the 30,000 killed comment back from "30,000 Turkish Civilians" to "30,000 people". According to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4543283.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4543283.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4543283.stm</a>, "More than 30,000 people died in that conflict.

<p>I just want to make some comments on a phrase that I read on this page, which refers to the terrorist as a "freedom fighter".Well for those who may not have sufficient information, I think for somebody to have a title like "freedom fighter" he/she or the community that he/she belongs have to be slaves or something like that. But in Turkey the Kurdish people even have their right to be elected and represented in the parliament.About 10 years ago the president of the parliament was kurdish himself.So the question is what are they really after it is not freedom, what they really want is to have a country of their own by taking pieces of land from Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. Well I do not know about the others but it is impossible to take a cm square from Turkey. I understand the fact that the area that they are living in Turkey is not the best in terms of schooling, hospitals etc. but it is not only the kurds that have those problems there are also turkish people having the same problems in other parts of the country.But no one is getting armed and killing people for their so called freedom and having a so called "freedom fighter" like this terrorist.</p>

<p>The article currently reads: "Öcalan... also known as Serok Apo among his supporters and Teröristbaşı among Turkish citizens". "Teröristbaşı" simply means "terrorist leader" in Turkish; it is not a name, but a description. A Google search shows many pages (15,000) using the word, but most use it in phrases like "Teröristbaşı Öcalan", "Teröristbaşı Apo", etc. Following the same logic, we would say "George W. Bush... also known as President among American citizens", which of course would be silly. For all I know, newspaper headlines may refer to Öcalan as "teröristbaşı", but again that doesn't mean that that is an alternate name for him. Finally, I assume that there are at least <i>some</i> Öcalan supporters who are Turkish citizens.... I would be interested to know what Serok Apo means and whether it, too, is a description (e.g. 'Our Leader') or a name (perhaps a nom de guerre?).

<dd>It was me who added Teröristbaşı in there. I thought mentioning only the name that his supporters use is not neutral. So I added Teröristbaşı to counterbalance. Yes, serok means leader, president or something like that in Kurdish. Apo is simply a shorthand for Abdullah. Something like Jeff - Jefferson. And yes Teröristbaşı is only a discription literally, but it is only used for this man (there is no other use of it). Normally you would write "Terörist başı" for correct grammar. Whenever a newspaper mentions Teröristbaşı, everybody can understand that it is talking about Abdullah Öcalan. He is widely known as Teröristbaşı in Turkey. You're right about Turkish citizens supporting Abdullah Öcalan, though they would still understand that Teröristbaşı refers to Abdullah Öcalan. --<a href="../../../i/l/e/User%7E%C4%B0Levent_e240.html" title="User:İLevent">levent</a> 14:33, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From the same letter to Massimo D'Alema that u mentioned and from the source that (probably u) added: <i>As Human Rights Watch has often reported and condemned, Turkish government forces have, in the course of the conflict with the PKK, also committed serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including torture, extrajudicial killings, and indiscriminate fire.</i>. Thus, we come back again to what i said before: both sides have committed atrocities. and if u will mention only the one side (PKK in this case), u can be characterised everything but neutral...And do not forget that PKK is an organisation (terrorist or not), but Turkey claims to be a democratic state, so, atrocities on behalf of Turkey weight much more. --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 22:06, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We don't ask for your imagination, we ask for facts and proof. Each day people in Turkey are dying because of Apo and PKK. Each day we read a new death in newspapers or a new bomb that is found or exploded. Don't joke around with this. PKK killed a lot of innocent Turkish doctors, nurses, teachers and business people. They're doing drug-weapons-human trafficking. They're criminals. They're robbing their own Kurds in Turkey and Europe for food and money. They're accepted as terrorists by western world as well. This is an encyclopedia, not a hatred forum. You seriously couldn't support some terrorists just you don't love Turks or Turkey. If you have a grudge, do it like a man. You cannot just say "they couldn't give their child the name of Keje, so they're right to kill". Come on. Let's be serious. --<a href="../../../g/o/k/User%7EGokhan_2b6b.html" title="User:Gokhan">Gokhan</a> 14:48, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You cannot judge my thought processes, you don't even know me. I hope you'll leave your prejudices behind while talking to me about this issue. I try to see some good faith in you, because you seem like an intellectual person. But I didn't like the idea of you testing the "worth" of people. Well it's your call (who is "us" by the way?). However let me try to explain my view. For example you seem to accept the armenian genocide, which is fine. But in good faith, that shouldn't automatically mean you'll also blindly support anything that will hurt Turkey or Turkish people, such as PKK terrorist organization or its founder Apo for instance, right? Will that make you a better person? Also, my sentimental outburst about PKK shouldn't automatically mean I'm a Turkish ultra-nationalist which will reject all negative points about my country. Believe me, I have knowledge on our country's issues. Anyway that's my actual thought process. And that's why I was sad to see your comments on PKK/Apo. I hope it's clear now.

<dd>By the way Francis, today there is a news article on Turkish newspapers. PKK planted a bomb targeting a bus carrying soldier's children to school in the city of Hakkari. 8 soldiers, 11 children, 2 civilians wounded. It seems PKK is actually targeting the civilians and the children. <a href="http://www.radikal.com.tr/haber.php?haberno=186307" class="external text" title="http://www.radikal.com.tr/haber.php?haberno=186307" rel="nofollow">See news article</a>.

<dd>It's funny when I read Turkish papers because when a bomb is planted who is it going to be? well, who can it be! PKK or amongst ignorants it was Aptullah Ocalan!. Can it not be another organisation, maybe another <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semdinli.html" title="Semdinli">Semdinli</a> bombing? No, the Turks don't bomb Turkey! You see there is two types of media organisations in Turkey one is working for the government which shows you one side of the story and the other types, the illegals, showing the other side of the story; so if you read both you finally get to decide what to believe. Forget the ignorance of the Turkish media. I mean, showing biased news websites as proof to your arguments is unintelligent because someone can post the other side of the <a href="http://dozame.org/blog/2006/04/27/video-from-the-uprising-in-amed/" class="external text" title="http://dozame.org/blog/2006/04/27/video-from-the-uprising-in-amed/" rel="nofollow">story</a>. The Armenian Genocide denial is a psychological proof that nothing is chanced since 1915 in Turkey and that sometimes the fundamentals of a country matter. There is a say amongst the Kurds that says "It was the Greeks then the Armenians and now the Kurds". Also some people have said that some Kurds are happy to be Turks. Those people are missing the fact that Kurds who accept being Turkish are either forced or manipulated. <a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgurgerilla_c1aa.html" title="User:Ozgurgerilla">Ozgur Gerilla</a> 23:28, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ozgur, demanding cultural freedom is different than supporting terrorism. I think you need to grow up and learn that. Supporting violence will only get more violence - which won't help anyone in Southeastern Turkey. EU started to warn Kurds about PKK. U.S will have to stop its positive attitude towards PKK soon. Don't count on any Armenian or Greek support after that. And you'll live in this region even westerners will leave one day. --<a href="../../../g/o/k/User%7EGokhan_2b6b.html" title="User:Gokhan">Gokhan</a> 06:25, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a personal attack. What you are mistaking is the cultural freedom doesn't just come to you. Especially, where in a country there is a passion to make everyone one race, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkification.html" title="Turkification">Turkification</a>. Since the beginning of Ottoman Empire, Kurds had no cultural freedom and any other freedom. So what you call terrorism is probably the only way, to some people, to make their voices heard. If somebody hits you, you hit them back. Just like Turks are doing it to Kurds and just like PKK is doing to Turks. We obviously need to read a lot more <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhi.html" title="Gandhi">Gandhi</a>. Lets not forget the ammount of help southeastern Turkey is or has received. You always put that the EU and US support has stopped towards PKK. EU and US has already got PKK in their terrorist list. Obviously putting down PKK is much important then giving the Kurds their rights and freedom for some people. An interesting thing about Turkey is that the country it self is suffering to make Northern Cyprus Internationally recognised but unfortunately does not understand the Kurds at all! A fact, Turkey always tells its people that it will never talk to the "terrotists" but how comes <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamas.html" title="Hamas">Hamas</a> visited Turkey? doesn't this show something? <a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgurgerilla_c1aa.html" title="User:Ozgurgerilla">Ozgur Gerilla</a> 10:21, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am afraid this discussion page has been turned into somewhat bash Turkey as much kind of a deal. For those of you interested here is a fact:</p>
<p>Wikipedia is somewhat divided over the point of Terrorism. It is understandable given what is going on in the Middle East in the last few years. However one needs to remember to check the list of sovereign states in the United Nations some time. To avoid confusion read this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Words_to_avoid#Terrorist.2C_terrorism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Words_to_avoid#Terrorist.2C_terrorism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Words_to_avoid#Terrorist.2C_terrorism</a></p>
<p>For the rest of the discussion, no body here seems to know what they are talking about well. Bringing up topics such as alleged armenian genocide here is just irrelevant. If you dont have a clue then why dont you STFU?</p>

What kinds of attacks has the PKK undertaken?

Mostly attacks on Turkish security forces. But the PKK has also attacked other Turkish sites at home and abroad, as well as Kurdish
civilians who would not cooperate with the group.  The group called off a six-year unilateral ceasefire in 2004 and tensions have 
been rising steadily in Turkey’s southeast region as the PKK began resuming its attacks on security and civilian targets.

<p>It's not right to say PKK is "by many considered a terrorist organization" it's not specific or a fact.

PKK is recognized as a Terrorist Group in its main article, by EU (Which also means over half of Europe), by USA. If HAMAS, Al-Quada, and Hezbollah are terrorist groups because Israel and USA consider them to be, then how come PKK is not?

<dd>I disagree. It was not a terrorist tag and it doesn't label him as a terrorist. He was only in a category says that he has been imprisoned for terrorism. What I mean is like you can be imprisoned for theft, even though you stole nothing. Though I don't really thing it is that important of an issue. But unless that category is totally abolished, this is where Ocalan should be included.
