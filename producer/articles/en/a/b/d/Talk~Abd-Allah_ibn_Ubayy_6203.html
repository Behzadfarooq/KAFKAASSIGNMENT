<p>Here we have the two versions, good and bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="../../../6/2/4/624.html" title="624">624</a> Muhammad moved against the Jewish tribe of the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qaynuqa_294f.html" title="Banu Qaynuqa">Banu Qaynuqa</a> and eventually forced them to surrender. Now, Abd-Allah was allied to the Qaynuqa and according to Muslim historians, went to Muhammad and asked him to deal kindly with his allies. As Muhammad turned his back on him, Abd-Allah, held him by his cloak. This provoked Muhammad's anger but Abd-Allah replied:</li>

<p>Abd-Allah was allied to the Qaynuqa and, according to Muslim historians, asked Muhammad to be lenient <b>this is from the POV that Muhammad was enacting some just judgement, the old version is in fact NPOV</b></p>
<p>with his allies. As Muhammad turned his back on him, Abd-Allah, held the former <b>what's the problem with pronouns? Muhammad was a real person, it's OK to call him "him"</b></p>

<dd>1. The conflict was initiated by Qaynuqa, afer teh market place incident.</dd>
<dd>2. He did not ask Muhammad to be kind but rather lenient. Kidn woudl be to allow the Qaynuqa to stay, but lenient is to allow them to leave.</dd>
<dd>3. In any case, I'm disputing the factual accuracy of all of this above.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 21:02, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Bless sins, re "lenient," why not be specific and state that he asked Mumammad not to kill them? That would avoid the need to insert your POV into mainspace.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 21:17, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>1. Just your POV, not supported even by Muslim sources.</dd>
<dd>2. He asked not to massacre the Banu Qaynuqa; "kindly" is Abd-Allah's own word. Leave to the readers to decide whether not to massacre a tribe is a sign of kindness, leniency, or just normal human behavior.</dd>
<dd>3. Of what? <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 21:20, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>1. The conflict was initiated by Muhammad's calling on the Jews to convert to Islam. The BQ, trusting in their strength, boasted that even though he had defeated the Quraish at Badr, he wouldn't be able to defeat them. Now, this was a foolish move (as they found out later) BUT the initiative nonetheless rested with Muhammad. ... In nay case, the wording "M moved against" does not so much deal with the overal causes of the conflict but merely that, in this one instance, M. attacked. Other versions make this needlessly complicated.</dd>
<dd>2. As Beit Or said, "kindly" is Abdallah's word. Therefore I have now put it in quotes, as indeed the kindness of that act is debatable.</dd>
<dd>3. As Beit said "Just your POV, not supported even by Muslim sources."</dd>

<dd>i think there is. there seems to be a heavy reliance on Glubb, though we don't seem to know quite what his academic credentials are. there are stark differences in how EoI presents Ibn Ubayy and how both the article and (seemingly) Glubb present him. i intend to do a rewrite on this soon, hopefully drawing from some better sources. the informal tone of addressing Ibn Ubayy is something i also hope to address. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 12:59, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I will restate my question: where does the article state a view as fact or where does it violate the NPOV in any other way? If you don't have a proper reason for disputing neutrality, you shouldn't be tagging the article. If you don't come up with some, I will remove the tag.</dd>
<dd>I don't see any violations. That doesn't meant that there is no room for improvement. My overhaul I thought to be a catalyst for that, as before the article was first a stub and than a real piece of POV pushing.</dd>
<dd>As "informal tone" - what do you mean by that? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 00:14, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>i already stated where i think the problem lies: in the usage of Glubb. as we know, Glubb has no training or qualifications in Islamic history, and so he isn't to be presented as a historian, or used/quoted as extensively as has been done here. i also stated how the representation of Glubb here contrasts with how Ibn Ubayy is portrayed in the EoI. we don't know if Glubb is representing an academic opinion at all, so extensive reliance upon him to tell us about Ibn Ubayy is inappropriate. informal tone, such as referring to Ibn Ubayy as Abd-Allah, whereas he is more appropriately discussed as Ibn Ubayy. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 08:14, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am asking a third time: what pieces of information given in the current text would you consider to be wrong (&gt; factual accuracy disputed) or onesided or where are opinions presented as facts (&gt; neutrality dispute). Merely the sourcing is not enough to tag an article (except with a "sourcing tag") unless you present certain pieces which you dispute. I think you should be able to do so within 24 hours.</dd>
<dd>The topic of this section is this question and not any (valid or invalid) concerns about Glubb as a reference.</dd>
<dd>As for the "informal" tone: we address Abdallah Ibn Ubay primarily as Abdallah because that is his name. The patronymic is a usefull alternative, as there are quite a few Abdallahs around at that time. But his first name is the proper first choice. At the time, people did not yet employ this strange modern invention called family name or even confused the two. If you don't believe me Itaq, go over to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> and change the wording into "Ibn Abdallah". But first, change the article's title to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Abd-Allah_35c8.html" title="Muhammad ibn Abd-Allah">Muhammad ibn Abd-Allah</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>re: informal tone. that's incorrect, we generally address people through their last names (we say Stillman says, Watt says, Bush says; not Norman says, Montgomery says, or George says) , or in the case of the arabs, their patronym, <i>kunya</i> or their locality (we say: Ibn Abbas says, Abi Lahab says, an-Nawawi says). the first time they are mentioned, we mention the full name. referring to one as Muhammad is an exception, as in general discourse (and academic in particular) everyone knows who is referred to when "Muhammad" is mentioned as opposed to another Muhammad of the time such as <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Maslama_5fcb.html" title="Muhammad ibn Maslama">Muhammad ibn Maslama</a>. similarly, anyone else named Muhammad throughout history is addressed otherwise (i.e. ash-Shafi'i, Ibn Abi Bakr, adh-Dhahabi etc.). Ibn Ubayy is addressed as such in the EoI also, and i doubt there are very many presses at all that simply address him as "Abd-Allah" <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 18:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's true in most, but not all cases. For example, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abu_Talib_a9ac.html" title="Ali ibn Abu Talib">Ali ibn Abu Talib</a> is better known as "Ali" than as "Ibn Abu Talib". In any case, this is a minor issue and not really a neutrality dispute. Feel free to change "Abd-Allah" to "Ibn Ubayy"; I will not object. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 19:09, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Itaq, that's (to be blunt) nonsense regarding "pre-modern" people. If AiU were often/commonly addressed as Ibn Ubayy it would be a reason to use it as well. However, I don't see that he is exclusively referred to by that patronymic or something similar (as opposed to Ibn Abbas, or Abu Bakr). Therefore is actual first name is the standard form of addressing him. In his own article, he is the "default Abdallah". <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 20:52, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>i disagree. only where the first names have become popularised, such as with Muhammad, Ali, Saladin, and so on, do we see its usage. for everyone else, usually their kunya, last name, and/or locality is used as i expressed above. his EoI article addresses him as Ibn Ubayy. Rodinson interchanges between "Abdullah ibn Ubayy" and "Ibn Ubayy." i haven't come across any academic work which frequently refers to him as "Abdullah/AbdAllah" only. if anywhere, you'd expect it in an academic biographical article on him, but as i said, EoI's article on him employs Ibn Ubayy. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 13:52, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could you please get a grip on two things: I asked about the neutrality dispute, not about any supposed factual accuracy dispute. You have made no argument about neutrality above, neither have you made one about factual accuracy - you have made on about sourcing. You cannot simply say any statements based on Glubb are inaccurate (you do, but that only reveals the fallacy of your claim) - you would have to clearly point out which statements are not neutral or which are factually inaccurate. And note these are not the same (and I will not repeat this one more time). Otherwise I will assume that the tag as originally placed is insubstantial - I will probably not remove it as Itaq's rewrite (judging from a brief look) has introduced a whole lot of POV problems (real POV problems, that is) himself.

<p>in the light of the poor sourcing and neutrality concerns (such as the exaggerated adulation of Ibn Ubayy, apparently by Glubb), i have rewritten the article using Rodinson and EoI mainly. Mubarakpuri was used a few times to substantiate attribtutions to Islamic tradition. there was a lot of dialogue (mostly attributed to Ibn Ubayy) which i removed, when a source more appropriate than Glubb is found feel free to reinsert it. similarly, some of the narrative attributed to Glubb concerning events not included in this version may be included if you can find a decent source for it. i restored the rendering of the lead which i proposed. i noticed that Str "tweak[ed]" with it (looked quite a lot like a revert to me), but in the EoI article on Ibn Ubayy, Watt says: "When all but a small minority of the Medinans accepted Islam, Ibn Ubayy followed the majority, but he was never a whole-hearted Muslim." Rodinson says the same thing really: "His reason for joining Muhammad was probably that having seen the strength of the wave of the conversions to the Messenger's doctrine, he thought it wiser to join than to stand out against it." so it's not something merely attributable to Islamic tradition alone. thanks. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 00:48, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My tweak was not a plain revert but a combining of information from both versions and a toning down of the POV introduced by the previous edit, which for instance plainly stated as fact that Abdallah was half-hearted. Also, I want to ask Itaq to refrain form general statements like "exaggerated adulation of Ibn Ubayy, apparently by Glubb" - if he hasn't read Glubb in the first place. His book is first and foremost a biography of Muhammad (or must I say Mr. Ibn Abdallah?). What you call adulation is his failure to simply villify the chief of munafiqin.</dd>

<dd>it was indeed excessive adulation, there were several quotes from non-historian Glubb designed to press home the notion of Ibn Ubayy's apparent "peacefulness" and "moderation". such descriptions are not supported by the academic works i have access to, do you have any opining otherwise? furthermore, you inserted original research like the clause ".. in political matters ..". that is not endorsed by the source and absolutely debatable: obedience to Muhammad is a religious matter. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 22:09, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Aminz, this dispute is about Itaq's rewrite, which is per se okay (I always said that an article can always be improved), which however reintroduced a POV-slant, removed certain things (immediate deletion instead of fact tagging) under the pretext of RS (but employed Sealed Nectar at the same time), his unilateral insistence on using a last name (based on terribly faulty reasoning).

<p>I object to this passage, "Shortly after, Aisha was exonerated by the Qur'an, which also rebuked those who had spread the rumors," for two reasons.

<dd>and i bet Norman Stillman is referred to as Norman by everyone he knows. for formal, academic and encyclopedic purposes, we use the last names or their Arabic equivalents. the EoI reflects this, and does Rodinson. so do academic works in general, referring to Arabs by their <i>kunya</i> and not their first name, barring the exceptions where the person's first name has been popularised. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:08, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>as an irrelevant side note, i also doubt that he was referred to as simply 'AbdAllah', there were hundreds of AbdAllah's in his time. it is likely that he would be referred to using a distinguishable kunya of some sort. even Muhammad was frequently referred to by his people as Abu'l-Qasim. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Itaq, are you serious. Stillman is not a 7th century Arab. Browse through WP and you will find hundreds of articles named for their first name, either alone (consider <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a>, <a href="../../../u/t/h/Uthman.html" title="Uthman">Uthman</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a>, Muawija, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Saladin.html" title="Saladin">Saladin</a> etc.) together with a patronymics (<a href="../../../h/u/s/Husayn_ibn_Ali_7823.html" title="Husayn ibn Ali">Husayn ibn Ali</a>) or together with a sur/nickname (<a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_al-Mahdi_6e3a.html" title="Muhammad al-Mahdi">Muhammad al-Mahdi</a>).</dd>
<dd>True, there are many Abdallahs and this one is just one. However, this is his own article. Most encyclopedias would refer to someone in his own article by a single letter, which in this case would be <i>A.</i>. In his own article Abdallah has the right to be referred to by his name unless this name is completely out of use, as e.g. in the cases of Ibn Abbas or Abu Bakr. But you haven't shown that it is in our case. "Abdullah ibn Uthman" or "Abdullah ibn Abi Quhafah" is used only seldomly, whereas our man here is referred to by his normal name and the patronymic, to distinguish him from all the other Abdallahs. Abbreviating this here and there to Ibn Ubayy for brevity's sake - especially when another Abdallah appears - is all right. But not the comprehensive replacement of the name with the patronymic.</dd>
<dd>The "informal" argument is completely void, as using the first name is completely normal at this time.</dd>

<dd>i have already stated my points. people were generally referred to by other than their first name in pre-modern Arabia, that much is certain if you consult classical Islamic scholarly texts. there are, of course, the obvious exceptions- which as i say were popularised into common usage, such as the examples you gave above. it was certainly not a custom of scholars to refer to people by their first names only speaking in formal tone. regardless, that is irrelevant here: the article is supposed to be a modern, academic piece; not a classical Arab tract. as i have stated: a lot of the directive to use it is mainly because modern historians use it, and that it comes across as more formal and detached. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 11:20, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You have not convinced me (and having stated your points does not prove their validity). I still say that</dd>
<dd>a) we must use the practices current at AAiU's time (and part of your argument assumes this) and not fall for modern notions of family name.</dd>
<dd>b) Patronymics were not <i>the</i> standard way of referring to people. Note, I am not pushing for some exclusive usage of AA (straw man #1) - opposed to your exclusive pushing of Ibn Ubayy - or of a first name only (straw man #2). After all, the title makes clear who we are talking about and using AA is a logical conclusion from that title.</dd>
<dd>However, I will put this issue on a shelf to deal with other, more important issues in this article. The AAiU vs. AA vs. iU issue can be changed any time very quickly. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 10:04, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>re: your comments above. a) says who? besides, i'm not sure you are really that familiar with Arab custom. this has nothing to do with "modern notions of family name." in any case, the article aims to be a reflection of academic discourse, not primary sources. b) "I am not pushing for some exclusive usage of AA (straw man #1)" that's the impression i was getting. the second straw man you highlight is the same as the first. i see no reason to interchange between Ibn Ubayy and AbdAllah, it makes the prose less fluent by switching from formal to less-than-formal. i see no problem, however, with interchanging between AbdAllah ibn Ubayy and Ibn Ubayy. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 16:02, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One thing I overread until now is this passage, quoting AAiU: "By Allah, in your place I would fear a reversal of fortune!" - can please everyone check all possible translations. the "in your place" is new to me. What I read didn't include that element and I fear it is a interpretive translation, meaning that it gives the sentence a spin. In translation one should always opt for the more general, comprehensive option.</p>
<p>I was of the opinion that AAiU is talking about himself, that he fears changing fortunes and doesn't want to be robbed of his clients. In any case "in your place" (coupled with the now gladly removed characterization of this as a "threat") again drives home the alleged general enmity between the two men, when AAiU might as well have included the Muslim community (because, despite all protestations, he was a Muslim - important for the Nadir issue) in his fears: that there could be a backlash against it, Muhammad and Abdallah included. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 10:46, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Str, i have trouble understanding why you have reinstated references to Glubb. he isn't a historian, and there is nothing suggesting that his opinion is significant. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 22:13, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Itaqallah, thanks for responding
<dl>
<dd>First of all, we never concluded the Glubb discussion. He is not a historian as such, I grant you that but he transports traditions just as the Sealed Nectar does (unfortunately without clearly giving the source). I have used him as an additional reference. <i>If</i> he is not acceptable, there is no reaon to delete this right away. Other articles have fact tags, sometime for much longer.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, could you please specify your concerns, what you think POV or in need of further reference.</dd>
<dd>Thirdly, the main thing I have done is dePOV the info taken from the existing sources, especially the Encyclopedia of Islam and even added more, even if I disagreed with it. This wasn't easy as in some places Watt simply errs not on matters of analysis but on facts (he says Muhammad asked an assemby to be allowed to punish Abdallah with incurring a blood feud - I am quite certain that this is the same event referred to by Muir that a Aws chief made the request).</dd>
<dd>I can safely say that I learned a lot about these things that Watt (or Glubb or others) never told about, e.g. in the Nadir affair.</dd>
<dd>So please, Itaq, specify your concerns so that we can move forward.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 09:03, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>&lt;reset&gt;ok. not an exhaustive list but some of the primary concerns are associated with (inappropriately, i believe) awarding prominence to the opinion of Glubb. these cites need to be founded in academic opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ibn Ubayy "used every effort to end the fraticidal strive" &lt;ref name="Glubb 142"/&gt; and achieved a partial reconciliation between the two factions, which both recognized the leadership of Ibn Ubayy.&lt;ref name="Glubb 161"&gt;Glubb (2002), p. 161, 164f.&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The arrival of a man who claimed to speak in the name of God eclipsed Ibn Ubayy's influence. This provoked his jeaulousy, which he was careful to conceal, but was mitigated by his moderation and peacefulness. Ibn Ubayy nonetheless remained a well-respected man.&lt;ref name="Glubb 161"/&gt;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Being second only to Muhammad, Ibn Ubayy became a "figurehead for those Arabs of Medina who, openly or secretly, sneered at the Prophet's teaching and complained of the confusion and the danger which the coming of the Muslims had brought to Medina"...</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>However, Ibn Ubayy had not defended the Qaynuqa but merely pleaded for mercy. His plea implies that Muhammad intended to put the Qaynuqa to death, as he later did with the Banu Qurayza, but after Ibn Ubayy's intercession, they were merely expelled from Medina – their property falling to Muhammad and the Muhajirun</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... possibly because they knew it was guarded by Ibn Ubayy
<ul>
<li>here you have given Glubb's position primacy, making Rodinson's the alternative. that is inappropriate considering that Rodinson is qualified in this field and Glubb is not. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:04, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The sequence flows naturally, as the first interpretation is the more obvious one while Rodinson's is a bit more contrived and complicated. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 07:17, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"as the first interpretation is the more obvious one" that is your opinion, and for encyclopedic purposes it is of little value. all that matters is that we have one reason sourced to an academic, and one sourced to a non-scholar, who shouldn't even be used in this article. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 07:45, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>the Banu Nadir section has been made a mess. the Banu Nadir article on EoI clearly states that Ibn Ubayy was involved. EoI is one of the best academic references we could aspire to use. yet, this has been removed in favour of making the prose ambiguous, presumably to add weight to Glubb's opinion. as for Rodinson's apparent 'mistranslation': what makes you believe there aren't multiple reports on this episode? and why replace Rodinson with Muir when Rodinson's translation is more appropriate as a contemporary translation? as for the mention of Sealed Nectar: the difference is that Mubarakpuri's opinion at least holds weight from the perspective that he is a trained Islamic scholar, learned in sira. we can at least implement him when attributing something to the Muslim viewpoint. what substantial view does Glubb represent? <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:04, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, the matter is not that easy. Watt, who wrote the EoI article, doesn't do a good job, providing zero nuance and claiming things without a reasoning (and containing serious errors such as the one corrected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abd-Allah_ibn_Ubayy&amp;diff=113184200&amp;oldid=113179645" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abd-Allah_ibn_Ubayy&amp;diff=113184200&amp;oldid=113179645" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Ibn Ubayy is the villain and that's it in this article. This has nothing to do at all with Glubb. Watt claims that Ibn Ubayy encouraged the Nadir, when Ibn Ishaq says that they were encouraged by infidels. At the beginning, I knew no more. Then I had a look into Muir and found the sources that Watt was lacking and found out the details. I don't see how the section can be legitimately called a mess. It certainly was inaccurate before. I placed Muir's translation because it seems less interpretative than Rodinson, even if the language might seem archaic. "In your place" seems quite distinct from anything I read and it is placing an interpretation into the translation. Maybe you can provide your expertise in translating this passage from Arabic? And no, the Sealed Nectar is just as bad (or good) as Glubb. What you mean by "substantial view" I do not know. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 07:17, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Vacca wrote the EoI article on Banu Nadir. as for your correcting an apparent 'serious error', i see nothing wrong with what Watt wrote. you can consider whatever you like to be a "blunder by Watt," it does not belong on the encyclopedia however if it has no academic backing. you must understand: you and i are not reliable sources. your findings are of little consequence, and using them to favour one view over another in encyclopedic entires is absolute original research. it doesn't matter what Ibn Ishaq says: you assume that Ibn Ishaq is the only early source on the matter. similarly, you assume that Rodinson must have been consulting the version of the narrative as presented by Ibn Ishaq, and that he could surely not have seen another primary report available documenting the incident. again, this is the kind of original research we should be avoiding at all costs. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 07:53, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>a key feature of these extensive edits is that they have consistently reinstated Glubb's opinion as factual, whereas other opinions conflicting with this are made attributive. considering that i had attempted a rewrite with academic sources, it is not appropriate to skew the article with Glubb's opinion and then suggest we wait for stronger sourcing. that was the whole point of the rewrite in the first place. i will not proceed to edit the article yet, however. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:04, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This sounds strange, given the fact that the previous version had Abdallah factually encouraging the Nadir without any regard to the sources (I refer to the historical sources, such as Ibn Ishaq, Wakidi etc. - not some Watt scribble). However, where the attribution is missing it can be added ... if the view is controversial. It is not my fault that Watt's treatment of the man is so crappy, unbecoming of a scholar of his stature. In the cases, Glubb was unattributed he was intended only as a supporting provider of details and I still think that this is what he is doing here. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 07:17, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was referring to Watt's article on Abdallah IbnUbayy. As for primary sources, this is why I brought in Muir.

We don't "pose as historians" but we do not blindly parrot Watt (maybe you would address his blunder) and Vacca either.

I don't know how anyone interested in clear and broad information could object to the current wording of the Nadir section, as it - in the end - relates what Watt and Vacca say but make the source basis for this much clearer. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 08:21, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>by 'parroting' them, i mean that our responsibility lies in representing the secondary sources (and thus academic opinion), and that is all. we do not <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">assess and interpret primary sources</a>, or use primary sources to discount reliable secondary sources. i see no reason to discount Vacca and Watt, even Muir states that Ibn Ubayy was the instigator. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 18:31, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, I speficially used the term "parroting" to describe the wrong way of dealing with the so-called secondary sources, i.e. scholarly literature. Nothing in WP forbids the mentioning of primary sources. Muir uses them, therefore they are covered by a secondary source and not OR. We should give this a proper treatment, which includes an account of the pr. You do not do this. Though you say you "restore a scholarly version" you actually remove the scholarly parts and turn it into storytelling for the credulous. Do not remove information. Also, using Glubb is a silly pretext, as in this instance he merely says what other say too (that the promised help did not come). You apparently don't want a proper treatment of the episode, being content with the sub-standard treatment by Watt &amp; Vacca. DO NOT delete information. Thank you.</dd>
<dd>Also, you re-inserted the flat out endorsing (and therefore pov-pushing) "Over the following two years, he actively intruiged against him." Quite apart from the typo (can you see it) this is endorsing Watt's POV. My version included this view without endorsing it. STOP the POV-pushing. Thank you. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 18:41, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>you claim i am "POV-pushing" with Watt, yet you cannot bring a single academic contesting his claim. we must note that it is Muir interpreting the primary sources and using them as a basis for his claims: and as such the claims should be attributed to him. again, that you believe it is "sub-standard treatment by Watt &amp; Vacca" doesn't and shouldn't mean much to me: they are academics and you (and i) are not. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 18:53, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Itaq, other "sources" are welcome, sure, but I do not need them to call pov pushing pov pushing. What Watt and Vacca write is their POV and if we endorse this POV it is POV pushing. I or rather "my version" does not actually negate what they are writing but provides, via Muir - who in the end agrees with them regarding facts, the proper basis in the sources, a thing I would have expected from Watt. And that's what I meant by calling their articles sub-standard - sub-standard as far as Wikipedia goes - in contrast to WP other encyclopediae don't adhere to the NPOV policy. Nothing more, nothing less. As for Muir: what is "his claim"? He simply narrates the life of Muhammad. In this section there is not so much a claim but a presentation of the sources which is IMHO useful to our reader. Also, I think it a bit inconsistent of you that you OTOH have no problem with a version flat out endorsing Watt &amp; Vacca's view without even acknowledging that there is a view dimension to it (the text simply stated that it was like this and that Abdallah did that etc.) but then turn around and demand an attribution for what you call "Muir's claim". Your second position would be the correct stance regarding any claim put forth by Muir. But in our case here I see no such claim, only a presentation of the different sources. Per OR, I wouldn't be allowed to create one myself - except for a very clear statement that book A says B. But Muir, being a RS, already does it and he is quotable. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 23:45, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><small>&lt;reset&gt;</small>Str, marginalising those highly scholarly sources which you do not concur with is highly inappropriate. Muir is not presenting sources, he is presenting <i>his</i> narrative based upon the sources, so the claims the work makes are from his interpretations. this "sub-standard" rhetoric is inappropriate: other publications <i>are not required</i> to adhere to NPOV: they present their POVs which they conclude are most accurate. quite clearly, the editors at the reputed encyclopedia of Islam decided that Watt's and Vacca's analyses of the subjects were the most appropriate, which is why they included them. there should be no issue with relating what they say to be fact, as long as there are no notable POVs opposing them in their claims, which as we know is something yet to be verified. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 09:03, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Watt &amp; Vacca are not marginalised, even less so in comparison to "your version", which didn't mention them at all ... which is precisely the problem.</dd>
<dd>Specify what you mean by "Muir's claims".</dd>
<dd>Other publications are indeed not bound by NPOV - BUT WE ARE and hence we cannot just "parrot" them, even if they are encyclopediae. You are mistaken about how such project work: topics are given out to scholars and who write the articles on them. Unless they produce a complete mess or nothing, the article will be printed.</dd>
<dd>"there should be no issue with relating what they say to be fact, as long as there are no notable POVs opposing them in their claims, which as we know is something yet to be verified." - But not everything here is a fact, many things are analysis. And, even if you chose to ignore that point, I DID NOT INCLUDE A OPPOSING VIEW POINT (regarding facts), but set the view regarding facts on a more stable, scholarly, insightful, informative basis.</dd>

<dd>your version fails to make explicit the fact that Ibn Ubayy actively intrigued against Muhammad, as established by Watt, Vacca, and Muir. your version focuses on musings over primary sources, obscuring Ibn Ubayy's explicit involvement and central role in the affair. NPOV does not mean 'no point of view', we relate subjects the way academics have done so with neutral wording. if there are disagreements, we employ attribution. if not, there should be nothing wrong in relating what a reliable source says as fact. a typo can be fixed, it is not a pretext for reversion. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 10:15, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The "intriguing" is Watt's view and included as such, attributed to him. NPOV does not mean WPOV or VPOV or IPOV. There is no disagreement on the facts between Watt, Vacca and Muir (as far as we can see, as the former two do not lay open the details) - the strong statement by Watt is included but in an attributed form. What is wrong with this? We are aiming at informing the reader, not telling him what to think right away. As for the typo, this is a small thing in regard to the greater issues that warrant opposition. However, you either do not care about it or do not see it, or you would have corrected it in your reverts. But even without the typo, your version is unacceptable. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 10:21, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>you have not yet provided one reason why it is "unacceptable" except that its POV is not to your taste. the section does not make explicit that Ibn Ubayy was central to the Nadir dispute, it (anachronistically) shoehorns academic opinion to one sentence at the end of the section, while the rest of it is obscure musings over primary sources, convoluting the fact that Ibn Ubayy was involved. indeed, that is what is truly unacceptable here. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 10:32, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your telling reply:</dd>
<dd>"except that its POV is not to your taste" ... indeed, you confirm that it has a POV. And this is not in line with WP policies.</dd>
<dd>"the section does not make explicit that Ibn Ubayy was central to the Nadir dispute" ... he was not central to the dispute but merely played a small role at the end of it. If one looks at results the only "consequence" of his actions was that Muhammad cut down trees (for which Ibn Ubayy should not be blamed).</dd>
<dd>"it (anachronistically)" ... look up the word please.</dd>
<dd>"shoehorns academic opinion to one sentence at the end of the section" ... so the academic opinion consists of blaming Abdallah? I thought academic scholarship was about relating what actually happened. Which my version does.</dd>
<dd>"while the rest of it is obscure musings over primary sources" ... yes, what an absurd idea that coverage of the sources (through a secondary source, hence no OR) could be of any use. How silly of me, when we only need to state that Abdallah was a hypocrite and evil intriguing fiend and breaker of his word.</dd>
<dd>"convoluting the fact that Ibn Ubayy was involved." ... have you actually read the first sentence of the section ("my version")?</dd>

<p>&lt;reset&gt;i don't think you fully understand WP:NPOV, which mandates that we represent the POVs of the academics and leave it at that. it does not mean "no point of view". "he was not central to the dispute", he was central to the dispute, for as all three academics confirm, he was the one who persuaded the Nadir to rebel. the article fails to state this explicitly. your version seeks to smudge this fact through red herrings pointing to primary sources and unencyclopedic musings such as "Other sources include or even identify these persons with Ibn Ubayy, despite the latter's adherence to Islam", while you are quite aware that Ibn Ubayy's involvement is a matter of fact. yes, placing Watt's analysis at the end of the sect is anachronistic, it belongs at the beginning of the sect in its correct chronology. your version does indeed shoehorn academic opinion, you attempted to use Muir as a guise for your previous concern of "i don't see how they came to that conclusion, they must be wrong." coverage of the sources is fine, you have used it however to obscure the fact that Ibn Ubayy was the instigator. as for the first sentence, that is terribly and deliberately ambiguous, as you know full well. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 11:38, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not at all. You don't seem to understand the policy. Neutral point of view indeed means that the article does not have a point of view. The way to implement this aim is by including all (notable) point of views, while endorsing none. You are asking for an endorsement, nay, even worse: for an identification of that POV with the facts. That is what I call pov pushing.</dd>
<dd>"he was not central to the dispute", he was central to the dispute, for as all three academics confirm, he was the one who persuaded the Nadir to rebel." What? No one is saying that. The Nadir dispute doesn't start with the siege but with the assassination attempt on Muhammad (I am assumming that what M. said was true) Abdallah had nothing to do with this. And Abdallah was not even central to the siege either though he played an important part in its beginning and end. If the article is not explicite enough in that, maybe you can make it more explicit without reverting to a POV version.</dd>
<dd>"your version seeks to smudge this fact through red herrings pointing to primary sources and unencyclopedic musings ..." ... bad faith comments. My version tries to cover the full breadth of the events, therefore the coverage of all sources. Which is not unencyclopedic.</dd>
<dd>"such as "Other sources include or even identify these persons with Ibn Ubayy, despite the latter's adherence to Islam", while you are quite aware that Ibn Ubayy's involvement is a matter of fact." ... did I question Abdallah's involvement? No, I even put it on the top of the section a statement that HE WAS INVOLVED, whereas you preferred Watt's "Abdallah is evil evil evil" passage.</dd>
<dd>As for the "despite" part: does not Ibn Ishaq talk about unbelievers? Does that, at the first glance, seem to refer to a Muslim like Abdallah? That is the issue, that is why I was not content with Watt's simplistic coverage in the first place, looking for what the sources actually said. And they are a good enough basis for the identification (even though Watt does not help in making this clear).</dd>
<dd>You obviously have no clue about the word anachronistic.</dd>
<dd>An analysis by Watt belongs after the facts and not in front of them (or "at the beginning of the sect" - which sect, the Wattites or the Vaccaites?) - Watt's statement doesn't cover only the Nadir affair but also the stuff narrated in the following section.</dd>
<dd>My concern was never "i don't see how they came to that conclusion, they must be wrong." but "I don't see how these came to that conclusion which seems to contradict the one source I have seen. Therefore I want to know what the other sources are saying and understand how they came to their conclusion". Other readers, if they are not blind adherents to Wattism (the gullible acceptance of every utterance from the great WMW's lips), might find this interesting as well. WHY CENSOR THIS INFORMATION?</dd>
<dd>I have not used it to obscure any fact, at least not intentionally, and if you have any suggestion in improving my wording, please go ahead.</dd>
<dd>"as for the first sentence, that is terribly and deliberately ambiguous" ... actually no, it is an introduction to the whole affair. This article is about Abdallah and covers his life. Therefore we introduce the whole Nadir issue by saying that Abdallah was involved. And that is correct. What follows is a coverage of his involvement in the affair.</dd>

<li>"that is why I was not content with Watt's simplistic coverage", therein lies the problem: you seem to believe you are in a position to pass judgement upon reliable scholarly sources- and marginalise them- because they aren't in according with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">your own reading of primary sources</a>. needless to say, i wouldn't trust your research which is motivating your conclusion that Watt/Vacca are wrong in their analyses- and neither should the readers.</li>
<li>"No, I even put it on the top of the section a statement that HE WAS INVOLVED", yes i can see that. can you recall what i said about it? i stated that it was extremely ambiguous, and it shies away from explaining exactly <i>how</i> Ibn Ubayy was involved, in clinical and factual terms. i agree, this article is about Ibn Ubayy, so it should explicitly explain his role in the affair, as verified by the Encyclopedia of Islam. i already stated i don't mind if we have mention of what Muir derives from the primary sources, you have used it to obscure the explicit involvement of Ibn Ubayy by using the narration of Ibn Ishaq and the succeeding sentence ("Other sources include or even identify these persons with Ibn Ubayy, despite the latter's adherence to Islam ...") to imply that Ibn Ubayy wasn't involved according to the Ibn Ishaq narrative. this is utterly misleading. we should relate exactly what Ibn Ubayy did, as stated in the scholarly sources.</li>
<li>"I don't see how these came to that conclusion which seems to contradict the one source I have seen. Therefore I want to know what the other sources are saying and understand how they came to their conclusion", yes, and as you believe that Watt/Vacca have no textual basis for their narrative, you are using primary sources to sidetrack verified fact. that is the epitome of original research and "POV-pushing". furthermore, you detach Watt's comment about Ibn Ubayy from its correct chronology in the narrative, moving it to the bottom of the sect- where it does not belong. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 15:47, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Itaq, indee I am in the position to think for myself. I am in the position to read the article I am working on. I am in the position to reflect how another reader might read it. What I am not doing is marginalizing anything. If anyone is marginalizing anything, it is you thinking we merely need to parrot Watt and that's enough.</dd>
<dd>There's nothing wrong with an introduction being "ambiguous", since it only introduces. You want the article to say that Abdallah is the most evil man in the world. The article should explicitely explain his role in the affair (period, not as verified by the EoI - the EoI is not the only book in the world) and that is what my version is doing. Your version had nothing about attempt to reconcile (which is in the sources), your version had absolutely no nuance. Abdallah just pops up and does evil, only to annoy Muhammad. I have not obscured anything. "we should relate exactly what Ibn Ubayy did, as stated in the scholarly sources." - problem is your preferred sources doesn't say a lot about it, only that he intrigued. And that is why I am so bugged about Watt's article. A man of his standing could have done better.</dd>
<dd>Itaq, stop writing nonsense: "and as you believe that Watt/Vacca have no textual basis for their narrative". You are completely misrepresenting my point. I did ask what the textual basis for that narrative was (I don't know whether you ever question anything you read) and I did find out, unfortunately not via Watt and Vacca, but at least through Muir. Now I am content with the factual gist of Watt's narrative and I therefore include Muir, who will spare other non-gullible readers the trouble of having to look for it as well. You obviously have no clue what OR is, nor what POV is, as you are constantly trying to paint Watt's villifying analysis of Abdallah (not the facts, of which he barely mentions anything) as fact. That is POV pushing. And again you are talking about some sect - again I ask the Wattites or the Vaccites? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 18:17, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
