<dd>I think its still wrong! How could his mother be "Princess"? Isn't she wife of king Hussen, she should be Queen! I didn't change that because I'm waiting for someone who could confirm this.

<p>To answer your question, although Princess Muna (King Abdulla's mother) was married to King Hussein (King Abdulla's father), she was never official given the title of Queen, only Princess.</p>

<p>The article is more or less empty, isn't it? I mean, King Abdullah has made lots of structural changes to Jordanian culture and economics, hasn't he? I believe the article could be a lot longer, or possibly a "Jordan under King Abdullah" article could be created. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKapilTagore_5f23.html" title="User:KapilTagore">Kapil</a> 02:20, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article is skeptical of the Hashemite claim to descent from Muhammad. Is there serious controversy over this point? If I don't see a citation, I'll take it as read that their descent is what they say it is, and remove the ambiguous language.</p>
<p>The completely irrelevant section questioning Abdullah's descent from the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is deleted. I deleted it because it was factually incorrect--incredibly wrong, actually. The book cited was Mary Wilson's “King Abdullah, Britain and the Making of Jordan" and the argument was that the book disputes the argument about biological descent. I own this book. The book is a historical account of King Abdullah I's reign in Transjordan, from 1921 until his death in 1951. It is a historical work that focuses on the economic and political context of the young emirate's interaction with its colonial power until its independence in 1946; it is aimed at history students and makes primary use of archival and diplomatic records. It makes NO argument about genealogy, regarding the Hashemite (the family's name) house's claimed descent from the Qurayshi Tribe, the tribe of Muhammad, and indeed that is not Professor Wilson's intention.</p>
<p>In contrast, the subject of this article is Abdullah II, the current ruler of Jordan, was took power in 1999 after the death of his father, King Hussein, who began his tenure in 1953, the year after the abdication of his mentally ill father, Talal, and the death of his grandfather, Abdullah I. This can be verified by any cursory glance through this popular history book, which is available in any university library, or reading any of the myriad reviews of it online, through a Google search.</p>

<p>As of now ,the position of Crown Prince is vacant. What if King Abdullah II suddenly died or was assassinated, who'd become King? My theory is, Prince Hussein (Abdullah's eldest son), would become King and as a minor, one of his uncles (Abdullah's brothers) would be regent. Does anyone else have theories on this topic? Mightberight/wrong 18:53 ,10 November 2005 (UTC).</p>
<p>The scenario you outline seems a likely one. According to the Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2192" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2192" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> "by the terms of the Jordanian constitution Abdullah's ten-year-old son Hussein would automatically inherit the throne" but would not be King until 2012 when he turned 18. As for the process for appointing a governing figure or authority to take charge until Hussein turns 18, the article goes on: "In the interim, Jordan would be governed either by a single regent or a regency council. It is the king's prerogative to name the regent or the regency council as a precaution in the event of his death; if none is named, then the responsibility falls to the Jordanian cabinet. At the moment, it is not known whether Abdullah has privately taken steps to prepare for this constitutional void; no public announcement has been made." <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickfraser_0543.html" title="User:Nickfraser">Nick Fraser</a> 08:16, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article refers to St Edmunds, Hindhead, Surrey (correctly) but link takes you to St. Edmunds Canterbury. Don't know how you fix this.</p>

<dd>I removed the link for now, as there is no article for a St. Edmunds in Surrey, nor could I find any listing of such a school in the articles on <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindhead.html" title="Hindhead">Hindhead</a> or <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey.html" title="Surrey">Surrey</a>.

<dd>Not only would it be nice if you would register (especially since it appears you have taken a desire in Wikipedia), but also if you would reference an article to bolster your statement. I'm sure the king plans to uphold the Washington Declaration, but the article mentions nothing of the sort to back up your claims. The article has been properly listed on the appropriate page (see above). This is a case of appropriateness, not censorship.

<p>I was recently involved in a similar issue on another page. External links are permitted, if they are on topic, and follow on with further information related to the article. A stonger case can be made for notable sources, that plug a reader into a larger store of information, or to journal article, lets say, Biblical studies on Jordan as a whole, and the role of a Monarch. So in my third opinion, while this Truthroom is interesting it fails these tests, and should be removed. <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDominick_f59a.html" title="User talk:Dominick"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a> 03:46, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This link points to an article about King Abdullah and his commitment to the peace process. This section is going through the arbitration process. Please do not remove any links.

<p>As another wikipedian has stated it is a question of appropriateness not censorship. This article is not sufficiently relevant or appropriate to merit inclusion.

<p>I have yet to read a valid point to be made as to why the peacemaker link should be removed. So far all I read is that is a pov. If there is a scholar among you let them speak. Stop removing valid content, you are showing yourself to be biased.</p>
<p>I have no particular interest in this page; I simply came across it while on RC patrol (as a matter of course I check ALL edits made by anons). However, I do agree that the site in question is in fact relevant to an article on King Abdullah, a fact that becomes quite clear when you read further down the page. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 01:43, 26 December 2005 (UTC) (someone with no particular interest in this page, although admittedly he does consider himself a friend of the late King Hussein, having communicated with him over ham radio a few times)</p>

<p>The peacemaker link refers to an article that is significant in showing the dedication that King Abdullah has had for many years to the peace process. It also has one of the best photos I have seen of the King in his formal dress. I am sorry to know that "we do censor wikipedia". It is a minority of you that take part in the censoring of information and this is the very reason rules have been setup against the practice.</p>

<p>I'm coming into this because we've had a request for an Advocate at the <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">Association of Members' Advocates page</a> and I've been reviewing the page for some pertinent info. The person requesting the advocate is an anon but I believe has since registered an account.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't understand why this link to Truthroom.com has to continually be removed. Looking at <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> you can find similar links to mudslinging sites such as toostupidtobepresident.com, dubyaspeak.com and Michael Moore's website. Not that the GWB article should be the shining example of Wikipedia (I personally think it's a steaming pile of manure) but clearly there's precedent out there for "rogue" or "fringe" websites critical of a particular world leader. If you look outside of GWB there's a massive article regarding the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon_landing_conspiracy.html" title="Moon landing conspiracy">moon landings being faked</a> and if that's not fringe or just plain wacko I don't know what is.</p>
<p>Simply including the link isn't inferring any particular POV and, like I said, GWB's article is chock full of derogatory external links so what's the big deal? In fact, I think it should probably be addressed in the article. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 07:46, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The "Future" section does not adhere to the policy on biographies of living persons, in that it is unsourced and potentially libelous.</p>

<dd>I just removed soem of the unsourced and irrelevant stuff, but left the Haaretz and LAT sourced stuff, although it also looks poor. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelkvance_d699.html" title="User:Michaelkvance">MKV</a> 16:19, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please do not add opinions or factoids. Keep the information to biographical material. This is an encylopedia type article. Please use Encylopedia Brittanica as a model. This is a not an opinion page from the latest newpapers. I have removed much of the article which is not neutral or simply factual information. <a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzalea_pomp_8528.html" title="User:Azalea pomp">Azalea_pomp</a></p>
<p>I'd go further. Someone needs to tear down and completely re-write this entire entry. If<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.

<p>Can someone please point me to the NPOV discussion that the template says is here on the Talk page? I don't see any active or even recent discussion of this issue so I'm probably just missing or overlooking it. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 05:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
