<p>In the article, it says: "Another assassination attempt, motivated by suspected pan-Arabist influence and state control over the petroleum sector, was carried out with the backing of the British government and the American CIA in on February 9, 1963. Qasim was killed after a show trial on February 9, 1963." I think these two are mutually exclusive. You can't get killed after a show trial, by assassination, can you?</p>

<p>CABINET PAPERS 1963: IRAQ: MINISTERS EAGER TO SELL ARMS TO NEW RULERS AFTER BLOODY COUP</p>
<p>EVIDENCE of the British government's strong support for the first Iraqi government led by Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party is revealed in the enthusiasm with which Macmillan's cabinet secretly agreed to arm the new Baghdad regime, writes Seumas Milne.</p>
<p>The Ba'athist overthrow of General Kassem in February, 1963, <b>in a bloody anti-communist coup backed by the CIA</b>, was accompanied by the killing of about 5,000 communists and supporters of the dead leader.</p>
<p>Less than two months later Edward Heath - then Lord Privy Seal - gave a sympathetic report to cabinet on an Iraqi request for military aircraft and armoured personnel carriers.</p>
<p>"If these inquiries reflected a disposition on the part of the new government of Iraq to reduce their dependence on the Soviet Union, we should seek to take advantage of it," the future prime minister said.</p>
<p>The only worry was that British equipment might be used to attack Kuwait, but the government pressed ahead with the arms supplies anyway.</p>
<p>By June, there was some ministerial nervousness at the "ruthless methods" being used by the Baghdad regime against the Kurds.</p>
<p>Lord Home, then foreign secretary, warned that the government might be criticised if British weapons were used to repress the Kurdish community. The cabinet slowed the flow, but in September military supplies were again sharply stepped up.</p>
<p>They included 16 Wessex helicopters, 20 training aircraft, small arms, mortars, ammunition, Saracen carriers and 3,000 rockets. "These arms are wanted urgently by the Iraqis for operations against the Kurds . . . our interest lies in a gradual supply of arms to meet Iraqi requirements," one minute to Macmillan reads.</p>
<p>"I agree," the prime minister has scribbled across the bottom, asking that the matter be "pushed forward energetically".</p>
<p>Duncan Sandys, the colonial secretary, reported to cabinet in May that the Iraqi government had "found it necessary to imprison a number of supporters of President Nasser and to execute certain adherents of the previous president." He said the agreement to supply military equipment would increase British influence in Iraq.</p>

<p>Many sections of this article express POV, such as the following snippet:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Qassim’s accomplishments are too many to include here in memory of his death. His accomplishments did not only include those in relation to politics and economy, but they covered a large range of improvements with regard to social services, legal system, agriculture, health and education, construction and the arts. Considering the short term of his leadership (four and a half years) and the youngest experience in the life of the Iraqi Republic, Qassim’s era brought the highest number of accomplishments and positive changes to Iraq compared with eras that preceded and followed him."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The claims made in the sections "Death," "After Death" and "Accomplishments" should be more precisely stated and qualified. Regardless of their accuracy, they lack citation and are written in such generalities that they constitute POV. In addition, the aforementioned sections contain several grammatical and spelling errors. Since the sections require revision in the first place, however, I did not fix these errors. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThucydides411_0d89.html" title="User:Thucydides411">Thucydides411</a> 07:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To my knowledge, most of it is recollections by individuals who claim to have been involved. I really don't know the extent of CIA involvement, as there's never been anything official declassified. Given that, I'm somewhat skeptical of how deeply they were actually involved. It's quite probable that they handed off lists of Iraqi communists, but other than that, there's really know way to know anything with certainty. Mattm1138 01:02, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This seems like historic revisionism considering the U.S. and Western attitudes towards Baathist Party and the position of the Baathist Party towards regional ally Israel. Furthermore the Baathist PArty of Iraq supported nationalization and increased involvement in anti-western movements as well as a non-aligned position that allowed them to have close ties to the Soviets while not becoming a sattelite. 21 November 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.66.237.41 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.66.237.41_d482.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.66.237.41">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>He is still praised for his unselfishness by the Iraqi people: It is said that he died without owning anything, that he slept in his office in the Ministry of Defense and he used to give half his salary to his sister to cook lunches for him.

</dl>
<p>Original research:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A source in the First Branch of Iraq’s Directorate of Security <b>told this writer</b> in 1967 that some 340 Communists died at the time. A well-placed foreign diplomatic observer, who does not wish to be identified, set the total death toll in the neighborhood of 1,500. The figure includes the more than one hundred soldiers who fell inside the Ministry of Defense and “a good lot of Communists.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>Unreferenced POV:</p>
<dl>
<dd>He left Kafr Qasem with the reputation of a disciplinarian, meticulous and honest.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Confusing paragraph, not sure what writer is refering to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Iraqi Communist Party championed Qassim throughout his rule, despite the steps he took against it, he tried to make a national government without any political influence from any party. It later appeared that Qassim's move against the Communist Party was his biggest mistake, since he was left with no means to mobilise ordinary people to defend his regime when the Ba’ath Party launched a coup in 1963.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Qassim succeeded in the struggle against Egypt's Nasser. Gamal Abdel Nasser stated, “No doubt the fact that he had incurred my displeasure weighed against his position. But in the direct contest I was thwarted; I grudgingly acknowledged my defeat, just as I have since acknowledged defeat against other opponents in the Middle East arena.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>POV tone:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Qassim had the very difficult mission of steering Iraq through that era when pro-Arab nationalism was at its peak of power in the Arab world, especially after the formation of U.A.R between Egypt and Syria under the leadership of <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser_2db4.html" title="Gamal Abdel Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a> of Egypt.</dd>
