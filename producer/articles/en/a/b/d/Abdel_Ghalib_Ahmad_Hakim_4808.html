<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunal</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p>Hakim chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.<sup id="_ref-CsrtAbdelGhalibAhmadHakim_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtAbdelGhalibAhmadHakim" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Tribunal's President stated, for the record, that Hakim had not requested the testimony of any witnesses. But he did request exculpatory documents -- his passport and plane ticket. But they could not be located.</p>

<p>Hakim confirmed that he was captured by Pakistani officials.</p>
<p>Hakim confirmed that he was he was captured with other people.</p>
<p>One of the Tribunal members expressed skepticism that the Pakistani security officials would have arrested him, without telling him why. Hakim replied that he still didn’t know why he was arrested. He said every new interrogator he was interrogated by had a brand new set of false allegations.</p>
<p>Hakim said he spent months in detention in Pakistani custody, and then in American custody, in Kandahar and Bagram, prior to being transferred to Cuba. He said none of his interrogators had asked him questions that implied they thought he was affiliated with Al Qaida until after he came to Cuba.</p>
<p>Hakim confirmed that he had never traveled to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The President of Hakim’s Tribunal expressed regret that Hakim did not take the opportunity to be more forthcoming about the details of his story.</p>
