<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdurahman_Khadr_9513.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Abdurahman Khadr was born in Canada, the son of <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmed_Said_Khadr_c357.html" title="Ahmed Said Khadr">Ahmed Said Khadr</a>, an Egyptian immigrant to Canada.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> His father moved to Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion in the 1980s, and brought his family to Afghanistan in the 1990s. While in Afghanistan Abdurahman Khadr attended the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalden_training_camp.html" title="Khalden training camp">Khalden training camp</a>, a facility closely linked with al-Qaida. Khadr argues that when he attended the camp in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, he was doing so merely under the order of his father, a strong supporter of the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a> regime and al-Qaida. He claims to have never received anything besides the most basic combat training, and views his experience as a "waste of time."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdurahman_Khadr_9513.html" title="Edit section: Detention and release">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Detention and release</span></h2>
<p>In November of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, he was arrested in <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabul.html" title="Kabul">Kabul</a> and handed over to American authorities who flew him to <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guant%C3%A1namo_Bay%2C_Cuba_2c9a.html" title="Guantánamo Bay, Cuba">Guantanamo Bay</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>. The original account of Khadr's time in US custody was that after many months of detention and interrogation he was returned to Afghanistan in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> after no links to terrorism or al-Qaida could be found.</p>
<p>A memo from a meeting held on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_9.html" title="October 9">October 9</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> summarizing a meeting between General <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Miller_%28general%29_aace.html" title="Geoffrey Miller (general)">Geoffrey Miller</a> and his staff and Vincent Cassard of the <a href="../../../i/c/r/ICRC_e559.html" title="ICRC">ICRC</a>, acknowledged that camp authorities were not permitting the ICRC to have access to Khadr, and three other detainees, due to "military necessity".<sup id="_ref-Memo031009_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Memo031009" title="">[3]</a></sup> The DoD released this memo to the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a> as a result of a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_Information_Act_920f.html" title="Freedom of Information Act">Freedom of Information Act</a> request.</p>
<p>The story of Khadr's release and subsequent treatment is a murky one. The United States claims that he was returned in July, four months before the ICRC memo confirmed he was still in Guantanamo, Khadr says he arrived in November. Khadr states that he attempted to approach Canadian embassies in various nations and was rebuffed at all of them. He finally gained admittance to the Canadian embassy in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_c758.html" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia</a> and was flown back to Canada from there on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">November 30</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_4.html" title="December 4">December 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> Khadr was still withholding the story that he had co-operated with the <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdurahman_Khadr_9513.html" title="Edit section: CBC Interview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CBC Interview</span></h2>
<p>In March, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Khadr revealed in a two-part documentary broadcast by <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation_65d3.html" title="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation">CBC</a> that he and family members had lived in a compound with <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>, and that his father, <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmed_Said_Khadr_c357.html" title="Ahmed Said Khadr">Ahmed Said Khadr</a>, and some of his brothers had fought alongside al-Qaida members and even stayed with bin Laden for some time after their training.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the interview, Khadr claimed to have lived for nine months in a CIA safe house near the American Embassy in Kabul, and worked abroad as an informant. The CIA offered him a contract and asked him to go to Guantanamo Bay as a <a href="../../../e/s/p/Espionage.html" title="Espionage">mole</a> at the U.S. military prison. While in Cuba, Khadr worked to obtain information from his fellow inmates before spending five additional months at the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_X-Ray_23b6.html" title="Camp X-Ray">Camp X-Ray</a> prison, undergoing training as an undercover CIA operative. He later was given a bogus <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passport.html" title="Passport">passport</a> and boarded a government plane destined towards Bosnia to conduct a spy operation at <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosques</a> in <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarajevo%2C_Bosnia_b3ab.html" title="Sarajevo, Bosnia">Sarajevo</a>.</p>
<p>His work for the CIA ended as he was dropped at the Canadian <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embassy.html" title="Embassy">embassy</a> in Sarajevo to gain access back to <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>. There he lied to reporters and government officials and denied any connections to terrorist organizations. Abdurahman later acknowledged that he is "the black sheep" of his family for his disavowal of support for al-Qaida, and says he just wants to be a peaceful Muslim.</p>
<p>In the interview, Khadr declared that 'We are an al-Qaida family'. He says he resents his father for dragging the family into a life associated with terrorism. Rumours emerged that Abdurahman's older brother, <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_Khadr_9b0e.html" title="Abdullah Khadr">Abdullah Khadr</a>, had been responsible for a January suicide bomb attack in Kabul that killed Canadian soldier <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Murphy_556a.html" title="Jamie Murphy">Cpl. Jamie Murphy</a>. Identified by members of the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a>, Abdullah Khadr was found alive and hiding in <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and was later cleared of any involvement.</p>
<p>Abdurahman Khadr's mother and sister, who during the 2004 CBC interview were unaware of Khadr's detailed CIA role, told the interviewer that they are proud of their family's connection to al-Qaida.</p>

<p>In July 2004, Khadr was denied a <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passport_Canada_b891.html" title="Passport Canada">Canadian passport</a> by explicit decision of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_%28Canada%29_1fc2.html" title="Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)">Foreign Affairs Minister</a> <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Graham_%28politician%29_b28b.html" title="Bill Graham (politician)">Bill Graham</a>. To achieve this, Graham advised <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_General_of_Canada_3270.html" title="Governor General of Canada">Governor General</a> <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrienne_Clarkson_1680.html" title="Adrienne Clarkson">Adrienne Clarkson</a> to invoke the <i><a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Prerogative_cb9c.html" title="Royal Prerogative">Royal Prerogative</a></i> for an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order-in-Council_6258.html" title="Order-in-Council">Order-in-Council</a>, a rarely-used power usually reserved for ceremonial duties or government crisis, claiming the decision was "in the interest of the national security of Canada and the protection of Canadian troops in Afghanistan."</p>
<p>Khadr and his attorney, noted Toronto lawyer <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clayton_Ruby_1c50.html" title="Clayton Ruby">Clayton Ruby</a>, announced they would appeal the decision, and Khadr's appeal of the government's use of <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Prerogative_cb9c.html" title="Royal Prerogative">Royal Prerogative</a> to deny him a passport came to court on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_5.html" title="December 5">December 5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup> Ruby called the government's position "disgraceful" and said it was inconsistent with the Canadian constitution.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">June 8</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the Federal Court ruled that Khadr was entitled to reapply for a Canadian Passport, although it stopped short of ruling that the Government must issue him one. The court cited that the Federal government had used dubious grounds to deny him a passport, and ordered that Ottawa stop denying him his travel documents.</p>
<p>However, on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">August 30</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, now <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_MacKay_a693.html" title="Peter MacKay">Peter MacKay</a>, advised, with the backing of Prime Minister <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Harper_d9dd.html" title="Stephen Harper">Stephen Harper</a>, Governor General <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micha%C3%ABlle_Jean_5dae.html" title="Michaëlle Jean">Michaëlle Jean</a> to use the Royal Prerogative to deny Khadr's application, again citing national security as the reason.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
