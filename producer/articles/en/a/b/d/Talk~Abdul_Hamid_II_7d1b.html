<p>user (209.158.161.194) that was really cheap act of removing my added text.. it took me hours to make the article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Hameed_II" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Hameed_II" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Hameed_II</a>). You cannot remove the article like that without good reason.. I have placed my sources very well. You should be banned for such stupid act. I didnt remove this article (Abdul_Hamid_II) but placed my article on another name (Abdul_Hameed_II).. so that ALL VIEWS SHOULD BE KNOWN.. Be Fair Enuf.</p>

<p>Abdul Hamit II was the last good leader of the Ottoman Empire. After his reign, you can easily realize how fast the country lost power in the world arena. Also after his death, the Ottoman Dynasty became a puppet for military and political leaders. Abdul Hamid II tried every way to save the country. They argue that he destroyed all the navy power of the empire because he was afraid of navy generals to betray him. For example this was a good example for the lies that was made up to show that Abdul Hamit II was a bad person. The reality was different. Seapower of the empire was too old and ships were too powerless against new ships of the navies such as English ships. Also it was too expensive too keep them so Abdul Hamit Khan gave order to stop paying the bills of the ships. Only because of this fact, many people hated him but in reality he was a great leader. With respect, the son of the nomadic warriors, <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeliogul_430e.html" title="User:Deliogul">Deliogul</a> 22:51, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. The Image <a href="../../../a/b/d/Image%7EAbdul_Hamid_Zia_Pasha.jpg_2157.html" title="Image:Abdul Hamid Zia Pasha.jpg">Image:Abdul Hamid Zia Pasha.jpg</a> popped up on the commons with insufficient source. The Source says "Abdul Hamid Zia Pasha. 1825-1881", but we at the commons could not yet find such a guy. Could this be Abdul Hamid II? The birth dates and death dates do not match, but they look mightily similiar.

<dd>Hi, it seems that the image belongs to "Ziya Paşa (Ziya Pasha)", who was exiled by Abdülhamid, so the mismatch in the identification of the picture.

<p>ABD-UL-HAMID II. (1842- ), sultan of Turkey, son of Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid, was born on the 21st of September 1842, and succeeded to the throne on the deposition of his brother Murad V., on the 31st of August 1876. He accompanied his uncle Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz on his visit to England and France in 1867. At his accession spectators were struck by the fearless manner in which he rode, practically unattended, on his way to be girt with the sword of Eyub. He was supposed to be of <b>liberal principles</b>, and the more <b>conservative</b> of his subjects were for some years after his accession inclined to regard him with suspicion as a too ardent <b>reformer</b>. But the circumstances of the country at his accession were ill adapted for <b>liberal developments</b>. Default in the public funds and an empty treasury, the insurrection in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia.html" title="Bosnia">Bosnia</a> and the Herzegovina, the war with <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montenegro.html" title="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, the feeling aroused throughout Europe by the methods adopted in stamping out the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_rebellion.html" title="Bulgarian rebellion">Bulgarian rebellion</a>, all combined to prove to the new sultan that he could expect little aid from the Powers. But, still clinging to the groundless belief, for which <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> statesmen had, of late at least, afforded <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> no justification, that <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> at all events would support him, he obstinately refused to give ear to the pressing requests of the Powers that the necessary reforms should be instituted. The international Conference which met at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> towards the end of 1876 was, indeed, startled by the salvo of guns heralding the promulgation of a constitution, but the demands of the Conference were rejected, in spite of the solemn warnings addressed to the sultan by the Powers; <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midhat_Pasha_23cd.html" title="Midhat Pasha">Midhat Pasha</a>, the author of the constitution, was exiled; and soon afterwards his work was suspended, though figuring to this day on the Statute-Book. Early in 1877 the disastrous war with <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> followed. The hard terms, embodied in the treaty of San Stefano, to which Abd-ul-Hamid was forced to consent, were to some extent amended at <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, thanks in the main to British diplomacy (see EUROPE, History); but by this time the sultan had lost all confidence in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, and thought that he discerned in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, whose supremacy was evidenced in his eyes by her capital being selected as the meeting-place of the Congress, the future friend of Turkey. He hastened <b>to employ Germans for the reorganization of his finances and his army</b>, and set to work in the determination to maintain his empire in spite of the difficulties surrounding him, to resist the encroachments of foreigners, and to take gradually the reins of absolute power into his own hands, being animated by a profound distrust, not unmerited, of his ministers. <b>Financial embarrassments forced him to consent to a foreign control over the Debt</b>, and the decree of December 1881, whereby many of the revenues of the empire were handed over to the Public Debt Administration for the benefit of the bondholders, was a sacrifice of principle to which he could only have consented with the greatest reluctance. Trouble in <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, where a discredited <a href="../../../k/h/e/Khedive.html" title="Khedive">khedive</a> had to be deposed, trouble on the Greek frontier and in Montenegro, where the Powers were determined that the decisions of the Berlin Congress should be carried into effect, were more or less satisfactorily got over. In his attitude towards Arabi, the would-be saviour of Egypt, Abd-ul-Hamid showed less than his usual astuteness, and the resulting consolidation of England's hold over the country contributed still further to his estrangement from Turkey's old ally. The union in 1885 of Bulgaria with Eastern <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumelia.html" title="Rumelia">Rumelia</a>, the severance of which had been the great triumph of the Berlin Congress, was another blow. Few people south of the Balkans dreamed that Bulgaria could be anything but a Russian province, and apprehension was entertained of the results of the union until it was seen that Russia really and entirely disapproved of it. Then the best was made of it, and for some years the sultan preserved towards Bulgaria an attitude skilfully calculated so as to avoid running counter either to Russian or to German wishes. Germany's friendship was not entirely disinterested, and had to be fostered with a railway or loan concession from time to time, until in 1899 the great object aimed at, the Bagdad railway, was conceded. Meanwhile, aided by docile instruments, the sultan had succeeded in reducing his ministers to the position of secretaries, and in concentrating the mhole administration of the country into his own hands at <a href="../../../y/i/l/Yildiz.html" title="Yildiz">Yildiz</a>. But internal dissension was not thereby lessened. Crete was constantly in turmoil, the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a> were dissatisfied, and from about 1890 the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenians.html" title="Armenians">Armenians</a> began a violent agitation with a view to obtaining the reforms promised them at Berlin. Minor troubles had occurred in 1892 and 1893 at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marsovan.html" title="Marsovan">Marsovan</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokat.html" title="Tokat">Tokat</a>. In 1894 a more serious rebellion in the mountainous region of Sassun was ruthlessly stamped out; the Powers insistently demanded reforms, the eventual grant of which in the autumn of 1895 was the signal for a series of massacres, brought on in part by the injudicious and threatening acts of the victims, and extending over many months and throughout Asia Minor, as well as in the capital itself. The reforms became more or less a dead letter. <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crete.html" title="Crete">Crete</a> indeed profited by the grant of extended privileges, but these did not satisfy its turbulent population, and early in 1897 a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> expedition salled to unite the island to Greece. War followed, in which Turkey was easily successful and gained a small rectification of frontier; then .a few months later Crete was taken over "en depot" by the Four Powers---Germany and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> not participating,---and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_George_55e7.html" title="Prince George">Prince George</a> of Greece was appointed their <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandatory.html" title="Mandatory">mandatory</a>. In the next year the sultan received the visit of the German emperor and empress.</p>
<p>Abd-ul-Hamid had always resisted the pressure of the European Powers to the last moment, in order to seem to yield only to overwhelming force, while posing as the champion of Islam against aggressive <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christendom.html" title="Christendom">Christendom</a>. The Panislamic propaganda was encouraged; the privileges of foreigners in the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>-often an obstacle to government--were curtailed; the new railway to the Holy Places was pressed on, and emissaries were sent to distant countries preaching Islam and the caliph's supremacy. This appeal to <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moslem.html" title="Moslem">Moslem</a> sentiment was, however, powerless against the disaffection due to perennial misgovernment. In <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamia.html" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemen.html" title="Yemen">Yemen</a> disturbance was endemic; nearer home, a semblance of loyalty was maintained in the army and among the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mussulman.html" title="Mussulman">Mussulman</a> population by a system of delation and espionage, and by wholesale arrests; while, obsessed by terror of assassination, the sultan withdrew himself into fortified seclusion in the palace of Yildiz.</p>
<p>The national humiliation of the situation in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a> (q.v.), together with the resentment in the army against the palace spies and informers, at last brought matters to a crisis. The remarkable revolution associated with the names of Niazi Bey and <a href="../../../e/n/v/Enver_Bey_5a61.html" title="Enver Bey">Enver Bey</a>, the young Turk leaders, and the Committee of Union and Progress is described elsewhere (see TURKEY, History); here it must suffice to say that Abd-ul-Hamid, on learning of the threat of the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salonica.html" title="Salonica">Salonica</a> troops to march on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> (July 23), at once capitulated. On the 24th an irade announced the restoration of the suspended constitution of 1875; next day, further irades abolished espionage and the censorship, and ordered the release of political prisoners. On the 10th of December the sultan opened the Turkish parliament with a speech from the throne in which he said that the first parliament had been "temporarily dissolved until the education of the people had been brought to a sufficiently high level by the extension of instruction throughout the empire."</p>
<p>The correct attitude of the sultan did not save him from the suspicion of intriguing with the powerful reactionary elements in the state, a suspicion confirmed by his attitude towards the counter-revolution of the 13th of April, when an insurrection of the soldiers and the Moslem populace of the capital overthrew the committee and the ministry. The comittee, restored by the Salonica troops, now decided on Abdul-Hamid's deposition, and on the 27th of April his brother Reshid Effendi was proclaimed sultan as Mahommed V. The ex-sultan was conveyed into dignified captivity at Salonica.</p>

<p>Formerly, the template {{ArB}} was being used to introduce "عبد الحميد ثانی", which was Abdülhamîd's name as written in the Ottoman version of the Arabic abjad. This is a mistake in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>For those just arriving at the page, they see this: <b><span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">عبد الحميد ثانی</span></b>. This links to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_alphabet.html" title="Arabic alphabet">Arabic alphabet</a>, which is roughly accurate insofar as a Persian-derived version of the Arabic abjad was used to write <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Turkish_language_f605.html" title="Ottoman Turkish language">Ottoman Turkish</a>. However, it is highly misleading: only the word "Arabic" appears as a link, giving the impression at a glance that the man was of Arabic origin in some way. Of course, reading the article should quickly dispel that impression, but there is no need to be initially misleading when accuracy is very easy to obtain.</li>
<li>The bigger problem is the following: "عبد الحميد ثانی" (roughly, <i>Abdülhamîd-i sânî</i>) is not <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>; that would be "عبد الحميد الشان" (roughly, <i>‘Abdu’l-Hamid as-sānī</i>). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E2%80%98Abdu%E2%80%99l-Hamid_II&amp;diff=29548199&amp;oldid=28748861" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E2%80%98Abdu%E2%80%99l-Hamid_II&amp;diff=29548199&amp;oldid=28748861" rel="nofollow">original insertion</a> of the Arabic script was made by a user whose native language was Arabic, and who seemingly has no knowledge of Ottoman Turkish. While that user's efforts are to be commended, they are also incorrect insofar as the Arabic definite article "ال" was not used for enumerating rulers in Ottoman Turkish. Thus, putting the word "Arabic" before the name "عبد الحميد ثانی"—as the name would be written in the language that Abdülhamîd used—is fundamentally wrong.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given these points, I think that—rather than using the {{ArB}} template, which presents information wrongly—the link to the Ottoman Turkish language (wherein the Ottoman version of the Arabic abjad is outlined) should stay. Any thoughts on this issue? —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 18:52, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you missed the ی in the Arabic version. It should be "عبد الحميد الشانی". And the only difference is that the Arabic version adds the definite article, and the Persian/Turkish version leaves it out, quite a long-shot from insinuating that it's an entirely different language. The reason for the different scripts in the intro is to give useful information, and since most people would want to know the Arabic script and the modern Turkish transliteration, that's what should be there. Claiming that it's Ottoman Turkish just confuses the issue, and I suspect there is some kind of political motivation. I suggest the following intro:
<dl>
<dd><b>‘Abdu’l-Ḥamīd II</b> (<b><span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">عبد الحميد الشانى</span></b> <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a>: <b>İkinci Abdülhamid</b>) (<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_21.html" title="September 21">September 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1842.html" title="1842">1842</a> – <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry, I don't see how that source is "verifiable" or neutral. Not only does it reproduce the usual propaganda but it introduces a demonstrably false fabrication, that Abdul Hamid settled refugees from the Balkans in Armenian lands. This is a blatant attempt to obscure the fact that Muslims were a huge majority in every area in which Armenians lived in an attempt to lend legitimacy to Armenian claims over these lands - and to call into question the Ottoman Empire's legitimacy, and by association, Turkey's. The vast majority of Balkan refugees were settled in areas of the Balkans that remained in the Ottoman Empire. Very, very few were settled in Armenia, which was mountainous, had poor communications, and was totally incapable of absorbing any number of immigrants.</p>

<p>Justin McCarthy is quite reputable as a historian except in the minds of Armenian propagandists, who have no interest in actual history in any case. McCarthy does not in any way deny that massacres occurred, and you are quite mistaken, his views are quite in accord with those of the vast majority of Mid East scholars. In fact, there are no scholars of any repute that deny that massacres occurred; the debate is over the reasons why they happened and the scope. The ludicrous figure of 300,000 in the 1890s is more or less drawn out of thin air and has not one single bit of evidence to support it. The consular officals of all the Western powers came up with a figure of 20,000-25,000 in the provinces and 6,000-7,000 in Istanbul, the figure used by Britannica until the 70's. McCarthy draws all the Armenian ire because he's one of the few scholars who wasn't silenced by the Armenian terror campaign in the 80s that saw the bombing of Prof Stanford Shaw's house and death threats to the long list of scholars who signed a petition to Congress that takes a position identical to McCarthy's. I suppose none of these are "reputable" historians either.</p>

<p>Instead of baseless smears on the reputations of scholars whose works you clearly haven't even read, why don't you try to back up your arguments with actual evidence?</p>
<p>The disingenous use of the word "denialist" that Armenians use to label anyone, anywhere, that hold any opinion contrary to their dogma deliberately obscures the fact that nobody disagrees that the WWI death toll amongst the Armenians was massive. The difference is that the Armenians claim that it was a racially-motivated attempt to purify Anatolia of non-Turkish elements whereas the Turkish position is that it was an attempt to save the state at any cost under desperate circumstances. That millions of Muslims were slaughtered in the wars between 1876-1923, including by Armenians, is conveniently overlooked.Jpiccone 18:54, 21 November 2006 (UTC)Jpiccone</p>

<p>I've came across to many uncreditable claims that AH2 was partly an Armenian, but in none of those, Armenianness of the sultan was attributed to this Tirimüjgân Kadınefendi. They instead claimed that actual mother of AH2 was an Armenian dancer (?) at the court, with whom so-called 'casanova' Abdülmecid had some intercourse. The story is like, "A circassian girl in the court (this is Tirimüjgân) was announced to be his mother, however, he was the son of an Armenian dancer." These are told in a rather pejorative manner as you can see. But even those people agree that Tirimüjgân was not an Armenian woman. For the time being, I'll be contented with a citation-nneeded tag, but I am planning to remove that if it is not verified by an appropriate source. <a href="../../../m/a/o/User%7EMaokan_e39a.html" title="User:Maokan">Okan</a> 18:15, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>–The story that Tirimüjgân was Armenian persists because Abdul Hamid was thought to have Armenian features (whatever that means), being darker than his father or brothers. The name Tirimüjgân is of Persian origin, but that doesn't mean anything as she was likely given a new name in the Harem. "Müjgân" is "eyelashes", but I don't know what the "Tir-i" refers to.</p>
<p>In any case, it doesn't really matter what AH2's ethnicity was, he was the Padişah, which makes him about as Ottoman as Ottoman can get. Jpiccone 18:29, 21 November 2006 (UTC)jpiccone</p>
