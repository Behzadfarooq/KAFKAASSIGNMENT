	    <p>Dear <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh</a>, I'm pleased to find you reverting my work again. Could you please argue why abdominal pain is <i>not</i> a gastroenterological disease? Yeah, family doctors and especially <a href="../../../g/y/n/Gynaecology.html" title="Gynaecology">gynaecologists</a> see lots of them. But the main causes of abdominal pain are handled by <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgeons</a> (acute) or <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gastroenterology.html" title="Gastroenterology">gastroenterologists</a> (chronic). I'm reintroducing the box, and await your argumentation.<br />
<a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff"></a> <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a> | <a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 03:05, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not so pleased to find you defacing mine. Abdominal pain is not a GI disease because [1] it's not a disease, it's a symptom, and [2] it's caused by many other things than GI disease. The box misrepresents this, falsely making abdominal pain [1] medical rather than surgical [2] specifically GI rather than a symptom that involves many organ systems. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 03:08, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Allright, it's a <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symptom.html" title="Symptom">symptom</a>, not an actual disease. So are some others in my cherished box (<a href="../../../n/a/u/Nausea.html" title="Nausea">nausea</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/m/Vomiting.html" title="Vomiting">vomiting</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diarrhea.html" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a>). It would be a lovely job to make seperate boxes for symptoms and others for diseases, but IMHO this clouds the issues.<br />
Indeed, when I'm finished doing all these boxes (see <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_WikiDoc_0c2a.html" title="User:Jfdwolff/WikiDoc">WikiDoc</a>), this article might well have a box from <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gastroenterology.html" title="Gastroenterology">gastroenterology</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgery</a>. Episodic or chronic abdominal pain is not surgical. It's a gastroenterologist's job to determine whether this patient needs to be worked up for <a href="../../../r/a/r/Rare_disease.html" title="Rare disease">rare diseases</a> such as <a href="../../../f/m/f/FMF_1ad2.html" title="FMF">FMF</a> and <a href="../../../c/1/-/C1-esterase_deficiency.html" title="C1-esterase deficiency">C1-esterase deficiency</a>.<br />
<a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff"></a> <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a> | <a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 03:16, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>No, in most cases it will be a family medicine, gynecological or internal medicine practitioner that decides whether a gastroenterologist's particular expertise is needed, not the reverse. The box is pretty but misleading, and not particularly useful. A list of GI diseases can stand on its own: it doesn't need to be here. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 03:25, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of these boxes is to link together as much medicine as possible, preferably with as little linking as possible. There is inevitably some overlap between specialisms; will we have the same argument over <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allergic_rhinitis.html" title="Allergic rhinitis">allergic rhinitis</a>? This is treated mainly by family doctors, although it's an ENT diagnosis.<br />
Could you suggest which specialism is best suited to link to "abdominal pain"?<br />
<a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff"></a> <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a> | <a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 03:29, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>My point is that abdominal pain "belongs" to no particular specialty, and to discourage the suggestion that it belongs to one more than any other. A doctor who thinks of one particular organ system when confronted with abdominal pain is a dangerous physician. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 03:32, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <i>completely</i> off the point. As I stated above, the end result of this exercise might well be that the "abdominal pain" page will be—as you call it—"defaced" by several horizontal linking elements, each for all the specialisms that might involve themselves with Jane Doe's recurrent abdominal cramps in the week before her period. I thought I'd made abundantly clear that I'm not forcing abdominal pain into any particular organ system!<br />
If you don't like the horizontal linking, please just state this outright.<br />
<a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff"></a> <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a> | <a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 03:38, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It's precisely on point. The utility of linking abdominal pain to gyn, GI, general surgery, hepatology, emergency medicine, and every other specialty in which it may figure does in fact seems minimal to me, but at least it would avoid falsely suggesting that only one of them need be considered. Please wait until you can link them all, if you are intent on doing so, rather than linking only one. Though I do think Wikipedia would be much more improved by concentrating on content, rather than on a device for navigating between articles there is no particular need to navigate between. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 03:48, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll refrain from dropping lots of boxes on the page. Indeed, this would amount to overkill. I do not agree that Wikipedia would not benefit from the type of navigational element I've sought to introduce. The complete absence of hierarchical structure can cause a lot of confusion.<br />
By the way, I don't need to be reminded of the need for wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=User:Jfdwolff&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500&amp;hideminor=1" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=User:Jfdwolff&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=500&amp;hideminor=1" rel="nofollow">content</a>.<br />

<ul>
<li>Imposition of a hierarchic structure where it does not occur naturally is misleading. Navigational elements are useful when used in moderation and where they grow out of the subject matter, but they are destructive when they proliferate and are used to impose a false order. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:02, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Great. May I suggest we provide links on the pages to the specialisms involved? I would recommend just five: <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgery</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_medicine.html" title="Family medicine">family medicine</a>, <a href="../../../g/y/n/Gynecology.html" title="Gynecology">gynecology</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_medicine.html" title="Internal medicine">internal medicine</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gastroenterology.html" title="Gastroenterology">gastroenterology</a>. It would establish a vertical order without suggesting there's a horizontal one.<br />
By the way, could you define "destructive" and "proliferate"?<br />
<a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff"></a> <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a> | <a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 04:08, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I have no problem with you putting a link <b>to</b> abdominal pain anywhere you think it's pertinent. My problem is with linking <b>from</b> abdominal pain to articles where abdominal pain is only peripherally related. Do you want to mention abdominal pain in the articles you enumerate? If not, I don't think they'd be useful links. I'm using "destructive" and "proliferate" in their usual senses. To elaborate on "destructive", the boxes are destructive in the same way that all overlinking it: it's distracting; linking to an article suggests that pertinent information is to be found there and is wrong if it isn't to be found there; boxes take up visual space allowing fewer on-screen words; mediawiki "menus" imply relationships between subjects that may be unduly narrow or even misleading, and their "premade" format enables rote insertion rather than thoughtful linking. As to "proliferate", I'd say that these boxes are multiplying faster than their utility is. Do you envision a box on every "medical" article? -- <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:31, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Do I envision that? The answer is probably "yes". I agree with you on the narrowness of menu structure; they can impose constraints where these are unwarranted. In this particular article, I agree that lots of boxes would seriously deface the page. There are undoubtedly other examples.<br />
However, many cities, counties and personalities are linked by "blue boxes" just because they happen to have a form of spacial or temporal proximity. Wikipedia seems to be tolerating this quite well, without upsetting layout conventions—even if their structure is premade and quite rigid.<br />

<dl>
<dd>Let's just say I don't share your vision&lt;g&gt;. If you want to add a "See also: <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgery</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_medicine.html" title="Family medicine">family medicine</a>, <a href="../../../g/y/n/Gynecology.html" title="Gynecology">gynecology</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_medicine.html" title="Internal medicine">internal medicine</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gastroenterology.html" title="Gastroenterology">gastroenterology</a>" I'd have no objection. I don't think it's particularly pertinent, but it's less obtrusive. I think you'll find that as more and more of these mediawiki "menus" are used less and less appropriately, there will be more objections made, though I suspect it will be some time before serious consideration is given to their net effect and the fact that a pretty face is being used to conceal particular points of view in places not particularly amenable to editing. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:50, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, I'm finished arguing. My menu effort is certainly not aimed at pushing my (or anyone's) view, apart from creating some sense of unity in Wikipedia's medical segment. And Mediawiki messages can be edited by everybody, including you! Requires no privileges! The "serious consideration" will be given in wiki style: by consensus and debate. The matter of whether navigational elements should be introduced is something for admins and bureaucrats. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff"></a> <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a> | <a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 05:04, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
