<p>As far as your schoolkid soccer buddies are concerned, we have no verification from any independent source that they exist at all. I'm sure they do, but so do six billion other people. The question is whether they merit an article. If they're the best soccer players at their high school, quite frankly no one outside the school cares. If they actually are signed by, and placed on the active roster of, a major professional team, that would be notable. Clearly that hasn't happened yet, because if it does, it will be in the news. If that happens, and they actually apear in major league games, feel free to recreate the articles. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 23:38, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, the normal process is to leave messages on someone's User Talk page (not the User Page). Also, when you leave a message, sign it with four tildes (like this: <b>~~~~</b>). When you Save the page, it gets translated to your name and the date and time. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 18:15, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello there - may I enquire about how you have set-up your userpage? Have you copied it from somewhere else? While it's ok to "borrow" good bits from other people (nice to tell them), it means that some of the information you have on your Userpage is incorrect. For example - unless I am mistaken, you do not have 2,500 edits and you are not approved for the use of Vandalproof.</p>
<p>Do you need some help getting set-up?</p>
<p>If so - let me know on my talkpage.</p>

Yes, you chose "PD-self", a license that claims you made the image yourself, which you clearly didn't. Even if you chose another public domain license, this also would be wrong. Almost anything you see on the Internet or in real life is copyrighten, even if you don't see a (c) symbol near it.

<p>This doesn't change anything on the French page, but for the record, it is pretty clear that Lyonne's mother is Jewish, too. See this at the bottom of the page <a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:bJt5tGnI0vMJ:newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/people/columns/intelligencer/4117/+%22Natasha+Lyonne%22+mother+holocaust&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:bJt5tGnI0vMJ:newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/people/columns/intelligencer/4117/+%22Natasha+Lyonne%22+mother+holocaust&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. She says her mother's parents were Holocaust survivors, with one being in Auschwitz. I kind of doubt that they were from France, though you never know. I have never seen a reliable source that described either Lyonne's mother or (this is the important part for the list) Lyonne herself as French. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 08:28, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A person who would be on a list of French Americans is someone who has been described explicitly as French American (or "French", if they are also "American") by a reliable source. Exactly like the link you just gave me, that mentioned several people were "French Americans". Matt LeBlanc - all I've seen is that he has French ancestry on his father's side, along with many other ancestry groups. I've never seen him described as a French American, I doubt anyone would describe him as that, and I doubt he himself would - but you can prove me wrong on this if you have a quote by him or something. All he has is some distant French ancestry, which is probably nothing but a piece of trivia at this point. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 20:33, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know but "Americans of French descent" is not encyclopedic.

<dd>Yes, a lot of French arrived here a long, long time ago, and mostly 1. faded into mainstream America, so we have a lot of Americans with really distant French roots 2. Became French-Canadians or 3. Became Cajuns. That's why there aren't a lot of just "French Americans" <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 19:18, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

I'm sure that <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_American_3c30.html" title="French American">French American</a> can be vastly expanded. From noting the early history to the evolution of the French in America - the creation of the Cajun communities, etc. - you get the idea.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:ALaroche.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently specifies that the image is unlicensed for use on Wikipedia and may only be used on Wikipedia under a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">claim of fair use</a>. However, the image is currently <a href="../../../o/_/_/WP%7EO_c91c.html" title="WP:O">orphaned</a>, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">You may add it back</a> if you think that that will be useful.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Abdelkweli_b496.html" title="Special:Contributions/Abdelkweli">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images not used in any <b>articles</b> will be deleted after seven days, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.
