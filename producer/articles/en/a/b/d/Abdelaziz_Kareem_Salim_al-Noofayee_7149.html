<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>Al Noofayee's Personal Representative summarized Al Noofayee's response to the allegations from his interview with him:</p>
<ul>
<li>Al Noofayee acknowledged traveling to Pakistan, for medical treatment. He traveled to Pakistan prior to <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001.html" title="September 11, 2001">September 11, 2001</a>, his travel documents were perfectly in order, and he has never traveled to Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Al Noofayee acknowledged being captured in a guesthouse. Al Noofayee went to the guesthouse when he heard the Pakistani police were randomly arresting Arabs.</li>
<li>Al Noofayee said that he had no knowledge of the political affiliation, or anything else, about the other guests, except that they seemed busy reciting the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koran.html" title="Koran">Koran</a>. The guesthouse was recommended to him by the <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tablighi_Jamaat_db7d.html" title="Tablighi Jamaat">Tabligh</a> organization.</li>
<li>Al Noofayee acknowledged he had worn a Casio watch. He didn't know whether it was a F91W. He didn't understand how a watch could implicate him in terrorism. He pointed out it was a very common watch, and that many of the Guantanamo guards wore the same kind of watch.</li>
<li>Al Noofayee denied that he had received training at the Khalden training camp in 1997. He had never heard of the Khalden training camp prior to his capture, and, he repeated that he had never traveled to Afghanistan.</li>

<ul>
<li>Al Noofayee said he was about 27 years old, that he considered himself a student, but that he had graduated from high school at 19, and between graduating and traveling to Pakistan he had worked elling vegetables in a bazaar -- the heavy labor for which he blamed his back problems.</li>
<li>Al Noofayee denied ever receiving any kind of military training.</li>
<li>Al Noofayee could not name a particular incident that triggered his back trouble.</li>
<li>The outpatient medical treatment Al Noofayee was receiving in Pakistan was bi-weekly massages and "tablets".</li>

<p>The Tribunal's President asked questions to establish the timeline from Al Noofayee's arrival in Pakistan, until his capture.</p>
<p>Al Noofayee said he had arrived in Pakistan approximately two weeks prior to the terrorist attacks of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001.html" title="September 11, 2001">September 11, 2001</a>. He said that the Pakistani government started arresting all Arabs.

They recommended the guest house were he was eventually captured. He didn't know that some of the other guests were members of al Qaeda. He kept to himself and didn't interact with them.</p>

<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
