<p>Umm Sahabah 05-27-2004 09:06 AM The prophet's aunties</p>
<p>Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh,</p>
<p>Here is a little something from a very beloved sister of mine, i pray that we all benefit from this and May Allah reward her tremendously Ameen...</p>
<p><a name=".3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D.3D_.3D.3D"></a></p>
<h6><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/d/Talk%7EAbd-Allah_ibn_Jahsh_4aa1.html" title="Edit section: ============================================ ==">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">============================================ ==</span></h6>
<p>We hear a lot about uncles of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallam but not much about his aunties. So here is a little something (source Tabaqaat of ibn Sa’d)</p>
<p>1) Barrah bint 'Abdul muttalib(she is not mentioned as being muslim in Isaabah or Usdul Ghaabah. Where it is said only 2 of the aunts of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam became Muslim, Arwaa and Safiyah)</p>
<p>She is full sister of 'Abdullah the father of the prophet sallaahu alayhi wa sallam. Their mother is Fatimah bint 'Amr ibn Aa’idh ibn 'Imran ibn Makhzum.</p>
<p>She had 2 sons who were Shaheed at badr:</p>
<p>1) Abi Salamah ibn `Abdul Asad ibn Hilaal ibn `Abdullah ibn `Umar ibn Makhzum, from Bani Makhzum. He did Hijrah to Abyssinia. He was married to Umm Salamah bint Abi Umayyah ibn al-Mugheerah ibn `Abdullah ibn `Umar ibn Makhzum who became the wife of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam.</p>
<p>2) Abi Sabrah ibn Abi Ruhm ibn `Abdul `Uzzah from Bani 'Amir ibn Lu'ayy. He did Hijrah to Abyssinia. He was married to the Umm Kulthum bint Suhayl ibn 'Amr (he is brother of Sakraan ibn 'Amr the husband of Sawdah bint Zam'ah Ummul Mu'mineen). He was also milk brother to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam as they were both breast fed by Thuwaybah the freed slave of Abu Lahab, their uncle.</p>
<p>Her second husband Abi Ruhm ibn 'Abdu 'Uzzah was also married to Maymunah bint al-Haarith who also later married the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam.</p>
<p>So her son and her husband had wives who later became Ummul Mu’mineen.</p>
<p>We can see how closely the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam was related to Bani Makhzum and also the connections between him and umm Salamah who was the widow of his first cousin.</p>
<ul>
<li>An interesting connection: Abi Umayyah had several wives, one of whom was 'Atikah bint 'Abdul Muttalib. She had 3 children to him: Quraybah (probably the elder as he has 2 daughters named Quraybah) 'Abdullah and Zuhayr ibn Abi Umayyah.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that means that 3 of Umm Salamah's brothers and sisters were first cousins of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam by their mother. Whilst her husband Abi Salamah was the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa salaam’s first cousin.</p>
<p>It is to be noted again that the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallam was also connected to Bani Makhzum by his grandmother, one of the wives of 'Abdul Muttalib she is: Fatimah bint 'Amr ibn 'Aa’idh ibn 'Imran ibn Makhzum.</p>
<p>So it appears to be implausible the comments often made by some authors that Umm Salamah was married to connect the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam with Bani Makhzum, as he is already from that tribe through his grandmother. Lineage through the father is the tribal norm however they also kept the lineages of the mothers as tribal links as well. There’s hadeeth regarding the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam commenting on his "tribe" Bani an-Najjar (al-Ansar) from the female lineage and there are other references in hadeeth to this practice of including female lineages.</p>
<p>Umm Sahabah 05-30-2004 09:06 AM Re: The prophet's aunties</p>
<p>2) Al-Baydha' - Umm Hakeem bint 'Abdul Muttalib - She is the TWIN sister of 'Abdullah the father of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallam (mentioned by ibn Hazm in gathering the tribes of the Arabs). She is full sister of Barrah bint 'Abdul Muttalib, as her mother is also Fatimah bint 'Amr ibn Aa’idh ibn 'Imran ibn Makhzum.</p>
<ul>
<li>A point of interest is her name Al-Baydha'. When you consider that 'Abdul Muttalib’s real name is Shaybah and he was called Shaybah because he was born with white hair.</li>
</ul>
<p>Her husband was: Kurayz ibn Rabee'ah ibn Habeeb ibn 'Abdu shams.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that 'Abdu Shams is the TWIN brother of Hashim who is the father of 'Abdul Muttalib and great grandfather of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallam. Abdu shams was the oldest out of all of them. His son Umayyah ibn 'Abdu Shams is the cousin of 'Abdul Muttalib and the head of Bani Umayyad (the tribe of 'Uthman ibn 'Affan and also Abi Sufyan ibn Harb and Mu’awiyah and Umm Habibah bint Abi Sufyan).</p>
<p>Children: They are all first cousins of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallam</p>
<p>'Amir ibn Kurayz Talhah ibn Kurayz Umm Talhah bint Kurayz</p>
<p>Arwaa' bint Kurayz - she had two husbands: 'Affan ibn Abi Al 'As ibn Umayyah ibn 'Abdu shams</p>
<p>She had 2 children: Aminah bint 'Affan 'Uthman ibn 'Affan - Ameer ul Mu’mineen and son in law twice of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p>He is also first cousin once removed to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam. So Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum were his 2nd cousins.</p>
<p>Second husband of Arwaa bint Kurayz the daughter of Al-Baydha' bint 'Abdul Muttalib was: ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt</p>
<p>Children: Al-Waleed ibn ‘Uqbah Khalid ibn ‘Uqbah Umm Kulthum bint ‘Uqbah.</p>
<p>This is an extremely interesting part of the family of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam so many different connections and includes some of the best of people and some who are not.</p>
<p>‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt is one of the latter. He is famous or rather infamous for his many insults and hatred towards the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam, who was his cousin by marriage.</p>
<p>Ibn Hisham in his Seerah narrates:</p>
<p>Umayyah ibn Khalaf ibn Wahb ibn Hudhaafah and ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt were close friends. Now ‘Uqbah had sat and listened to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam and when Umayyah came to know of this he came to him and said, "Do I hear that you have sat with Muhammad and listened to him? I swear I will never see you or speak with you again (and he swore a great oath) if you do the same again, or if you do not go and spit in his face." Uqbah the enemy of Allah, actually did this, May Allah curse him. So Allah sent down this verse concerning the pair of them: - “And (remember) the Day when the Zaalim (wrongdoer, oppressor, polytheist) will bite his hands, he will say: "Oh! Would that I had taken the path with the Messenger. "Ah! Woe to me! Would that I had never taken so-and-so as a Khaleel (an intimate friend). He indeed led me astray from the reminder (this Qur’an) after it had come to me. And shaytan is to man ever a deserter in the hour of need.” (Surah 25 Al-Furqaan Ayahs 27-28-29)</p>
<p>'Abdullah ibn Abi Najeeh narrated to (ibn Hisham) that Umayyah ibn Khalaf had decided to stay at home (from badr) He was a stately old man, corpulent and heavy. ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt came to him as he was sitting in the haram amongst his companions, carrying a censer with some burning scented wood. He put it in front of him and said, “Scent yourself with that, for you belong with the women!” Umayyah said, “God curse you and that you have brought.” And then got ready to leave with them (for Badr). (Ibn Hisham’s Seerah p 291) Umayyah ibn Khalaf the Khaleel (Friend) of ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt was killed on the day of Badr by Bilal in retaliation for the torture he inflicted upon him.</p>
<p>As for ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt he was taken prisoner the day of Badr along with al Nadr ibn al Haarith ibn 'Al-Qamah ibn Kaladah ibn 'Abdu Manaaf. When the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam and the companions reached al Safraa' al Nadr was killed by 'Ali ibn Abi Talib and when they reached 'Irqu'l Dhabya ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt was killed on the orders of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi was sallam.</p>
<p>Also in Bukhari on the authority of ‘Abdullah ibn Mas’uud who narrated that once when the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallam was prostrating himself while praying in al-Ka’bah Abu Jahl asked his companions to bring the dirty foetus of a she camel and place it on his back. ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt was the unfortunate man who hastened to do this ignoble act. The prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam invoked the wrath of Allah upon them…Sahih al Bukhari 1/37</p>
<p>According to ibn Hisham he was killed by 'Asim ibn Thabit al-Ansaree. But ibn Ishaaq does not name the place where he was killed and he says ‘Uqbah was killed by 'Ali ibn Abi Talib this is from az-Zuhree and others.</p>
<p>There are many issues relating to Muslims from the Seerah that have continued relevance to Muslims of today. Here we see two of the enemies of Allah and His messenger BOTH executed after the battle of Badr.</p>
<p>As to the children of ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt and 'Arwaa bint Kurayz they are half siblings to 'Uthman ibn 'Affan and also as mentioned before 1st cousins once removed to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam.</p>
<p>As we have seen in many families many noble companions had the worst of kufaar for a parent/parents and here we see:</p>
<p>Umm Kulthum bint ‘Uqbah, she is one of the noblest of the Sahabiyat and from the ones who did Hijrah. Ibn Hisham mentions her: Umm Kulthum bint ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt migrated to the messenger during this period (Hudaibiyah). Her two brothers Umarah and al-Waleed the 2 sons of ‘Uqbah came and asked the messenger of Allah sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam to return her to them in accordance with the agreement between him and the Quraysh at Hudaibiyah 6AH but he would not. Allah forbade it. Surat Al Mumtahanah -60 -10 was revealed concerning her: “O you who believe! When believing women come to you as emigrants, examine them: Allah knows best as to their faith, then if you ascertain that they are true believers. Send them not back to the disbelievers. They are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them.”</p>
<p>Umm Kulthum bint ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt was married 4 times. She first married: Zayd ibn Harithah on the order of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallam (he had other wives. He had previously been married to Zaynab bint Jahsh the 1st cousin of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi was sallam). He was killed Shaheed the day of Mu’tah 8AH</p>
<p>She then married: Az-Zubayr ibn al ‘Awwam he is also a 1st cousin to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallam from his mother Safiyah the half sister of ‘Abdullah and full sister of Hamzah (Az-Zubayr is also the nephew of Khadijah). He divorced her. She then married ‘Abdur Rahman ibn ‘Awf he divorced her. Then ‘Amr ibn Al ‘As she died whilst married to him.</p>
<p>In this as in others we see the depth of commitment to Islam and the walaa wal baraa of these best of muslims towards even those who their close relatives.</p>
<p>Umm Sahabah 06-25-2004 06:57 PM Re: The prophet's aunties</p>
<p>3) Safiyah bint ‘Abdul Muttalib ibn Hashim ibn ‘Abdu Manaaf ibn Qusayy ibn Kilaab.</p>
<p>She accepted Islam by bayah (pledge) and she did Hijrah to Madinah. She died during the caliphate of ‘Umar ibn Al Khattab and is buried in Baqi cemetery in Madinah.</p>
<p>She is the full sister of Hamzah ibn ‘Abdul Muttalib by their mother. She is: Halaah bint Wahayb ibn ‘Abdu Manaaf ibn Zuhrah ibn Kilaab, the sister of Abi Waqqas (Malik) ibn Wahayb, and the aunt of Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas. Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas is one of the ten promised paradise in his lifetime; and ‘Umayr ibn Abi Waqqas who was killed Shaheed the day of badr aged 16 years; and ‘Amir ibn Abi Waqqas. And also we have amongst the worst of men ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqas who was the one who injured the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam the day of Uhud. He was with the Mushrikeen.</p>
<p>Also sister of: Nawfal ibn Wahayb the father of Makhramah ibn Nawfal.</p>
<p>Halaah bint Wahayb is cousin to Aminah bint Wahb ibn ‘Abdu Manaaf ibn Zuhrah, the mother of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam and wife of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abdul Muttalib (they were married at the same time). And also cousin to the brother of Aminah bint Wahb, Abdu Yaghuuth ibn Wahb (uncle of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam) the father of al-Aswad ibn Abi Yaghuuth, cousin of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam, the one who mocked the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam and was cursed by him.</p>
<p>From this, we note that Hamzah and Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas are 1st cousins and that Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas is 2nd cousin to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam and that Hamzah ibn ‘Abdul Muttalib is uncle on fathers side and 2nd cousin on mothers side to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam. And he is also brother (by breastfeeding) as they were both breast fed by Thuwaybah the freed slave of Abi Lahab (‘Abdul ‘Uzzah ibn ‘Abdul Muttalib).</p>
<p>Safiyyah bint ‘Abdul Muttalib was first married to: Al-Haarith ibn Harb ibn Umayyah ibn ‘Abdu shams ibn Qusayy. He is the brother of Abi Sufyan ibn Harb and uncle of Umm Habibah bint Abi Sufyan Ummul Mu’mineen and Mu’awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan Amirul Mu’mineen. She had a son to him.</p>
<p>She then married: Al ‘Awwam ibn Khuwaylid ibn Asad ibn ‘Abdul ‘Uzzah ibn Qusayy. He is the brother of Khadijah bint Khuwaylid Ummul Mu’mineen, the 1st wife of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam. So this makes Safiyyah the sister in law of Khadijah.</p>
<p>He is also brother of Hizaam/Hazm ibn Khuwaylid whose son Hakeem was born in the Ka’bah and lived 60 years in Jahiliyyah and 60 years in Islam and whose other son Khalid died whilst on Hijrah to Abyssinia.</p>
<p>And Nawfal ibn Khuwaylid who was called the lion of the Quraysh (Asad ul Quraysh) He was killed by his nephew az-Zubayr ibn Al ‘Awwam on the day of Badr whilst he was with the Mushrikeen (his great grandson ‘Abdur Rahman ibn Nawfal ibn Al-Aswad ibn Nawfal was killed while he was fighting with ‘Abdullah ibn az Zubayr the son of the man who killed his great grandfather).</p>
<p>Halaah bint Khuwaylid, the sister of al-Awwam and also the sister of Khadijah is the mother of Abi Al ‘As ibn Rabee’ah, the husband of Zaynab bint Muhammad sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam and Khadijah. Zaynab and Abi Al’As are 1st cousins.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Al-Awwam had other wives and at least another 10 children by them, one of them ‘Ubaydullaah ibn Al-Awwam was killed day of badr whilst with the Mushrikeen. And another of them Bukhayr ibn Al ‘Awwam was killed in Jahiliyyah by Subayh ibn Sa’d ibn Hani the grandfather of Abu Hurayrah.</p>
<p>Safiyah gave birth to 3 children to him: As-Saa’ib ibn Al ‘Awwam. He witnessed the battle of Khandaq (the trench) and was killed Shaheed the day of Yamamah 12AH ‘Abdul Ka’bah ibn Al ‘Awwam. The prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam changed his name to ‘Abdur Rahman on his conversion to islam. He was killed shaheed the day of Al Yarmuk in the caliphate of Abi Bakr. He had 2 sons: ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abdur Rahman, he was killed the “day of the house” with ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan. And ‘Ubaydullaah ibn ‘Abdur Rahman who was killed the day of Siffeen whilst with Muawiyah.</p>
<p>Az Zubayr ibn Al’Awwam is one of the ten promised paradise in his lifetime. He is called the Hawaaree ‘the disciple’ of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallam. He is 1st cousin to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam by his mother and he is also a nephew of Khadijah and the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam (by marriage) from his fathers side. He is also 1st cousin to the children of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam (Ruqayyah, Zaynab, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah).</p>
<p>He was aged 29 on the day of badr. He was killed Shaheed the day of Jamal. He was one of the leaders of the army under Aishah Ummul Mu’mineen (the other was Talhah ibn ‘Ubaydullaah, he also is one of the ten promised paradise). Az Zubayr was aged 64 years when he was killed.</p>
<p>One of his wives was Asmaa’ bint Abi Bakr who is the mother of ‘Abdullah ibn Az Zubayr. He was also married to Umm Kulthum bint ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt the daughter of Arwaa’ bint Kurayz the daughter of Safiyah sister of Al Baydha’ bint ‘Abdul Muttalib. Az-Zubayr had at least 20 children by his various wives and Umm Walads.</p>
<p>Az Zubayr is the father of ‘Abdullah ibn az Zubayr, he was called Ameer ul Mu’mineen until he was killed day of al-Harrah in Mecca, 63 AH.</p>
<p>Az Zubayr ibn Al’Awwam said, “And verily Talhah ibn ‘Ubaydullaah ibn at Taymee named his children after the names of prophets (It is known that there is no prophet after Muhammad) Verily I name my children after the names of the Shuhaadah in the hope that they will ALL die Shaheed.”</p>
<p>This is compiled from Isaabah by ibn hajr and the Tabaqaat of ibn Sa’d and Usdul Ghaabah by ibn Katheer and gathering the tribes of the Arabs by ibn Hazm.</p>
<p>Umm Sahabah 07-10-2004 02:26 PM Re: The prophet's aunties</p>
<p>4) She is Umamah (Tabaqaat) and they say she is Umayyah (Isaabah) bint 'Abdul Muttalib ibn Hashim ibn 'Abdu Manaaf ibn Qusayy ibn Kilaab ibn Murrah ibn Ka’b ibn Lu’ayy ibn Ghaalib ibn Fihr ibn Malik ibn an Nadr ibn Kinaanah ibn Khuzaymah.</p>
<p>Fihr, he is Quraysh, so the descendants who come from him are all called Quraysh. The tribes of Bani Kinaanah and Khuzaymah are before him and are not called Quraysh, but as you can see they are all from the same lineage.</p>
<p>She is full sister to 'Abdullah and the other sisters except for Safiyah who has a different mother.</p>
<p>The mother of Umaamah/Umaymah is: Fatimah bint 'Amr ibn Aa’idh ibn 'Imran ibn Makhzum.</p>
<p>Umaamah was married in Jahiliyyah to: Jahsh ibn Ri'aab ibn Ya'mur ibn Sabirah ibn Murrah ibn Kabeer ibn Ghanm ibn Duudaan ibn Barrah ibn Asad ibn Khuzaymah. He was an ally (Haleef) of Bani Umayyah ibn Shams.</p>
<p>Children: 'Abdullah ibn Jahsh. He is amongst the early Muslims He was of those who did Hijrah to Abyssinia and Ahlul Badr (the people of Badr). His sword was broken on the day of Uhud.</p>
<p>He was amongst those killed Shaheed the day of Uhud. He was killed by Abi al-Hakam ibn Akhnas ibn Sharif ath-Thaqafi and he was buried with his uncle Hamzah ibn 'Abdul Muttalib. He was 40 years old when he was killed Shaheed. There was a brotherhood in Islam between him and 'Asim ibn Thabit al Ansaree.</p>
<p>‘Abdullah ibn Jahsh was married to: Zaynab bint Khuzaymah al-Hilaliyah. Her previous husbands were:</p>
<p>1: At-Tufayl ibn al-Haarith ibn ‘al-Muttalib ibn ‘Abdu Manaaf ibn Qusayy. He divorced her and she then married his brother. It is to be noted that Al-Muttalib is brother of Hashim the father of 'Abdul Muttalib, so they are 2nd cousins of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam. At-Tufayl is also Ahl badr as is his brother Al-Husayn ibn al-Haarith.</p>
<p>2: 'Ubaydah ibn al Haarith - When he was in Mecca he was the head of Bani ‘Abdu Manaaf with Al’Abbas. He was killed Shaheed the day of Badr. He was one of the three (Hamzah and 'Ali were the others) who opened the fighting the day of badr. He was older than Hamzah and ‘Ali.</p>
<p>He was fighting 'Utbah ibn Rabee’ah and he was seriously wounded but before he fell Hamzah killed 'Utbah and cut off his head, they carried 'Ubaydah back to their camp but he died several days later Shaheed. According to ibn Hisham in his Seerah, after he was brought off the battlefield they brought him to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam and the marrow was oozing from his severed leg, he said “Am I not a martyr, O Messenger of Allah?” “Indeed you are,” he sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam replied. It is to be noted that ‘Utbah ibn Rabee’ah ibn ‘Abdu Shams is 2nd cousin of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam.</p>
<p>I have found 2 daughters to him, Khadijah bint ‘Ubaydah and Safiyah bint ‘Ubaydah. Insha’Allah I will try to find the name of their mother as it does not mention if she is Zaynab bint Khuzaymah or if they are children of another wife.</p>
<p>We should remember the noble situation of Zaynab bint Khuzaymah in this. She is blessed with being married to ‘Ubaydah ibn Al-Haarith who was testified as being killed Shaheed by the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam whilst he was fatally injured the day of badr and then she was married to ‘Abdullah ibn Jahsh who was killed Shaheed the day of Uhud and was buried with his uncle Hamzah. She then was blessed with the marriage to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam (there is differing over the dates) 31 months after Hijrah and she died 39 months after Hijrah aged approx 30 years (according to ibn Sa’d in Tabaqaat) and died in his lifetime. She was married to him before the marriage of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam to Umm Salamah as Umm Salamah moved into Zaynab bint Khuzaymah’s room (Isaabah). Zaynab is half sister Maymunah bint Al-Haarith Ummul Mu’mineen by their mother, Hind bint Awf.</p>
<p>‘Ubaydullaah ibn Jahsh - He was amongst the early Muslims. He did Hijrah to Abyssinia with his wife where he apostated to Christianity and died on that.</p>
<p>His wife: Umm Habibah-Ramlah bint Abi Sufyan ibn Harb ibn Sakhr ibn Umayyah ibn ‘Abdu Shams ibn Abd Manaaf.</p>
<p>Her mother is Safiyah bint Abi Al ‘As ibn Umayyah ibn ‘Abdu Shams. She is the aunt of ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan ibn Abi Al ‘As. So ‘Uthman and Umm Habibah were 1st cousins on mothers side and 2nd cousins by her fathers side.</p>
<p>Umm Habibah married the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam in 7A.H aged 30 years. She died 44 A.H in the caliphate of Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan.</p>
<p>She has a daughter to him named Habibah bint Umm Habibah bint Abi Sufyan (this is how she is named in Isaabah). Her father is ‘Ubaydullaah ibn Jahsh. She married Dawud ibn ‘Urwah ibn Mas’uud ath-Thaqafi</p>
<p>She is the sister of Muawiyah. His mother is Hind bint ‘Utbah ibn Rabee’ah. He is the one who killed ‘Ubaydah ibn al Haarith before he was then killed by Hamzah ibn ‘Abdul Muttalib. She also married the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam after the death of her husband ‘Ubaydullaah.</p>
<p>Abu Ahmad ibn Jahsh - His name was ‘Abdu. He was amongst the early Muslims and from those who did Hijrah to Abyssinia and he did Hijrah to Madinah with his brother ‘Abdullah after the Hijrah of Abi Salamah his cousin. He was blind and was a poet. He used to go all around Mecca without anyone to lead him even though he was blind. The house of Bani Jahsh was left empty after their Hijrah they stayed in the house of Mubashir ibn ‘Abdul Mundhir ibn Zanbar in Qubaa’ among the Bani ‘Amr ibn ‘Awf. He died after his sister Zaynab bint Jahsh Ummul Mu’mineen 20 AH.</p>
<p>His wife: Al-Faar’ah bint Abi Sufyan ibn Harb the sister of Umm Habibah bint Abi Sufyan ibn Harb (although there seems to be differing over her being his wife or the wife of ‘Abdullah ibn Jahsh Insha’Allah I will check further this is discussed in usdul ghaabah by ibn atheer, in isaabah it says she did hijrah with ‘Abdullah ibn Jahsh and his brother Abu Ahmad and he was her husband.)</p>
<p>Child: ‘Abdullah ibn Abi Ahmad.</p>
<p>So here we have 2 of Abi Sufyan ibn Harb’s daughters married to cousins of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallam. This shows the close connection between these families that already existed BEFORE the marriage of Umm Habibah to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam. If you remember from the previous posts Abu Sufyan is a distant cousin (‘Abdu shams and Hashim were twins), so the Umayyads were closely linked to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p>The daughters of Umaymah/Umamah are according to a report in Isaabah ALL called Zaynab but they used Laqabs such as Umm Habeebah/Habeebah and Hamnah</p>
<p>Umm Habeeb bint Jahsh - She is listed as Habibah bint Jahsh (in Isaabah). She is the full sister of Zaynab bint Jahsh and she is almusthaadah. There are narrations regarding this from ‘Urwah from ‘Aishah that Umm Habibah bint Jahsh was istuhaydah (continuous bleeding) for seven years.</p>
<p>Husband: ‘Abdur Rahman ibn ‘Awf. He had other wives one of whom he married in Jahiliyyah was Umm Kulthum bint ‘Utbah the sister of Hind bint Utbah ibn Rabee’ah ibn ‘Abdu Shams ibn ‘Abdu Manaaf, so she is aunt of Mu’awiyah. He was also married to Umm Kulthum bint ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt ibn Abi ‘Amr ibn Umayyah ibn ‘Abdu Shams ibn ‘Abdu Manaaf the daughter of Arwaa’ bint Kurayz the daughter of Al-Baydha’ bint ‘Abdul Muttalib.</p>
<p>Hamnah bint Jahsh - She is from those who made bayah (Pledge) and witnessed Uhud (Isaabah). She was also mentioned in hadeeth as istuhaydah (continuous bleeding) She was married to Mus’ab ibn ‘Umayr who was killed Shaheed the day of Uhud. And had a daughter to him.</p>
<p>He was the standard bearer of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam the day of Uhud (he was holding the standard in his right hand and it was cut off, then he held it in his left and that was cut off too, he then knelt and shielded it with his neck and chest. It was then he was killed by ibn Qami’a al-Laythee who mistook him for the prophet Salla-llahu alayhi wa sallaam as he looked like the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallam after he killed him he went back to the Quraysh and said I have killed Muhammad. It was the shout from him saying he had killed Muhammad that caused consternation amongst the Muslims during the battle. After he was killed Shaheed the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam gave the standard to ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib.</p>
<p>There is a hadeeth referring to her after the battle of Uhud when she came to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam. This is narrated by ibn Hisham in his Seerah: “Then the messenger of Allah sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam went back on his way to medina and there he met Hamnah bint Jahsh. As she met the army she was told of the death of her brother ‘Abdullah ibn Jahsh and she exclaimed, “We belong to Allah and to Allah we will return” and asked forgiveness for him. Then she was told of the death of her uncle Hamzah and she uttered the same words. Then she was told of the death of her husband Mus’ab ibn ‘Umayr and she shrieked and wailed. The messenger of Allah sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam said “The woman’s husband holds a special place with her, as you can see from the self control at the death of her brother and her uncle and her shrieking over her husband.”</p>
<p>She then married Talhah ibn ‘Ubaydullaah and had 2 children to him: Muhammad ibn Talhah he was known as as-Sujjaad (the prostrator) he was killed with his father on the day of Jamal. ‘Imran ibn Talhah and possibly a third (Insha’Allah I need to check for his/her name) She was amongst those who was involved in the affair of ifk in 6AH and she was flogged 80 times along with Mistah ibn Athaathah and Hasan ibn Thabit for their part in spreading the gossip against ‘Aishah Ummul Mu’mineen. It is to be remembered that Mistah ibn Athaathah is ahl badr and that all three repented for what they had said.</p>
<p>Zaynab bint Jahsh - She was married to: Zayd ibn Harithah and he divorced her. She was then married to the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam by Allah’s orders in 3AH or they say 5AH. She was the first of the wives of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam to die after him. She died 20 AH and her funeral prayer was led by ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab. She is buried in Baq’ee in Madinah.</p>
<p>Usaamah ibn Zayd ibn Harithah, Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Jahsh and ‘Abdullah ibn Abi Ahmad ibn Jahsh put her in her grave. She was the first woman who had a bier made for her (Usdul Ghaabah).</p>
<p>Here is another aunt and in this family are some amazing examples of how Allah truly is the changer of hearts. We think we have difficulties because our families are either not practicing or we have problems because we are reverts. We should keep in mind that these are the family of the prophet sallaallaahu alayhi wa sallaam. Insha’Allah we can gain some benefit from knowing more about the men and women around the messenger of Allah.</p>
