<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<li>Al Tamini acknowledged attending a speech given by Osama bin Laden.</li>
<li>Al Tamini corrected the allegation that he observed the number of recruits growing substantially while he was at the camp. He acknowledged noticing more recruits, but after he left the camp.

<li>Al Tamini acknowledged serving on the front lines.</li>
<li>Al Tamini acknowledged carrying a weapon while on the front lines -- but not the full list in the allegations -- just an AK-47. When asked -- <i>"Was there anybody to fight on the front lines?"</i> -- Al Tamini replied: <i>"None. We were in bunkers and just shooting."</i></li>
<li>Al Tamini denied being captured with a group that included Osama bin Laden bodyguards. He said he traveled to Pakistan with two men. When he was turned over to the Americans he was added to another group of captives, which included the Osama bin Laden bodyguards.</li>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
<p>There is no record of Al Tamini participating in his First Annual Administrative Review Board hearing.</p>

<p>Detainees whose Combatant Status Review Tribunal confirmed their original classification as enemy combatnats have the value of continuing to detain them at Guantanamo reviewed on an annual basis. The <i><a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a></i> offered an account of the Second Administrative Review Board hearing of a young Saudi named <b>Abdul-Razzaq</b>. <sup id="_ref-Bbc061018_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bbc061018" title="">[4]</a></sup> Guantanamo contained about half a dozen detainees named <b>Abdul-Razzaq</b>, or something similar. but Al Tamini is the only one who is a Saudi. The detainee the BBC identified as Abdul-Razzaq said:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"I was 17-years-old and full of enthusiasm for jihad, but now after five years in Guantanamo I have changed. I need to go back to my country, lead a simple life care for my old parents and have a wife and kids."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The <i>BBC</i> reports that the detainee told his Board that two of his brothers were died during jihad, one in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chechnya.html" title="Chechnya">Chechnya</a>, and one in Afghanistan, while a third brother was captured at the same time he was.</p>
<p>According to the <i>BBC</i> his Board promised to investigate when he reported:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"...that some of the evidence presented to the board - especially evidence kept from detainees - is false or was taken under pressure or psychological torture."</i></dd>
