<dd>I would argue that it is very neutral in tone. The perspective may come from persons who engage in ABDL play, but from different angles with different interpretations of it. There are, in several points, at least two points of view: One user has described things from the POV of a 'daddy', the other from the POV of an AB. There will of course be many others.

<li>The community uses the items described in the pages. That's the relevance. Dangling babies doesn't have much to do with a diaper. A person with a diaper fetish has alot to do with a diaper.

<p>Show me where underrepresenting a minority, or deleting all references to it is considered NPOV. Let's talk about acceptable behaviour. Is it acceptable for you to delete references to a minority simply because it's easier than to do the same for the majority? Perhaps you should delete references to ethnic minorities while you're at it. Or religious ones. Explain to me again how the size of the community justifies you're actions? Sure, I'll agree on neutral ground. I won't mischaracterize your community as an 'albino alligator' or a freakshow if you don't do the same to mine. Sound fair? I believe some folks consider that to be civility. Incidentally, are you on some sort of crusade?

To compare the adult baby community to an ethnic community is a obvious <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>, and as such I will not address it. The relevance of the <i>size</i> of the community goes to it's encyclopedic value, and true representations thereof. Please review the arguments I've presented above, follow the links provided to relevant discussions and guidelines, and generally <i>calm down</i>. There is no value judgement here. I'll use yet another example: if someone made an article entry for the "Northern Idaho Potato Haters Club" and linked it to the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potato.html" title="Potato">potato</a> article, it would be deleted as not relevant to the potato as a whole entity. You'll notice I've made a large number of changes to articles in this area, please review the reasoning I've provided in each instance.<br />

<li>What if my baby doesn't want to listen to me and be a good AB?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This can be as stressfull as having a real baby or more so; but this could also be a sign the baby wishes to have another activity; spanking is very intimate as well as it puts the trust from your AB into your hands (pun not intended) and lets them be more submissive. Even if your AB doesnt want a spanking, try it any ways if they are stepping out of line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It should however be remembered that in many cases infantilism occurs in persons who were in childhood subject to physical or emotional abuse. Therefore, it is best to ask the AB person before making the assumption that physical punishments such as spanking would be pleasurable for that person. Such punishments may in fact be very unpleasant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The human mind is very creative, Parents have throughout the millenia used a variety of means to discipline their wayward children. If your AB does not enjoy corporal punishment, try making them stand in the corner, send them to bed early or simply raise your voice.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Playing with your AB can be quite fulfilling for both you and your AB. Simply playing around with blocks spelling words can mean the world to your AB. Holding your AB and feeding them is also a good activity as it strengthens the bond between an AB and a partner. Reading your AB a story and putting them down to sleep or take a nap is also a very fulfilling activity. Games such as patty-cake and peek-a-boo, nursery rhymes and tickle or pillow fights are also highly suggested.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is POV and/or How-To, and thus non-encyclopedic. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 04:48, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You know what? So far I've seen a whole lot of Aaron Brennerman requesting this page be deleted, and trying to pare it down gradually into near non-existence, deleting links to it from other pages, etc etc. but almost no one excpet myself trying to save this page from this man's attempts to get rid of it. I'm not getting into an ego contest with anyone. But unless someone else is willing to show that they want to keep the page here, well, I guess I'm not going to bother with it. Go ahead, Aaron.

I just saw what is going on myself. Aron, back off, this is a multiple point of veiw entry and what has been said is fact. This page was opened to cut down on the size of the infantilism article and this page contains psychological information. What has been said bcan be compared to "being burned is painfull".</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>There is nothing "going on" here. Have a look at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman">my edits</a> and you'll see that there is no "crusade", just desire for NPOV. And the line <i>"Even if your AB doesnt want a spanking, try it any ways if they are stepping out of line"</i> is clearly POV.</li>

<p>Honestly, your attitude though has been a bit out of line, I do not know why though, nor do I care. Being offensive does bias my reaction to the subject of NPOV, but you started out by deleting sections -WITHOUT- coming to the talk page and pointing out the sections. Just saying it is not NPOV is not enough, please support what you say or you will not likely be believed or considered. Yes, you do have a point, but the article about ABDL is supposed to give practical information. I will delete part of the article though so you will be happy. --<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_44d2.html" title="User:OrbitOne">OrbitOne</a> 11:36, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Then start deleting parts of the wikipedia entrys without enough good reasons.</p>

<p>Playing with your AB can be quite fulfilling for both you and your AB. Simply playing around with blocks spelling words can mean the world to your AB. Holding your AB and feeding them is also a good activity as it strengthens the bond between an AB and a partner. Reading your AB a story and putting them down to sleep or take a nap is also a very fulfilling activity. Games such as patty-cake and peek-a-boo, nursery rhymes and tickle or pillow fights are also highly suggested.</p>
<ol>
<li>The use of the phrase "your AB" is POV. Is presumes that the reader of this page <i>has</i> a partner who wishes to be an "Adult Baby".</li>
<li>The phrase "can mean the world" is <i>advocacy</i> not reporting.</li>
<li>The phrase "a good activity" is an opinion, not a fact.</li>
<li>Etc, etc.</li>

<p>It appears that your desire is to have Wikipedia serve <i>your</i> needs, and the needs of your community, not the reverse. I am unhappy with by your attitude, your agression, your apparent disregard for the conventions and practices of Wikipedia. I propose that we take this to either <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28miscellaneous%29_ea61.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)">Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a>.<br />

<p>No, actually, you are the first person to actually point out -any- sentence that isnt NPOV and I agree with you. What has pissed me off though are users attack the page due to their beliefe that ABDL is sick so I have become over protective. Thankyou for pointing out the POV sentences in the article. <small>(Unsigned comment by 80.62.170.94. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 13:17, 27 July 2005 (UTC))</small></p>
