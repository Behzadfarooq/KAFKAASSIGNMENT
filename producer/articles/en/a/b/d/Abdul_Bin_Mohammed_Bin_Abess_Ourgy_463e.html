<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ourgy confirmed that he traveled to Italy, then Afghanistan, where he received training at the Derunta military camp.</li>
<li>Ourgy disputed that Derunta was an al Qaeda camp.</li>
<li>Ourgy confirmed that he received military training, for twenty-eight days. But he claimed this camp was small, with limited resources. So he didn't train on the RPG -- although he saw one being fired. He acknowledged firing about ten AK-47 rounds, and five or six shots from a pistol.</li>
<li>Ourgy disputed that he engaged in hostilities.</li>

<p>Ourgy expanded on the explanations he offered while answering the allegations:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"This training camp is not associated with Al-Qaida. The proof to this is the Taliban shut down all the training camps in Derunta. The training camp I trained in is associated with the Islamic mujahadin. They were against the Taliban and fighting the Russians. They were the ones running this camp and were not associated with anyone. The man running it told me as soon as I got there that they were not associated with anyone or any regime. The Taliban closed these camps so the people training there would have to go and train in camps with Bin Laden and Al-Qaida in Kandahar. I trained in 1997 at the beginning of the Taliban. About the issue with Tora Bora; I did not go there, Tora Bora is a village. The only way for me to go to Pakistan was through that village and the mountains of Tora Bora. There were Arabs in the mountains but I wasn't there. I just walked through there to get to Pakistan. That's it."</i></dd>

<ul>
<li>Ourgy testified he traveled to Italy in 1989, to find work. He lived in Italy until 1997, when he traveled to Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Ourgy testified he traveled to Afghanistan in 1997 because he had become a drug addict. Another Tunisian man living in Italy, named Abu Abdullah, encouraged him to start praying, to help him kick his drug habit. After he had been praying, and had been clean of drugs for three months, Abdullah paid for his passage to Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Ourgy said he still "didn't know anything at that time because of my drug use", when he agreed to travel to Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Ourgy testified he Abdullah told him he should not return to Tunisia because the government forbids having a beard, the veil, and praying.</li>
<li>Ourgy testified that another reason he did not return to Tunisia was that: <i>"It would have been a problem for me to stay there for seven years and then go back to Tunisia with no money or nothing."</i></li>
<li>Ourgy said he didn't travel directly to Afghanistan. He was met by another Tunisian man, named Saif, and stayed a month in Pakistan, to begin growing a beard, because he was cleanshaven at the time. He then stayed in a house in Afghanistan for another month before he was taken to the Derunta camp.</li>
<li>Ourgy testified he had never had any military training prior to his stay in Derunta.</li>
<li>Ourgy testified that Saif told him all Muslims should receive military training.</li>
<li>When Ourgy was asked if the Taliban approved of his presence he replied: <i>"The Taliban was not the country and couldn't approve or not approve. Afghanistan is a jungle. There is no law or anything."</i></li>
<li>Ourgy testified that, following his month of training in Derunta, he wanted to use the return portion of his round-trip ticket, to go back to Italy.</li>
<li>Ourgy said he was talked out of returning to Italy in Pakistan, by other Tunisians, who convinced him he was at risk of resuming his drug use in Italy. So he stayed in Pakistan.</li>
<li>Ourgy lived in Pakistan until 2000, working in a Libyan store that sold Arabic items.</li>
<li>Ourgy returned to Afghanistan in 2000, when he got married, and:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"When the current President of Pakistan came into power he started rounding up Arabs and returning them to their countries. I was afraid he would turn me over to Tunisia. So I went to Afghanistan because there is no law or anything."</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Ourgy lived in <a href="../../../j/a/l/Jalalabad.html" title="Jalalabad">Jalalabad</a>, where he made a living by importing honey, then selling it.</li>
<li>Ourgy testified that during his stay in Afghanistan the Taliban never harrassed him because he was not an Afghan, and they never asked him to do anything for them.</li>
<li>When asked Ourgy offered this account of his capture:
<ul>
<li>Ourgy testified that when Afghanistan's problems with America started he decided he and his wife should return to Pakistan.</li>
<li>Ourgy's brother-in-law took his wife back to Pakistan, while Ourgy made his way to Pakistan through mountain passes.</li>
<li>Ourgy said he stayed for ten days in a mountain village, until the headman told him he was concerned the presence of Arabs would lead to the Americans bombing his village.</li>
<li>Ourgy said he then moved on to the village of Tora Bora, where he stayed for approximately twenty days. When he set off, with other Arabs, to cross the border, they were bombed, he was injured, some men were killed.</li>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>".the guards are not angels. They make mistakes like I make mistakes. The guard didn't spit at me but he said something, for example, I don't eat meat and they put the meat on the top of [the] vegetables and rice. When you see this, you take it and you throw it This is something very regular between us and the guards."</i></dd>
</dl>
