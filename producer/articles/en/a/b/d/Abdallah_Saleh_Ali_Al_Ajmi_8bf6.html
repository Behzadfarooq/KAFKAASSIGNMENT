<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p>There is no record that he chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.</p>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
<p>The factors for and against continuing to detain Al Ajmi were among the 121 that the Department of Defense released on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.<sup id="_ref-FactorsAlAjmi_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FactorsAlAjmi" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Al Ajmi answered each of the factors favoring his continued detention in turn.<sup id="_ref-ArbAlAjmi_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ArbAlAjmi" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Al Ajmi denied participating in Jihad.</li>
<li>Al Ajmi stated he went to Pakistan to learn and memorize the Koran -- he never traveled to Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Al Ajmi denied any contact with the Taliban. He acknowledged that he had previously confessed to the allegations he was being asked to comment on -- but those were false confessions:
<dl>
<dd><i>"These statements were all said under pressure and threats. I couldn't take it. I couldn't bare <sup class="noprint">[</sup><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>] the threats and suffering so I started saying things.

</dl>
</li>
<li>Al Ajmi denied participating in military operations against the coalition.</li>
<li>Al Ajmi denied being placed in a defensive position by the Taliban:
<dl>
<dd><i>"I am not an enemy combatant. I said this only because I was under pressure and threats and suffering."</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>In response to the allegation that he admitted spending eight months in the front line at the Aiubi Center in Afghanistan, Al Ajmi responded:
<dl>
<dd><i>"I never entered Afghanistan. I never fougth with anyone. My intentions were to stay four months only but under the circumstances I had to stay for eight months. I never fought. My intentions were never to go to Afghanistan my intentions were to go to Pakistan.</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Al Ajmi denied participating in firefights, and he denied admitting he participated in firefights.</li>
<li>In response to the allegation that he fled through Tora Bora Al Ajmi said he had never heard of Tora Bora.</li>
<li>Al Ajmi asserted the group he went to study with, is a peaceful group.</li>
<li>In response to the allegation that <i>"In August 2004 Al Ajmi wanted to make sure that when the case went in front of the tribunal, that the tribunal members know that he is now a Jihadist, and enemy combatant and that he would kill as many Americans as he possibly can," Ajmi replied:</i></li>
<li><i>"That is impossible that I would say such a thing. How could I fight the Americans? They were with me in the military in Kuwait. I would've fought them in Kuwait not here. How can I fight them here? How can I try to kill them here?"</i></li>
<li>Al Ajmi denied being a trouble-maker in Guantanamo.</li>
<li>In response to the recommendation that Al Ajmi was regarded as a continuing threat to the USA, Al Ajmi replied:

<p>Al Ajmi said he had never planned to go AWOL. He planned to go to Pakistan for religious study during his leave. He would have been back in time, except the war made travel for Arabs in Pakistan difficult.</p>
