<p>I wasn't sure whether your last name was spelled with a "G" pronounced as in "Jimmy" (i.e. Modern Standard Arabic pronounciation) or as in "Greece" (i.e. eg. Egyptian pronounciation). Let me know and I'll fix Bosnian and Croatian accordingly. The "h" in the end is pronounced, and <i>Avdo</i> is a jolly Bosnian nickname for any Abdullah (notice the one l) they'll meet. <a href="../../../m/u/h/User%7EMuhamedmesic_2d10.html" title="User:Muhamedmesic">nepTune</a> 22:50, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Abdullah, Firstly, I don't believe that the vandalism on the articles is sufficient at the current time to justify protection. Almost every article will get vandalised at some stage, and sadly we just have to live with that. This is especially so if an article was on the main page as <a href="../../../l/a/a/Laas_Gaal_2b2a.html" title="Laas Gaal">Laas Gaal</a> was. Let me know if it gets worse though and I'll see what I can do. Else post a note to <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, with the images you should now:</p>
<ol>
<li>update each image page with the <u>exact url</u> you got it from. Wikipedia gets several thousand images uploaded every day and every image must have a source and a valid license attached. I noticed you updated Image:Laas Gaal.jpg saying that the author is BBC. That wont work because many people understand BBC images to be copyright. I'd suggest something very explicit along the lines of <i>"downloaded from <a href="http://www.world66.com/africa/somaliland/sights/laas_gaal" class="external free" title="http://www.world66.com/africa/somaliland/sights/laas_gaal" rel="nofollow">http://www.world66.com/africa/somaliland/sights/laas_gaal</a> which asserts a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 1.0 license"</i>. The people at copyright protection need to be able to quickly verify what your saying is correct, else they'll just delete the image. The onus is on you to provide as much information as possible to make their job easier.</li>
<li>update <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_2006_August_26_Images_0fce.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems/2006 August 26/Images">Wikipedia:Copyright problems/2006 August 26/Images</a> with the same information.</li>

<dl>
<dd>Abdullah, you are removing copyright warnings from images that may be unsuitable for Wikipedia. eg. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Haano.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72266535" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Haano.jpg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72266535" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Lahooh.jpg&amp;diff=72194153&amp;oldid=72018601" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Lahooh.jpg&amp;diff=72194153&amp;oldid=72018601" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Please stop as this can be interpreted as vandalism which I'm sure is not your intent. As I said above, add the url you downloaded the photo from to the image page. "BBC publicity photograph" or "Flickr Share and Publicity photograph" means nothing. The changes you've done will now have to be reverted. -- <a href="../../../i/40/n/User_talk%7EI%40n_406b.html" title="User talk:I@n">I@n</a> 13:30, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've replaced the "copyvio" tag - again - on Image:Lahooh.jpg. Flickr does <i>not</i> assert cc-by-sa. Flickr leaves it up to individual photographers to decide what licenses to use for their photos. If you look at the page the image comes from, it does not say "cc-by-sa" or "Creative Comments". In fact, it says "All rights reserved" , which means that the original photographer continues to hold the copyright. Copyright is a complex and detailed area, and I do not think you understand it well. I really think it would be better if you avoided uploading images unless they are pictures that you have taken with your own camera. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> 15:27, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thats right. When Flickr says "public" they are referring to public in the context of the photo being visible to everyone as opposed to "private" for members viewing only. I think you'll find they don't mean "public domain". -- <a href="../../../i/40/n/User_talk%7EI%40n_406b.html" title="User talk:I@n">I@n</a> 15:42, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>(edit conflict with I@n) Exactly. I was just coming here to say what I@n said. We can't use that image. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> 15:44, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Then can you just upload those two pics please with the right copyright. As soon as you do that I will stop uploading pics. Abdullah Geelah 15:44, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</i>
<dl>
<dd>Your missing the point Abdullah. We can't upload those photos because they're under a copyright. ie. they're owned by someone who hasn't released them to the public domain or with a Creative Commons license. -- <a href="../../../i/40/n/User_talk%7EI%40n_406b.html" title="User talk:I@n">I@n</a> 15:48, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><i>OK!! I understand I will delete the images and never upload another Image again! Abdullah Geelah 15:50, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</i>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, you cannot delete the images once they're uploaded. Only an administrator can do that and now that they're listed for copyright review (as I told you yesterday ), it will be a few days before they get deleted. Don't worry about it, that will get sorted out. Please don't edit the images any more as you'll only get yourself into hot water. Secondly, don't be put off from uploading images in the future. Have a read <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_FAQ_fe96.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright FAQ">Wikipedia:Copyright FAQ</a> and understand that Wikipedia can only use photos that have been explicitly released into the public domain or have been released with a suitable copyright tag (explained in the above link). The person who first takes the photo <i>owns</i> copyright on it and unless he releases copyright, use of the photo without permission is theft. That's why the Wikimedia foundation takes this issue so seriously Ask if you need help. -- <a href="../../../i/40/n/User_talk%7EI%40n_406b.html" title="User talk:I@n">I@n</a> 16:02, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but maintaining your edit count is a very poor reason to restore deleted edits. Only an administrator can delete edits - if you had edited out the personal info, anyone could still have viewed it by looking at the edit history. As far <a href="../../../l/a/a/Laas_Gaa%27l_3ea7.html" title="Laas Gaa'l">Laas Gaa'l</a> is concerned, <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.52.254.62.html" title="User:24.52.254.62">User:24.52.254.62</a> is correct - the image appears to have been taken off the BBC website by world66 and is therefore not useable.
