<p>In most of the article, it says "Sharia", then, in line 4 of the letter from Sen. Santorum and Sen. DeMint, it says "sharia law". Is this sort of like the word "sun", which is used as a proper noun, but also as a general one? Or is this just a typographical error on their part?</p>

<p>CAIR CALLS FOR RELEASE OF AFGHAN CHRISTIAN Islamic civil rights group says conversion a personal, not state matter</p>
<p><br />
(WASHINGTON, D.C., 3/22/2006) - A prominent national Islamic civil rights and advocacy group today called on the government of Afghanistan to release Abdul Rahman, a man facing the death penalty for converting from Islam to Christianity.</p>
<p>The Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) says the man's conversion is a personal matter not subject to the intervention of the state.</p>

<p>The move of this article from <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Rahman_%28Afghan%29_bf11.html" title="Abdul Rahman (Afghan)">Abdul Rahman (Afghan)</a> to <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Rahman_%28Apostate%29_47b5.html" title="Abdul Rahman (Apostate)">Abdul Rahman (Apostate)</a> is a bad idea. The ES says that "there are several noted Afghan men" with that name, but we don't appear to have articles on any of the others. To call him "Apostate" (which has a somewhat negative connotation) is to overemphasize the POV of those who are angered by his conversion.

<p>The article said the following "<a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybercast_News_Service_61c8.html" title="Cybercast News Service">CNSNews</a> reports the U.S. Islamic advocacy group <a href="../../../c/a/i/CAIR_c159.html" title="CAIR">CAIR</a>, criticized for not speaking out promptly about thew issue, is calling for Rahman's immediate release", and gave two references: one for CAIR itself, and one for CNS News. I changed this to "The U.S. Islamic advocacy group <a href="../../../c/a/i/CAIR_c159.html" title="CAIR">CAIR</a> is also calling for Rahman's immediate release", and included only the reference to CAIR itself. <a href="../../../t/i/c/User%7ETickle_me_f9ac.html" title="User:Tickle me">User:Tickle me</a> reverted my change, with the comment "CAIR had been criticized, CNSNews reported it, and CAIR reacted. That's noteworthy. btw: It's no way to delete information without giving reasons in the summary". There are several reasons I made this change, and I'd like to discuss them here, and decide the best way to proceed:</p>
<ol>
<li>The fact that CNS reported it is not relevant to the article. Lots of news sources might report it. The CNS News article merely quotes the CAIR press release, which we link to anyway.</li>
<li>The link to CNS News resizes many browsers, which is annoying, and automatically tries to print the page. I think that's a bad link, in addition to being redundant.</li>
<li>The CNS News link says that CAIR was criticized, but uses <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wikipedia%7EWeasel_words_3d79.html" title="Wikipedia:Weasel words">weasel words</a>, without saying <i>who</i> criticized CAIR. I can't find any info on who might have criticised CAIR, and I don't see any reason to copy CNS's weasel words. I also see no evidence that CAIR reacted to any criticism.</li>
<li>It's quite likely CAIR was criticized, as they often are; they are a controversial group. CAIR gave their statement on the same day that Amnesty International made their statement, one day after the BBC first reported on the issue -- but that won't stop partisans from criticising the group for acting too slow. Regardless, this article isn't about CAIR, and criticism of CAIR belongs in the <a href="../../../c/a/i/CAIR_c159.html" title="CAIR">CAIR</a> article.</li>
<li>I wasn't trying to hide my changes at all; I left an edit summary saying the wording I had changed to. Please assume good faith.</li>
</ol>
<p>For these reasons, I think the article should only link to the CAIR press release, not the CNS News report, and should omit inspecific allegations of criticism against a group not directly related to the subject of the article. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 17:48, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In Rahman's case, apostasy is punishable by death, derived from Muhammad's statement "If anyone (a Muslim) changes his religion, kill him." [6]</p>
<p>This isn't how a Muslim Expert on the Koran (I cannot remember his job but he worked at a british university) on the BBC put it he said their was nothing in the Koran saying he had to be executed/punished for changing religion himself, isn't it just if he converts others???</p>

<p>Reply: A Hadith needs to be taken as a whole, not parts. I think this statement of Muhammad(PBUH) needs more explanation. THe Prophet was a humanitarian, he was not a violent type. The Quran is also interpreted, it is not literally followed.</p>
<p><br />
Muhammad was not the "violent type"? Well, that is a big claim... Maybe the 800 unarmed Jewish POWs of Banu Qurayza that he had murdered tought otherwise.... Anyway here's the hadith that was requested:</p>
<p>reply to above: The Jewish tribe twice broke treaties it made with Muhammad and twice tried to assasinate him. Their killing was done by one of the Prophet's companions, and when the Prophet found out, he wept. Dont make one-sided claims.</p>
<p>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 57:</p>
<p>Narrated 'Ikrima: Some Zanadiqa (atheists) were brought to 'Ali and he burnt them. The news of this event, reached Ibn 'Abbas who said, "If I had been in his place, I would not have burnt them, as Allah's Apostle forbade it, saying, 'Do not punish anybody with Allah's punishment (fire).' I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah's Apostle, 'Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'"</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/084.sbt.html" class="external free" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/084.sbt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/084.sbt.html</a> The statement Muhammed (S) was not a 'violent type' is not a big claim while in fact making the claim that he was is a very major statement. Also taking the invasion of Banu Qurayza without understanding the full situation and not understanding the ways of the people in the region and at that time, is also wrong and misleading. Banu Qurayza was breaching their own trust by breaking the treaty planted by Muhammed (S) years ago right after the coming to Medina or Hijra. The treaty claimed that all the groups will defend the region of Medina from invasion of other groups. Since the treaty was breeched by the Jews for the fact that they were switching sides to the invading group that were the Quraysh, the muslims immediately were had the right to put siege to Banu Qurayza. When the Jews had been taken captive, the Aws tribe of Medina wanted to be lenient towards the Jews and so it was decided that Sa'd ibn Muadh, a former ally of the Jews would decide the fate. Sa'd ibn Muadh decided that the punishment should be the punishment that is written in the Jewish books about the punishment given to prisoners for breaking a treaty. Thus the men were killed. Also the Jews had not been unarmed for the fact that the muslims put siege to their fort and the Jews could have easily gone into battle with the muslims. It was their decision not Muhammed (S)'s decision on the punishment. To look at the era of this time, it was common that such events would take place even in Byzantine and Persian empires. One cannot take the events taking place then and judge them in context to the ways here. Also one can examine the warfare of this time when one country goes into war with another would bomb the other's civilian masses in their city. This tactic was started in the World Wars. If people from then looked at this what would they say, what would they say at the killing of millions of innocent lives. This tactic was started in Europe not anywhere else. So who is really violent here and by comparison it can easily be decided.</p>
<p>There is no real evidence that Banu Qurayza broke any treaty with Muhammad. In fact it only happend in the paranoid mind of Muhammad, and even if they did in fact broke a treaty with him, it still wouldn't be a valid excuse to commit such a terrible war-crime. The plain facts is that Muhammad had 800 unarmed Jews murdered. In this case and others (such the murder of the poet Asma Bint Marwan) he was responsible for the crime of murder, and if there is a hell, he will burn in it for these crimes. -Dirty Kuffar.

<dd>I disagree, the purpose of Islam is to make everyone a Muslim, and a strong part of that is killing everyone that refuses to become a Muslim and anyone who converts from Islam. It's the Islamist way, to kill all infidels. While that basically makes Islam a cult rather than relgion to the average Westerner, the Persian world doesn't really agree. You know, it's funny, the Persians were the biggest, best nation for the longest of times, they were multicultural and tolerant of beliefs, then came Islam and things went all to hell. 65.95.229.9 18:24, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reply: Islam seeks conversion through persuasion and example. Islamic empires were formed by the sword, as were all empires in the history of the world. That is confused with islamic religio, which spread peacefully and by choice, the same way it continues today. Your view on Persian history is also Hollywood-based.</p>

<li>This law isn't necessarily because of religion. It would be the equivalent of the treason laws here in the United States, or wherever I guess. Islam is not just a religion, it is a way of life, and a form of government as well. In an Islamic country, leaving Islam amounts to treason, because it goes against the government. The Noble Qur'an states (This is fairly relevant):</li>
</ul>
<p>005.033 YUSUFALI: The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter;</p>
<p>PICKTHAL: The only reward of those who make war upon Allah and His messenger and strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or crucified, or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off, or will be expelled out of the land. Such will be their degradation in the world, and in the Hereafter theirs will be an awful doom;</p>
<p>SHAKIR: The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement,</p>
<p>While the verse lists several punishments, they are separated by the word "or". Meaning that the punishment appropriate for the crime should be given. I personally believe the man should be exiled for turning his back on his family and community. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirbytime_cc43.html" title="User:Kirbytime">Kirbytime</a> 18:53, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Other relevant verses:</p>
<p>022.038 YUSUFALI: Verily Allah will defend (from ill) those who believe: verily, Allah loveth not any that is a traitor to faith, or show ingratitude. PICKTHAL: Lo! Allah defendeth those who are true. Lo! Allah loveth not each treacherous ingrate. SHAKIR: Surely Allah will defend those who believe; surely Allah does not love any one who is unfaithful, ungrateful.</p>
<p>004.017 YUSUFALI: Allah accept the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and repent soon afterwards; to them will Allah turn in mercy: For Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom. PICKTHAL: Forgiveness is only incumbent on Allah toward those who do evil in ignorance (and) then turn quickly (in repentance) to Allah. These are they toward whom Allah relenteth. Allah is ever Knower, Wise. SHAKIR: Repentance with Allah is only for those who do evil in ignorance, then turn (to Allah) soon, so these it is to whom Allah turns (mercifully), and Allah is ever Knowing, Wise.</p>
<p>004.018 YUSUFALI: Of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil, until death faces one of them, and he says, "Now have I repented indeed;" nor of those who die rejecting Faith: for them have We prepared a punishment most grievous. PICKTHAL: The forgiveness is not for those who do ill-deeds until, when death attendeth upon one of them, he saith: Lo! I repent now; nor yet for those who die while they are disbelievers. For such We have prepared a painful doom. SHAKIR: And repentance is not for those who go on doing evil deeds, until when death comes to one of them, he says: Surely now I repent; nor (for) those who die while they are unbelievers. These are they for whom We have prepared a painful chastisement.</p>

<p>The quote under "religious arguments" is so long that it camouflages the core argument. I suggest we reduce that very long quote to his core argument&#160;:</p>
<p><i>once somebody affirms the truth [Islam] and then goes into its rejection, it would jeopardize the truth and it would also show the spiritual corruption of oneself; therefore the execution.</i></p>

<p>In that context, does it make sense to separate the two? The article (as well as many other sources) call him "Rahman" as if that's his family name, when it isn't; wouldn't it be better to go with "Abdul Rahman" the whole time?</p>

<p>An example: <i>In 1993, Abdul Rahman moved to Germany. Abdul Rahman unsuccessfully sought asylum in Belgium before returning to Afghanistan[1] in 2002 after the fall of the Taliban government. In February 2006, Abdul Rahman was reported to the police by members of his own family after seeking custody of his children from his parents.[2] and he was subsequently arrested after police discovered that he possessed a Bible.[3] Abdul Rahman was recently divorced by his wife over his conversion to Christianity...</i></p>
<p>My question is: has the word "he" gone out of style in this article?

<p>As it has already been pointed out above on the talk page, "Abdul Rahman" is one inseparable name, meaning "servant of the merciful". Its romanization in two words is just one of several alternative spellings; it could be "Abdurrahman", for example. Therefore, please do not remove the word "Abdul", calling him just "Rahman"; doing so is not appropriate because "Rahman" is not his last name, just part of the name. Please understand that the subsequent restoring of the word "Abdul" requires a lot of tedious work.

To the best of my knowledge, in Arabic script his name is spelled Abd Alrahman, meaning that only calling him Abdul or only called him Rahman would be incorrect. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirbytime_cc43.html" title="User:Kirbytime">Kirbytime</a> 19:00, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Arabic script is - as correct in the article - <b><big>عبدالرحمان</big></b> This reads 'abdurrahmaani. Abd Al-Rahman or Abdul Rahman is "not really" correct (in this writing). The l in the article <i>al</i> assimilates to r before an r, thus Ar-Rahman when standing alone. But Abd is standing before, and it takes the nominative ending u, thus Abdu-r-rahman. In such a construction, the second part stands in genitive and takes the ending i, thus <b>abdurrahmani</b> - but I admit, that this genitive ending is not mandatory -- <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArne_List_9f9e.html" title="User:Arne List">Arne List</a> 13:53, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I looked earlier for some report on his denomination, but I found none. Since he was working with a Christian aid group when he converted it could be any number of denominations.

<dd>I found many quotes in the article taken from both officials and people in Kabul, all saying that he should be executed because the Prophet Mohammed said that converts from Islam to something else should die. The article also says in a number of places that this saying is part of Muslim traditional law, and that the Constitution of Afghanistan supports the application of such traditional laws. I don't think it's quite as unbalanced as you say, but feel free to edit it to improve it. Or, if you could indicate specific places that seem too slanted, point them out specifically and others may be better able to help. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 17:00, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not within this article's scope to defend Islamic faith nor the underlaying reasoning. It's not Wikiepdia's task to defend any faith anyway. Besides, the section "Response in Afghanistan" with it's subsections:</p>
<ul>
<li>3.1 Government officials</li>
<li>3.2 Muslim clerics</li>
<li>3.3 Afghan public</li>
</ul>
<p>gives equal room for domestic views, mostly supportive of the former verdict. --<a href="../../../t/i/c/User%7ETickle_me_f9ac.html" title="User:Tickle me">tickle</a> <a href="../../../t/i/c/User_talk%7ETickle_me_c608.html" title="User talk:Tickle me">me</a> 18:00, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can see how the article may seem unbalanced. However, the fact is that this article is about Abdul Rahman, and we have to work with the truth that a lot of western governments and organizations have condemned his arrest. I would love to see a better explanation of the ideas behind Abdul Rahman's case, but I know that I wouldn't be good at explaining those ideas. Perhaps wikipedia needs another article about the Afghan constitution and what some scholars say are conflicting ideas on freedom of religion etc. Also, the article probably needs to be two articles, one solely a biography on Abdul Rahman, and the other about the trial and controversy it arroused. I think this may be remembered as a historically significant case, being the first of its kind (at least to gain widespread attention) concerning civil liberties under the new Afghan government.<a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWanda5088_a8b3.html" title="User:Wanda5088">Wanda5088</a> 17:55, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since his release and drop off on the outskirts of Kabul, Abdul Rahman has vanished; whther in hiding, asylum, or worse is not yet known. I think needs to be discussed. Especially since major world powers have offered him refuge.</p>

<p>I am unsure of how this law works - is it illegal to <i>convert</i> from Islam in Afghanistan, or simply to hold a religion other than Islam? --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnoma_lee_c499.html" title="User:Anoma lee">Anoma lee</a> 01:26, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Conversion</i> is illegal, though it may not be for long. For now the aquittal was based on alleged "mental defect". Though it is clear that vulnerability to external pressure has called into question any kind of independant judiciary or legitimacy that the court could have. The reprecussions on the Afghan justice system at their best is showing the susceptability of the court to external opinion. <b>Can anyone find an article on the less than immediate effects?</b><a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngrynight_be7e.html" title="User:Angrynight">Angrynight</a> 05:05, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>These are my reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>This issue is about "Apostasy" but there isn't any explanation or active link in the text.</li>
<li>There are several sentences in the lead as well as the body of the article which doesn't have source and because this issue is controversial they should be verified.</li>
<li>The text should be verified again because some of the sources like <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060322/ap_on_re_as/afghan_christian_convert" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060322/ap_on_re_as/afghan_christian_convert" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and <a href="http://www.thehawaiichannel.com/news/8212014/detail.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thehawaiichannel.com/news/8212014/detail.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> don't exist anymore.</li>
<li>There are several expressions and names which should be linked to other articles. For example there are several of them in <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Rahman_%28convert%29_5845.html#Muslim_clerics" title="Abdul Rahman (convert)">Abdul Rahman (convert)#Muslim clerics</a> comprising Ahmad Shah Ahmadzai, Hizb-i-Iqtadar-i-Islami Afghanistan and Afghan Ulama Council.</li>
<li>All of the photos have Fair use tag while non of them have "<a href="../../../i/m/a/Help%7EImage_page_09d1.html#Fair_use_rationale" title="Help:Image page">Fair use rationale</a>".</li>
