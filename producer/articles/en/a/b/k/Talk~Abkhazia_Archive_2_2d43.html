<dd>Khoi its a first time i hear the name "Sokhom"&#160;:) You must be mistaken. Turks called the city "Sukhum Kale" and so did Russians, "Sukhum". In Abkhaz its "aq'wa" , in Georgian "tskhumi" and officialy after 1991 "Sokhumi." During USSR it was Sukhumi due to Rusification of the name. But Please double-check National Geographic. Britannica has good info too. Thanks Khoi&#160;:) <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Noxchi Borz</a> 00:59, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well Khoi, you should work for NG. Where do you get all those rare articles from NG?&#160;:) They should hire you. Ok, both of the maps which you had links to have "Sokhumi" the one here is "Sokhum." The name "Sokhum" is a mistake for sure. Its definately not Abkhaz, Russian, Turk, Arab or Georgian. They forgot to include "i" in the end. Here is what the city is called in following languages: Abkhaz: "aq'wa (trans. water), Georgian: "tskhumi", Turk: "Sukhum Kale", Arab: Sukhum, Russian: "Suxum" and "Suxumi" and Mingrelian: "tskhuma." I sent you more photos, check your gmail&#160;:) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Ldingley</a> (<a href="../../../l/d/i/User_talk%7ELdingley_e5ff.html" title="User talk:Ldingley">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ldingley_9800.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ldingley">contribs</a>) 01:31, 12 May 2006.</small></dd>

<dd>Well, I think I heard somewhere that Sukhum/Sokhum is the name used by Abkhazians when the speak Russian. I also heard that they dropped the "-i" suffix because it's characteristic of Georgian names, so the Abkhaz see it as offensive. Yes, I got the email, outstanding as usual.&#160;:) I'll reply to it soon. —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 01:48, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey Khoi, NG is a great source but not always accurate. I’d far prefer Sokhumi (the correct name of the city), but Sukhumi is also OK even though it’s a Russificated form. However, we must add the note explaining that the official name of the city is Sokhumi frequently transliterated as Sukhumi. Sukhum is an old Turkish name which was reestablished by Abkhaz nationalists in order to eliminate everything Georgian. However, both Abkhaz separatist officials and Georgian authorities continue to use Sukhumi when they give interviews in Russian. Most international sources also use either Sukhumi or Sokhumi. Here are my results of googling (excluding wikipedia):</dd>

<dd>I totally agree with Kober. I don’t think Wiki articles should be written in the way not to offend some individuals. The importance of "official" status is very crutail for truthfulness and accuracy of Wiki articles. I actually met Abkhaz who did not find any offences in that name. The articles should represent in the way Britannica represents, an officially known and recognized material. Officially it’s <b>Sokhumi</b> and there are tons of un-official names of the city (every city has them), but what are we promoting here? Why is there a tendancy to promote pro-separatist agenda on these articles? That map Khoi which you attached to this page is very funny. They have maintained Georgian names on all the cities (Tkhvarcheli, Ochamchire, Gagra, Gudauta, Gali, Bichvimta, etc) but took away "i" from the Sokhum. If they want to be pro separatist, it should be: Sukhum, Tkhvarchal, Gagr, Gudaut, Gal, Ochamchir, Putsunda, etc&#160;:) BTW Bichvinta is purely Georgian name which definitely offends Abkhaz&#160;:) Wow. Another interesting thing, The color of those regions are almost same as Russian Federation&#160;:) Also somehow Chechnya's borders are not shown (its like they don’t exist) and the borders of other N Caucasian Republics also, thats amzing. Also Karabakh borders are totally wrong. This map is perfect in sense of propaganda and limited knowledge of the issue/geography which the author had when he was chopping off those territories.&#160;:) I think we should have Sukhumi or Sokhumi (official name). But I respect all oppinions and welcome all suggestions.<a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Noxchi Borz</a> 13:40, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey guys—I never said we should move the page to Sukhum/Sokhum. I personally would prefer S<b>u</b>khumi over Sokhumi, as it conforms to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)</a>. We had a similar dispute, should the page be at <a href="../../../k/y/i/Kyiv.html" title="Kyiv">Kyiv</a> or <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>? As you can see, the English name for the article is used today. Besides, Sukhumi is by far the most common name. Anyways, there were no bad intentions. When I get the job with NG I’ll fix the place names.&#160;;) —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 15:25, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BS my dear Khoy, the last thing Georgia wants is war. Only through peaceful means they will be able to achieve settlement, and they know it better than anyone. Don’t trust whatever Kokoit is declaring from Moscow. Moscow told him to say so but nobody believes in that crap. Yesterday in Moscow they started to deport all Georgian nationals and placed many posters on the street: "Respect yourself and your country, Dont drinks Georgian Wine." This all reminds me of Third Reich and SA operations. It’s disgusting. <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Noxchi Borz</a> 17:11, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Huh! It’s a typical propaganda machine. Do you think Georgians are so mad to initiate a new war when the country has just begun to recover and is but slowly improving? The new peace proposal by the Georgian government has just received an international support. Kokoity relocated to Moscow a few months ago and said that the Russian capital is the best place to run the government in Tskhinvali – the most ridiculous words I’ve ever heard from a politician. The fact is that common South Ossetians are being increasingly convinced in necessity to return within the Georgian state. This is the reason for such claims. The Russian military bases are finally leaving Georgia. The country is going to withdraw from the CIS and is moving closer and closer to NATO. Now, guess who wants the war… <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 17:18, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Tasc before editing, please review the archived discussion about attaching separatist to the de facto term. Based on numerous sources, we have all agreed that current so called "government" and regime in Abkhazia is separatist. Please try to avoid POVs and let’s stick to NPOV. Otherwise state and present sources which contradict separatist status of Abkhazian regime.

<p>Clearly many of the contributions to this article have been made by people whose first language is not English. Articles don't exist in Eastern European languages and the concept is difficult to grasp - should one correct the grammar? How can one do so? This is one of probably thousands to which this comment applies, it's probably going to change over time, and one would not wish to discourage people from contributing just because their English is not up to scratch. Any suggestions? I could change the grammar, but can't contribute materially to the facts.</p>

<dd>Tasc, you are undermining the NPOV of the article by adding your own POVs. You have proven before on other articles (ex. <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sochi.html" title="Sochi">Sochi</a>) to have anti-Georgian bias and as I noticed you are slowly implementing your own ideas into articles which are related to Georgian events. I highly recommend you to maintain NPOV regardless of your Russian background and start a constructive co-operation with other editors like Kober who have contributed to Wikipedia tremendously. Pro-separatist, nationalist POV will not be tolerated on any post-soviet conflict articles. Take a look at Nagorny-Karabakh, a good example of co-operation and respect for NPOV. <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Ldingley</a> 17:17, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hey Noxchi. It’s a pity to see that there are only a few users interested in this article. Yet we can cooperate to improve the quality of the current version. First of all, I think we should abridge the history section which is becoming too long and create a separate article on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Abkhazia_f6b4.html" title="History of Abkhazia">History of Abkhazia</a>. For the sake of compromise I agree to change the words like "massacre" with more neutral expressions, or at least we can use the wording how the UN and OSCE describe the events. Tell me what you think. Thanks, --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 17:39, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Kober, great idea. We can start working of History of Abkhazia article with the help of sources from western scholars (Lang, Wardlop, Allen, Andersen, Mc'Killen, Blair, etc). As for massacres. Please review the book by Chervonnaia, Svetlana (Russian journalist witnessing the events). She called those crimes as massacres and also Human Rights Watch. "Georgia/Abkhazia: Violations of the Laws of War and Russia's Role in the Conflict." Published March 1995. I will also gather all UN and OSCE resolutions on Abkhazia like they did on <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno-Karabakh_a51f.html" title="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> article. But its up to you, you may change the term "massacres" but judging from many reports, they were massacres (specially in Sukhumi and Gagra).

<dd>Thanks a lot, Noxchi. Then I will start the History of Abkhazia article and put it on wiki in a few days. I'm not well-versed in the legal issues and it will be really great if you can focus on that. If most sources consider those events massacres (and they really do) we should obviously keep exactly this sort of description.

<p>It is stated that Georgians constituted a majority in Abkhazia at the beginning of the century, and this is backed by information from the EB from 1911 detailing the ethnic composition of Sukhumi. The one does not necessairily follow from the other however, urban centers generally show a larger percentage of people of 'foreign' origin than a country overall does. Thus if one merely looks at the composition of Riga one might be led to believe that there are more Russians in Latvia than Latvians. There aren't. Of course it is not given the Georgian population actually was concentrated in the urban areas, but due to the uncertainty of the statistical relationship (also considering the small size of Sukhumi at the time) I will adapt the text accordingly. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephia_karta_e555.html" title="User:Sephia karta">Sephia karta</a> 15:12, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

The <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brockhaus_and_Efron_Encyclopedic_Dictionary_bcde.html" title="Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary">Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary</a> gives the following data about Sukhum district: Население округа состоит из абхазцев и самурзаканцев (86%), мингрельцев (5,5%), греков (3,5%), армян (1,5%), русских (ок. 2%), грузин (около 1%), немцев и проч.

<dd>The district population consists of abkhazians and samyrzakanians (86%), mingrelians (5.5%), greeks (3.5%), armenians (1.5%), russians (about 2%), georgians (about 1%), germans etc. Since georgians and mingrelians now are considered as georgians that would give the following abkhaz/georgian proportion: 86/6.5. The Sukhum district of that time occupied pretty much the same territory as Abkhazian ASSR. This is the link to the online version of the B&amp;E encyclopaedia <a href="http://brokhaus-efron.narod.ru/4/4559.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://brokhaus-efron.narod.ru/4/4559.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

Stalin's ethnicity has nothing to do with Georgians or Georgia. This kind of bias and POV statement should be avoided. Try to see things in the perspective of NPOV. Also do not quote he sources which are from the Russian web sites, as we see today Russia is the conflicting side in this issue even far greater than the Abkhaz. Also with one source from Maryland Uni, provide a secondary opinion to support their claims of which references must be valid and reliable.

<dd>Andersen, Lang and Blair are Western scholars and authors of most valuable works on Georgia published in English. I don't know why Brockhaus is supposed to be more accurate than 1911 EB or other sources available on Abkhazia. Furthermore, Samurzakanians mentioned by the Brockhaus dictionary have never been classified as a separate group. Actually, "Samurzakanians" is a collective terms for the inhabitants of Samurzakano (modern Gali district in south Abkhazia) and most of them spoke (and speak) a local dialect of Mingrelian. The name <i>Sa-murzakan-o</i> itself is typically Kartvelian (Georgian/Mingrelian) meaning the "[land] of Murzakan" after the early 18th-century Abkhaz-Mingrelian prince of the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shervashidze.html" title="Shervashidze">Shervashidze</a> family.

<dd>Kober, thank you for a good point about Samurzakanians. They are indeed the Mingrelians who lived in Samurzakan. One can only wonder why they were united with Abkhazians rather than Mingrelians in the B&amp;E.</dd>
<dd>Nevertheless the number of Abkhazians can be estimated too. The population of Sukhum district was 100498. The total number of Abkhazians was 'about 70000' <a href="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/000/386.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/000/386.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>(including Abaza, who live to the north of Caucausus, who numbered 5000 <a href="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/000/111.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/000/111.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>). That gives us 60000-65000 of Abkhazians in Sukhum district (60-65%).</dd>
<dd>Brockhaus is NOT supposed to be more (or less) accurate than 1911 EB. Probably something like that should be written: "According to the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedia, published in 1890-1906 in Russia Abkhazians and Georgians composed 60-65% and 25-30% of the Sukhum district population respectively in 1897'. Information from the 1911BE should also be added.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaexis_da0d.html" title="User:Alaexis">Alaexis</a> 07:59, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alaexis, thank you for your cooperativeness. <s>Can you please provide the exact date of the</s> B&amp;E edition that estimates the number of the Abkhazians at 60,000-65,000? The <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a> article "Abkhaz" by <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Minorsky_079b.html" title="Vladimir Minorsky">Vladimir Minorsky</a> says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the thirties of the 19th century the population of AbÕ9§zia was estimated at about 90,000, and the number of all Abkhaz (i.e. including those living in the north outside Abkhazia) at 128,000 souls. After 1866, the population of Abkhazia was reduced to c. 65,000... in 1881 the number of Abkhaz was estimated at only 20,000. No statistics on the Abkhazians in Turkey are available.</i> <a href="http://www.encislam.brill.nl/data/EncIslam/S8/SIM-0148.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.encislam.brill.nl/data/EncIslam/S8/SIM-0148.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, Georgian authors frequently cite the 1917 statistics (I’m sorry, I don’t remember the exact primary source) according to which the population of Abkhazia consisted of 74,846 Georgians (42,1 %), 38,121 Abkhaz (21.4%), 20,893 Russians (11.7%), 20,673 Greeks (11.7%), 18,219 Armenians (10.2%) and 5,087 of other nationalities (2.9%).</p>
<p>IMHO, the best solution here is to compile all these versions, mentioning that the figures vary and indicating the corresponding sources. Regards, <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 08:46, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>P.S. Ah, sorry. I see the B&amp;E statistics date to 1897. However, it seems somewhat implausible that the ethnic Abkhaz populaton increased threefold from 20,000 in 1881 (as per Minorsky) to 60,000-65,000 in 1897 (according to B&amp;E), doesn't it? --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 09:05, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it does seem strange.

<p>The problem here is that de jure gov of Abkhazia (-in exile) now exercises both de jure and de facto control over the northeast of the republic. Georgia took full control of the upper <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodori_Valley_c2a9.html" title="Kodori Valley">Kodori Valley</a> in August 2006, and now there's kind of diarchy in Abkhazia, with separatists in control of Sukhumi and most of Abkhazia, and de jure gov ruling in Kodori or the Temporary Administrative District of Upper Abkhazia, as the area is officially styled by Tbilisi. --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 16:36, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. We must not forget or leave out that Sukhumi based de facto government is radically separatist. As for de jure, which is composed of many ethnic Abkhaz and Georgians, has different views on the status of Abkhazia. That government is officially recognized by international community as legal. In Kodori, which is part of Abkhazia this de jure government now controls big chunk of north-western Abkhazia and planning to set up the government there. Therefore, it’s becoming de facto for Abkhazia as well. <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Ldingley</a> 16:41, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would it be best to use "separatist" and "recognized" to distinguish between the governments, then? I agree with Khoikhoi's edit summary that "de facto separatist" is redundant, and the control by each government over different parts of the region does make using "de facto" and "de jure" somewhat inaccurate as well. -<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schaich_eeca.html" title="User:David Schaich">David Schaich</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Schaich_3ea0.html" title="User talk:David Schaich">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Schaich_5354.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Schaich">Cont</a></sub></small> 17:39, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>David, it’s simple. So called de jure government was the real body which controlled Abkhazia and administered that territory before the war. In it, there was significant number of pro-separatist members. That government had executive powers and was elected to represent Abkhazian Autonomous Republic just before the war. The elections were fair and recognized because every ethnic group of Abkhazia had a chance to vote equally. When war started, the separatist wing of that government left the capital and joined up the armed groups in Gudauta which launched a full scale country-attack on Georgian forces and the government of Abkhazian autonomous republic. Those rebel separatist former members of Abkhaz government managed to take over Sukhumi, expel majority of Abkhazia’s inhabitants (mainly ethnic Georgians), killed many members of the government (some managed to escape and form government in exile, just like Tibetan one) and pronounced a formation of new government of “sovereign” Abkhazia. World organizations, states, UN, OSCE, EU, EU parliament has condemned such action and did not recognize any of such government or election of it, where the majority of the population did not vote for it and was expelled. Just recently, Hague also spoke out and added that some of those members of that de facto Abkhaz government might be indicted in war crimes. So the western media labeled current separatist regime as de facto government (which factually controlls that territory) and the exiled one de jure (which has jurisdiction authority and international recognition as being official government of that territory). De jur egovenment was legally elected and represents not only the 300,000 Georgian IDPs but also the entire population of Abkhazia which their jurisdiction dictates. Now, this year the de jure exiled government managed to dislocate from Tbilisi to Kodori, the north-western region of Abkhazia populated by ethnic Georgians (Svans). That’s the simplest way to put it&#160;:) The so called de facto government is the separatist wing of that de jure government which governed Abkhazia since the creation of Soviet Union. De jure govenment has many abkhaz (Akishbaia, Marshania, etc) georgian and armenian members, while the de facto has only radical separatists and extreme nationalists in their club&#160;:) <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Ldingley</a> 18:01, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the interests of absolute accuracy it is important to call it as it is . To refer to de-facto or de-jure is clearly better than using emotive terms such as 'separatist' or 'recognised'. The Abkhazia would not consider themselves 'separatist' but 'separate'. There is a difference. So I suggest you refer to it in a scientific way rather than a politically sensitive manner. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkStreet_e65b.html" title="User:MarkStreet">MarkStreet</a> 20 Oct 2006</dd>

The first controls around 30% of the territory Abkhazia, the other 70%. And there’s also the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgian_people.html" title="Georgian people">Georgian</a>-populated <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gali.html" title="Gali">Gali</a> district, that is just partially-controlled by the separatist government.</dd>

<p>On the top of the page it says: "Russian: Абха́зия Abhazia". Is the transcription really correct? Doesn't "х" usually become "kh" (instead of just "h") in English? (218.228.195.44 09:11, 29 September 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>In my opinion, "х" transliterated as "kh" if "x" goes after vowel, to indicate that russian "x" ("ha") sounds a little harder than english "h". If "x" goes after cosonant, then it should be transliterated simple as "h", because cosonant already implies harderness of next sound. But I should notice, that most people pronounced transliterated russian words wrong because of that transliteration - they pronounce it too hard, making accent on 'k'. 'Nikita Mikhalkov' - was pronounced so bad on Oscar movie avards, I remember.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sorry for my English.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No apology needed ... your English is far better than my quite limited Russian. "Абха́зия" probably <i>should</i> be transliterated as you describe, but I've always seen it rendered as "Abkhazia". I don't know why this is so. Perhaps because some native English speakers would be tempted to mispronounce it as "uh-BAHZ-uh" or "ah-BAY-zyuh". "Abkhazia" gets pronounced as close to correct as is likely without learning Russian pronunciation and syllabication.

<dd>It definitely was not. The non-Georgian and non-Abkhazian population (mainly Russians and Armenians) as a rule supported Abkhazians against Georgians during the war. I suppose they rather wanted to be part of Russia than Georgia. After the end of the war Abkhazia obviously expirienced very hard times in economic sense. The Russians who were mainly city-dwellers and did not have the advantage of family (clan) support were hit the hardest. So quite naturally a lot of them emigrated to Russia (as well as many Armenians and Abkhazians). The exact after-war statistics is unavailable with the figures varying greatly. By now I don't have time to provide the necessary references so I'll just change a bit your contribution.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaexis_da0d.html" title="User:Alaexis">Alaexis</a> 20:24, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>As I said before, I thought that the table of Abkhazia was going pretty confuse. So I changed from the old one (to the right) to the new one (to the left).</p>
<p>In fact there’s not so much new infos on the new table; the main difference is the presence of the national symbols used by the <a href="../../../d/e/-/De-jure_Government_of_Abkhazia_c00a.html" title="De-jure Government of Abkhazia">Unionist Government</a> nowadays. And the former infos were rearranged in a neater form, separating the geographic aspects from the political ones.</p>

<p>I think the terms “<a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">De facto</a>” and “<a href="../../../d/e/_/De_jure.html" title="De jure">De jure</a>” to designate the <a href="../../../s/u/k/Sukhumi.html" title="Sukhumi">Sukhumi</a>-<a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a>-backed and <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodori.html" title="Kodori">Kodori</a>-<a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28country%29.html" title="Georgia (country)">Georgian</a>-backed governments respectivelly are nowadays outdated, because of two factors:</p>
<p>01. The Abkhazian separatist government in Sukhumi <b>does not control the entire territory of Abkhazia</b>. The Gali district is conttrolled by Sukhumi and <a href="../../../u/n/o/UNOMIG_3347.html" title="UNOMIG">UNOMIG</a>, and the region North of the Kodori valley is nowadays fully controlled by the government of Georgia, which already installed a government that is, theorically, the internationally-accepted one.</p>
<p>02. So, call the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separatist.html" title="Separatist">separatist</a> government as “De facto” and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionist.html" title="Unionist">unionist</a> government as “De facto” for me is POV. I think other sections in this article and other articles about Abkhazia and Abkhazian politics should be altered to reflect the current realities.--<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMaGioZal_830d.html" title="User:MaGioZal">MaGioZal</a> 19:19, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The terms "<a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a>" and "<a href="../../../d/e/_/De_jure.html" title="De jure">de jure</a>" are legal terms and are used by most governments and international organizations (such as the UN), and not taken as POV. Nor is it necessary for a governmental entity to control 100% of its claimed territory to qualify for status of being the de facto government; it need only control the major portion. I would deprecate use of the terms here, but for different reasons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First, the average reader is often unfamiliar with these terms (as they are "technical" and foreign [Latin]), and they form awkward, confusing adjectives for identifying a particular governing body — it's hard to keep straight which is which. Secondly, if Georgia attacks Abkhazia to regain control and is successful, at some point in the conflict the "de facto" government will change from the secessionist government to the Georgian government.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that "secessionist" and "unionist" are much clearer; what is necessary is to identify these terms, when first used, as "de facto" or "de jure" and wikilinked so those unfamiliar with them can learn more. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">Talk</a> 23:00, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=85.108.163.136" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=85.108.163.136" rel="nofollow">Someone using a Turksih ISP</a> has altered the “Official language” status of the separatist government in Sukhumi to just “Abkhazian” because in its stating “(russian language is not official according to CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF ABKHAZIA ( <a href="http://www.abkhaziya.info/GOS/GOS3.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.abkhaziya.info/GOS/GOS3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abkhaziya.info/GOS/GOS3.htm</a> ))”. Well, let’s check it:</p>
<p><i>ARTICLE 6. The official language of the Republic of Abkhazia is Abkhazian. The Russian language as well as the Abkhazian language shall be recognized as the language of the government, public and other institutions. The state shall guarantee all ethnic groups living in Abkhazia the right to use freely their own languages.</i></p>
<p>So, as we can read the conclusion is that yes, the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a> has a co-official status in the Abkhazian separatist-controlled territory. And as we can see in a lot of websites and many testemonials, the “De facto” main language of Abkhazia, used by the government and the people that remainded there after the war in 1993, is Russian.--<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMaGioZal_830d.html" title="User:MaGioZal">MaGioZal</a> 19:19, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How so? How would this be more confusing than similar set-ups with Western Sahara, Korea and Taiwan? All 3 articles would start with a short explanatory note linking to the other two articles. If anything, this would introduce more clarity, keeping things separate that are separate and following the practised principle of Wikipedia to devote seperate articles to seperate political entities. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephia_karta_e555.html" title="User:Sephia karta">Sephia karta</a> 13:03, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The term "de-jure" and sseparatist are extremly subjective in a situation when the whole area was devolved from the Soviet Union based on imposed boundaries. The "de-jure" government may in fact be internationally recognized, but it's hardly a "government" at all and is generally regarded by those of Abkhazian nationality as collaborationist.</p>
<p>This article should mention both points of view from a neutral position. I have therefore added a POV tag. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Adler_ba56.html" title="User:Scott Adler">Scott Adler</a> 07:08, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't get your point. "De facto" and "De jure" are not subjective names, but legitimate terms used by the UN. There are two infoboxes in the article: one for the de facto authorities, and the other for the de jure government. Furthermore, the "de facto" one goes first.

<p>Not very active here, so this is for the experienced editors to discuss: It is POV to give the two governments equal weight if that isn't the reality in Abkhazia. My understanding is: One has control of 99% of the area. The other one has a small village in the gorge. In the article's infobox, these two are listed next to each other on the same basis. This is POV because of the weight. The right thing to do is to revert to the infobox which was there before, and then put a link on it: "See also: De facto government of Abkhazia". To a separate page. Please discuss. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPernambuco_dde4.html" title="User:Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> 21:17, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. First of all, the de jure government enjoys an international recognition and controls not only a small village, but almost 20% of Abkhazia though this territory is scarcely inhabited. Secondly, I don't think that the two governments are given equal weight in the article and the "de facto" infobox goes first. The article's intro explicitly states that the secessionist authorities control most of Abkhazia including the regional capital. Elimination of the infobox for the de jure government wouldn't make the article more neutral, IMHO.

<dl>
<dd>I concur with <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a>. The presence of the two infoboxes does not imply POV through "equal weight" so much as it admits to there being a complicated state of affairs in Abkhazia. Having both a "legitimate" <i>de jure</i> and a "legitimate" <i>de facto</i> government is certainly just that. Furthermore, trying to explain the history and reality of this fact would require more than 1% of the article. Balance here should not be measured by "weight of text" so much as "evenhandedness in approach". -- <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">Talk</a> 16:01, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The State Duma’s failed attempt to pass a bill on "the admission of new federal subjects into the Russian Federation" in the spring of 2005 comes to mind. Given the Abkhaz separatists’ frequently voiced desire to become "an associated member of the Russian Federation", I don’t think that the statement is particularly "anti-Abkhazian POV". As an opposer of "Georgia’s aggressive attempts to subjugate Abkhazia", you should do some more research on the issue before deleting the text from the article.

<dl>
<dd>Still, this statement is infelicious. It suggests that the absence of such 'legal ways' are currently the main hurdle for anything like associate relations between the two states, whereas in reality it is totally dependend on political will. Russia would first have to recognise Abkhazia and it does not want to do so at the moment, for whatever reasons. But if/when it does, all that is needed is 2 laws passed by resp. the Russian and the Abkhazian parliaments.<a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephia_karta_e555.html" title="User:Sephia karta">Sephia karta</a> 17:47, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kober,Abkhazia,unlike Transnistria,does not seek to unite with Russia.It prefers to become an independent member of CIS (you should do more research yourself).Secondly,you said it yourself that the attempt to pass that bill failed.So,the statetment has no ground beneath it.It has to go.<a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimts_8efa.html" title="User:Dimts">Dimts</a> 09:10, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that the bill was discussed and failed means that the Duma is <i>looking for legal ways to incorporate this region into Russia</i> though without any result. I agree that this is due the absence of a political will, but that is another story. Whatever the reason behind it, the fact remains the fact.</dd>

<dd>Abkhazia has had past experiences too unhappy with Russia for it to want to give up independance and join Russia.

<dd>Location maps are for any area where it might be useful to show where in the world the area you are discussing is located, showing the area on a world map doesn't necessarily imply the area is independant, it just shows what area you are talking about - Currently there is nothing in the article to establish that for readers that aren't already familiar with Georgia.

<dd>I fully concur with <a href="../../../k/m/u/User%7EKmusser_3979.html" title="User:Kmusser">Kmusser</a>. Location maps such as these may be found in news articles, <i>National Geographic</i>, etc. They are an aid to locating a place — and it need not be a country; it can be a province, region, a country that existed long ago, etc. Such maps are value-neutral. There is nothing in it suggesting that Abkhazia is or is not separate from Georgia. It merely illustrates for the benefit of the reader where Abkhazia is located ... something probably 99% of the world likely has no idea. In fact, it would seem to me an excellent idea for such maps to be added to articles on other poorly known places like <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chechnya.html" title="Chechnya">Chechnya</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno-Karabakh_a51f.html" title="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>, etc. The map you linked to only shows Georgia, and using it would suggest that all of Georgia was Abkhazia! Abkhazia exists, it has a location, and showing where it is located is NPOV. If there were a title to the map suggesting Abkhazia was an independent country, you'd have a point about POV, but it doesn't and I'm afraid you don't. Unless someone can show how this map is clearly POV, it should be allowed to remain. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 03:25, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Im sorry but I don’t agree with you Askari. This map does show Abkhazia as a separate state. Only this region is highlighted in green and its borders are outside of the de jure borders of Georgia. If the region would have been green in the Georgian borders than I would understand the point which you and Kmusser were making. But separating it physically from the rest of Georgia is definitely a POV. And I do have a point in that. You cant have the locator maps for every region in the world. Than you should start with Russia, a place where many different republics exist and 99% of the people in the west do not know about their location. However, im certain that the Russian users would not allow it. Therefore, this map (although many thanks to author for considering the interests of the reader) should be modified so we don’t get any wrong impressions. Make a locator map where the whole Georgian borders appear, and you may separate Abkhazian Autonomous Republic by different colour. That way the official recognition and de jure status is respected. Again, im not accusing anyone, as I told to Kmusser I admire his dedication and consideration for the interests of the people who came to Wiki to learn about this subject. I made a valid point and it should be considered by the author of the locator map. However, I will find it hard to let this map endure on this article based on the controversy which surround this issue and in terms of NPOV integrity.

<dd>It would seem to me that either representation of Abkhazia on a map (highlighted within the wider region vs. highlighted within Georgia) presents a certain POV. It seems to be impossible to have a map that is NPOV, or it would have to be one where both Abkhazia and Georgia are seperately highlighted from the wider region, to present the disagreement about the relationship between the two entities.</dd>
<dd>Another approach would be what I proposed before, to trifurcate the article into one general article, one article for the Republic of Abkhazia and one for the Autnomous republic of Abkhazia, where the two latter articles could have maps resp. showing Abkhazia as a seperate state and as within Georgia. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephia_karta_e555.html" title="User:Sephia karta">Sephia karta</a> 15:47, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You may make visa regimes anywhere where possible, in this case massacring anyone who does not agree with your separatist drive and expel 300,000 of its rightful citizens. It’s a regime, a separatist regime which came to power by force and dirty war. Similar self designated republics have sprung up and in vain. International recognition of the statehood is more important than your claims of being mono-ethnic republic attaining power through utter violence. To split this article into self proclaimed/imposed so called Republic of Abkhazia of the separatist mono-ethnic/ideological regime and into Autonomous Republic which is internationally recognized via numerous UN resolutions is senseless. Than why not split Nagorno-Karabakh into Azeri republic and Armenian? Tibet? Palestine as its capital in Jerusalem (in terms of de facto, Arabs claim that and live there), Kurdistan? Etc. I’m sure many articles about different republics within Russia would spring up as separate Republics. This is off topic and has nothing to do with the map. I made my point so the author would take it into consideration. But if you want somehow to legalize the notion of glorious and victorious separatist regimes in any country and self designated Republics and Presidents, fell free to indulge but lets not deviate from the topic. <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Ldingley</a> 16:57, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Incidently, the (tri)furcation I advocate for Abkhazia into region and political entities <i>has</i> been applied to <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibet.html" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a>. The reason why there is no article on the Azeri republic of Nagorno-Karabakh is because no such thing exists. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephia_karta_e555.html" title="User:Sephia karta">Sephia karta</a> 01:44, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thats a true NPOV version. Many thanks Kmusser again for designing these much needed maps. Best regards. May i also suggest to make similar maps for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chechnya.html" title="Chechnya">Chechnya</a> and other republics of <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasus.html" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> region?

<dd>I agree with Ldingley. The current one seems fine to me. The topic is already controversial. Let's don't inflame another POV dispute. --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 17:28, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think <a href="../../../k/m/u/User%7EKmusser_3979.html" title="User:Kmusser">Kmusser's</a> revised map is perfect. And, yes, Ldingley, you <i>can</i> have a locator map for any region, province, etc. — as long as it locates the subject of the article. A map cannot be inherently POV if it just shows a location; you need labels on it to do that. The white border you saw was an artifact of how the map was made, not some intent to push a POV. While the subject of this article is indeed contentious, I think we need to remember to assume good intentions. Not everybody who tries to contribute to this article is trying to push a POV. A better way to have handled this contribution would have been to address anyone's concerns here on the talk page, not automatically deleting it before only a couple of people got the chance to even view it. Letting Kmusser know what concerns some people had with the original map allowed him to come up with a version that satisfied everyone (I think). That's a much more constructive process and encourages more people to make positive contributions to this article. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 18:21, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This new map is nearly ideal. I cannot speak for all Russians but for me the similar map of any Russian region is perfectly ok, contrary to what <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Ldingley</a> thinks )). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaexis_da0d.html" title="User:Alaexis">Alaexis</a> 20:04, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can live with it. Since we're on the topic of maps though, since we're all so keen to have maps be NPOV, and since currently the article features a map showing Abkhazia as a province of Georgia and a map of Abkhazia with Georgianised names I suggest that these either be replaced or complementised by a map following the Abkhazian standards.</dd>
<dd>Plus, additionally, a map showing what part of Abkhazia is actually controlled by whom would be very neat. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephia_karta_e555.html" title="User:Sephia karta">Sephia karta</a> 01:59, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What should we write in other articles about or mentioning places in Abkhazia, about where they are located. Are they in Abkhazia, or in Georgia, or in Abkhazia, Georgia’s breakaway region, or in Georgian autonomous republic of Abkhazia, or defined some other way. All those have been used on Wikipedia city articles, I can see. How to write in city articles? How to write in lists of places or in articles about people where we don't want a too long definition. Probably a controversial issue. -- <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBIL_6577.html" title="User:BIL">BIL</a> 23:22, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. Since it is such a controversial issue, we have to have too long definitions to maintain NPOV, imo. For the sake of neutrality, we should mention both de facto and de jure statuses of Abkhazia.

<dd>I prefer "Abkhazia, Georgia's breakaway republic", since that's what it is, a republic, and I don't believe that there is serious dispute about its being a republic. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephia_karta_e555.html" title="User:Sephia karta">Sephia karta</a> 22:24, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
