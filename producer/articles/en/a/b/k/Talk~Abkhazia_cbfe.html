<p>Ok! Now listen people! My name is George and I'm from Georgia. You all must know, that Abkazia is Georgia, not independent country. Georgia is independet country and Abkazia is Georgian land. There was Russian political games in Abkazia. We was friends, but Russia did all, for war. My father was fighting in Abkazia, not for Russians, not for politacal games...he was fighting for integrity of Georgia. Noone can take, not Abkazia and not Tskinvali. As our ancestors, we will fight for integrity of Georgia. Abkazians are Georgians...I'm from Imereti and I have friend from Racha, Achara, Guria... and we all are Georgians, as people from Abkazia. And you all who wrote this article must know, that Abkazia is not independent country, Abkazia is land of independent Georgia and I'll fight for this.<br />
P.S. Sorry for my English...<br />

<dd>Thank you for your warning, <a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnome%28G%29_5ec3.html" title="User:Gnome(G)">Gnome(G)</a>, but having just re-read the article to see how it has evolved since I last read it, I don't think I can agree. Wikipedia is pledged to hold to a neutral point of view (NPOV), supporting neither the views of one side or the other, but outlining both. Can you show me the anti-Georgian bias in passages such as these?</dd>

<li><i>Abkhazia is a de facto independent republic within the de jure borders of Georgia, on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, bordering the Russian Federation to the north. Abkhazia’s independence is not recognized by any international organization or country and is regarded as an autonomous republic of Georgia, with Sukhumi as its capital.</i></li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>On 21 February 1992, Georgia's ruling Military Council announced that it was abolishing the Soviet-era constitution and restoring the 1921 Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. Many Abkhaz interpreted this as an abolition of their autonomous status. In response, on 23 July 1992, the Abkhazia government effectively declared secession from Georgia, although this gesture went unrecognized by any other country.</i></li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>In spite of the 1994 ceasefire accord and the ongoing UN-monitored CIS peacekeeping operation, the conflict has not yet been resolved and the region remains divided between the two rival authorities, with over 83 percent of its territory controlled by the Russian-backed Sukhumi-based separatist government and about 17 percent governed by the representatives of the de jure Government of Abkhazia, the only body internationally recognized as a legal authority of Abkhazia, located in the Kodori Valley, part of Georgian-controlled Upper Abkhazia.</i></li>

<dl>

<ul>
<li><i>The United States, European Union and international organizations (UN, OSCE, Council of the European Union, etc.) recognize Abkhazia as an integral part of Georgia and are urging both sides to settle the conflict over Abkhazian autonomy through peaceful means. However, the Abkhaz separatist government and the majority of the current Abkhazian population (excluding ethnic Georgians who still populate the Gali District and the Kodori Gorge) consider Abkhazia a sovereign country, even though not recognized by any party in the world.</i></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>As far as I can see, with content like this, the article appears rather even-handed. The fact that it is not pro-Georgian does not automatically mean it is pro-Russian. If you see <i>specific</i> statements that are anti-Georgian — not merely not pro-Georgian — then please identify them on this Talk page so that they can be addressed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In writing the article on the <a href="../../../a/b/k/Abkhazian_Air_Force_dcd5.html" title="Abkhazian Air Force">Abkhazian Air Force</a>, I myself have tried to present as even-handed a story as possible, drawing upon a variety of sources and viewpoints. This was not easy, given the scarcity of English-language references, but that is the best I can do. If you can guide me to English-language Georgian sources on the Abkhaz air force and its operations, I would be just as interested in them as any coming from English-language Abkhazian or Russian sources. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 18:53, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll tell you, Abkazia is not de facto independent republic, Abkazia is de facto refublic. There are <b>Russian</b> and Abkazian separatists and Russia Rules Abkazia. anyway Abkazia is not independet. Maybe for this time is independent from Georgia, but not from Russia --<a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnome%28G%29_5ec3.html" title="User:Gnome(G)">Gnome(G)</a> 20:26, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I understand what you mean, but Wikipedia requires us to draw upon reliable, independent sources and summarize what those sources say — and cite them. This is especially true when the topic of the article is controversial. For us to present what we <i>believe</i> to be the truth — especially as the one and only possible truth — is considered "point of view" (see <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>) and, if uncited, it is at best "original research" (see <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>).</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I perceive that your main criticism of the article is that the Russian role — possibly to the extent that the <i>de facto</i> government is nothing but a Russian "puppet" government — is understated. If so, this aspect of the article can be better developed by identifying "reliable, independent" sources (preferably in English) that provide evidence supporting this theory. That would provide stronger substantiation than, say, a group of sources that are all pro-Georgian (which would be rightfully dismissed as POV, even if it were all true). <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/k/User_talk%7EAskari_Mark_1910.html" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a></small> 20:49, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>askari mark I understand wat u talk about, but only one wat I want to say&#160;: i didn't say that in this article all is not true, I said that in this article some parts is not true and bigest part(de facto independent republic of abkazia)is simple russian propagand, simple russian misinformation. Why is not writen independent republic of chechenya? becouse russians never assume this. This is world free encyclopedia and this articles read whole world.<br />
OK.. for example...do u know wat happen in abkazia? wat u know, u know from this article yes? do u know that we won this war in abkazia? and "georgian, but russian" man eduard shevardnadze said something like this&#160;: "return army from abkazia, we lose this war". there was an airport named "bombora" and there was arm and noone could enter there, but russians and shevardnadze admittance there "peace russian army", where is peace? they kill georgians in Gali. In past this war was russian political game and now this article is russian propagand<br /></p>
<p>sephia, yes it's true that in last presidential elections did not won russian's favorite. there won half georgian. He's wife is georgian. He want to settle our sonflict. why? answer about this question is simple - not russia, not america, not china...shortly noone can separate georgians. only one what i want... i want that someone delete abkazia from independet countries. P.S. Sorry for my English --<a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnome%28G%29_5ec3.html" title="User:Gnome(G)">Gnome(G)</a> 00:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But then if such a man could have become president, then surely Russia is not running the country? And you and I agree that Georgia is not running the country, so what other option does that leave than the conclusion that Abkhazia is currently de facto independent? I mean, you have the right to thoroughly dislike this fact, but to state that Abkhazia is currently indendent has got nothing to do with stating that Abkhazia should or should not be independent. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephia_karta_e555.html" title="User:Sephia karta">sephia karta</a> 10:04, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnome%28G%29_5ec3.html" title="User:Gnome(G)">Gnome(G)</a>, I can understand your English okay, so you don't need to keep apologizing for it. However, your limited skill may be what is leading you to believe this article is about an <i>independent</i> Abkhazia. It is not. It is about an Abkhazia which some people want reunited with Georgia, some want to join Russia, and some want to be independent. As can be found in the editing history for this article, every time someone has tried to add such a claim to this article, an editor has removed it. The extracts I posted above show what is truly being stated in this article — that Abkhazia is a Georgian province chiefly controlled by separatists, but which no other nation (even Russia) recognizes as an independent land.</p>
<p>As for myself, I study military conflicts around the world, so this article contains less than I know; however, to simply add further information I know about would be "original research". (In fact, if I had written a published article on the civil war, I personally would not be able to use it as a reference. With Wikipedia, I am limited by what sources I can find on the Internet or elsewhere in a language I can read.) That is where you could make a useful contribution to the development of this article. As I stated earlier, if you can locate sources readable by at least one of the contributing editors, post a link on this talk page. Don't worry about your command of English; other editors here can polish it. No one here is opposed to improving this article, even though we have editors who are partial to one side or another. The key is to rely as much as possible on sources not written by partisan authors.

<p>OK...if you study military conflicts around the world, then u know what heppened in Abkazia and u know that it's not writen here. you did not answer me on this question&#160;: why is not here - independent republic of chechnya?

<dd>Alaexis, Ldingley created his userboxes in response to the inflammatory ones invented by <a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimts_8efa.html" title="User:Dimts">User:Dimts</a> and quickly adopted by <a href="../../../%C3%B3/%C3%B0/i/User%7E%C3%93%C3%B0inn_524f.html" title="User:Óðinn">User:Óðinn</a> and yourself. I tried in vain to convince the valiant opponents of "Saakashvili’s aggressive attempts to subjugate Abkhazia and SO" that the move could only be divisive. You seem to be more cooperative and I appreciate your efforts to maintain NPOV. However, I still think that one of your Georgia-related userboxes is simply irredentist ("unification of Ossetia"? I’m sure you don’t mean the unification of Ossetia within Georgia) and the other is no less offending. Do you think that it is only Saakashvili ("the puppet of Bush’s bellicose administration" as one of your compatriots once put it here) who wants to restore the territorial integrity of Georgia while other Georgians are resolutely opposed to his "aggressive attempts"? You can freely substitute those two boxes with a single one "this user supports the partition of Georgia and Russian annexation of South Ossetia". Most of other users who support separatist movements prefer simple wording such as "this user supports the independence of X", while you have chosen the most offending way to express you political opinion. I hope you understand what I mean. Respectfully, <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 12:15, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Back to the subject, the article needs to be seriously reworked. First of all, it is becoming very long and some sections (e.g., Geography and Climate, and History) need to be abridged. Second, the article lacks the information about the poor human right conditions in Abkhazia, especially in the Georgian-populated Gali district where people are terrorized almost daily. The existing, but not widely publicized division among Abkhaz political leadership and the increasing tensions between the Abkhaz and Armenian communities are also overlooked. The Armenian Association of Georgia has recently reported several attacks on Armenian schools in Abkhazia. I'll try to find appropriate citations when I have enough time.--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 12:17, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i already said what i want to change for this time. i want that wikipedia's administration delete abkazia from indefendent countries, or move in depended countries, or in de facto republics. as i know from your personal page u are russian. i don't have problems with russians. i have many, many russian friends and kinsman, i have russian cooperators and i don't have problems with them. but i have problems with russian politics.your pattern about south ossetia and abkazia...what it means?! saakashvili don't has aggressive attempts to subjugate Abkhazia and South Ossetia. if u watch free television, not federation's, or something like this...u see, that russian "peacekeepers", ossetian guardians and "naiomniki" shooting in georgian villiges. from where comes "naiomniki"? ossetia don't have not money, not army... of course from russia and don't argue about it...becouse it know u, it know me and it knows whole world.why u wrote about saakashvili and not about kokoiti, or not about someone else? if i'll tell you that chechenya is independent republic and war in chechen republic was terorism from russia, i guess u'll don't like this. i'll tell you...let about georgian lands articles write gerogians, couse we know about our country more than someone else and about other countries lets write people from other countries. yes, it's right that it's free encyclopedia, but with this article, autors insults georgian nation. i guess wikipedia don't want this, yes? correctives in this article i'll enter then, when administration will moves this article in de facto, or in defendent countries. and remember this, abkazia is not country, abkazia is province of georgia, but for now we have problems, for russian plitics and for georgian ex-politics too.i guess u don't have problems with georgia, and with georgians, but u have problems with georgian politics. so please, we don't need to insult each other, with articles. abkazia and ossia with peace, or with war also will be our, couse this provinces are our. i see that ppl in ossetia wants to come back, but russia don't let them...but abkazians....they have more and more less time to come back, or we will do this. and at last, i'm not politician, i'm not state clerk, i'm programer and designer, simple i'm student.so lets do this, here will come georgian historians and they will write article about abkazia, and if abkazians want, they will write too.. but they'll never be independent.if u want to know, i don't need peace with abkazians anymore. but it's only my consider--<a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnome%28G%29_5ec3.html" title="User:Gnome(G)">Gnome(G)</a> 12:18, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Abkazia is in the list of independent states because it is believed to be de facto independent. It is written in beginning of that article that Abkhazia is not recognised by any other coutry. If you want to remove it from that list you have to prove Abkhazia is NOT de facto independent, i. e. that it's part of Russia (de facto). It'll be quite hard because Russia has never recognised Abkhazia as one of its regions (and as independent state also, btw). The president of Abkhazia is also elected by its citizens and is not appointed like other Russian regional leaders, moreover, as Sephia Karta has written, the candidate supported by Russia was defeated in the last elections. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaexis_da0d.html" title="User:Alaexis">Alaexis</a> 13:25, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, as an outsider to this article I would just like to point out that the first paragraph is both lopsided and contradictory. I would recommend something a little more NPOV. <i>Abkhazia is a disputed territory within the borders of the Republic of Georgia.</i> Rather than claiming it is a <i>defacto republic.</i> I would also point out that since there is a conflict on-going in Abkhazia the page should be tagged to reflect that. On this same point I would remind users to be careful of Recentism.

<dd>I'm sorry but I thoroughly disagree with you here. There is nothing contradictory in the opening paragraph, its information is factually true (according to the sources, though Gnome(G) doesn't agree with this) and it is NPOV. Stating that Abkhazia is a de facto independent republic is merely an observation about the situation on the ground, and it does not in any way qualify this situation in terms of right or wrong. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephia_karta_e555.html" title="User:Sephia karta">sephia karta</a> 09:56, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I apologize if I'm being unclear. I am not referring to the rest of the article (in general I think its a pretty good analysis of Abkhazia), I'm strictly referring to the wording of the first paragraph - the header. I'm not disputing the truth of it, but as an outsider that first paragraph does not look NPOV <b>enough</b>. Enough weight is not given to both sides. I merely suggest that the disputed status of Abkhazia be noted with more neutrality than it is currently given. However, if there is a verifiable, objective source that backs this paragraph up, please reference it- that would probably allay any concerns I have over the paragraph.--<a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECailil_97aa.html" title="User:Cailil">Cailil</a> 19:30, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

If 'separatist' is used as an adjective the phrase 'separatist appeal' does not make any sense anyway. Even if it's correct it could confuse international readers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The majority of Abkhazia population (as well as its government) is pro-independence, so it may be right to write "<i>Abkhazian Republic's appeal to be recognised ...</i>".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Consider this fragment "<i>Russian-backed separatist government...</i>" - there are people in Russia who do not support or back Abkhazian separatists, but Russia <i>as a state</i> indeed supports Abkhazia. In the same way Abkhazia <i>as a state</i> strives for independence. That's how I understand it. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaexis_da0d.html" title="User:Alaexis">Alaexis</a> 19:46, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ok...if it is not russian's and separatistes article..why someone is deleting georgians true information? Dimts proclaimed independence is not enough. if country is independent, it must be recognized. when georgia proclaimed independence it was recognized. abkazians never get recognize not fro georgia, not from world. maybe they get it from russians, couse after that abkazia will be russian teritory.</p>
<p>people let georgians and not only them write true information and don't delete it.Dimts do u know wat happned in abkazia? maybe u know, maybe u know only this that "Abkhazia (or at least some circles of Abkhazian politicians) proclaimed independence".if u want to know true, let us write true--<a href="../../../g/n/o/User%7EGnome%28G%29_5ec3.html" title="User:Gnome(G)">Gnome(G)</a> 20:44, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The way you understand it, is not the way the international community interprets the events in Abkhazia. The full support of the Russian government to the separatist regime of Abkhazia within the de jure borders of Georgia (confirmed and supported by numerous UN resolutions, Security Consul Amendments, OSCE, EU, etc). Claiming and stating in the encyclopaedic article the following statement: Abkhazian Republic is definitely a non conformance approach to NPOV guidelines. There are many self designated republics and separatist enclaves in the world today, however, Wikipedia being as educational tool for the reader who has no background in abkhazian issues should find neutral and widely acceptable (with regards to international recognitions, designations and definitions) terminology. Therefore, we must not forget that de jure or de facto, the self imposed separatist wing of Abkhaz politicians who came to power thanks to the bloody ethnic war has no legal jurisdiction or has any authority according to international law to represent the population, jurisprudence/law and legal authority of Abkhazian Autonomous Republic. When or if Abkhaz separatist regime will gain recognition as legal governmental/authority (example: Palestinian Authority is a legal body governing the Palestinian affairs both internal and external) body by international community or Georgian government (under which jurisdiction and constitution the Autonomous Republic falls) we can use such terminology as Republic, Government, State or any other means ascribed to the real states. The enclaves such as Abkhazia are no states but enclaves of some regimes. I’m a firm supporter of international law, constitutional law and legality which comes with state affairs. This is not how I see it but how UN and other international organizations have interpreted and defined this issue. <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Ldingley</a> 21:05, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh this conversation is going off-topic plus goes into deep political discussion which has nothing to do with the encyclopaedic articles. Alexis, I understand your passionate ideals toward separatist causes on the Georgian territory (fanny how your opinion differs when it comes to Russia and Israel) and liberation, unification of some newly enchanted “states.” Its no surprise for me. However, as I said, this is encyclopaedic web site and not political discussion forum (you may join fellow aps’wa at www.abkhazia.org or “unified” Ossetians at www.ossetia.ru) . When claiming this and that we usually use references (valid ones and not the ones from Russian websites), sources (primary and secondary) and quotes from various news headlines. It’s not wise to drag the subject on the encyclopaedic article. It’s not a propaganda tool but an educational experience for the reader who had no idea before about this issue. So let’s keep politics out and concentrate on expanding and creating articles for encyclopaedic purposes. Cheers mite! p.s Montenegro example has no similarities or implications for Abkhazia, this has been confirmed by UN and EU. Georgian territorial integrity and the international support which stands behind it is far different, from the case on Montenegro (where the Yugoslav constitution allowed Montenegro to separate) and Putins favourite example Kosovo. Another thing, Russia fears "independent" Abkhazia more than Georgia. If setting such precedent, its territorial integrity in Caucasus will break as the thin ice on the melting point. Again we are venturing into politics. <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Ldingley</a> 15:28, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is harder than I thought.Let me explain.</p>
<p>The article says "...Abkhaz separatist appeal to be recognized as an independent state...".Now for the first question.Who is this mysterious Abkhaz separatist?Is he a Forseman Apocalypse?Mabus from the prochesy of Nostradamus?Somebody you know?</p>
<p>Question N2.What state wants to be recognized?Maybe the Abkhazian separatists took over London and proclaimed it an independent state?Or maybe they want the international community to recognize the evil Empire from Star Wars?</p>
<p>That's why the quote "...Abkhazian Republic's appeal to be recognized as an independent state..." is the best option.<a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimts_8efa.html" title="User:Dimts">Dimts</a> 14:12, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I’m sorry, but your questions (arguments?) with their Nostradamus/London/Star Wars rhetoric make little sense. Who are the Abkhaz separatists? It is becoming quite clear in the process of reading the article and the lead section thereof. What state wants to be recognized? An answer is basically the same and whether Abkhazia and fellow breakaway/occupied entities can be categorized as “states” is a subject of ongoing discussion here and elsewhere in Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don’t think that “Abkhazian Republic's appeal to be recognized as an independent state” is the best option. I have to repeat myself: ethnic Georgians who still live within the de facto boundaries of the “Republic of Abkhazia” (and thus can be qualified as its population) or in the lands claimed but not controlled by this “republic” don’t want to secede from Georgia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don’t think that this “separatists vs. republic” issue is that big problem in the article. This is becoming just another fruitless (and typical for Wikipedia) “talk page” collision among different POVs. Folks, please stop treating the article as if reflects only a Georgian POV.

<dd>To translate all geografical names literally is not always a good idea. However in this case it might be since English is more neutral than Russian, Georgian or Abkhazian version.

<dd>Exactly. Alaexis, it is impossible to reflect everything in one map. The map should use the most widely accepted English names (Sukhumi, not Sukhum; Tkvarcheli, not Tkuarchal; Gali, not Gal). It is directly in accordance with the Wikipedia policy. The above map, however imperfect, is actually made and used by the UN. It can also be found at the UNOMIG (the UN mission operating in Abkhazia) website. I think it is wise to keep it in the article until the better one is created.--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 15:38, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>2. English, Georgian and Abkhazian variants. This means three names for some entities (like Abkhazia, Abkhazeti, Apsny) and two names for most of them (Gali, Gal; Tkuarcheli, Tkuarchal) because usually accepted English version coincides with Georgian one.</dd>
<dd>In MY opinion the current map is ok. However if someone wants to make a new one s/he should adhere to one of the aforementioned policies to be consistent. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaexis_da0d.html" title="User:Alaexis">Alaexis</a> 16:54, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Alex, I’m afraid you have somewhat a strange understanding of NPOV&#160;:) Why have you selected an apparently erroneous (but more suitable for your POV) info from the document? The same pdf contains an absolutely contradictory info on the same subject which is consistent with other UN reports and similar documents. If you want, I will post direct quotations. Since you specialize in the Abkhazia-related topics, you should know perfectly well that Georgians are not allowed to freely return to the region and those who have returned are subjected to almost everyday attacks and mistreatment. I know that such things are not reported by Russian media, but check some Georgian sources from time to time. Just to hear the opposite side.

<dd>No. The information is valid and comes from the UN report cited in the article. Kishmaria is Abkhaz. Many ethnic Abkhaz have Mingrelian surnames. Don't you remember the Abkhaz writer Gulia or the former de facto prime minister Jergenia? There was also an Abkhaz butcher Papaskiri notorious for his crimes during the Sukhumi massacre of Georgians in 1993. The surname is clearly of Mingrelian origin, "skiri" meaning "a son".--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 13:31, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if you can read, what is written on the link you provide, you will see that from the very beginning that person denounces his Georgian identity. In the same way if he were Richard Katamadze, this would not make Richard a Georgian name:).</dd>
<dd>And Akhra is Abkhaz name with no alternatives or usages by other nationalities.

<p>What the heck is going on here! It seems to me a group of Russian web brigade activists have teamed up to wage a pro-separatist and Russian neo-imperialist prop. Guys, you are too brainwashed to stay neutral when writing this article. I was just wondering why Abkhaz users don't appear on Wikipedia. It would have been more interesting to work with them rather than listen to a bunch of Russian users who pretend to be very sympathetic towards the Abkhaz "self-determination" cause, but, in reality, they regard them as a barbarian and underdeveloped people. They have simply chosen to support the Abkhaz separatist ambitions due to the fact that Russian nationalists cannot reconcile with the fact that Georgia is independent and pro-Western. This is the main reason behind the current Russo-Georgian antagonism. And this is not just my opinion. Several indepedendent observers and analysts write about an extreme anti-Georgian public opinion in Russia.</p>
<p>Now back to the article, why it is so surprisingly silent about the role of Russian Air Force in bombing and destroying Sokhumi? As far as I remember, the Russian defense minister and notorious Great Russian Chauvinist Grachev claimed that Georgians were bombing themselves. However, the Georgians shot down, in 1993, a Russian Su piloted by Major Shipko who had served in the Russian air forces and the UN military mission confirmed this fact.</p>

<p>What about making a table in the demographics section merging the 1897, 1926, 1989 and 2003 censi data which is already present and adding 1939, 1959, 1970 data. Like the one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Alaexis/Abkhazwogallery#Demographics" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Alaexis/Abkhazwogallery#Demographics" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dl>
<dd>It will be better to exclude the pre-Soviet demographics info from the table. The 1890s data are very contradictory. To give a preference to one source (B&amp;E in your case) over the rest and include it in the table while footnoting others is kind of POV. Also, your assertion that the <i>Sukhumi district occupied about the same territory as Abkhazian ASSR in Soviet times</i> is not true, because the Abkhazian lands north of the Bzyb river (including Gagra) were detached from this district in 1904 to form a part of the Black Sea district. The area was later reconquered by the Georgian army from Denikin's Whites and reincluded in Abkhazia in 1919. --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 17:20, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Currently there are 3 sets of pre-revolution numbers: from Encyclopedia of Islam (1881), from the B&amp;E encyclopedia (actually based on the 1897-census data) and 1917 data. Before any further discusion could you provide reference for the latter statistics? Then we'll consider either moving all this info into table with appropriate footnotes or leaving pre-1926 numbers in the text.</dd>
<dd>About Sukhum district. The important thing is that <b>at the time of census</b> Sukhum district had occupied the same territory as the Abkhazian ASSR did later. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaexis_da0d.html" title="User:Alaexis">Alaexis</a> 18:13, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alex, please don’t remove referenced content. Yes, the source is a Georgian book published in Tbilisi. If you don’t trust it, you should find the sources that would prove otherwise. You can go to the nearest library and verify the 1917 rural census data. The way to deal with such things is by challenging them, not by removing them.

<dd>Actually I trust this data. You've pointed out recently that Gagra was part of Sochi district (or Chernomorski, not sure) since 1904 and till the Georgian conquest. Since the census was conducted by the Provisional Government Gagra wasn't included in Abkhazia. That's the reason behind conflicting numbers, I believe. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaexis_da0d.html" title="User:Alaexis">Alaexis</a> 07:51, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>So this data is not very relevant - it includes only <b>rural</b> population of <b>part</b> of the present-day Abkhazia. It certainly doesn't deserve to be put into the table near the census numbers for the whole Abkhazia. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaexis_da0d.html" title="User:Alaexis">Alaexis</a> 07:56, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well you see that would be difficult judging that Mr Alaexis has frankly pro-separatist agenda here on Wikipedia. Therefore, i have relay serious doubts that he will generate any neutral information for this article. By using Russian and Abkhaz sources and ignoring the rest is definitely a POV approach and will not be constructive, in fact it will lead to confrontation between disputed parties here on Wikipedia. This topic is extremely controversial and pro-separatist or pro-Russian approach is not a solution for creation of a neutral article, on contrary. . <a href="../../../l/d/i/User%7ELdingley_cae2.html" title="User:Ldingley">Ldingley</a> 15:14, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

On research It appears that this editor has more than a POV on this subject. It was he that CREATED the Ethnic Cleansing page itself.. I do not want to be hard on you here but please do not RV me for POV when clearly you yourself have a very strong POV. I propose the 'Ethnic Cleansing' words to be deleted.

<dd>Dear Buffadren, what are you talking about? It was exactly what an ethnic cleansing campaign is called and it is recongnized as such in the OSCE resolutions. The ethnic cleansing of Georgians was a deliberate policy aimed at changing the region's demograhic situation. Do you really think that the Abkhaz could have broken away in the presence of the Georgian majority of 300,000? What you call 'Ethnic Cleansing' type hysteria is actually a strong collection of facts. If anything, there are numerous sources for that. --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 12:54, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kober, not quite right. The majority of republic's poptlation was non-Georgian in 1989 and, consequently, supported Abkhaz during the conflict. Regarding the issue itself I'm neutral.

<p>Buffadren you have demonstrated blunt POV pushing on this article past few days. In fact, you have removed all valuable data (supported by sources) and implemented your views and biased approach to this article. You did not consult anyone before deleting and removing the information from the article. Therefore, this is considered as vandalism and inappropriate behavior. The ethnic-cleansing has been recognized officially by numerous world organizations including UN. The Hague War Crimes tribunal has also launched the full investigation and prosecution process. Therefore, stop deleting, damaging the data on this article. First, present your sources and references for any claim, than consult your fellow Wikipedians if you want to remove anything from the article. So far you have demonstrated unconstructive, inappropriate and damaging behavior which will bring further rv wars and involvement of Administrators.

<p>Alex, can I ask you where your 1897 figures come from? I’ve just checked B&amp;E and it only says "…абхазцев и самурзаканцев (86%), мингрельцев (5,5%), греков (3,5%), армян (1,5%), русских (ок. 2%), грузин (около 1%), немцев и проч", leaving the cryptic category of "Samurzakanians" open to conflicting interpretations. I gather your calculations are based upon the other B&amp;E entry which places the number of ethnic Abkhaz at 70,000. However, it doesn’t specify whether the figure refers to the Abkhaz dwelling in Abkhazia or in the Russian Empire in general. On the other hand, we know from the 1911 Britannica that "Pop. 43,000, of whom <b>two-thirds</b> are Mingrelians and <b>one-third</b> Abkhasians, a Cherkess or Circassian race. The total number of Abkhasians in the <b>two governments</b> of Kutais and Kuban was 72,103 in 1897".<a href="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Abkhasia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Abkhasia" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> (Note: Sukhumi District was part of the Kutaisi Guberniya under the Russian rule). Indeed, Abkhaz also lived (and live) outside Abkhazia, particularly in the <a href="../../../k/u/b/Kuban.html" title="Kuban">Kuban</a> area, <a href="../../../t/b/i/Tbilisi.html" title="Tbilisi">Tbilisi</a>, <a href="../../../k/u/t/Kutaisi.html" title="Kutaisi">Kutaisi</a>, and <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjara.html" title="Adjara">Adjara</a> (where they had fled the Russian persecutions in the 1870s when Adjara was still part of the Ottoman Empire). I’m leaving the section as it is now for the time being but it definitely needs to be reworked to meet a NPOV standard and to eliminate any possible original research.--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 18:12, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For some reason they don't write <b>in what year</b> the population of Abkhazia was 43,000, so I have to assume it was 1911. So they claim Abkhaz numbered 43,000/3 = 14,000 in 1911 <b>in Abkhasia</b> (presumably Sukhum district). If we are to believe in the first Soviet census (giving 55 th.) this number is very very unlikely (considering the revolution and civil war that happened in between).</dd>
<dd>Now let's go back to 1897 figures. Unfortunately I don't know about Abkhaz population of Tbilisi or Ajaria so I have to assume if it were significant it would be reflected in the corresponding encyclopedia article (in EB1911 or B&amp;E). On the contrary it's written in the article 'Russia. Population: Statistics (addition)'&#160;: "К черкесской группе — кабардинцы (98561), по сев. склону Кавказа в Терской и Кубанской обл., и <b>абхазцы (72103) — в Кутаисской губ.</b> и другие племена (46286) в Кубанской обл." You are right that Abaza (who live in Kuban) are included in the number of Abkhaz in the encyclopedia. However they numbered only 5,000 and I have taken it into account subtacting these 5,000 from the total of 72,103. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaexis_da0d.html" title="User:Alaexis">Alaexis</a> 19:07, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don’t want to seem distrustful, but I’m going to need the hyperlinks to your references. I would also ask you to name the exact source about the number of Abaza. However, I still think that all these calculations are tentative. They are not supported by academic sources with the exception of outdated encyclopedias whose information is rather confusing and contradictory. That’s why I suggested leaving only the Soviet-era statistics. If you still insist on keeping the pre-Soviet figures, we will have to find something more useful in modern scholarly literature. I will probably return with some citations on the subject. --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 20:07, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I never said that we should dismiss the 1897 data even though they are far from being credible compared to the Soviet statistics. The census did not even classify ethnic groups properly (“Samurzakanians” is the most illustrative example). I just thought it would be better to move that data from the table to the text, explaining all inconsistencies across the contemporary sources. Actually, this seems to me the only way to avoid POV. A series of calculations and combinations you did can be qualified as original research. We cannot dismiss the 1911 EB either. “This number is very very unlikely” is not an argument. Britannica is an important source and it should be included in the section.

<dd>Only God knows what a mixed Abkhaz-Mingrelian identity is. Never heard of such thing. Sephia, the book you are citing is notorious for its one-sided approach and is actually a political pamphlet edited by the established anti-Georgian demagogue George Hewitt who is, btw, educated in Tbilisi and fluent in Georgian, but evidently loves her Abkhaz wife too much to stay neutral. Anyway, the section desparately needs to be balanced by more neutral sources. I’m currently working on this.--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 14:46, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A mixed Abkhaz-Mingrelian identity means that part of the people consider themselves Abkhaz, part Mingrelian, part report Abkhaz as a mother tongue, part Mingrelian, and this need not match, so you have people that report Abkhaz nationality but Mingrelian mother tongue. Nothing so strange here that only God would know. I don't care that you find Hewitt not neutral (you may very well be right), the article is written by Daniel Müller, and unless you prove otherwise (e.g. by citing passages from the article that you find biased), he is a perfectly legitimate source. It's not as though he is inventing these figures, you know. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephia_karta_e555.html" title="User:Sephia karta">sephia karta</a> 15:04, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don’t overreact. The figures are not invented, but they are interpreted differently. That’s why I said that the section should be balanced with the information from different sources. There is not a single reference to any "mixed identity" in the Imperial Russian demographic accounts. The 1886 data contains a separate category called "Samurzakanians" (without any further details about their identity), while the 1897 census classifies them together with Abkhaz. In the 1922-23 All-Georgian Census (which included Abkhazia) Samurzakanians are also counted as Abkhaz, but in the later censuses they are classified as Georgians. Neither Muller not Hewett is the only author who has studied Abkhazia. Most scholars I have read agree that the Samurzakanians were chiefly Georgians (Mingrelians) with a minority of Abkhaz. Don’t you think that all these controversies should be reflected in the article to meet a NPOV policy?--<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 15:33, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>2 Sephia karta. Thx for adding this info.</dd>
<dd>Kober, you are artificially making the issue more complex than it really is. The 1897 census grouped the people by their mother-language (Georgian, Mingrelian, Abkhaz; no mention of Samurzakan language because it doesn't exist). There were 59,469 Abkhaz (by mother-language) in the Kutaisi guberniya in 1897.</dd>
<dd>BE does not even state to what year do their numbers belong. Let's add something like: "EB1911 states that Abkhaz numbered one third of 43,000 <b>sometime</b>". Of course we cannot divide 43,000 by 3 because it would be original research&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>ps. Btw your link to EB1911 does not work any more. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaexis_da0d.html" title="User:Alaexis">Alaexis</a> 16:35, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm... Artificially complicating? I <i>would rather call it striving for consistency</i>&#160;:) The 1897 census categorizes Samurzakanians together with Abkhaz. Not on a language basis, I guess. As for 1911EB, you could think of a better solution. Just insert a verbatim quotation (don't be afraid of copyright problems; the edition is in public domain) something like this: "According to the 1911 edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica,... in <b>the early 1900s</b>". Why to make things <i>artificially complex</i>? Anyway, I see no point in further arguing over the topic until I find enough time to retrieve some other academic sources and rewrite the section. --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 17:37, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The map that shows ethinc make-up of Abkhazia does not work. Those videos are certainly not *unique* as they are only links to youtube, googlevideo etc. Some pictures appear to be <s>stolen</s> borrowed from abkhazeti.ru site (look <a href="http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/abkhazia/action_pics%203.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/abkhazia/action_pics%203.htm" rel="nofollow">there</a>).

<dd>Well, you have one misinterpretation of my words, and one direct lie in your message. Misinterpretation is that I said UNIQUE concerning the photographs. And unique they are. Abkhazeti.ru does not have all the photoes from this site that you are deleting. The lie is that the photoes that are both on this site and on abkhazeti.ru are not stolen. The site has direct links on abkhazeti.ru. Besides, abkhazeti.ru has been also deleted from this Wikipedia article. Thus, you are trying to leave no source providing these pictures in the Abkhazia article. <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPirveli_cebd.html" title="User:Pirveli">Pirveli</a> 21:16, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've checked <a href="http://abkhazia.e-caucasia.com" class="external free" title="http://abkhazia.e-caucasia.com" rel="nofollow">http://abkhazia.e-caucasia.com</a>. There's quite a lot of articles there and some of them seem to be informative (those about language, religious situation, famous people). There's also good gallery there (I especially liked the photos of <a href="http://abkhazia.e-caucasia.com/index.php?option=com_easygallery&amp;act=categories&amp;cid=45&amp;Itemid=75" class="external text" title="http://abkhazia.e-caucasia.com/index.php?option=com_easygallery&amp;act=categories&amp;cid=45&amp;Itemid=75" rel="nofollow">frescoes in Pitsunda cathedral</a>).

<dd>About external links in general, Wikipedia already has well-established <a href="../../../l/i/n/WP%7ELINKS_dec6.html" title="WP:LINKS">guidelines</a> in place. Our own personal opinions must always take a backseat to the rules. Now, the way to deal with nationalistic links (on either side) is to mark their bias. This can be done by "sectioning off" the links within subcategories (for instance, pro-independence / anti-independence) or it be done by marking each individual link (for instance, adding a parenthesis afterwards to alert the readers to the bias of the link). But do not remove wellestablished links which have been part of the stable version of the article for a year, or more. - <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Mauco_97a3.html" title="User:William Mauco">Mauco</a> 14:34, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please read my post more carefully. I didn't remove the links just because they are nationalistic, but because of their unreliability. The real issue in the case is not whether they are pro- or anti-independence. One of them (abkhazia.org) belongs to a non-functional political party and has not been updated since 2004. The other contains non-scholar articles and ethnic slurs. They have been part of the stable version of the article for a year because nobody cared to check them. --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 14:45, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I personally don't think we need to have any external links at all. I know that might seem a bit radical, but most of those links don't really help the article, plus we already have enough external links in the "References" section. I say we trim all unneeded links, and keep only a small number of them. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 03:46, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's *too* radical imho. Besides there's a consensus about most of the links - there exists a controversy about only 2 or 3 of them. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaexis_da0d.html" title="User:Alaexis">Alaexis</a> 03:54, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, let's look at them in detail:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<pre>
   * President of the Republic of Abkhazia. Official site
</pre>
<p>// definitely needed; the site of the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic should also be added if it exists</p>
<pre>
   * BBC Regions and territories: Abkhazia
</pre>
<p>// contains more or less the same information as the article does presented in concise and nonbiased manner. Probably could be <b>removed</b>.</p>
<pre>
   * Abkhazia profile page at Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation
</pre>
<p>// contains an overview of the history of Abkhazia. Could be <b>removed</b>.</p>
<pre>
   * Publication of the United States Institute of Peace: Sovereignty after Empire Self-Determination Movements in the Former Soviet Union
</pre>
<p>// nice balanced paper by G. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starovoitova.html" title="Starovoitova">Starovoitova</a> about post-soviet conflicts. I'd vote for <b>keeping</b>.</p>
<pre>
   * The Autonomous Republic of Abkhazeti - from Georgian National Parliamentary Library
</pre>
<p>// presents Georgian view of the Abkhazia's history; should be <b>kept</b> imho</p>
<pre>
   * <s>Former Soviet war zones |The hazards of a long, hard freeze, The Economist, 19 August, 2004</s>
</pre>
<p><s>//The Economist is my favourite English-language magazine, but the link is to the paid content so I'll delete it right now</s></p>
<pre>
   * Sun and Surf, but Also Lines in the ‘Russian’ Sand, The New York Times, August 20, 2006
</pre>
<p>// this link also requires registration, although a free one. Therefore I think this link should be <b>removed</b>.</p>
<pre>
   * Site devoted to Abkhazia
</pre>
<p>// see the arguments in the previous section</p>
<pre>
   * (English) Abkhazia.com Official website refugees from Abkhazia
</pre>
<p>// should be <b>kept</b> imho</p>
<pre>
   * (Russian) Abkhazian news
</pre>
<p>// Abkhazian news from the Georgian perspective - let's <b>keep</b> it</p>
<pre>
   * (Russian) State Information Agency of the Abkhaz Republic
</pre>
<p>// the same from the Abkhazian perspective. Definite <b>keep</b>.</p>
<pre>
   * (Russian) www.abkhazeti.ru Official web of IDPs from Abkhazia and IAG Aphkhazeti
</pre>
<p>// this could not be an OFFICIAL site because there's alredy another official site here. I think it could be <b>removed</b>, otherwise some similar site from the other side (like abkhaziya.org) should be added.</p>
<pre>
   * Picture Gallery - Georgian Refugees in Abkhazian War
</pre>
<p>// could be <b>moved</b> to the article about the war</p>
<pre>
   * (Russian) www.apsny.ru
</pre>
<p>// it's a regularly updated site about Abkhazia. I think it should <b>remain</b>.</p>
<pre>
   * Abkhazian language
</pre>
<p>// nonpartisan site about Abkhaz language. It's already present in the <a href="../../../a/b/k/Abkhaz_language.html" title="Abkhaz language">Abkhaz language</a> article so it could be <b>removed</b></p>
<pre>
   * Special Abkhazia on Caucaz.com, Weekly Online about South Caucasus
</pre>
<p>// there are no articles about Abkhazia newer than 2005. I'd rather <b>remove</b> it.</p>
<pre>
   * Abkhazia Provisional Paper Money
</pre>
<p>// there are two pictures of modified Soviet notes there. i don't have an opinion about this one</p>
<pre>
   * Orthodox Churches of Abkhazia
</pre>
<p>// nonpartisan site devoted to the ancient church-buildings of Abkhazia; while there are no articles about Abkhaz architecture and culture it should <b>remain</b> here</p>
<pre>
   * Official site of the Orthodox Eparchy of Abkhazia
</pre>
<p>// Could be moved to the article about religion in Abkhazia when there'll be one. For now let's <b>keep</b> it here. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaexis_da0d.html" title="User:Alaexis">Alaexis</a> 05:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The BBC link should stay because many people will check Wikipedia’s accuracy in the sources like BBC. Your arguments about <a href="http://abkhazia.e-caucasia.com" class="external free" title="http://abkhazia.e-caucasia.com" rel="nofollow">http://abkhazia.e-caucasia.com</a> are rather weak. How can you take seriously the source which claims Tbilisi to be "a Georgianized ancient Abkhaz city"? This link should be removed. Other pro-Abkhaz, pro-Georgian, or neutral sources contain enough information about the Abkhaz culture and history. There’s no need to adopt the websites with marginal POVs.

<dd>The alleged "official website" of the Orthodox Eparchy of Abkhazia is another issue. An eparchy (i.e. diocese) is normally a subdivision of Orthodox Christian Church. The site doesn’t even say to which church the eparchy belongs. This is simply not serious. The Eparchy of Abkhazia (Tskhum-Abkhazeti) is a canonical territory of the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgian_Orthodox_Church_d8c0.html" title="Georgian Orthodox Church">Georgian Orthodox Church</a> and the fact was officially and unambiguously recognized by the Russian Holy Synod in 2003. Then what this Eparchy of Abkhazia website means? Which church it is a member of? There are no independent or self-governing eparchies. So better remove this absurdity from the page and don’t load the article with POV links. --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 06:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How about less than 10 links? Suggestion: 3 from Abkhazia, 3 for the Georgian position, and 3 which are independent/outside/neutral. Just pick the best. Instead of deleting the others, move them to the relevant forks. For instance, a site which only deals with the war doesn't need to be in the main Abkhazia article, but is suited in the separate article dealing specifically with the war of Abkhazia. - <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Mauco_97a3.html" title="User:William Mauco">Mauco</a> 05:06, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
