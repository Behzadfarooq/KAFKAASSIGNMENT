<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lincoln's Depression</span></h2>
<p>I'm surprised to see no mention of Lincoln's life-long depression. See this article for example: <a href="http://www.mcmanweb.com/article-225.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.mcmanweb.com/article-225.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcmanweb.com/article-225.htm</a> 62.231.39.150 11:58, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Yet another controversy</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Slaves were real property per the rights of slave owners and signed contracts at purchase. The Federal Government considered slaves property. Slaves had no legal standing. Sources are all over the place to verify these facts. When Lincoln, by himself, freed the slaves without legislation passed in the House and Senate this was an abuse of power. Lincoln justified this by stating the country was at war. There was no war powers act in the 1860's. Lincoln as the head of the Executive Branch violated the law when he freed the slaves. Ameerica is not a dictatorship. Someone has stated, and there are zero sources to prove this, that "many" believed that when Lincoln freed the slaves he was returing the "property" (slaves) to the rightful owner, the slave himself. This needs to be removed. This is merely left wing crap and a personal opinon. Slaves had no legal standing. America is a land of laws. The slaves were property, not people in the sense that they had no liberties or legals standing.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Lincoln abolished slavery without the consent of the House or Senate. There was no vote. I want this fact included. The act of freeing the slaves is the only know case in U.S. history where the Executive Branch of government (the President) took real propery from American owners without any legislation or vote in Congress. This is amazing history. There was no vote to end slavery. Lincoln did this on his own and then said the power to do this was his because the nation was at war. This is remarkable given all the laws that were passed to guarnatee the slave holders rights to his real property, slaves. Do you people not see how significant this is?? This is an amazing American fact. This was an act of dictatorial rule. This make anything the Bush administration or even Watergate look like childs play. People need to understand how much power our presidents used to have. Today our presidents have virtually no power compared to 150 years ago..</p>
<p><br />
I think Lincoln's life and career must be the focus of more popular misunderstanding than any other American politician. We often imagine Lincoln as a modern-day liberal, a free-spirited proponent of big government, executive power and equality for African-Americans. In fact, Lincoln was very much a man of the 19th century U.S. who embodied the prevailing mores and limitations of that period. Thus, Lincoln actually believed in limited executive power, strict construction of the constitution, and federalism (very strongly, too), and his racial attitudes were far closer to the 19th century model than today's views.</p>
<p>I deleted a comment about how the emancipation proclamation freed slaves in areas the Union army occupied. The reality is actually much more complex and in fact the Union army usually tried to keep the slaves laboring on plantations under conditions very similar to slavery. The consensus is that the slaves mostly freed themselves by escaping from their masters. But the emancipation proclamation by its own force did not free the slaves and in practice often led to something close to peonage. -- Proudly anonymous</p>
<ul>
<li>It seems you wan't to portray the common positive image of Lincoln, just change the view of him as a 'modern-day liberal' to that of a right-wing conservative (as I am guessing you are - not that there is anything wrong with that). Yet saying "his racial attitudes were far closer to the 19th century model than today's views" is a more postivie way of saying he was a white supremist (in that he though whites to be above blacks), and "Lincoln actually believed in limited executive power, strict construction of the constitution" is just plain incorrect - Lincoln probably had more executive power than any President ever, and would ignore the constitution when he thought it 'necessary'. Saying he believed in "strict construction of the constitution" and the like is basically just saying that he would have supported modern day conservatives, and seems like an argument in favor of conservatism, using an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">Appeal to authority</a> fallacy - Lincoln was good, and he would have wanted this ...(whatever I happen to support). I'm sorry if I have misconstued what you said. - 00:01, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>It is also misleading to say it freed few slaves. Slaves weere officially freed as territories were occupied &amp; before the proclamation, Lincoln had to stop generals from freeing slaves. What is your source for this or any of your changes? --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 08:36, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Why is it misleading to say that it "freed a few slaves"? What source do you have that contradicts my account? You are only going on your own speculation based on irrelevant bits of info. "Officially" is a weasel word in this context. Blacks "officially" won civil rights as a result of the Fourteenth Amendment, yet of course it took a century for them to "actually" win Civil Rights.</dd>
<dd>Yes, Lincoln had to stop two Radical Republican generals from freeing slaves. Fremont didn't last long after his order and Hunter's order obviously did not reflect military policy. But what does that have to do with the Emancipation Proc.'s effects? That fact says absolutely nothing about the central claim in this dispute. Why did you even cite it?</dd>

<li>The very page you cite discusses assisting freedmen in enforcement of contracts with employers - work is not necessarily slavery --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 13:27, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Discusses assisting freedmen in enforcement of contracts with employers"-- who is the agent in that sentence? Not the Union Army, which presumably would be of little help in intervening in contract negotiations with itself. I am genuinely curious, JimWae, as to why you are so confident that the Union Army would scrupulously ensure fairness in its dealings with the freed slaves. I am also curious as to what role you think the Union Army actually played in freeing blacks. I think your views on this issue are not only wrong (and will be proved so soon when I have more time to track down references), but rather naive.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The book is Louis Gerteis, From Contraband to Freedman: Federal Policy Toward Southern</li>
</ul>
<p>Blacks, 1861-1865 (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1973). He makes the point that the main goal of the Union Army was to keep blacks working in slavery-like conditions without real contracts.</p>
<p>One historian writes of wartime contracts with blacks (Lawrence Powell, Tulane Univ., "New Masters: Northern Planters during the Civil War and Reconstruction"): "[B]y fixing wages it denied a laborer the right to bargain as a free agent with his employers; by obligating a laborer to contract for a year, it seriously restricted his freedom of movement and his freedom to change employers. The entire apparatus was really a system of vagrancy laws that left black people with the choice of working on the plantations or laboring on the public works. And it was even bolstered by such familiar methods of slave control as the pass system and patrols (led by U.S. provost marshals), even though corporal punishment was forbidden or delegated to military authorities."</p>
<p>Here is radical Republican general Benjamin Butler, who controlled Louisiana, in a letter to S.P. Chase:</p>
<p>"Be sure that I shall treat the negro with as much tenderness as possible but I assure you it is quite impossible to free him here and now without a San Domingo. A single whistle from me would cause every white man's throat be cut in this city. Accumulated hate has been piled up here between master and servant, until it is fearful. . . There is no doubt that an insurrection is only prevented by our Bayonets"</p>
<p>It is a moot point now because the weasel wording, "allowed the Union Army...", is not technically untrue though it is incomplete.</p>

<dd>Did Congress approve? YES: before Lincoln issued his emancipation proc. Congress passed the Confiscation acts freeing the slaves of owners in rebellion. Lincoln in Sept 1862 said that any areas still in rebellion in Jan 1 1863 he would seize their slaves. He did so--that is called war powers. He also burned plantations and arrested people That's war powers. As for the owners they had repudiated the US governments and its laws and joined a foreign country. They lost their legal standing by doing that. BAD mistake. As for the slaves, they were better off. As for the North--it was better off because it shortened the war. Note that Lincoln did NOT free the slaves inside the parts of the USA controlled by the federal government. "American is not a dictatorship" -- well yes it is, in wartime. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 02:23, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are wrong. The House and Senate never voted or approved Lincoln abolishing the legal institution callled slavery. This was not until the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Give me the name of the legislative bill, date, and names of the member sof the House who supported it. It does not exist. Because a handful of memebers of Congress want somethng dooes not make it the law. Hundreds of laws were passed giving slave owners rights. Not one law was ever passed by the house or senate abolishing slavery. Not one..-onenex1000.</p>

<p>That means: every one who aids the rebellion shall have his slaves liberated. That's not quite the same as abolishing the legal institution of slavery (done by XIII Amendment), but it does prove Congress wanted all slaves owned by rebels to be liberated. And that is what Lincoln did in Emancipation Proclamation. qed. <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llhb&amp;fileName=037/llhb037.db&amp;recNum=3605" class="external text" title="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llhb&amp;fileName=037/llhb037.db&amp;recNum=3605" rel="nofollow">actual copy of the bill passed by Congress</a><a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 11:36, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It represents Lincoln's point of view, as you have shown, and thus belongs in the article one way or another. It is not, however, a neutral description of Lincoln's war aims. From the southern point of view the union between the northern and the southern states had been abolished. Those were certainly the facts on the ground, regardless of legalities. Let's say you drop a statue on the ground and it breaks. You try to patch it together again. Are you trying to "preserve the statue"? It could be argued, perhaps, but it doesn't strike me as the most natural way to express what you're doing. Or let's say you want a divorce from your husband. You've moved out and you believe that you've legally got a divorce. Your husband disagrees and keeps pursuing you, saying that the divorce isn't legal. Is he "preserving the marriage"? Perhaps, from his point of view, but it may not be how you would like to put things. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukurth</a> 09:32, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, it is how I would put things, since that it the way I phrased it. It is no more point of view that claiming that there was no union left to be preserved. You seem to have a very strange view of historical documents, in that case. <i>Prior</i> to the outbreak of hostilities, in 1856 and 1860, the Republican Party stated that the Union must and shall be preserved. You claim to know what Lincoln's War aims were, yet you refuse to accept the reasons Lincoln stated both before and during the war. TO use your divoce analogy: There is a legal way of getting a divorce and an illegal way. Moving out is not a legal method of getting a divorce. If you were to get remarried simply because you felt the marriage had been disolved without following the legal method, you would be guilty of bigamy.<a href="../../../s/h/s/User%7EShsilver_5f57.html" title="User:Shsilver">Shsilver</a> 11:42, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>To put it another way, there was no legal means for secession from the union, just as there was no legal method for the colonists to dissolve their ties with England in the 1770s. What made the latter legal was the fact of their victory at the end of the war. What kept the former illegal (and meant the union had, in fact, been preserved) was the fact of the defeat of the secessionists.<a href="../../../s/h/s/User%7EShsilver_5f57.html" title="User:Shsilver">Shsilver</a>!

<dd>The union was not preserved. It was broken and then reestablished by force of arms. Not everyone agrees with your idea that the secession was illegal and those who do typically don't use your curious "to the victor go the history books" reasoning. Preserving the union could potentially be NPOV wording for the Republican antebellum policy but it's certainly not NPOV wording for their policy during the war. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukurth</a> 13:02, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Are you serious about wondering about accuracy? Read a biography on Lincoln. He grew up under pretty bad circumstances. Read With Malice Toward None by Stephen Oates.

<li>Lincoln mentions this in his own auto-biography published shortly before his nomination for the Republican ticket, for the 1860 election. This is attested to by nearly every biography of Lincoln ever written... So unless there is a conserted effort of Historians to make up the legend of Lincoln, it can be taken as variably true. Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of Team of Rivals, offers a sound description of Lincoln's early life... which includes the meak beginnings.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Timeline?</span></h2>
<p>How many people see a value in this <b>Timeline</b> section that was added recently? I deleted it once and remarked that it was superficial. It is now back and although it has a lot more entries, is still a relatively superficial collection of random dates in Lincoln's life (and rather poorly formatted by Wikipedia standards at that). Are there other significant biographies that include a similar section? I watch over more than 200 American Civil War biographies and cannot recall any, other than a few generals who have lists of command histories. My concern about the section is that when people notice it and see some of the trivial entries, they will pile on and add so many events that it will become unwieldy. Dates of battles, speeches, appointment of generals and cabinet officers, signing of laws, etc. The article is long enough already.

<p>When the timeline gets too big it gets moved to its own entry, just like every other article on popular subjects. The <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> entry is now divided into 24 (and growing) seperate entries, all accessable from the main extry. Timelines are now standard in the New York Times, and Time magazine so that information is readily accessable in a chronological order. You say: "The article is long enough already". I say: No article is too long until all the facts are presented in a clear manner. The same might be said of the indexes placed in the back of books. There are pages and pages of entries I have no interest in, but they are there for not just me. In several books I own the combined space used for the bibliography, endnotes, and the index comprise 1/3 of the publication. You say: "My concern about the section is that when people notice it and see some of the trivial entries". I say: What is a trivial fact? I guess something your not interested in. We all have our own interests in Lincoln: Family, War, Assasination. They appear trivial to scholars of the other areas of expertise. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 23:21, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>OK, I will follow your suggestion of moving that section to its own article if and when it becomes unwieldy. But a couple of comments regarding your reply:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. Triviality is, of course, subjective, but it also can be judged in relative terms. If I were to create a list of the top 15 events in the life of Abraham Lincoln, I would not have included two US census forms, as an example. I believe that most objective people would consider those as trivial events in the course of his (or anyone's) life and career.</dd>
<dd>2. I do believe that articles can be too long if you look at the objective of creating an encyclopedia. The art of writing an encyclopedia article includes understanding how to describe a person or event in a concise manner—what is most important and what should be left out. An encyclopedia is not a compendium of all known information on the subject (such as the World Wide Web itself hopes to be), nor is it a database of tabular data. Putting too much information into an encyclopedia article is doing a disservice to the typical reader who wants to get directly to the salient points and does not wish to wade through insignificant details. For instance, suppose I found Lincoln's shoe size, the color and styles of suits he wore, the kind of meals he ate, a list of all of the White House staff members, the text of all his speeches, or a list of all the lawsuits he handled in Illinois. All of this is information that may be of interest to <i>someone</i>, but it merely detracts from the important information about his life as a man and a wartime leader by taking up space and sapping attention spans. This is not to say that all Wikipedia articles meet this objective because they do not. I do attempt to impose such standards on articles that I edit, though obviously there is the opportunity for people to disagree with me on what is important. I admit that it is quite difficult to have such standards for articles that have as many editors as <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> or the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, so I tread lightly in such places.</dd>
<dd>3. Your example concerning indexes is really beside the point. They are artifacts of old technology. Someday when printed materials have faded, search technology such as Google will render indexes obsolete. But a related artifact is germane to my argument. I think you will find that most books today no longer have footnotes clogging the bottoms of pages, distracting readers. They put them in the back to be less obtrusive. Including too much trivia is equally distracting. (Now in your case, the timeline section is neatly walled off from the rest of the text, so my distraction argument admittedly carries less weight.)</dd>

<li>"However, he stated in a debate with Stephen A. Douglas that he opposed to granting citizenship to blacks and said: "I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race." &lt;--I placed this in response to his quote that all men are created equal.</li>
<li>"However, a few weeks before signing the Proclamation, and after it had already been drafted, Lincoln said in a letter to Horace Greeley: "My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union." &lt;--obviously he was doing this as a means to an end, rather than for the cause of emancipation.</li>

<li>The photograph linked to is of the president lying in repose, unlike how it is billed;</li>

<dd>I'm still calling shenanigans on this:
<ul>
<li>Lincoln was shot behind the left ear and the bullet was lodged behind his left eye. I find it difficult to believe that if this photograph was taken "but a few hours post mortem", that the pillow he is lying on would be free of blood, that his neck would be clean, that his hair would be arranged neatly, and that there would be nothing but white pillows surrounding his head.</li>
<li>I find it difficult to believe that, in 1865, as a doctors and statesmen are surrounding the dying president, a photographer was setting up his equipment in the corner to take a picture for posterity. Unlike today, that sort of thing didn't happen back then, because it's not as though they were going to print it in the newspaper the next day.</li>
<li>I don't even believe that this is a photograph at all. Photographic technology at the time Lincoln was assassinated was in the form of ferrotype, a process which results in images that look like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ferrotype.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ferrotype.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Even accounting for possible digital retouching for better contrast and assuming the image was scanned in from a book (presumably printed with halftones as there is a considerable vertical interference pattern), features such as the slight indentation in the nose or the slight fold between the nose and the mouth would not be evident. Given that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_B._Bachelder_d1e7.html" title="John B. Bachelder">John B. Bachelder</a> was a talented portrait painter and engraver, I suspect that this is actually an engraving of Linocln lying in state.</li>
<li>If this is such a shockingly important historical find, why is Wikipedia the only site on the internet that mentions it? Why is the only image a closely cropped shot of Lincoln's head?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The book that this image allegedly appears in is available in my public library. I'll check it out this evening and read for myself what it says. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Deken_ff24.html" title="User:Stephen Deken">Stephen Deken</a> 16:30, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Such language. Is that really neccessary? -- XXXX</p>
<p>Might be an authentic hoax... that is, a hoax well-known-enough to be worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Googling on <i>"Lloyd Ostendorf" death</i> makes it clear that Ostendorff was born in 1925, lived in Dayton, Ohio, and died in 2000, and <i>was</i> a well-known and important collector of Lincolniana.</p>
<p>The Ostendorf book exists, but was published in 1998, not 2004 so the photograph is not a very "new" discovery.</p>
<p>Not sure whether this link will work if you don't have a Google account, or if you have a different Google account from mine. <a href="http://print.google.com/print?id=Eisr3xoQkhcC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;dq=Lincoln's+Photographs:+A+Complete+Album&amp;prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3DLincoln's%2BPhotographs:%2BA%2BComplete%2BAlbum&amp;sig=EJ5tVYUcZKzKNTlWuwIbGBGMl4Y&amp;auth=DQAAAH0AAACHnuQtk-cFb04osdmIvXb0CS5vq8qAR_ngkwvbs8ZkJ1POTNYPRVuRxNZynruelkLHjSgEENXirEBb5ZqV8tDtnm5nMV4nv2R48UBxfqTabJh0zp-H-bZ5lACgwDIh1D-OJZlBNVleZmWrrjDzqOnPfYsOotehIr64hUrzEEWquQ" class="external autonumber" title="http://print.google.com/print?id=Eisr3xoQkhcC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;dq=Lincoln's+Photographs:+A+Complete+Album&amp;prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3DLincoln's%2BPhotographs:%2BA%2BComplete%2BAlbum&amp;sig=EJ5tVYUcZKzKNTlWuwIbGBGMl4Y&amp;auth=DQAAAH0AAACHnuQtk-cFb04osdmIvXb0CS5vq8qAR_ngkwvbs8ZkJ1POTNYPRVuRxNZynruelkLHjSgEENXirEBb5ZqV8tDtnm5nMV4nv2R48UBxfqTabJh0zp-H-bZ5lACgwDIh1D-OJZlBNVleZmWrrjDzqOnPfYsOotehIr64hUrzEEWquQ" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> If that link doesn't work, go to [<a href="http://books.google.com" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com" rel="nofollow">Google Book search</a>], search on Lincoln's Photographs: A Complete Album.

On p. 225, it refers to Lloyd Ostendorf, gives the book reference, and mentions "some have challenged the authenticity of his latest finds" which include "a photograph that he argues depicts Lincoln after death." The Ostendorf book was published in 1998, not 2004.</p>
<p>I have no idea whether the link to the image is actually the image in the book or not.</p>

<p>The text of the latter explains "Shown above is a reproduction of the death-bed scene painted by John. H. Littlefield, once a law student in Lincoln’s office. Photographs of those in attendance, including the twenty-three year old Surgeon Taft, standing to the right of Lincoln’s oldest son, Robert, were used as models. It is interesting that in his diary Taft writes that he spent most of the night supporting the President’s head in order that the wound would not press on the pillow." That's why Taft's hands are holding Lincoln's head.</p>

<li>Ok, I've got the 1998 edition of the book in my hands, and sure enough, this image is on page 374, labeled "O-130" and generally meets the description offered by Cathytreks. In that vein, I owe her an apology for branding it a hoax; I am sorry, Cathy. The caption and facing text reads:</li>

<dl>
<dd>"The reverse of this photograph of Lincoln in death bears the inscription:
<dl>
<dd>"Lincoln photograph taken by Uncle Bachelder after Lincoln died.</dd>

</dd>
<dd>"The life-like quality and photographic perspective is evident in the image even thought [sic] some retouching has been applied. The exposure was evidently taken under poor lighting conditions and under difficult circumstances; the task was obviously undertaken in purposeful secrecy."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The facing page reads:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"A post-mortem portrait. An extremely rare carte-de-viste discovered in the extate of artist and engraver John B. Bachelder. The heretofore unpublished photograph of Abraham Lincoln seen at the right was taken on approximately April 16, 1865, after the President's death. Apparently, it was to serve as a model for the death-bed scene produced by Bachelder in collaboration with Alonzo Chappel."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The photograph, in general, looks exactly like the version offered by Cathytreks, except that it is surrounded by apparently underexposed media (or perhaps vignetted, as the text indicates it has been retouched). To me, seeing the reproduction in the book, it looks even more like a drawing than it did before, but I suppose it's not. However, Ostendorf asserts in the text that it was taken on the 16th, the day after he died, and I agree with that. This is not a candid action shot. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Deken_ff24.html" title="User:Stephen Deken">Stephen Deken</a> 00:28, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My cousin placed the piece with my name and authority as I had seen the photograph in the late Ostedorfs last book , It made me then and makes me cry now still sad somehow, I have no doubt it is as the article surounding it claimed,and that it was very much a photograph (albiet somewhat nessisarily imo retouched) one of the late beloved president but a few hours post (within a mere 24 maxiumum!) mortem~... it is truly documented, it is clearly unlike any other porported hoax or falseity, etc;...When I look at "that honest abe" PHOTOGRAPH ...just seeing the truth of death there...seeing Lincolns sallow face and the tired sad eye of lincoln....grieves me still, knowing in my heart it is real......YES, it was Abraham Lincoln at repose...for awhile, aand our last clear look for all the world to see (aside from that small blurry photo taken in N.Y.C. while he lay in state in city hall there) on his slow final trip home to Springfield.</p>

<dd>The basic issue is whether any discussion of this photo belongs in a Wiki article on the life of AL? There are thousands of photos of Lincoln.

<p>Surely a Lincoln historian such as yourself Rjensen, must be aware of the authentic nature of the photograph of Lincoln taken by John Batchelder in the White House only hours after his body taken there, the photograph proven since as authentic taken by Batchelder within 24 hours of Lincolns assasination, re: Lloyd Ostendorf's book <i>Lincoln's Photographs: A Complete Album" photograph # "0-130"),</i></p>
<p>From the book: "The reverse of this photograph of Lincoln in death bears the inscription: "Lincoln photograph taken by Uncle Bachelder after Lincoln died." "The life-like quality and photographic perspective is evident in the image even thought [sic] some retouching has been applied. The exposure was evidently taken under poor lighting conditions and under difficult circumstances; the task was obviously undertaken in purposeful secrecy."</p>
<p>This alone shows the importance of this photograph and its ever gaining prominence of study amoungst Lincoln researchers and scholars.</p>

<p>So "Uncle Bachelder" a noted photographer as well known as Brady in his day, seemingly did in fact take that hidden historic shot, then proccessed them at Bradys studio...so what? As this is not a hoax situation... the truth wil prevail as its unveiled, right guys?, I feel now after reading that article Rjensen provided us in my belief of the photographs authenticity all the more. , the article which went out of its way to not mention the actual Batchelder photograph, plus it also mistated several key facts of the events of the immediate days following the asasination on April 16, 1865 regarding Batchelder, Brady, and others. The death photo "O-130" of Lincoln in its authenticity is proved now more than ever.

<p>You are the hoax...and are wrong about the things you say, and you know it. The photograph is authentic, and when proved you will apologise, no one talks that way to me, I'm a respectable lady and a history major with a photographic aspect in that I understand the back ground of the photos, the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_B._Bachelder_d1e7.html" title="John B. Bachelder">John B. Bachelder</a> current next of kin will verify the photo for a proper forensic study. The photo exists and if you looked and opened your eyes you would see it was a real photograph of the dead president taken under difficult conditions and we need a 1st generation copy to prove to doubters such as yourself...It will be done, as I have contacted the son of the author already and he will send me via email or snail mail too, better detailed photo(s) and more background material.</p>
<p>I'd Be careful (some of you)if I were you.. in what you say unless you seek a libel and slander suit for your lies about Lincolns photograph and your outright rudeness about it after its proven true!</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln the day after he was murdered. (april 16th 1865)</p>
<p>Source: private collection of the Batchelder family, This "Lincoln in Death" Photograph is over 140 years old.</p>
<p>The photograph of Lincoln taken by John B. Batchelder the noted photographer, artist and engraver in Washington D.C. was taken in the White House within 24 hours after Lincolns body had been taken there, this photograph has been proven since as authentic taken by Batchelder within a day of Lincolns assasination, re: Lloyd Ostendorf's book Lincoln's Photographs: A Complete Album" photograph # "0-130"),</p>
<p>From the book: "The reverse of this photograph of Lincoln in death bears the inscription: "Lincoln photograph taken by Uncle Bachelder after Lincoln died. "The life-like quality and photographic perspective is evident in the image even thought [sic] some retouching has been applied. The exposure was evidently taken under poor lighting conditions and under difficult circumstances; the task was obviously undertaken in purposeful secrecy."</p>
<p>The facing page reads: "A post-mortem portrait. An extremely rare carte-de-viste discovered in the estate of artist and engraver <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_B._Bachelder_d1e7.html" title="John B. Bachelder">John B. Bachelder</a>. The heretofore unpublished photograph of Abraham Lincoln seen at the right was taken on approximately April 16, 1865, after the President's death. Apparently, it was to serve as a model for the death-bed scene produced by Bachelder in collaboration with Alonzo Chappel."</p>
<p><br />
This book researched by Lincoln Scholar Ostendorf shows the importance of this newly discovered photograph and that it has been overlooked, and wrongly discredited by some, however its ever gaining prominence of study amoungst Lincoln researchers and photographic scholars of this heretofore unknown (overlooked by some as a etching) photograph!</p>

<p>I will Back in a few of days with more proof positive, see you then, not to watch some eat humble pie...but to show the truth and reveal a long lost photo, never meant to be seen by many at all butwas nessisary at the time for portraits yet to be made by many others....Rjensen.</p>

<p>I feel like the "six men of Hindustan to learning much inclined, who went to see the elephant, though all of them were blind." If somebody could post the photo in question, here on the Talk page, so all interested readers could see at least the image that is in dispute (it has long passed into public domain, given its age) it might be helpful, at least to see what the argument is about (even if it is not included in the article itself).<a href="../../../a/m/h/User%7EAmherst5282_f5e9.html" title="User:Amherst5282">Amherst5282</a> 22:12, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Having now seen the picture, let me say: 1) I am, of course, no photographic expert, so who cares what I think? 2)I am disturbed by the grain and distortion 3)Yet, I compared the photo to the two well-documented last photos of Lincoln alive (<a href="http://members.aol.com/RVSNorton1/Lincoln71.html" class="external free" title="http://members.aol.com/RVSNorton1/Lincoln71.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.aol.com/RVSNorton1/Lincoln71.html</a>) and am struck by how "correct" this detah picture is: the peculiar permanent "arch" of the left eyebrow, the angle of the left hairline, the hollow of the cheek, and so on on several points -- if made as an engraving from living photos, the artist must have been almost forensically accurate (as opposed to almost every other Lincoln artist), or this is an authentic post mortem picture.<a href="../../../a/m/h/User%7EAmherst5282_f5e9.html" title="User:Amherst5282">Amherst5282</a> 22:12, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the book (2004)ed: it states.."is believed the photograph was taken through a shroud on a bed, a veil placed out of respect yet still allowing the photographer John B. Batchelder and his and Lincoln's friend and assistant on this project famed fellow photographer <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathew_Brady_4843.html" title="Mathew Brady">Mathew Brady</a> to get their picture of him nessisary for later portraits to be done in a quick, and dignified manner" - unquote.</p>
<p>Did you know it was a common practice of the day, when death photograph's or even those taken of not so famous "death photos", as individual family members death photographs were far more a common place event than they are today?</p>
<p>Hense what I now am calling call the "rippling effect" seen in what I believe is the genuine first photograph of the president taken within a day of his death...note his slightly open glazed unseeing eye, and it's surrounding area....and if you hold a piece of paper over the lower area on his chin, but from his lower beard up to the top of his head...then you will note "the conventional lincoln beard area below his chin area seems retouched.</p>
<p>Indeed it is a true death photograph of Lincoln without question with an even then revealed retouch by the family of the photographer himself....well the research being done will bare all of this out in the end....we have a real find here, not a hoax as some have been quick to judge without reading or looking or studying the photo and the facts so far.</p>
<p>It is my surmise in the picture that it was from the Beard area down that they themselves the photographer Bachelder family said via Orsdendorf's, one of the greatest finds in history when it is proven true see this below re: [[Lloyd Ostendorf[['s book Lincoln's Photographs: A Complete Album" photograph # "0-130") the beard areas below his chin are the only area they did a slight and dignified retouch that I can detect as it states below from the scholarly Lincoln book:</p>
<p>"The reverse of this photograph of Lincoln in death bears the inscription: "Lincoln photograph taken by Uncle Bachelder after Lincoln died. "The life-like quality and photographic perspective is evident in the image even thought [sic] some retouching has been applied. The exposure was evidently taken under poor lighting conditions and under difficult circumstances; the task was obviously undertaken in purposeful secrecy."</p>
<p>Again the proofs in the pudding:</p>
<p>The facing page reads: "A post-mortem portrait. An extremely rare carte-de-viste discovered in the estate of artist and engraver John B. Bachelder. The heretofore unpublished photograph of Abraham Lincoln seen at the right was taken on approximately April 16, 1865, after the President's death. Apparently, it was to serve as a model for the death-bed scene produced by Bachelder in collaboration with Alonzo Chappel."</p>
<p>These were and are all legitimate people involved in this by default of time by the materials laying undisturbed colecting dust on a familys book case, This book researched by Lincoln Scholar Ostendorf shows the importance of this newly discovered photograph and that it had been previously overlooked, and therefore wrongly discredited by some, its ever gaining prominence of study amoungst Lincoln researchers and photographic scholars of this heretofore unknown *(mistakenly overlooked by some as an etching, not understanding the photographic technic's of the glass plate, or albumum processess of the day, a specialty of mine and my familys history) and in fact a genuine Lincoln post-mortium photograph of the man, President Abraham Lincoln...</p>
<p>One can also note a real feeling of sadness in an almost otherwise serene face, shown that could only be possible in a photograph.</p>
<p>...One more last memorable image of him... from a blink of time on April 16th 1865.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Evidence of hoax?</span></h3>
<p>I've been extremely reluctant to interject myself into such a major stink for my first-ever Wikipedia edit, but about a month ago, after coming across Cathytreks's dubious claims, I stumbled upon what seems to be fairly conclusive evidence of them being a hoax.</p>

<p>Note four posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cathytreks's post of 2004/09/23, in which she refers to her own website, states that her "exstensive research has found NOTHING to support such a second photograph in fact!"
<ul>
<li>THIS IS ANOTHER SERIES OF LIE'S PUBLISHED BY SOMEONE WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY POSING AS ME TO DISCREDIT THE PHOTOGRAPH FURTHER, AND THE ONGOING RESEARCH ON IT! (<a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECathytreks_4d6c.html" title="User:Cathytreks">Cathytreks</a> 03:56, 20 March 2006 (UTC))</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Joseph M. Di Cola's post of 2004/09/28. Mr. Di Cola is familiar with the Ostendorf book in question and raises many of the questions regarding the photo that others have raised here.</li>
<li>K Morgan's post of 2004/10/01. K Morgan claims to have inspected the original and states unequivocably that it a <strong>photograph of a drawing</strong>.</li>
<li>Blaine Houmes's post of 2004/10/01. Houmes claims to <strong>own the image</strong>, and gives very specific information about how he came by it, how Ostendorf got it wrong, and how it came to be in Ostendorf's book. A quick google reveals Houmes to a real person, a medical doctor in Cedar Rapids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note further that Cathytreks is aware of all of these statements, yet continues to vehemently push her agenda.</p>
<dl>
<dd>this is all untrue and I never heard ofr these statements untill just now, and did not realise there were several persons at work here to discredit both the photograpgh of Lincoln in death, and me as a serious researcher on Lincoln, RV Norton and his band never recieved anything from me as we do not agree on the matter in question here, as I seek only to have the truth revealed in a npov way.

<p>A previous statement I made was incorrect. I apologize. Cathytreks's first edit concerning the supposed "Lincoln death photo" was on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abraham_Lincoln&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18145381" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abraham_Lincoln&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18145381" rel="nofollow">2005-07-04</a>, not prior to the above posts as I stated. This is what I get when I wait so long before posting; I forget what I was researching. But I stand by my previous statement that this seems to implicate Cathytreks in a hoax. —<a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonelyPilgrim_9043.html" title="User:LonelyPilgrim">LonelyPilgrim</a> 15:56, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are a lier and a perpetrator of an untruth if you DO NOT believe in what I have written and researched!... in 1998, a photograph was published with the permission of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_B._Bachelder_d1e7.html" title="John B.

<dd>Rjensen, I would be more than happy to comply with your wishes, I shall call the Badger/Bachelder owner of said photo myself in the morning (LOCAL TIME), so as to clear this up once and for all so that the photograph may be given its proper respect that is long overdue, since 1998, btw I was not meaning to sound disrespectful to you, but am heartsick over the doubters of what is so clearly a photograph of Lincoln taken through a death shroud at the White House on April 16th, 1865.</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Another Take on the Lincoln Photo Debate</span></h3>
<p>Let's say the photo is somehow real. So be it. Why is it necessary to put it here for the world to see. That would be like putting JFK's autopsy photos on his page here. It is disgraceful to do such a thing. It may be alright for a book that people can choose to purchase or not; but is irrelevant for an Encylopedic article on Lincoln's life and SAVING THE UNION as such. Let us not get off point here. I see the debate above, fine for a talk page...but my opinion is that Real or Not, it does not belong on this page. It is morbid and wrong to do so. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 22:33, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Straw poll on death photo</span></h3>
<p>I have watched this dispute go on for awhile and I have to say that I am quite skeptical that this is an authentic photograph. If you do a Google search, virtually the only references that appear are from the Wikipedia and Talk articles. I did a search through <i>Manhunt</i> by James Swanson, the recently published bestseller about the Lincoln assassination and although it includes photographs, this one does not appear. I also checked Questia.com and none of their online books about Lincoln mention it. Although we in the Wikipedia community sometimes will reference claims that appear in only a single book, I think that when a claim is disputed, the burden of proof becomes heavier and we should await further scholarly corroboration. A few additional reasons why I am skeptical: John Bachelder, who keeps getting cited as a famous photographer, in fact is not well-known in that vocation; he is known as a watercolorist, lithographer, and most importantly, military historian and preservationist. The image does not actually look like a real photograph. And, since Lincoln was shot through the left ear, he seems to have had some pretty impressive plastic surgery prior to this.</p>
<p>I would like to take a straw poll on whether to delete these photograph references from the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_B._Bachelder_d1e7.html" title="John B.

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I am on vacation, presently on a very shaky dialup and not on my own computer with all my notes, so I can't give at present the full rebuttal I'd like to give to <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECathytreks_4d6c.html" title="User:Cathytreks">Cathytreks</a>'s arguments. But just a few points I'd like to raise:
<ul>
<li>The image simply doesn't look like a photograph, let alone a photograph of someone who's been murdered. That's not even to mention that this poor scan is beneath Wikipedia's standards of quality.</li>
<li>Self-serving statements made by an author in his own book (i.e. Ostendorf's claim of what this image is and its provenance) and not supported by any other authority (in fact, strongly contradicted — see the mailing list posts I linked above) are insufficient to meet Wikipedia's standards of verifiability.</li>
<li>Ostendorf was not a "Lincoln historian" in the academic sense as <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECathytreks_4d6c.html" title="User:Cathytreks">Cathytreks</a> claims, but a collector of Lincoln photographs and memorabilia. The 1998 and 2004 printings of his book are not academic releases and lack credibility (unlike the earlier one, released by an academic press with an academic co-author; it did not contain the image in question).</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECathytreks_4d6c.html" title="User:Cathytreks">Cathytreks</a> claims the photograph is under heavy controversy among "Lincoln experts," yet there's no indication that anyone but us is even debating it, or that anyone but her is making such claims. Ostendorf's work is well known to historians, and I think that if anyone at all had given this image any serious consideration, it would have been all over the news and in every single Lincoln documentary and biography. Yet I've never seen it anywhere but here.</li>
<li>For all of <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECathytreks_4d6c.html" title="User:Cathytreks">Cathytreks</a>'s claims of having seen the original image and knowing its owners, she has been unable to provide a shred of proof or even a citation. I find it much more likely that the image is owned by Dr. Blaine Houmes, as he stated in the above-linked posts. I'm sure the matter could be easily resolved by contacting him, though frankly, I consider it already resolved, and don't think it's worth bothering him.</li>
<li>Some of <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECathytreks_4d6c.html" title="User:Cathytreks">Cathytreks</a> recent claims are frankly laughable. Cathy, if you are a doctor of history, what are your credentials? Where did you get your degree? Why have you not edited anything else historical on Wikipedia (but instead a lot of cult sci-fi television shows)? Why do you present such an unacademic attitude and lack of literacy? If you truly are a professor, show us your curriculum vitae. Also, if you live in New Hampshire as you have recently claimed, why have you made previous statements that you live in New Zealand? Why does Google reveal so many hits for you there?</li>
<li>In sum, <b>delete</b>. —<a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonelyPilgrim_9043.html" title="User:LonelyPilgrim">LonelyPilgrim</a> 03:10, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Although Lincoln was not shot through the left ear, and whether a photo that would be 141 years old this spring looks like someone who was murdered or not, is not the real point. The photo appears to be bogus for a variety of reasons. I'm sure scientific or forensic photography should have solved this one already, if there was any truth to it.

<p>Whether it came across to some as an unintended or intentional "hoax" or as a real and contemperary photograph of the beloved late 16th President, (by me certainly I am drawn in by it's genuinely sad nature and naturalness of HIS face!).....a real photograph, or maybe just a exstraordinary and remarkable likeness via a well done engraving, by a great artist... done post mortem is not known, but the likeness to Lincoln is uncanny as well as haunting in it's portrayal of him.</p>
<p>Without question the photographer or engraver Bachelder, knew Lincolns face very well...HE WAS THERE the day after with Mathew Brady at Lincolns side, the day after Lincolns assasination, and that cannot be debated..for it is a part of the undisputed history all of us may read about in media and letters, and journals of the period being ~April 16th-17th 1865.</p>
<p>John Badger Bachelder, both an artist and an early photographer, knew his subject well...and while the original photo may have been destroyed, on the order of Stanton, all that may be left is that American Civil War Artist, Engraver &amp; Photographers John B.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">A frank assessment</span></h3>
<p>Cathy, let's pretend for a moment that I find this alleged photograph even the least bit credible. The way for you to prove its veracity, and to have it instated at Wikipedia, is not through persistence or insistence, not through empty rhetoric, and not through personal attacks. It is through providing documentation from reliable, scholarly sources. So far you haven't done that. The only source you can cite for your claims is this book by Ostendorf. This presents several problems for us:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is not a scholarly source. Now, before you get angry, you should understand that "scholarly" is a technical term in the academic world. It means that the source was written and published through an academic apparatus — i.e. written by a scholar, and published by a reputable scholarly press with an editorial board and a system of peer review.</li>
<li>Lloyd Ostendorf was not a scholar. Now again, before you get angry, we are not casting aspersions on either the man or his work. A scholar is someone who has an advanced degree in his field of study. Ostendorf did not. He was not a historian, but an artist and a collector of photographs. He had several <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honorary_doctorates.html" title="Honorary doctorates">honorary doctorates</a>, but that is not the same thing as a bona fide academic degree.</li>
<li>The book, and Ostendorf's claim about this alleged photograph, is not well-documented. So he says there's an inscription on the back. So? Who wrote the inscription? When? How did they know what it was? Where did the image originate? How did Ostendorf come by it? Where specifically is it now? None of these questions are answered in the source. This does not amount to documentable proof, and does not meet Wikipedia's standards of <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verifiability</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can anticipate your argument; it's the same one you've had all along. You say you know where the photograph originated (from John B. Bachelder), you know who wrote the inscription (his daughter or niece), and you know where it is now (among Bachelder's descendants). Let's pretend for a moment that I believe you. Your having this knowledge doesn't help us. We can't take your word for it. This is not due to any personal bias; it is <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOL_b383.html" title="WP:POL">official Wikipedia policy</a>. Wikipedia strives for <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verifiability</a>. This means citable sources. If Ostendorf had satisfactorily documented his claim, it might possibly have been citable; he however did not.</p>
<p>Suppose you were willing to share all the information you claim to have (as you have so far refused to do). Suppose you gave us a proper, specific citation for the current owner of the photograph. Suppose you went and had a better copy made of it, or even had your own picture made holding it. Suppose the owner of the photograph appeared to tell us its tradition and provenance — how it was passed down to him, who made the inscription, and when. Suppose all of this was documented extensively. Then we might personally believe you. But this would still present a fundamental problem for us. Wikipedia, by official policy, accepts <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>. Even if you were to come up with all of this, we couldn't use it. All of what you're purporting to have done and proposing to do amounts at best to original research, and is not acceptable at Wikipedia.</p>
<p>So what can you do? You have two courses of action:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you can provide a documented, reliable, scholarly, published source that supports your claim — one that takes this image, answers all of the questions that we all have about it, documents its sources and the provenance of the image, and states with authority that it is what you claim it is.</li>
<li>Alternatively, if you are indeed convinced of your claim, by all means, keep researching. Have your work published in a peer-reviewed academic journal, then come back and tell us about it. Tell the whole world about it. We'd all be overjoyed to find documentable proof of another Lincoln photograph, and we'd instate it in Wikipedia in an instant.</li>
</ol>
<p>But until you can do either of these things, I'm afraid there's nothing more we can do here. Your continued insistence, your repeated reverts, your ongoing harping over the same empty rhetoric, and now your personal attacks, are not accomplishing anything positive. They are undermining the integrity of these articles, they are disrupting Wikipedia, and they are annoying us. Please desist. —<a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonelyPilgrim_9043.html" title="User:LonelyPilgrim">LonelyPilgrim</a> 19:59, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An article in a tabloid newspaper about something so demonstrably false has no place in an encyclopedia. Abraham Lincoln was a biological male who fathered four sons. The WWN article already has a section on the recurring subject of past and current presidents, so if anything this pseudofactoid should be mentioned in the WWN article.

<p>I removed the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>All historians agree that Lincoln had a lasting influence on American political values and social institutions. He redefined republicanism, democracy and the meaning of the nation. He destroyed secessionism and greatly weakened states rights.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Except this isn't true. What "social institutions" did Lincoln meaningfully change? Slavery was abolished as a consequence of the war, not because Lincoln willed it. I guess in a weasel sense this is true, the argument being: Lincoln influenced the emancipation proclamation, the emancipation proclamation influenced social institutions, but this is weaker causation than the sentence implies. My old teacher, who was a student of David Donald at Harvard, argued that Lincoln did not fundamentally alter American values. In Lincoln's speeches, he appeals to traditional concepts of the constitution; he does not "redefine" the constitution, which implies he believed it meant something it previously was not thought to mean. Also, Lincoln IN NO WAY weakened states' rights. State spending increased during the war. Anyway, the old paragraph was more accurate:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some historians also argue that Lincoln had a lasting influence on U.S. political and social institutions. The most important may have been setting the precedent for greater centralization of powers in the federal government and a weakening of the powers of the individual <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_government.html" title="State government">state governments</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This claim, however, is disputed as the federal government largely reverted to its former weakness after <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstruction.html" title="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a> and the modern administrative state would only emerge with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a> some seventy years later.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The claim is true. Social Institutions: He was the most important person by far in abolishing slavery (thru both Proclamation and 13th). He also had impact on millions in terms homestead laws and pacific Railroads. Did he weaken states rights? Yes, the states forever lost any notion of being able to secede, or to protect any peculiar institution. He totally reversed Virginia and Kty resolutions. He did not limit how much states could spend. He ordered governors around in the South and Border states--that was utterly unthinkable in 1869. Listen to the supporters of states rights bemoan all the damage Lincoln did to their cause! Even today you hear that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Did he change American POLITICAL values? Yes. Overall values? Probably not, but hey, the GOP still insists it reflects Lincoln's values and the Democrats say they are even MORE Lincolnian. Lincoln redefined republicanism and democracy-- he defined a new birth that was as important as the one four score and seven years ago (1776). that's the Gettysburg address. It ended the notion that there were separate states that voluntarily joined a union-of-convenience. Instead the US became for the first time a strong central state. He redefined democracy in terms "of the people etc" that remains the basis of our philosophy about voting rights. Did the federal government revert afterwards?? Oh no: the federal courts (filled with Lincoln appointees) became far more powerful and stayed that way (and they still are).</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Lincoln did nothing on the homestead laws and Pacific Railroad-- those were all measures which Congress worked on independently. Lincoln just signed them. Remember the nullification crisis? When Jackson abandoned states' rights with his nullification proclamation, THAT was the death of the VA and KY resolutions, not the Civil War. Supporters of states' rights bemoan the New Deal, certainly NOT the Civil War (unless they are Confederate sympathizers). It is important to note that the U.S. did NOT become a centralized country after the Civil War; only the New Deal began the administrative state. The federal courts did not become more powerful as a result of Lincoln. The Gettysburg Address did not redefine democracy in terms "of the people," the Greeks defined democracy that way 1000 years ago. Finally, just because various parties invoke Lincoln rhetorically today, does not mean he actually changed political values in 1865. It is important to note that you guys are trying to rationalize the sentimental modern perception of Lincoln as some sort of transformative figure. As Americans we have an emotional attachment to Lincoln. This article should not represent that emotional legacy as some sort of historical fact. <a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPlease_Don%27t_Block_ddb1.html" title="User:Please Don't Block">Please Don't Block</a>Please Don't Block</dd>

Without Lincoln: no end to slavery. No redefinition of democracy as the main aim of American political values. No powerful Federal government, --maybe several different federal governments. No vision to transform the world. Unless he gets elected No Repuiblican Congress, hence no national banks or homestead laws or high tariffs. He proved democracy can work in wartime and can change the entire social-economic system. He proved you can make "all men are equal" an actual guiding principle of government. That's amazing achievement. Maybe somebody else gets the credit? Hardly. The historians are right: he made an enormous difference. It is NOT true that the New Deal began the Administrative state: Lincoln did. He ruled the conquered South with an iron hand (that is the parts his armies had liberated, which was about half). He made the decision to liberate the slaves, not somebody else. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 14:23, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1.Democracy <i>was</i> the main aim of American political values prior to Lincoln; read Andrew Jackson's Bank Veto message if you have doubts.</dd>
<dd>2.As for your claim that Lincoln started the administrative state: what traditional state functions did the federal government assume during Lincoln's presidency? Name one. The power to wage war was never lodged in the states, and that is the power you are referring to.</dd>
<dd>3. Your statement that "he proved democracy can work during wartime" is question-begging; how would you prove democracy "can work during wartime" as a universal proposition? Democracy can work during wartime in some contexts and obviously cannot in others. (For example, during wartime it is often incovenient to have legislatures making policy; World War II Britain was essentially an "elective despotism").</dd>
<dd>4. Your statement that "he proved you can make equality a guiding principle of government" is a platitude. If you mean to imply that Lincoln made the advancement of blacks a "guiding principle" of his government, you are wrong; the policy of the Union Army was basically to re-enslave blacks up until Reconstruction.</dd>

<dd>Jackson did a lot for democracy too. But he vetoed things and Lincoln created new things. Lincoln's war goivernors ran all the political, economic &amp; military affairs in their states. Treasury agents decided who could and who could not ship cotton (in places that was the main crop). Democracy works in America in wartime. The Brits, as you note, decided not to hold elections in WW1 and WW2. The Canadians and Australians followed the US in WW1, NOT mother-country. Maybe equality is a platitude today; it was not a platitude in 1860. Lincoln made that difference. It is absolutely false to say Union policy was to re-enslave the blacks! By 1864 Lincoln was demanding the vote in deep south (for Black veterans) --an astonishing development. Lincoln's policy was to permanently free all the blacks, and he did so.

<p>Lincoln's nomination at the 1860 RNC seems like it should demand more attention than it does in the article. He employed brilliant strategists, far more so than even Seward who was operating under Thurlow Weed, did not make the same mistakes as some of the other nominees (Seward leaving the US for 8 months prior to the convention, Chase not attenting the New York City Cooper Union addresses, and dozens of other semi-coincidences that led to his nomination over the other three (Seward, Chase, Bates, noteably). Further, there should be some mention of Lincoln striving to be a second ballot nominee, accepting that the majority would first chose Seward, but that moderate Republicans weren't sure who the runner up to Seward would be--whom they would primarily vote for come the second ballot. I would write this, and I am willing to, but I'm not sure if this is the right forum for it (possibly the 1860 RNC entry). <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_brazell_1c06.html" title="User:Michael brazell">Mike Murray</a> 07:01, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We seem to disagree. Why would his overseeing the war belong in intro (without even making clear he was president at the time &amp; not a genreal) - while context for the assassination (something sorely omitted in most articles) be omitted? Lincoln's assassination was not like that of Kennedy - Lincoln's was clearly linked to a plot and to events of his presidency. The JFK article gives context to his asassination, even though it is less clear that the act was anything more than senseless. While other assassinations were committed by apparently deranged people, Lincoln's can be "understood" as part of the Civil War. I see no reason to delete this.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 04:52, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I agree the assassination plot should be in the article. But not in the summary because the summary is what Lincoln himself did. As for the war effort: he selected all the generals and approved (or changed) their strategies; he was in charge of fundings, diplomacy, and politics, he picked all cabinet members and other senior officials, he took personal charge of emancipation and reconstrcution policies. That pretty much puts him in charge of the war effort, don't you think? <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 04:56, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

As for the hook bit, there are 100+ fascinating things about his life, which people can discover by reading the article. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 05:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And why is his managing the war "more intro-worthy"? Leave out the plot &amp; you leave out any hook at all. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 05:25, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are you suggesting that no effort should be made in an encyclopedia to capture the reader's interest early on? That is precisely one of the purposes of having an intro at all. I have other things to do than argue with someone who just repeats himself &amp; does not address my points --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 06:59, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>yes the job of the introduction is to say what wass most important. I reject the idea that this encyclopedia should jazz up articles to attract readers who might otherwise watch TV. Lincoln ran the war effort and that's very important. As for public opinion, go to any bookstore like Borders and count the hundreds--even thousands-- of books on display about the Civil War. That certainly proves a demand for info on the civil war. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 07:15, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not saying leave out his management of the war - I kept it in a version you reverted within a minute. I am saying you are going into it in too much depth for the intro (and now you even have details on civilian appointments &amp; patronage) &amp; the plot is AT LEAST as good a candidate for brief inclusion in the intro. Following your argument that only what he did belongs in the intro, his assassination would not be in the intro at all. There is no such rule here nor in any literature --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 08:12, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>because you seem less interested in the big issues and instead focused on conspiracy. Evryone to their own taste but an encyclopedia has to focus on big issues. Which is what I tried to list in the intro. There are of course 100 other topics covered in the article. The challenge it to pick the 5-10 most important ones. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 08:24, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well I guess then, within your complete grasp of the big issues, you do not include plots to assassinate presidents &amp; the cabinet, but do include civilian appointments and patronage --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 08:29, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Using that argument, the assasination would be entirely excluded. Fantabulous! It is an article about his life - both what he did and what happened to him - and his legacy. Your resistance suggests you want suppression of information. Most people are not aware that there was a plot. Introducing it early gives the reader motivation to read on. Talking about patronage &amp; civilian appointments is not going to interest the reader - nor are they major topics --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 19:26, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Please Add External Link to audio recollections of the Only Known Gettysburg Address Eye Witness - William V. Rathvon</span></h2>
<p>William V. Rathvon's eyewitness audio recollections and reading of the address at NPR.org at <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1045619" class="external free" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1045619" rel="nofollow">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1045619</a></p>
<p><b>Discussion</b> I added Rathvon's audio recollections to the Gettysburg Address article and was suprised that they were not already noted in that article. But, actually, NPR only has "part of the story" on Rathvon. William V. Rathvon is the only known eyewitness of both Lincoln's arrival at Gettysburg and his address itself to have left an audio recording of his recollections.</p>
<p>I actually had heard of the audio recording before NPR and have cassette tape copy from a friend who used to sell them on the internet. On one side is a lecture on the subject of Christian Science and on the other side, almost incidentaly, is his recollections of Lincoln.</p>
<p>Who was William V. Rathvon? He was successful Colorado businessman and an accomplished public lecturer. He ended up, of all places, as treasurer, in 1918 of the Christian Science Church in Boston Massachussets in 1918 and a member of its Board of Directors. He and his wife, Ella S. Rathvon, had served on the staff of the founder of that religion, Mary Baker Eddy. By the 1930s that Church had radio broadcasts of its religious services and religious radio shows. As a public lecturer and one of the five top people in that church, Rathvon would have had execellent access to the top quality recording devices of his time. Hence the quality of the 78rpm record. The term "long lost," really doesn't apply, as the Rathvon audio recollections have been known by an extremely small circle of individuals ever since he made them in 1938. To Rathvon, they were actually incidental to what he felt were his more important church-work responsibilities. I suspect that he made them simply for historical posterity as he never promoted them, or even promoted the idea that he had made them nor sold them per my source. I doubt very much that he even realized that they were unique a he, as an adult, saw men such as Lincoln's personal secretary, John Hay, a Secretary of State under McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>More information on this recording might be available by contacting the Mary Baker Eddy Library for the Betterment of Humanity in Boston, MA as they have extensive archival information on Mary Baker Eddy, the Christian Science church, and, of course, all of its key individuals such as Rathvon, who, as a personal student of Mary Baker Eddy, a church treasurer and church director, certainly would have been. As a Christian Scientist and a amateur church historian, I had known about Rathvon for more than 30 years. But I didn't hear about this recording until the early 1990s. David Keyston, the founder of the web site <a href="http://www.christianscience.org" class="external free" title="http://www.christianscience.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.christianscience.org</a> first put the tape on line on his web site. If anyone would like a copy in MP3 format they can email me at SimonATL@yahoo.com as Keyston said I could share it with whomever I liked. I no longer see the recording at that site. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonATL_c957.html" title="User:SimonATL">SimonATL</a> 15:18, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I added to the article, Rathvon, was a nine year old boy when he saw Lincoln at Gettsburg became a gifted public lecturer and director of the Christian Science church. He made an excellent quality 78rpm disk recording in 1938 including his reading the address, itself. A copy wound up at National Public Radio during a their "Quest for Sound" project in the late 90s. Thet often air them around Linclon's birthday. To listen, click here [6]. Even after move than half a century, Rathvon's audio recollections remain a moving testimony to Lincoln's transcending effect on his fellow countrymen and the love which so many ardent unionists held for him. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonATL_c957.html" title="User:SimonATL">SimonATL</a> 15:18, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
