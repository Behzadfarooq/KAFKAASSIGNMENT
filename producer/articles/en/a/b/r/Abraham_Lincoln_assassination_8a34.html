<p>John Wilkes Booth's original plot was to kidnap Lincoln and take him south, then to exchange Lincoln for the release of Confederate prisoners of war.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Booth had organized a circle of conspirators to help him in attempting this. He recruited <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Arnold_%28Lincoln_conspirator%29_5f4f.html" title="Samuel Arnold (Lincoln conspirator)">Samuel Arnold</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Atzerodt_554c.html" title="George Atzerodt">George Atzerodt</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Herold_5893.html" title="David Herold">David Herold</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_O%27Laughlen_5582.html" title="Michael O'Laughlen">Michael O'Laughlen</a>, Lewis Powell a.k.a.

Weichmann">Louis J. Weichmann</a> was also suspected to be part of the conspiracy. He lived at Mary Surratt's boarding house and knew all the suspects. He was later an important witness in the trial of the conspirators.</p>
<p>Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_4.html" title="March 4">March 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>, as the invited guest of his secret fiancée Lucy Hale, the daughter of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_P._Hale_de60.html" title="John P.

In a photo taken at the event, Booth can be seen in a crowd above the president. In another crowd below the president, fellow conspirators David Herold, George Atzerodt, Edmund Spangler, Lewis Powell and John Surratt can be seen. Booth remarked afterwards, "What an excellent chance I had, if I wished, to kill the President on Inauguration day!"<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> though he had no plan to do so at the time.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_17.html" title="March 17">March 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>, Booth learned that Lincoln would be attending a play, <i>Still Waters Run Deep</i>, at Campbell Military Hospital. Booth assembled his team on a stretch of road in an attempt to kidnap Lincoln, as he came back from the hospital, but Booth's intelligence was wrong, and the president never came. Lincoln was instead giving a speech at the National Hotel in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_D.C._708d.html" title="Washington D.C.">Washington D.C.</a> which, ironically, was where Booth lived.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Confederacy began to fall apart shortly after Booth's last kidnapping attempt failed. Although many Southerners had given up hope, Booth continued to believe in his cause, writing in his diary that "something decisive and great must be done."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> He decided that if he could simultaneously murder the President, Vice-President Andrew Johnson, and Secretary of State William Seward, he could throw the Union government into chaos for enough time that the Confederacy could mount a resurgence. Atzerodt wanted nothing to do with it, saying he had signed up for a kidnapping, not a killing. Booth told him he was too far in to back out. He assigned Atzerodt to kill Johnson, but instead Atzerodt went out drinking. Booth suspected he would not follow through and so, on his way to Ford's Theatre, Booth stopped by Johnson's apartment leaving a note that read "Don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth." This message has had been interpreted in many different ways through the years.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> One theory is that Booth, afraid that Atzerodt would not be successful in killing Johnson, tried to use the message to implicate Johnson in the conspiracy.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Booth then assigned Powell and Herold to kill Seward, thinking Powell, unfamiliar with the capital, would be unable to find Seward's house, and that Herold would be unwilling to carry out the murder.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln and Mary Lincoln were going to attend Laura Keene's 1,000th performance in <i>Our American Cousin</i>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> The Lincolns were under much stress, put on them by both the war and the death of their son Willie in 1862. President Lincoln had also been plagued by dreams which concerned his own death. The play was supposed to give them a chance to enjoy themselves. Several people were invited to join them, however, only <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">Major</a> <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Rathbone_aad4.html" title="Henry Rathbone">Henry Rathbone</a> and his fiancée <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clara_Harris_4a05.html" title="Clara Harris">Clara Harris</a> accepted the invitation.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The President and First Lady arrived at Ford's Theatre at around nine o'clock with Rathbone and Harris.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> They were brought to the presidential box, where Lincoln was seated in a rocking chair on the left-hand side.</p>
<p>Booth arrived at the back door of Ford's Theatre. There, he handed the reins of his horse over to Edman Spangler. Spangler, having work to do, asked Joseph Burroughs to hold the horse. As an actor at Ford's Theatre, Booth was well known there and he knew his way around. He entered a narrow hallway between Lincoln's box and the theatre's balcony, and barricaded the door.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mrs. Lincoln whispered to her husband, who was holding her hand, "What will Miss Harris think of my hanging on to you so?" The president replied, "She won't think anything about it."<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> Those were the last words ever spoken by Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>Lincoln's bodyguard, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Parker_a1bd.html" title="John F. Parker">John F. Parker</a>, had left his post to get a better view of the show.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> Booth entered without any one noticing and shot the president in the back of the head. Lincoln slumped over in his rocking chair, unconscious. Rathbone jumped from his seat and tried to prevent Booth from escaping, but Booth stabbed the Major deep in the arm with a knife. Rathbone quickly recovered and tried to grab Booth as he was preparing to jump from the sill of the box. Booth again stabbed at Rathbone, and then attempted to jump down to the stage. As he jumped, his foot was caught on the American flag, and Booth fell onto the stage in a way which broke his leg.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> He faced the crowd and yelled, "<a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic_semper_tyrannis.html" title="Sic semper tyrannis">Sic semper tyrannis</a>,"<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup>, the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> state motto, meaning "Thus always to tyrants." Other accounts state that he also uttered "The South is avenged!"<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> He then hobbled off the stage, and went out the door onto the horse he had waiting outside. Some of the men in the audience chased after him, but failed to catch him. Booth rode to the navy yard to meet up with Herold and Powell.</p>

<p>Booth assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward. At this time, Seward was bedridden due to a carriage accident he was in about a week before. He was at his home in <a href="../../../p/r/e/President%27s_Park_6488.html" title="President's Park">Lafayette Park</a> in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_D.C._708d.html" title="Washington D.C.">Washington</a>, not too far from the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a>.</p>

<p>Powell and Herold went to Seward's residence on Booth's orders. Booth probably thought that Powell wouldn't be able to find the house and that Herold was too cowardly to attempt the murder himself. Powell was carrying an 1858 Whitney revolver which was a large, heavy and popular gun during the Civil War. Additionally, he carried a huge silver-mounted bowie knife.</p>
<p>Powell knocked at the front door of the house a little after 10:00 p.m. William Bell, Seward's butler, answered the door. Powell told Bell that he had medicine for Seward from Dr. Verdi, and that he was to personally deliver and show Seward how to take the medicine. He was let in and Powell made his way up the stairs to Seward's third floor bedroom.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the top of the staircase, he was approached by Seward's son and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Assistant_Secretary_of_State_8702.html" title="United States Assistant Secretary of State">Assistant Secretary of State</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Seward_b4ba.html" title="Frederick Seward">Frederick Seward</a>. Powell told Frederick the same alibi he that had told Bell at the front door. Seward was suspicious of the intruder and told Powell that his father was asleep.</p>
<p>After hearing voices in the hall, Seward's daughter Fanny opened the door to Seward's room and said, "Fred, Father is awake now," and then returned to the room. Powell now knew where Seward was. Powell started down the stairs when suddenly he jolted around again and drew his revolver, placing it upon Frederick's forehead. He pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired. Panicking, he then smashed the gun over Frederick's head continuously until he collapsed. Fanny, wondering what all the noise was, looked out the door again. She saw her brother bloody and unconscious on the floor and Powell running towards her. Powell ran to Seward's bed and stabbed him continuously in the face and neck. He missed the first time he swung his knife down, but the third blow sliced open Seward's cheek.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> The metal neck brace Seward was wearing was the only thing that prevented the blade from penetrating his <a href="../../../j/u/g/Jugular.html" title="Jugular">jugular</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup> Sergeant Robinson and Seward's son Augustus tried to drive Powell away. Augustus had been asleep in his room, but was awoken by Fanny's screams of terror. Outside, Herold also heard Fanny's screaming. He became frightened and ran away, abandoning Powell.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Secretary Seward had rolled off the bed and onto the floor where he could not be reached by his attacker. Powell fought off Robinson, Augustus and Fanny stabbing them as well. He ran down stairs and headed to the front door.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup> Just then, a messenger named Emerick Hansell arrived with a telegram for Seward. Powell stabbed Hansell in the back, causing him to fall to the floor. Before running outside, Powell exclaimed, "I'm mad! I'm mad!"

<p>Booth assigned George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson. Whether or not Atzerodt agreed to do this is unknown. Johnson was staying at the Kirkwood Hotel in Washington. Atzerodt was to go to the Vice President's room at 10:15 PM and shoot him.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

Atzerodt was hesitant. He went to the bar downstairs and asked the bartender, Michael Henry, about the Vice President's character and behavior. However, Atzerodt never attempted the assassination. After spending some time at the Hotel saloon, Atzerodt wandered away down the streets of Washington.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
