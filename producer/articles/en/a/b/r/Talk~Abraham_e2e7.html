<p>My username is ThaThinker, and I have been a significant contributor to the article <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Exodus_a4d5.html" title="The Exodus">The Exodus</a>; especially the archaeological sections. Most archaeologists do not place the date of Hammurabi's reign at 2000 BCE, as it is stated here in the article. The encyclopedias Americana and Britannica both placed his reign from 1792-1750 recently. Some archaeologists support even lower chronologies. The matter is somewhat similar to the Early Exodus/Late Exodus controversy, and in part, depends on how that is ultimately resolved. I was pleased to see that the archaeological parallels with Gen. 14:1 had been mentioned, but it also should be mentioned that while Abraham is more often placed in the time of Hammurabi, there are those who maintain that he should be placed contemporary with Sargon the Great. I'd like the opportunity to update this article to address these issues, if possible. It need not lengthen the article by much, to make these corrections, as some of the material is already present, and a fuller explanation of the chronological issues related to Hammurabi still would not be very long. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaThinker_2e1b.html" title="User:ThaThinker">ThaThinker</a> 08:55, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've been doing some studying on the chronology of Abraham, and studied the "Chedolaomer Text" in conjunction with this. This is the tablet that is thought to refer to three of the four kings of the Eastern coalition in Gen. 14:1. It's a rather involved issue, and I'd like to revise and extend the materials relating to his issue. I'd be more or less following the materials on the subject in the Anchor Bible Dictionary, but will treat Astour's identification of the kings in this cuniform tablet (from the Spartoli collection in the British Museum) with a healthy grain of salt. This would lengthen the section on modern historical criticism. I have about six paragraphs on the subject, in order to explain it properly, which would replace the two that are there on the subject. I'd also like to add a few sentences on the end of the section to better represent some things that archaeologists do find that they correlate with Abraham. The chronological section, by contrast, would have only three paragraphs. I just didn't want to start revamping the article without warning anyone. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaThinker_2e1b.html" title="User:ThaThinker">ThaThinker</a> 02:52, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why don't you post your emendations as a sub-page of the article, or of your user page, and request comment? Making sweeping changes to the article would likely devolve into edit warring. Also, I would suggest that if you <i>do</i> make archeological additions to the section, you do so as a sub-section, as any archeological supposition will likely not be close to the various religious datings, which should have their own subsections. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 03:56, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I created a subpage with the proposed edits here: <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Proposed_Chronology_Edits_e0e2.html" title="Abraham/Proposed Chronology Edits">Abraham/Proposed Chronology Edits</a>. You might have a point on an archaeology section. Other than the first paragraph, the whole historical criticism section is about archaeology. An archaeological section might belong under a secularilst historical criticism section, or else have one of its own. (BTW: While much archaeology concerns historicity, the two topics really are a bit different.) A section one paragraph long would seem rather odd, but others might have more to add later. Also, archaeology is often concerned with historicity, but the Chedolaomer materials were already here. The only work I've done on religious datings concerns the dating derived from the MT, i.e. the orthodox dating. These are actually discussed at the beginning of the article, and one only need supply a traditional Exodus date of ca. 1446 BCE to get absolute dates. I have in mind to add a sentence on the modern Catholic Encyclopedia's dating, and to proof it one more time for readability before adding it. I invite anyone who is interested to comment on these proposed edits, as well as how to organize various sections involved. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaThinker_2e1b.html" title="User:ThaThinker">ThaThinker</a> 07:04, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is pointless to say "lived between 2000 and 1500" in the lead when we then go on to say that Abraham isn't considered historical by secular scholarship. All dates will necessarily have to be attributed to one or another religious tradition or pious calculation. This is something for the "Dating" section, but it will not do to just pretend Abraham's <i>floruit</i> is a matter of educated estimates neutral scholarship doesn't even expect there is something to <i>be</i> estimated. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 06:34, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"is thought by" is weasling: this is 'thought' by pre-modern writers, and by biblical literalists. Abraham isn't "thought" to have lived by encyclopedic sources at all. <a href="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Abraham" class="external text" title="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Abraham" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the 1911 EB text for reference: it is perfectly fine, not <i>that</i> much progress has been made in this field since 1911, although we should of course collect more recent literature. If we <i>must</i> give a date right at the beginning, we have to specify exactly how we arrive at it, for example citing the (17th century, literalist!) <a href="../../../u/s/s/Ussher-Lightfoot_Calendar_5bd7.html" title="Ussher-Lightfoot Calendar">Ussher-Lightfoot Calendar</a>, as I am doing now.

<dd>archaeology doesn't enter into it. Abraham is, as the EB puts it, the product of the traditions of many generations, as fixed in the text of Genesis in ca. 700 BC. Archaeologically, it is interesting to note (per EB, what's the original source for this?) that the *name* <i>Abi-ram-</i> is actually attested in Bronze Age sources (which isn't surprising, after all, it is straightforward NW Semitic, and both members of the compound are extremely frequent elements). That's it. After that, we're discussing Genesis, viz. traditions of early Judaism, 1st millennium BC. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:10, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Before surveying some of the recent works on Abraham, I knew from my research on the Exodus that the Pentateuch may well contain 2nd millennium BCE traditions. For example, the mention of Rameses in Ex. 1:11 seems to belong to a period in the 19th Dynasty, if you accept the identification of Yadin's Solomonic gates, as many scholars still do. In fact, acceptance of them is mainstream, and you have a Conquest some centuries before that. Your date for the fixing of the text under the Documentary Hypothesis is early. This is generally thought to have been done in the era of Ezra, which took place in the years preceding 459 BCE, not in 700. This does not prove there were no early Hebrew memories in there. In fact, followers of the Documentary Hypothesis generally <i>do</i> believe that these documents came from older documents; with some going back as far as the divided kingdom, perhaps within a century of Solomon's death, and some materials, like the Song of Deborah (in Judges ch. 6), perhaps even well earlier. Before we can dismiss evidence of Abram's historicity altogether, we must dismiss three topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>the correspondence with the Chedolaomer texts: I have just done a lot of research on this, and in general, it seems that the Genesis account may resemble this exilic text, perhaps betraying a late composition date, as per Welhausen's followers. Even so, of the kings mentioned in range Abram in the Chedolaomer texts, AmrapBhel wIhose naGme mayD bIe CvalK&lt;nowiki&gt;Insert non-formatted text here&lt;/nowiki&gt;id spelling for Hammurabi-El is the closest. If one adjusts for a Late Exodus, this becomes even more of a possibility. True, it is quite tenuous on this basis, but even this one isn't 100% guaranteed to be devoid of any historical memory.</li>
<li>the similarity of the names of some of Abram's ancestors to cities of the 2nd millennium BCE: while archaeology finds a cluster of cities in Syria and nearby with the names of Abram's ancestors, whereas the Bible would lead us to expect personal names, many serious scholars have not abandoned the idea that Abram's ancestors' names might not somehow be a memory of these city names. Since some of these only existed in the 2nd millennium, it still could be considered evidence of 2nd millennium memories.</li>
<li>similarity of customs: Some scholars assert that similarity of social customs place Abram firmly in the 2nd millennium BCE, while others claim that these customs also appear closer to the time of Ezra. In fact, there is no broad consensus on this subject, and it seems more exact studies need to be done.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a quick survey, the historicity of the Patriarchal age is generally supported in: "The Patriarchal Age: Myth or History?" by Kenneth A. Kitchen (<i>BAR</i>, March/April) The following writer then refutes many of Kitchen's points: "Finding Historical Memories in the Patriarchal Narratives" By Ronald S. Hendel, but still does not reject the historicity of Abram altogether. He writes:</p>
<p>"It seems likely then, that the names of Abram’s lineage and the geographical location of the patriarchal home refer to the Amorite homeland in this area during the second millennium BCE."</p>
<p>In "The Patriarchal Age: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob" By P. Kyle McCarter, Jr., revised by Ronald S. Hendel (<i>Ancient Israel</i>, 1999), we encounter:</p>
<p>"A place-name in the Negev section of the inscription ... is best read “the fortification of Abram” or, more simply, “Fort Abram.” The location and chronological context of this site make it plausible that the Abram after whom the site was named was the Abram of biblical tradition. Although we cannot be certain of this identification, the place name probably indicates the presence and importance of the Abram/Abraham tradition in the tenth century BCE"</p>
<p>Thus, there is far more plausible support for the existence of Abram/Abraham in the archaeological record than you admit, even though of these, only Kitchen claims to find extensive support from the archaeological record. Your comments above and below indicate you think there <i>is</i> no archaeology to be done on Abram/Abraham, other than the name, and this is just not the case.</p>
<p>None of what anyone's said seems to criticize my revisions concerning Abram's chronology, so I'll go ahead and add them. A 'Textual Criticism' section will be a fine spot to put a discussion of the Chedorlaomer Text, even though it could just as easily go under an archaeology section, since it really is both. It does tend to support what you are saying, but I'm just cautioning you that there are a number of points that I haven't proposed as yet that could go under an archaeology section that you are overlooking. This is not to say Abram's existence is proven, or even is supported by substantial evidence. Even so, there are plausible archaeological parallels that most scholars believe do hold some kind of memories from the 2nd millennium BCE, even though how many of these traditions ultimately derive from that era an ongoing subject of debate. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaThinker_2e1b.html" title="User:ThaThinker">ThaThinker</a> 14:48, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, I've made the changes. Hope everybody likes them. If the Textual Criticism section is deemed too long, I hope people will consider leaving off the last paragraph first, as it is really about the historicity of biblical figures in general (and I didn't write most of it). Also, the section on Traditional dating is in years A.M., but for the purposes of synchronzing with archaeology, absolute years are preferable. It too might be dropped, or else folded into the chronology section. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaThinker_2e1b.html" title="User:ThaThinker">ThaThinker</a> 16:00, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been working pretty hard on it. I'd like to have a day or two. Also, I have a few that discuss the problem of the historicity of the Patriarchs that have good Abraham material in them to add. Actually, I see now that the first paragraph only briefly uses years A.M. Perhaps it might be folded into the chronology section. Sometimes, when things aren't referenced, it's because scholars are in general agreement on them, such as the extent of Sargon's kingdom and Hammurabi's. I generally save the references for things that more people might doubt, and are central to the thesis. I think it's pretty tight, and may be worth your read as is. It turns out that Gen. 14:1 may be reasonable case study for both pro and anti histricity sides of the debate (although there are better pro historicity points that could be made). --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaThinker_2e1b.html" title="User:ThaThinker">ThaThinker</a> 16:25, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dab: You are being POV again. You write, "... scholarship today has given up attempts to identify Amraham and his contemporaries in Genesis with historical figures." While the Britannica writes that little remains of these attempts, it does not write that nothing does. In fact, a real archaeologist would never give up completely. If you will check my objections to your minimalist stance, you will see:</p>
<p>"It seems likely then, that the names of Abram’s lineage and the geographical location of the patriarchal home refer to the Amorite homeland in this area during the second millennium BCE."</p>
<p>In "The Patriarchal Age: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob" By P. Kyle McCarter, Jr., revised by Ronald S. Hendel (Ancient Israel, 1999), we encounter:</p>
<p>"A place-name in the Negev section of the inscription ... is best read “the fortification of Abram” or, more simply, “Fort Abram.” The location and chronological context of this site make it plausible that the Abram after whom the site was named was the Abram of biblical tradition. Although we cannot be certain of this identification, the place name probably indicates the presence and importance of the Abram/Abraham tradition in the tenth century BCE"</p>
<p>As you can see, McCarter <i>is indeed</i> trying to identify Abram with whoever fort Abram may have been named after in archaeology, in a recent work. You write "While Donald A. MacKenzie as late as 1915, " could uphold the Amraphel/Hammurabi equation, but this is just weasel-like language to imply that you've made a reasonably comprehensive search of all scholarship between 1915 and now, when I doubt seriously you have. You'll need a reference to imply such a thing. Although I'm sure such a search would do little to further knowledge, I'm willing to bet real money that there are some. It'd be nice if you'd talk with people before doing high-handed, wholesale revisions, even if you are an admin. I do admit that I did not notice that the publication date of MacKenzie's book was quite out of date.

<ul>
<li>Placing the <a href="../../../u/s/s/Ussher-Lightfoot_Calendar_5bd7.html" title="Ussher-Lightfoot Calendar">Lightfoot calendar</a> in the lead automaticlly places a Christian tone. Since there are plenty of Jews. Moslems, and Bahaii who disagree that is a POV issue.</li>

<dd>I am happy to remove the Lightfoot thing, I am <i>opposed</i> to putting a "lived" bracket in the lead altogether. I brought up the EB 1911 reference to show that there was no question of treating Abraham as historical, even back in 1911. There can well be a "literalist" section, but it certainly doesn't represent anything like secular mainstream. I realize that "scholars" may also have a religious bias and be scholars nevertheless. We then require to <i>state</i> such a bias. "(lived between 2000 and 1500)" did nothing of the kind, and whatever format you choose to present Jewish religious scholarship, my point is to get rid of the implication of historicity from the intro. If you want to argue for the possibility of historicity, which is not mainstream at all, the burden to reference very closely who holds such opinions lies entirely with you. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:00, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>um, how do you even want to <i>begin</i> discuss the content of the Bible without biblical criticism? Certain conclusions may be unreliable, but the discipline itself is just philology.

<p>Understood, but discussing 'P' and 'J' in the lead as fact is a bit of an issue.

<p>Regarding your specification of the calculatons of A's date as "religious", how do you propose to present an "archaeological" estimate for A's date? Seeing that the existence of A is entirely confined to literature?

<dd>my point is that the entire article is "literary", and that there is little point in a single h3 section within a h2 section. Why Wellhausen? As far as I understand, Wellhausen proposed a 6th century date for the Pentateuch. "Biblical criticism" isn't necessarily about proposing a 6th century date, it is about discussing dates and context <i>at all</i>. Parts of the pentateuch may date to the 6th, others to the 7th or 8th, and early bits even to the 9th or 10th centuries, that's perfecly open to debate, biblical criticism is just about even <i>having</i> a rational debate about the question. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:33, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And since there are those who believe that the Pentateuch dates to 1312 BCE – 1272 BCE, automatically assigning dates based on biblical criticism is an implicit support of one POV over another.

<dd>well, of course that's a pov too, but a purely faith-based one, and not one defensible by rational scholarship. I do have every respect for faith and mythology, but they shouldn't be misrepresented as being on equal footing with criticism. Saying the Pentateuch dates to the 14th century is like saying the Vedas date to the 4th millennium BC: a pious sense of hoariness which is certainly notable, but doesn't stand up to criticism (to be fair, it isn't off by 2,000 years as in the Vedic case, just by some 500, which may conceivably be bridged by oral tradition at least in fragments; it is more like saying that Homer wrote the Iliad in 1190 BC on his way home from Troy) <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 07:56, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> means that “all Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by a reliable source.” The literary POV is significant, but so is the tradtional (a few hundred million Christians, Moslems, Jews, and Bahaii). And while “ Articles that compare views need not give minority views as much or as detailed a description as more popular views, and may not include tiny-minority views at all,” I think the two views we are discussing are not considered minority. As long as they are all presented fairly, without bias, and labeled as such, we'll be fine.

<dd>I wouldn't dream of censoring the "literary pov". It just shouldn't be presented as if it competed for factuality with the critical approach. It's beautiful and notable traditional lore, no more and no less. You seem to imply that just by being Christian or Jewish, you necessarily need to subscribe to an Iron Age worldview, reject criticism and enlightenment and burn witches at the stake. This may be the case in the Bible Belt, but certainly not for Christianity as a whole, not to mention Judaism.

<dd>are you yourself familiar with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>? We do not present urban legends and popular beliefs on equal terms with scholarly opinion.

<p>While I am neigher a minimalist nor a maximalist, I should point out that midrash is comparatively late. By way of comparison, while we might look to the modern Mandaeans for some information about their religion not attested elsewhere, when we want to know what their beliefs originally were or how they got their start, we should give the oldest texts priority every time; fragmentary though it is. Midrash, as I understand it, is only employed where 1) an older text does not speak to the subject in a plausible way, or 2) where it can be correlated with other ideas suggested by older evidence. Midrash is also full of some pretty tall tales. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaThinker_2e1b.html" title="User:ThaThinker">ThaThinker</a> 21:53, 20 October 2006 (UTC) OK GUYS, MY username is RagingClue, I took part in the Exodus and the articles are completely factual.

<p>I moved the photo of the "Tomb of Abraham" to the section entitled "Islamic view of Abraham".

If there is any serious secular scholarship exploring the possibility of a historical nature of the biblical patriarchs, it should by all means be <i>cited</i>.

<p>I do not know that I made any additions that did not concern Abraham, except two sentences that were part of a paragraph which discussed the historicity of Abraham that I did not otherwise write, and a few sentences compariing of the uncertainty of the Exodus with the uncertainty of Abraham's chronology. The historicity paragraph been removed, as I recommended, but a lot else has, although it did concern Abraham. I do not support the continued presence of the misleading statement "Mainstream scholarship in the course of the 20th century has given up attempts to identify Abraham and his contemporaries in Genesis with historical figures." Every time an archaeologist digs up a rock with writing on it from the appropriate era, they look for parallels in Gen. While none hold that any person from Gen. has been found in archaeology, the existence of a Fort Abram could reasonably be taken as support that Abram traditions harked back to a very early period. Deceptive, deceptive, deceptive. What about the part where I show that with a late Exodus, the life of Abraham in the MT would have overlapped the reign of Hammurabi. This is not an improvement, but a hack job. If this is the way here, count me out. Talk about POV, when is Hindu tradition trivia? It also does not mention that many modern, mainstream archaeologists do support the idea of some relationship between a number of place-names, and Abraham and his ancestors. You know they have regions in India with the same tribal names as many of the 12 tribes? They claim they originated them. While this is unproven, it's not disproven, either.

<dd>heaping up disparate ad-hoc identifications is even less so. I am certainly prepared to learn that there is a continuing debate of "when did Abraham live" outside bible-thumping circles, but you have shown nothing to the effect. It is, of course, undisputed that "Abram traditions harked back to a very early period". So do, as likely as not, Hansel and Gretel traditions. But since, to the best of my knowledge, everyone agrees that the Genesis text dates to a full millennium after the purported lifetime of Abram, it is clearly a legendary account dealing with the remote past. You will really need to support your assertion that "Every time an archaeologist digs up a rock with writing on it from the appropriate era, they look for parallels in Gen." — this is like saying that every time people excavate things from the 27th c.

<dd>I'm talking about the constant polemic language, like "outside bible thumping circles", also the false insinuation that anyone who does not a priori dismiss the possible existence of Abraham, and agree to summarily write off any evidence that ever has or ever will come up, should be labelled as a "bible thumper" and automatically ostracised from discussion without even really looking at said evidence. That's hardly neutral, that's minimalism. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 12:47, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>not at all. I admit willingly that up to 1915 or so the question was open to secular debate, so that by no means do I categorize people as "bible thumpers" based on their belief in a historical Abraham. I was saying that I am <i>open</i> to references to an ongoing discussion outside magazines titled "The Herald of Christ's Kindom" or similar (a kind of forum that, yes, I did summarize as "bible thumping". The hallmark of the bible thumper isn't that he is interested in examining the historicity of the Pentateuch, but that he 'knows' it is historical, in advance, and merely looks for any shred of evidence that may be used to support this 'knowledge'. No honest debate is possible with such an approach, but, again, people <i>did</i> reasonably attempt to find historical evidence for Abraham, it simply happened to turn out that there is none. If a text should turn up in Old Assyrian cuneiform that mentions, say, a contract of one <i><sup>m</sup>La-ba-an with one <sup>m</sup>I-a-a-qu-ub DUMU <sup>m</sup>Is-ha-a-aq</i> concerning spotted livestock, of course things will be dramatically different, so you cannot say I "write off any evidence that ever will come up", it is simply the case that none has come up so far. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:32, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It shouldn't be applied to those who are looking for, or think they have found, other evidence <i>outside</i> the Bible.

<p>"heaping up disparate ad-hoc identifications is even less so." I don't see where my defenses of the possible historicity of Abraham are desperate. I am no Bible thumper, or else I would never have added the idea that Gen. 14:1 may well be from a relatively late Babylonian text in the first place. It is ad hoc, in that I only recently began studying this subject. The article, when I wrote my complaint, implies that archaeologists do not even bother looking for connections with Gen. I cannot prove that every archaeologist looks for comparisons from Gen., but then I did not add this idea to the article. You added text that claims that they NEVER do, and you added it to the article. No wonder you get so many awards for you articles. You take what others did, hack it up, and take the credit. Is this a faith-based assumption that archaeologists have completely given up on looking for parallels in Gen.? Hansel and Gretel was never represented as history. True, early traditions don't prove historicity, but the way you changed what I wrote, you would think historicity had been disproven. Hansel and Gretel cannot point to archaeology that has place-names that correspond to character names in the story that were current a millennium earlier, nor a fort perhaps four centuries earlier with one of the names. Perhaps I should have added the references I gave in the talk to the article, but at least I did not change the writing of somebody who knew what they were talking about to imply that archaeologists NEVER looked for parallels in Gen.; and then insist on maintaining it when the error was pointed out. We don't see things from the Gilgamesh story that suggest memories of a millennium earlier, even if of doubtful precision. Even so, an academic community that failed to consider the possibility of an early parallel to Gilgamesh would have blinders on in a way that those who champion learning should never do. Clearly, the archaeological community holds the possibility of parallels with Gen. in higher esteem than recoverable archaeology on a recoverable historic basis of Gilgamesh, if there was one. There are more than a few science-minded agnostics who consider atheism a faith-based position in much the same way as believers engage in biblical litereralism. If you want to revise my scholarship so bad, why don't YOU bring some scholarship to the table, before making wholesale revisions without even seeking support for them? How about inviting some comments on changes before making them, as I did? --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaThinker_2e1b.html" title="User:ThaThinker">ThaThinker</a> 23:49, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't say desparate, I said <i>dis</i>parate. I'll say again that I remain open to citations of such "digs for Genesis" in archaeology. I am not convinced just by your saying so. "parallels" to Genesis is a rather fuzzy claim. There are "parallels", sure, such as the very general knowledge that there were Semitic workers in Egypt in the Middle Bronze Age.

<p>In his book Moisés y los Extraterrestres, Mexican author Tomás Doreste states,</p>
<p>Voltaire was of the opinion that Abraham descended from some of the numerous Brahman priests who left India to spread their teachings throughout the world; and in support of his thesis he presented the following elements: the similarity of names and the fact that the city of Ur, land of the patriarchs, was near the border of Persia, the road to India, where that Brahman had been born.</p>
<p>The name of Brahma was highly respected in India, and his influence spread throughout Persia as far as the lands bathed by the rivers Euphrates and Tigris. The Persians adopted Brahma and made him their own. Later they would say that the God arrived from Bactria, a mountainous region situated midway on the road to India. (pp. 46-47.)</p>
<p>Bactria (a region of ancient Afghanistan) was the locality of a prototypical Jewish nation called Juhuda or Jaguda, also called Ur-Jaguda. Ur meant "place or town." Therefore, the bible was correct in stating that Abraham came from "Ur of the Chaldeans." "Chaldean," more correctly Kaul-Deva (Holy Kauls), was not the name of a specific ethnicity but the title of an ancient Hindu Brahmanical priestly caste who lived in what are now Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Indian state of Kashmir.</p>
<p>"The tribe of Ioud or the Brahmin Abraham, was expelled from or left the Maturea of the kingdom of Oude in India and, settling in Goshen, or the house of the Sun or Heliopolis in Egypt, gave it the name of the place which they had left in India, Maturea." (Anacalypsis; Vol. I, p. 405.)</p>
<p>"He was of the religion or sect of Persia, and of Melchizedek."(Vol. I, p. 364.)</p>
<p>"The Persians also claim Ibrahim, i.e. Abraham, for their founder, as well as the Jews. Thus we see that according to all ancient history the Persians, the Jews, and the Arabians are descendants of Abraham.(p.85) ...We are told that Terah, the father of Abraham, originally came from an Eastern country called Ur, of the Chaldees or Culdees, to dwell in a district called Mesopotamia. Some time after he had dwelt there, Abraham, or Abram, or Brahma, and his wife Sara or Sarai, or Sara-iswati, left their father's family and came into Canaan. The identity of Abraham and Sara with Brahma and Saraiswati was first pointed out by the Jesuit missionaries."(Vol. I; p. 387.)</p>
<p><br />
In his History of the Jews, the Jewish scholar and theologian <b>Flavius Josephus</b> (37 - 100 A.D.), wrote that the Greek philosopher <b>Aristotle</b> had said: <b>"...These Jews are derived from the Indian philosophers; they are named by the Indians Calani."</b> (Book I:22.)</p>
<p>Clearchus of Soli wrote, <b>"The Jews descend from the philosophers of India. The philosophers are called in India Calanians and in Syria Jews. The name of their capital is very difficult to pronounce. It is called 'Jerusalem.'"</b></p>
<p><b>"Megasthenes, who was sent to India by Seleucus Nicator, about three hundred years before Christ, and whose accounts from new inquiries are every day acquiring additional credit, says that the Jews 'were an Indian tribe or sect called Kalani...'"</b> (Anacalypsis, by Godfrey Higgins, Vol. I; p. 400.)</p>
<p>Martin Haug, Ph.D., wrote in The Sacred Language, Writings, and Religions of the Parsis, "The Magi are said to have called their religion Kesh-î-Ibrahim.They traced their religious books to Abraham, who was believed to have brought them from heaven." (p. 16.)</p>
<p>In Hindu mythology, Sarai-Svati is Brahm's sister. The bible gives two stories of Abraham. In this first version, Abraham told Pharaoh that he was lying when he introduced Sarai as his sister. In the second version, he also told the king of Gerar that Sarai was really his sister. However, when the king scolded him for lying, Abraham said that Sarai was in reality both his wife and his sister! <b>"...and yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."</b> (Genesis 20:12.)</p>
<p>The bible also states that Ishmael, son of Hagar, and his descendants lived in India. <b>"...Ishmael breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his kin... They dwelt from Havilah (India), by Shur, which is close to Egypt, all the way to Asshur."</b> (Genesis 25:17-18.) It is an interesting fact that the names of Isaac and Ishmael are derive from Sanskrit: (Hebrew) Ishaak = (Sanskrit) Ishakhu = "Friend of Shiva." (Hebrew) Ishmael = (Sanskrit) Ish-Mahal = "Great Shiva."</p>
<p>A third mini-version of the Abraham story turns him into another "Noah." We know that a flood drove Abraham out of India. <b>"...Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, Even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor; and they served other gods. And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan."</b> (Joshua 24:2-3.)</p>
<p>About 1900 BC, the cult of Brahm was carried to the Middle and Near East by several different Indian groups after a severe rainfall and earthquake tore Northern India apart, even changing the courses of the Indus and Saraisvati rivers. The classical geographer Strabo tells us just how nearly complete the abandonment of Northwestern India was. <b>"Aristobolus says that when he was sent upon a certain mission in India, he saw a country of more than a thousand cities, together with villages, that had been deserted because the Indus had abandoned its proper bed."</b> (Strabo's Geography, XV.I.19.)</p>
<p><b>"The drying up of the Sarasvati around 1900 BCE, which led to a major relocation of the population centered around in the Sindhu and the Sarasvati valleys, could have been the event that caused a migration westward from India. It is soon after this time that the Indic element begins to appear all over West Asia, Egypt, and Greece."</b> (Indic Ideas in the Graeco-Roman World, by Subhash Kak, taken from IndiaStar online literary magazine; p.14)</p>
<p><br />
<b>"The Arabian historians contend that Brahma and Abraham, their ancestor, are the same person. The Persians generally called Abraham Ibrahim Zeradust. Cyrus considered the religion of the Jews the same as his own. The Hindoos must have come from Abraham, or the Israelites from Brahma..."</b> (Anacalypsis; Vol. I, p. 396.)</p>

<p>Throughout this Talk page, and in his editing actions, dbac claims he is npoving the article when in fact he edits it into an extreme "the patriarchs were purely mythical" diatribe. Scholarly opinion is so obviously split on this (in fact, with a noted recent movement in *favor* of historicity), it's a wonder he has gotten away with it for so long. Let's start with the Encyclopedia Britannica:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Several theses were advanced to explain the narratives—e.g., that the patriarchs were mythical beings or the personifications of tribes or folkloric or etiological (explanatory) figures created to account for various social, juridical, or cultic patterns. However, after World War I, archaeological research made enormous strides with the discovery of monuments and documents, many of which date back to the period assigned to the patriarchs in the traditional account. The excavation of a royal palace at Mari, an ancient city on the Euphrates, for example, brought to light thousands of cuneiform tablets (official archives and correspondence and religious and juridical texts) and thereby offered exegesis a new basis, which specialists utilized to show that, in the biblical book of Genesis, narratives fit perfectly with what, from other sources, is known today of the early 2nd millennium BC but imperfectly with a later period. A biblical scholar in the 1940s aptly termed this result “the rediscovery of the Old Testament.”</p>
<p>Thus, there are two main sources for reconstructing the figure of father Abraham: the book of Genesis, from the genealogy of Terah, Abraham's father, and his departure from Ur to Harran in chapter 11 to the death of Abraham in chapter 25; and recent archaeological discoveries and interpretations concerning the area and era in which the biblical narrative takes place."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's clear what direction the EB is moving in. Paragraphs like the following leave no doubt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Most scholars agree that Ur Kasdim was the Sumerian city of Ur, today Tall al-Muqayyar (or Mughair), about 200 miles (300 km) southeast of Baghdad in lower Mesopotamia, which was excavated from 1922 to 1934. It is certain that the cradle of the ancestors was the seat of a vigorous polytheism whose memory had not been lost and whose uncontested master in Ur was Nanna (or Sin), the Sumero-Akkadian moon god. “They served other gods,” Joshua, Moses' successor, recalled, speaking to their descendants at Shechem."...</p>
<p>The Bible provides no information on the itinerary followed between Ur and Harran. Scholars think that the caravan went up the Euphrates, then up the Balikh. After indicating a stay of indeterminate length in Harran, the Bible says only that Terah died there, at the age of 205, and that Abraham was 75 when he took up the journey again with his family and his goods. This time the migration went from east to west, first as far as the Euphrates River, which they may have crossed at Carchemish, since it can be forded during low-water periods...

<p>Would "most scholars" agree that Ur Kasidim was the Sumerian Ur while believing Abraham was a mythological being? Would scholars place this mythological being in a solidly historical caravan route documented by Mari texts unearthed in recent archaeological digs?..

<dd>'dbac' being me, I imagine? I've only recently contributed to this article, and there was some rather serious cleanup work to be done. I am not aware of any 'diatribes' on my part. Also, I do not see the point of your rhetorical questions. Do you suggest that if we can identify Ur as a historical city it follows that Abraham is a historical character? Thus, if Troy is historical, so is Helen of Troy? If Babel is historical, so is the confusion of tongues? I would never dispute that Genesis is aware of the geography of the region. So what? Maybe it will be useful for you to 'dredge up' your sources now, and tell us exactly which 'recent digs' shed light on the historicity of Abraham, and what secular scholars in the past 30 years seriously attempted to argue for a historical Abraham? It will spare us the rhetorics. I do, incidentially, think that a historical Trojan War is very plausible. But that doesn't mean that I believe that a historical Achilles was shot in the heel by a historical Apollo. That is to say, I don't see how your trade routes contribute anything to the debate. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 00:29, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What we really have here is a <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellhausen.html" title="Wellhausen">Wellhausenite</a> approach to Biblical criticism, an approach that has been thoroughly discredited by at least two generations of scholars who cannot themselves be described as "religious". But in the face of truly mountainous evidence, those coming from a basically atheistic perspective have learned much more respect for scripture and have acknowledged that the supernaturalism, if tacked on, was tacked onto very real personages in almost all cases. That is the modern synthesis and it's embarrassing Wikipedia does not reflect it... Dbachmann, my point was not that a historical Ur = a historical Abraham. Read the excerpts a bit closer will you? They don't make sense outside of, at the very least, a real patriarchal figure who may or may not have become a nucleus for legend and myth going forward. What do you make of the sentence "A biblical scholar in the 1940s aptly termed this result “the rediscovery of the Old Testament.”"? Your attempt to reduce these paragraphs to "trade routes" isn't working... The EB article is a good distillation of the latest work and the latest consensus. Are you trying to tell us these paragraphs point to a mythical-Abraham consensus? If so, I would sadly need to raise questions of basic reading comprehension... Do you have access to the full EB? The rest of the article may clear things up for you... My other sources are on my bookshelf, but I question the manual labor involved to get across a point that's already so patently made: your flat statement "Abraham is not regarded a historical figure by secular scholars" cannot stand. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 00:44, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I want to know what non-religous, researchers believe about abraham, what is the scientific view? was he a real person or not? if he was a real person to what do we know about him? excluding the religous view, can someone seperate the scientific information from the religous beliefs, I genuinely want to know more about the person but, you can't tell whether the information given is dogma or science, please draw a line for those of us who want to skip the crazy section and just want an unbiased assessment. If there are religous folks who have taken over the article and wont allow a NPOV, I suggest the secularists make a section called "secular" view or if even this is resisted the "athiest" view this would in their eyes deligitimise (and make less threatening) the scientific view while allowing the rest of us to get the info we want. thank you</p>

<p>You don't understand what I'm saying, I don't know whether all points of view are represented or not, thats precisely the point, I want to see what the athiest POV (and we do have our own dogma) are what i want is a section untouched by religous people, called the secular or athiest view. I'm actually honestly not questioning whether the guy existed or not I don't know I have no incling, actually if i had to bet i'd say he probably was real 50.000001% (one story beats nothing) but the issue is, I don't care! as I said I just want to learn about the athiest views(I mean dogma), The athiest view is it self a concept worthy of mention completely seperate from the truth, for example the muslim view point regardless of whether it is true or not is clearly setout as the view of the muslims, there is no christian contribution there to say "...but christians think..."

<dd>For future readers of this section: one reason for there not being a section describing a unified "secular viewpoint" is that there isn't one. There are varying degrees of secularity; it is a relative term. For example, many highly-religious people would view those who believe in their religion's general principles without taking every word of the holy text literally as secular (I personally know several people who hold this viewpoint). Even among atheists there is no consensus as to whether or not Abraham existed as a person or, if he did, how similar he was to his Biblical persona. There simply isn't enough evidence to make anything more than a guess either way. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_S_616d.html" title="User:Robin S">Robin S</a> 11:16, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if this helps, but I was at the City of Ur last year, and was given a tour by the caretaker for the city. The city constists of the ziggurat, tombs, and other ruins. The tombs are for buried Sumerian royalty (kind of creepy to be down in) and one of the other structures is the house where Abraham lived with his merchant father when he was young. They have rebuilt the house from the foundation they have found with walls. The excavation was performed by a combination of British and Iraqi archeologists from the early 1900's to the mid-to-late 1900's. The guy who is the caretaker is the descendent of the main archeologists, so Ur is his life's work. So, scientists (archeologists) apparently agreed that Abraham did exist and that the building that was excavated belonged to his father, and that Abraham lived there at a young age. If the archeologists were religous people, they likely would have been Muslim/Christian/Jewist because of their national affiliations. BmorePunk 21:36, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Without having Exodus in front of me, (and therefore unable to quote chapter and verse), I think you're referring to the incident where Moses is confronted by God in the burning bush: this is announced, in the text, as the point at which God reveals his name, YHWH.Therefore, logiccally, the name YHWH shouldn't be found before this point. But it is: somewhere around Genesis 4 or 5, there's a verse that says "Now men began to invoke the name of YHWH" (or words to that effect), and word YHWH appears quite frequently throughout Genesis. So there's a conflict between the Burning Bush/Exodus statement that God here reveals his name for the first time, and the earlier occurrences from quite early in Genesis. What seems to be happening is that one particluar strand of the Torah narrative (the one written in the northern kingdom of Israel sometime after 722 BC) makes a great play of God's ervelation of his true name, Yahweh, while the strand that makes up most of the first part of Genesis, and which had its origin in Judah, has no such program. (The Judah text provided the statement that men began invoking the name of Yahweh soon after the expulsion from Eden, and the Israel text said that the Burning Bush revelation was the first use of the name). <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 05:23, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a perfect example of how scholars go off on entire tangents of Original research based only on their dim recollections ("somewhere around Genesis 4 or 5") of what the text says, without even bothering to look it up or check the facts, and thus produce brand new original theories never before published about the alleged (yet so far completely unattested) source documents they are so sure existed, in their determination to pull to pieces an abviously cohesive document into as many isolated fragments as they possibly can, based on the flimsiest and most forced of evidence.</dd>
<dd>The episode with the Burning Bush takes place in Exodus 3; here Moses asks to know the name of the Lord and is told "I am that I am" and "thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me to you." In Hebrew, "I am" is different from the tetragrammaton YHWH. In this chapter 3, as in the entire Torah, the names YHWH and Elohim are both used interchangeably, now one, now the other, at the author's preference, and from the Orthodox standpoint it is sheer folly to try to invent new doctrines like "Documentary hypothesis" in the mistaken assumption that atheist scholars make and try to force on others, that YHWH and Elohim are somehow not the same thing, but two different things.</dd>
<dd>It is later, in Chapter 6:3 (not the Burning Bush) where Elohim makes the statement to Moses: That to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, He was known by the Name of "EL-SHADDAI" rather than YHWH. There is no statement that God is revealing His Name "for the first time", indeed Genesis does state that the patriarch lineage called on the Name YHWH long before Abraham, that is from Enos (4:26). Other traditions hold that Serug (Abraham's great grandfather) was the one who turned to idol worship that became prevalent in his day, and that Abram marked something of a "renaissance" of worshipping the One Creator, who according to Ex. 6:3 he called "EL-SHADDAI". It is impossible, and the sheer folly of faithless scholars, to separate the different Names of God into different gods; beware of being led down this path. Exodus 6:2 is but one example of a verse that includes the Names YHWH and ELOHIM together on the same line clearly to refer to the same Entity: so, you self-proclaimed "experts" who so confidently think you know exactly how the books were written as if you had the supposed "source texts" right in front of you, answer me this: do you say Exodus 6:2 is a 'J' verse or an 'E' verse? <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 14:57, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Robin, I know you weren't intending to start a discussion of the DH, but it seems to have happened anyway. And Codex is quite right, I was being lazy in my answer by not bothering to look up exact verses. The correct answer to your question is that at Exodus 6:3 God says to Moses, "I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as El Shaddai, and I was not known to them by my name, YHWH." This is a contradiction of the many times that characters in Genesis mention the name YHWH, beginning with Eve at Genesis 4:!, where she says of the birth of Cain, "I have created a man with YHWH." Genesis 4:26 makes clear that this was not an isolated case: "Then (i.e., after the expulsion from Eden and when men had begun to populate the Earth) it was begun to invoke the name of YHWH".</p>
<p>Others who read this thread might like some more details, so I'll explain: Codex believes that the Torah is a single, unified document; I believe it was originally four separate documents, which were edited together in antiquity into their present form. Codex's is the traditional belief supported by the rabbinic scholars of the Talmud and by Orthodox Judaism today; mine, the Documentary Hypothesis, is the view of many biblical scholars (not all). The DH is based on the idea that each of the four original texts had distinctive markers - distinctive linguistic features, distinctive thematic concerns, even distinctive twists of theology (although all, of course, were Jewish). One of those markers is the revelation of God's name. Two of the four texts, those known as E and P, appear to believe that God only revealed his name, YHWH, to Moses, at about the point that Moses' encounters with Pharoah begin. They therefore don't use the word YHWH in direct speech prior to the revelation to Moses, refering instead to El or Elohim. The point, apaprently, was to glorify Moses, the prophet to whom God made his final, complete revelation: the writers of both E and P are believed on other grounds to be have been priests descended from Moses. J, written by someone not descended from Moses, and not from the northern kingdom (where the priests of the house of Moses had their chief shrine, at Shechem), had no such agenda, and calls God Elohim or YHWH depending on context. (He uses YHWH, god's name, in narration, but characters sometimes use the word Elohim, simply God, in direct speech). There are over two thousand instances of the words YHWH, El and Elohim in the Torah, and the number of exceptions to this picture is three.</p>
<p>Codex and the traditionalists would retort that the DH scholars simply find instances of the word YHWH and then stick the label "J" on them, when in fact these are simply different names for God, just as you cuold refer to "George Bush" or to "the President". It's a good point; how can you know that the DH scholars aren't imposing a pattern where none really exists? The test of the DH is this: the "names of God" argument is only one of several markers; others include such things as specific terminology (the holy mountain, for example, is called Horeb in E, Sinai in P and J - and note how P agrees with E on the name of God, but with J on the name of the mountain); names of minor characters (Moses' father-in-law is Reuel in J, Jethro in E); attitude to sacred objects (P mentions the Tabernacle more than 200 times; E mentions it only 3 times; J and D never mention it at all); attitudes to Moses and Aaron (in E, written by priests from the clan of Moses, miracles are performed with Moses' staff; in P, written by priests of the clan of Aaron, who held the High Priest-ship in the kingdom of Judah, it's Aaron's staff - the rivalry between the Mushite and Aaronid priests lies behind a lot of their differences). And so on - there are many, many markers, some of them, like the name of God, ocuring many times, others, like the name of Moses' father-in-law, occuring rarely. But the eral point is that these amrkers are consistent: when scholars attempt to take the Torah apart on the basis of markers, putting passages with J markers together, passages with E markers together, and so on, they end up with four consistent, coherent narratives, and not some kind of gibberish. Sometimes the allocation of a passage isn't clear, but the areas of uncertainty are comparatively few.</p>
<p>As for the E and P revelations of YHWH's name, the P revelation (Exodus 6:2) is quite explicit - I quoted it above. The idea that the burning bush episode at Genesis 3 is also a first revelation is less obvious, but it works like this: Moses is herding Jethro's sheep on Mt Horeb (Gen.3:1). "Jethro" and "Horeb" are E markers. An angel of YHWH appears in a burning bush (Gen.3:2). "YHWH" is a J marker, as is the appearance of angels, so this is a change to a J passage. At Gen 3:4, Elohim calls to Moses from inside the bush - back to an E passage, and note that the angel of the J passage has now become God himself. The switches between E and J are frequent, and the passages from each brief, and there's still a great deal of dispute among scholars as to what comes from where (and I'm surprised Codex didn't use this passage to embarrass me with - it's one of the hardest to defend for the DH). But at 3:9 a long E passage begins, and its length, and the larger number of markers, means that it's easier to be sure that it really is E. Anyway, at 3:13 Moses asks God for his name so that he can tell it to the Israelites: clearly he didn't know it up to then. (Codex will say that Moses was brought up as an Egyptian, and therefore missed out on a good Jewish education - I don't find this convincing). God replies, "I am that I am...say to the children of Israel, "I Am" has sent you"...Say to the children of Israel, YHWH, your fathers' god, the god of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, has sent me...This is how I am to be remembered." The phrase "I am that I am" is itself a revelation of YHWH's name - the root of this phrase in Hebrew is also the root of YHWH. This is the first time in an E passage - and it is an E passage, because other E amrkers continue, and there are no J markers - that the name YHWH appears.</p>
<p>I think this reply is already getting too long, but the field of biblical scholarship is fascinating, and I hope this will be of interest to future readers. (Not to Codex, alas, who will simply be enraged). <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 04:33, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not enraged but dismayed at seeing this nonsense here asserted as fact where it does not belong. As I stated, from the Orthodox standpoint, there is no contradiction. The specifics are known because they were revealed to Moses at Sinai. In the days of Enos, the patriarchs began to call the Creator by His Name YHWH. The worship of YHWH was passed along from father to son, including Enoch, Noah, etc. But it was abandoned by Serug, Abraham's great grandafather, who turned to idol worship, according to the Ethiopian Bible, that was never redacted by the Sanhedrin. It also details how Abraham rejected idol worship and deduced the existence of the Creator, whom he knew as El Shaddai. That was the Name that Isaac and Jacob and their offspring knew Him as until you get to Moses, to whom the Name YHWH was again revealed. There is nothing in any Bible to contradict this, there is nothing that states Moses was the first to call the Name YHWH, there is nothing that states God had never revealed the Name YHWH before - that's you putting false words in the mouth of the account that aren't there for the sake of your hypothesis. All it states, correctly, is that God never revealed the name YHWH to Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob, it doesn't state that He never had revealed that Name before Abraham, because He had. Please think very very carefully before attacking the Word of God. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 12:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What the?! Who wrote all that? That is not NPOV at all, and it looks like it was copied off a website. On top of that it doesn't even conform to standardized spelling. Should that even be there?

<p>I just went ahead and deleted it. If anyone objects you can voice your opinion, but I really don't think that conformed to neutrality standards.</p>

<p>Why is "In 2007 refered British Prime Minister Tony Blair to "Abrahamic heritance" without any questioning that a leader of a secular nation has to keep his personal <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> at home. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>" geedit&#160;?? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Limboot (<a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimboot_be2b.html" title="User talk:Limboot">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Limboot_16f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Limboot">contribs</a>) 20:12, 20 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>My reasoning behind removing it is twofold. First it makes no sense, there is no clear indication of what Tony Blain said or how it is relevant. Second there is a comment regarding what Tony Blair should do with his personal beliefs. This may be a valid debate to have, but what does anyone's opinion on the matter have to do with Abraham? Since the statement reads unclear, I could be wrong about the intent of the person who wrote it and my second reason could be incorrect.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So I have writen has a politician to keep his religion "at home". Futher is "also believed by person with a <b>other religion</b> totally wrong. Also people who believe nothing believe that Abraham has really existed, what is, in my opinion, ridiculous. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Limboot (<a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimboot_be2b.html" title="User talk:Limboot">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Limboot_16f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Limboot">contribs</a>) 16:10, 21 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Hello again, I'm sorry but the statement still makes no sense. I read the part that Tony Blair had to say about Abraham, but it has no relevance what so ever to the topic of Abraham or the sub topic of Abraham as seen by other non 'Abrahamic' religions. Also what does Tony Blair's personal beliefs have to do with Abraham or with the views of 'non-abrahamic' belief systems? The paragraph in the reference also doesn't at all state whether Tony Blair holds any belief in Abraham as a historic character. All it states is that he sees Britain as a place containing large groups that do.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Believed by systems" is in all fronts wrong. Because there is no "non abrahamic" system. And I dont agree about your removel of the fact that Tony Blair takes his believe in a <b>fictive</b> bible figure into (inter)national policy. 18:15 GMT</dd>
</dl>
<p>The reference does not state whether Tony Blair actually holds any type of Abrahamic belief. Do I understand your view correctly that you feel that Tony Blair is making a personal religious belief system statement and attempting to apply it to British government? Also do you further believe that he should keep such beliefs to himself?</p>
