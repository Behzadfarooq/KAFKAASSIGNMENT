<p>Is the story real? I could not find any informations about him on genealogy sites. Its hard to believe that he was burned at the stake at Wilno in <a href="../../../1/7/4/1749.html" title="1749">1749</a> (member of such powerful family like the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potocki.html" title="Potocki">Potocki</a>). I never heard about burnings on stake of <a href="../../../s/z/l/Szlachta.html" title="Szlachta">Polish nobility</a> members (not even in the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a>). Since <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Frank_6e7e.html" title="Jacob Frank">Jacob Frank</a> (<a href="../../../1/7/2/1726.html" title="1726">1726</a>-<a href="../../../1/7/9/1791.html" title="1791">1791</a>), people of Jewish descend joined the ranks of Polish nobility.</p>
<p><i>"The Mystery of Walentyn Potocki</i></p>
<p><i>Numerous encyclopaedias of Jewish history, religion and culture include an entry on Walentyn Potocki, with the additional information that this was the name of a Polish <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnate.html" title="Magnate">magnate</a> who converted to Judaism in eighteenth–century The Netherlands. After his return to Wilno, he was tried by an Inquisition [sic!] court which sentenced him to the stake. This legend, which originated at the turn of the eighteenth century, was published in a Jewish periodical issued in London as “The Jewish Expositor and Friend of Israel” (vol. 8, 1822). A literary form of the legend was created by <a href="../../../j/%C3%B3/z/J%C3%B3zef_Ignacy_Kraszewski_f28b.html" title="Józef Ignacy Kraszewski">Józef Ignacy Kraszewski</a>, the renowned author of numerous historical novels, who included the story about Potocki in the third volume of the history of Wilno (1841). The tragic fate of Potocki remains unconfirmed by eighteenth–century Polish or Jewish sources. On the other hand, it would be difficult to believe that the death at the stake of a Polish aristocrat charged with apostasy was not echoed in any of the diaries or polemical writings concerning religion and tolerance, topics in which the Enlightenment was particularly interested. In this situation, the court trial and death of Walentyn Potocki should be recognised as an historical legend deprived of all source–material foundations."</i> <i>Alicja Kulecka</i></p>

On the bright side, it is most definetly an ACADEMIC PUBLICATION - since it has appeared in <a href="http://semper.rubikon.pl/kh/" class="external text" title="http://semper.rubikon.pl/kh/" rel="nofollow">Kwartalnik Historyczny</a>, 3/2003, and it is a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_Academy_of_Sciences_2d22.html" title="Polish Academy of Sciences">Polish Academy of Sciences</a> official publication. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 23:32, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, as far as I know, the last instance of stake-burning in Poland was in mid-<a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a> and even back then was seen as a barbarity and was not legal any more. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 17:56, May 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all: Halibutt, I am aware of the incident you refer to. An atheist was sentenced to <a href="../../../a/u/t/Auto_de_fe.html" title="Auto de fe">auto de fe</a> in 1689. However, as I'm sure you are aware, Church instigated (and often non-Church instigated) persecution of Jews was common in eighteenth century Poland. One notable example is the massacre of Jewish communities instigated by the Bishop of Gdansk (in 1723, I think). I would expect that other <i>auto-da-fes</i> may have taken place without being recorded in certain historical sources. Nevertheless, the story of Walentyn Potocki is shrouded in confusion, so perhaps he was killed by other means. However, this is unlikely given the universal account of Potocki's burning (by universal, I mean among those who provide an account; it is not to include those who question the story entirely).</p>
<p>Witkacy, I'll try to address your concerns soon. As a preview: (A.) It is possible that he was not a member of the Potocki family. (B.) The Frankists acceptance in the nobility does not say anything for the acceptance of other Jews, given the Frankists' association with Catholocism. If you understand the history well, you'll see that the acceptance of the Frankists actually runs counter to your point. (C.) There <b>are</b> accounts of this story dating back to the mid-eighteenth century. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 19:36, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>From what I read, Witkacy info sounds plausible. I have done lot of research on that era, and I also find it strange that not a single source mentions this. This was both after the last common date for stake burning as well. Also, while <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">history of the Jews in Poland</a> certainly needs expantion, I am unaware of any 'common persecution of Jews in 18th century Poland'. While religious freedom in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth_68ac.html" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> was limited compared through 16-17th centuries, from what I read it was still a much more tolerant place then its neighbours and virtually all Europan countries, which were absolute monarchies and allowed only one faith. Besides, there are lot of disputable details in the article: 1) Kraszewski - does it refer to <a href="../../../j/%C3%B3/z/J%C3%B3zef_Ignacy_Kraszewski_f28b.html" title="Józef Ignacy Kraszewski">Józef Ignacy Kraszewski</a>? 2) Count - there were very few titled nobility in PLC, thus if a Count was burned - it would be a famous story 3) It is missing names, surnames, who is the 'daughter of a great nobleman' 4) References are sketchy, I tried to format them according to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a> but they are missing dates and ISBN/ISSN, we definetly need English ones (Polish ones wouldn't hurt, neither). --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 10:33, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as (1.), yes. (2.) Not neccesarily. Cover-ups can happen for all sorts of reasons. If his family was so powerful, perhaps they used their influence to avoid the extreme embarrassment that would arise from publicity of the story. (It was not covered up, however, in Jewish communities, where many would flock to his tombstone every year since the year of his death). (3.) I have no idea; I didn't write the article. (4.) Thanks for your work. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 17:31, 25 May 2005 (UTC) P.S. What's disputed about saying that the story is either true or false?!

<dd>Why the template - since it is likely it is a myth, not a real story - I would remove the tag after a rewrite indicating it is unconfirmed. My doubts are strenghten by the above quote Witkacy brought us (btw, Witkacy, could you provide a source for this quote - book, print, isbn, link?). If you are right about 2) it would be the first such event I heard about, and likely a very interesting research matter. It sounds *very* unlikely to me, though. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 20:01, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'm a bit pressed for time, but I'll just explain shortly what I meant by that: His name may not have been Potocki; there are different versions as to who the subject of the story was.

<p>The following questions must be answered to prove - or disprove - this story:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../p/o/t/Potocki.html" title="Potocki">Potocki</a> family. A genealogical tree or other sources cleary proving he was a member of it (as all sources claim). As Halibutt wrote, Polish nobility kept many, many diaries and such. Consider: almost all of szlachta - 10% of PLC population - could raed and write, and majority of them were very interested in preserving their 'golden freedoms' - including the right to religious tolerance. Now, I find it extremly unlikely that not a single PLC source would mention this event. A consipracy theory that he was 'erased' from all PLC records is rather laughable - we cannot base encyclopedia on consipracy theories, can we? --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 11:32, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your argument is misleading. If I were to say that I know aliens exist because I somehow intuit that the government covers up their presence - that would be unencyclopedic. Since evidence <b>does</b> exist to support the story of "AbA," one must only conclude that which would normally not be assumed, i.e. lack of abundant secular records for a prominent event. Why this is must be left to speculation (e.g. "The government and nobility wanted to avoid embarrasment, so they didn't publicize or record the event"). In fact, the execution may have occurred in the absence of public exposure (maybe in a Jewish area, given that all accounts detail that the Jews were aware of the execution).

<dd>We have now 3 modern publications, the Jewish Encyclopedia from 1970, the Moskal article from 2001 and Tabzir article from 2003, which claim there is no evidence for this tale. Tabzir goes the furtherst, claiming it was invented. There is no academic source I have found or anybody has given claiming it is true. Now, until you can give me such a source, I will say our sources say it is Potocki's story is not true. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 23:36, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>crime of conversion to Judaism punishable by death in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. We need a source to prove there was indeed such a penalty. From what I read, only <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> was punishable by death. PLC allowed for extensive religious tolerance, with Catholics, various Protestant sects (Lutharns, Kalwins), Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Jews and even Muslims freely living and practicing their faiths in its borders. While I admit that I don't know if conversion from Catholicism (most likely) to Judaism was possible, and I would agree that it would be likely punishable by social ostracism and such, I find it extremly difficult to believe it could be punishable by death (at burning stake, especially!). There is of course the possibility that he was put to death because of other (real or alleged) crimes, but again, this is not mentioned in the stories which I can google. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 11:32, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For starters, the mentioned Encyclopedia Judaica from 190 sais: "So far no historical evidence for the story has been discovered". Looks rather reliable to me, unless sb has a more modern encyclopedia-type source? Second, the Jacek Moskal article mentioned (and linked) below looks like the closest thing to an academic article any of us has found, mentioned and/or read, and while it does not prove the story false, it most definetly raises many doubts about it.

<dd>How about oral transmission from disciple to disciple, beginning with the firsthand account of the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilna_Gaon_9c31.html" title="Vilna Gaon">Vilna Gaon</a>, and continuing through a chain of world-renowned Jewish religious leaders, all widely acclaimed for their credibility? (By the way, this chain I'm talking about has produced only one version of the story; any other variations don't say anything against this chain's credibility). Here's the chain: <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilna_Gaon_9c31.html" title="Vilna Gaon">Vilna Gaon</a> (world renowned figure; primary leader of non-Chasidic European Jewry during much of the eighteenth century)&gt; Rabbi <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaim_Volozhin_9970.html" title="Chaim Volozhin">Chaim Volozhin</a> (<b>the</b> main leader of non-Chasidic European Jewry at the beginning of the nineteenth century; considered primary disciple of the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilna_Gaon_9c31.html" title="Vilna Gaon">Vilna Gaon</a>; world renowned figure) &gt; Rabbi <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yosef_Dov_Soloveitchik_fae0.html" title="Yosef Dov Soloveitchik">Yosef Dov Soloveitchik</a> (author of <i>Beit HaLevi</i>; founder of the <i>Brisker</i> school of thought; world renowned figure) &gt; Rabbi <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaim_Soloveitchik_797a.html" title="Chaim Soloveitchik">Chaim Soloveitchik</a> (son of previous; author of commentaries on the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maimonides.html" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>, now almost universally studied in <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshiva.html" title="Yeshiva">Yeshivas</a> world-wide; world renowned figure) &gt; All following disciples of R' Chaim Soloveitchik relate the account in his name.

<dd>It's an impressive list. I think we can reach a compromise based on the Jewish encyclopedia, which sais that there is no historical evidence, but the story is believed true. We can expand on this, giving Tabzir/Moskal sources and analysis for 'no historical evidence', and your above para as the source of 'belief it is true'. Although I'd love to see at least one modern publicatiosn stating this - perhaps the one you based your above para on? --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 23:39, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm concerned about the section that has been entered regarding evidence against Potocki's existence. Have all these points been raised in other works, or are these just points which have been made by editors of this page? If the former, they need to be specifically attributed.

<dd>Don't worry, it is all based on the two referenced articles - mostly Moskal, since I have not yet read the one by Prof. Tabzir (although if need arisises, I should be able to get a hold of it as well). On the other hand, I am still waiting for any sources proving Potocki's existence. I'd think that 21st century academic research is more relevant then 100+ years old encyclopedias - especially as the new research is aware of the old ones, and it simply corrects it with new findings. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 16:26, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I decided to pursue this matter a little further.</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, about Kraszewski. Moskal, who in his article quotes the entire orginal story, writes that Kraszewski is the second oldest source. In his "Wilno od poczatkow jego do roku 1750", 1841, he wrote about this story: <b>"W wielkiem takze poszanowaniu w Wilnie jest pamiec tak zwanego Abrahama Abrahamowicza, ktory wielkiego rodu, z chrzescijan katolikow, w Amsterdamie nawrocil sie na wiare zydowska, a powrociwszy do kraju spalony za to w Wilnie, niedaleko Zamku, pochowano popioly jego za mogilkami zydowskimi (dla tego, ze nagle zmarlych nie grzebia na mogilkach) gdzie i drzewo na grobie jego rosnie. Rocznice jego obchodza drugiego dnia Zielonych Swiat w Boznicy Wilenskiej. Slyszac opowiadana jego historja, dowiedziawszy sie o exystencjij rekopismu opisujacego cale to zdarzenie, dostalismy z niemala trudnoscia oryginal, z ktorego tlumaczenie, jedyny podobno przyklad Kroniki zydowskiej, w calej oryginalnosci i pierwotnej naiwnosci formy i stylu, tu umieszczamy na koncu, przekonani, jak dalece zajac powinno (...) Rekopism oryginalny nabylem na wage zlota, a moze drozej jeszcze, zmuszony zareczyc, ze nie wydam od kogo mam" – wyjasnia w przypisie pochodzenie tego zrodla Kraszewski - "tlumaczony z pomoca P. Alexandra Ellenbogen. – Zbyt wolne kawalki musielismy powypuszczac (...) Rekopism hebrajski nie wyrazny zajmuje scisle zapisanych osiem stronic cwiartkowych".</b> What is interesting here is that he does not give the title or any other information about the orginal, thus we cannot be certain if is the Hurwitz or another source.</dd>
<dd>Now, about Ammude bet Yehudah, p. 46a, Amsterdam 1766. It refers to Judah ben Mordecai Ha-Levi Hurwitz, another Wilnian, btw. His 'Ammude bet Yehudah' (or 'Sefer Amude bet Yehudah', The Pillars of the House of Judah) book is from 1766 (or 1765, as Encyclopedia Judaica states), and is the oldest referenced source about his story. Unfortunately, there is a problem: Moskal writes he was unable to find a copy of his book anywhere, including the US Congress Library (yet I found a site that claims library HAS this book, see <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/loc/Choice.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/loc/Choice.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>). Perhaps some of you will have more luck - if you are living in US, perhaps you could go and scan the pages for us, or get them on an interlibrary loan? Or perhaps this book is also in some Isreal libraries? It does look like this book exists, although I'd appreciate a more concrete evidence (listing in library catalogue, at least). And even if it exists, we must make sure it is complete - I found only a scan of the title page - see link above) and more to the point, it contains the Potocki's story (preferably obtaining a scan of the orginal pages). This would go to much lenght in countering the arguments the story is false (or, at least, countering the claim Kraszewski invented the story, and text analysis could show if Kraszewski based his translation on Hurwitz or not). Note that Hurwitz <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=981&amp;letter=H" class="external text" title="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=981&amp;letter=H" rel="nofollow">has an article at Jewish encyclopedia,</a> although it doesn't like me and I have to access it via Google cache&#160;:&gt;. As there are very few pages mentioning Judah Hurwitz (btw, perhaps one of you would want to write a wiki article about him?), I read them all, unfortunately, there is no useful info besides his bio in the Encyclopedia. Perhaps sb might want to check if there is any interesting info in the following academic articles: Feiner , Shmuel "Between the Clouds of Foolishness and the Light of Reason: Judah Hurwitz, an Early Eighteenth Century Maskil" In: Etkes, I.; Assaf, D.; Bartal, I. And Reiner, E.(eds.)Within Hasidic Circles, Studies in Hasidism, in Memory of Mordechai Wilensky, p. 111-160.Jerusalem, 1999 and Feiner , Shmuel "Atheism, Enthusiasm and Early Haskalah, the Case of Jehuda Hurwitz of Vilna" The Gaon of Vilnius and the Annals of Jewish Culture, Proceedings of the Vilna Gaon Conference, p. 169-178.Vilna, The University of Vilnius, 1998.</dd>
<dd>It would also be interesting to see what are the references (if any) of other sources mentioned as a source in Jewish Encyclopedia (after Hurwitz and Kraszewski). However I'd be suprised if they gave references other then Hurwitz or Kraszewski (check the dates...) Those are 1) Fuenn, Kiryah Ne'emanah, p. 120, Wilna. 1860, 2) Gersoni, The Converted Nobleman, in Sketches of Jewish, Life and History, pp. 187-224, New York, 1873 and 3) B. Mandelstamm, Chazon la-Mo'ed, p. 15, Vienna, 1877 . Ufff.

He is supposed to have been burnt at the stake as a proselyte at the foot of the fortress of Vilna on the second day of Shavuot, 5509 (c.e. 1749) and is also known as Abraham ben Abraham and as the Ger Zedek.

Now, some interesting facts from the article:</li>
</ol>
<p>1) it is proven and not disputable that there was a cult of his grave (in the oldest Jewish cementary in Wilna, Pioromont aka Snipiszki quater). The graveyard was devasted by the Nazis and completly erased by the Soviets, who build a housing blocks there</p>
<p>2) reamins of rabbi <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliyahu_ben_Shelomo_Zalman_c357.html" title="Eliyahu ben Shelomo Zalman">Eliyahu ben Shelomo Zalman</a> (apparently the most imporant of Jewish Wilna rabbis) and 5 of his family were allowed by Soviets to be transfered to a new cementary at Sultaniszki</p>

<p>3) there is also a 7th grave, without any description tablet (!). Some sources say it is the grave of Walentyn Potocki, but many mention that only remains of Zalman rabbi were transfered and say nothing of Potocki/Abraham</p>
<p>4) author mentions that book from 1766 is so scarce, it is not even the the US Congress Library collection, and that Kraszeweski's story is the second oldest and available source. Kraszewski is not considered a reliable source by historians, he is known to have invented some stories and events he claimed as 'true'. It should be noted that MANY sources from that time used this trick - claimed sth was true, quoting older, invented sources, etc. And all later sources give Kraszewski - or works based on him - as the primary source...</p>
<p>5) According to author, there is no mention of POTOCKI name, only an abbreviation Pot. and a note that he was a 'great lord'</p>
<p>6) According to the author, the Kraszewski story (translation) shows many similarities with the Jewish religious tale or <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocryphe.html" title="Apocryphe">apocryphe</a> (sorry, not sure how to translate in English 'chaldydzka przypowieść')</p>
<p>7) Author quotes a letter from Lithianian historian Rimantas Miknys who claims that 'this story is generally considered an invented tale by modern Lithuanian historians' as he has researched this matter and found not a single source proving this (i.e. no sentnece, no archive information) and that at that time the normal penalty could be 'chłosta' (beating) not death</p>
<p>8) Then, Jacek Moskal writes it is also claimed false by Polish historians (gives the name of <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janusz_Tazbir_b49f.html" title="Janusz Tazbir">Janusz Tazbir</a> historian)</p>
<p>9) a very interesting argument, echoing stronly what we wrote earlier: such a trial - from tortures to the death penalty - violates many szlachta priviliges, starting with neminem captivabimu and would likely be (in)famous all over Europe, as happend with contemporary 'Gdansk event' - yet we find no mention of it anywhere, which is very suspicious</p>
<p>10) Potocki name. There is not a single Walenty in Potokci genealogy, although historians admit that genealogy (especually of some minor family line) might be incomplete, if it is not very likely. However, many Jewish sources claim Count Potocki was of the main Potocki line</p>
<p>11) Count. The Potocki family received the Count title after the partitions of Poland (1795), although the 'Zlota Pilawa' line got it from 1606 from austrian emporor. Still, in many sources they were called counts even in 18th century</p>
<p>12) Many Potocki's have indeed travelled to Rome and been at papal's courth, as the story indicates</p>
<p>13) The author then mentions some examples of other known szlachta who converted to Judaism in 18th century PLC, some well known names as Marcin Maciej Radziwill. None of them has been convicted or died, although some did emigrate to Amsterdam</p>
<p>14) The author then discusses the conspiracy theory - could this really be erarsed from contemporary sources? Potocki family was wealthy, poweful and could try to erase such a shameful incident from the history. He points at Teodor, Polish primate, archbishop of Gniezno, member of Potocki family (third son of Pawel Potockiego). He was known for his opposition to religious tolerance ideals, and it is possible - just possible - that he could have scared many people into 'forgetting' about this affaris. But, there are two 'buts': one, that 99% of mentioned szlacha diaries were written for family only with no intent for publication, and PLC being very, very far from police state (it wasn't called anarchy for nothing), one could doubt it Teodor's influence would reach to those sources; second point - Teodor died in 1738, 11 years before alleged date of death of Walentyn Potocki&#160;:)</p>
<p>15) He mentions that there is a Jydisj proverb - Nich szpelen Graf Potocki - don't try to impersonate somebody wealthier/better then him (author mentions the orginal and translation may be flaky)</p>
<p>16) Author contacted the Potocki's family. None of them has any proof that this story is real, although one, Mikołaj Potocki, heard about it and one of his hobbies was collecting materials about this alleged ancestor (he gives the aboove proverb). He showed the author a book: 'Abraham sohn Abrahams, by S. Sachnowytz, printed in Frankfurcie nad Menem in 1930. But it has nothing we don't know already in this Talk page</p>
<p>17) there is a picture of Walentyn, painted in 1980s by a Moscow Jewish painter Grisza Bruskin for Mikołaj Potocki. Unfortunately, it is not in the article, but there is a skectch (begining of chapter VI) by prof. Meir Shub in his book Jews of Wilno. This is, however, only a portrait of an actor who played him</p>
<p>18) Prof Meir Shub nor Jacek Moskal were able to get into Wilno Church's archives, but they are rumored to be very incomplete (tnx to KGB which took most of them in USSR times), see also my point 7) Jacek Moskal did go through Vatican archives, and found not a single source mentioning Walenty Potocki's incident, nor to his mentor (in some sources only), who was also killed in Wilno around that time (Menahem Man ben Aryeh Löb z Wizun)</p>
<p>20) He was unable to get access by himself to the Inquisiton archives, but he submitted a question if they have anything about Walenty or similar converts - answer was 'we have nothing'</p>
<p>21) He did find a mention of him in the Mormons database (apparently available through internet, so feel free to double check this, I am too tired now myself). The information was very scarce: only that a person named Walenty Potocki was born in Poland around 1700. Unfortunately, the source 'Source information: Film number 2078024.' is not available througn net - perhaps an interesting Wikipdian near St. Lake City can go check this out? The author in his 2001 article promises to check this out, but there has been no update. Ufff. That's all from this article. I would definetly say based on this that while we cannot claim this story is false, we cannot claim it is true. It definetly remains disputable, and the scarcity and doubiousness of sources must be mentioned in the lead. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 12:42, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Piotrus: Who said the persecution was unique to Poland?!

<dd>Perhaps I overreacted, however, there is a fairly common bias that Jews were persecuted in PLC (erroneusly called Poland) *more* then in other European countries, which is the exact opposite of truth.

<dd>Because it wasn't. And such case (even if true) is rather exception than a rule. It does not make the whole AbA case any more credible to me.

<dd>Also, while eighteenth century Poland was better than a number of other countries at the time, and notably better than seventeenth century Poland (and, for that matter, Poland during much of the twentieth century), Jews were still persecuted. For example, the Jews were forced by Polish landowners (essentially <a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzerainty.html" title="Suzerainty">suzerains</a>) into the most unpopular work; the Jews became tax-collectors, tavern keepers, estate administrators, and moneylenders. This helped develop negative sentiments among the populace towards the Jews, in the vein of "<i>Kill the messenger</i>." <b>Of course, the existence of such persecution alone</b> doesn't prove the story of Abraham ben Abraham. The anti-semetic tendencies of Polish society simply provided a backdrop for the incident. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 01:21, 26 May 2005 (UTC) By the way, Halibutt, why do you continue to ignore the examples that I presented for you (the atrocities of 1723 and 1757) as real persecution? <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 01:25, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>They were not forced. Nobody ordered them to do it. The jobs were available, paid really well, and so many Jews took it. They didn't monopolize them, but as they formed a significant part of merchant&amp;etc. caste in PLC, they were quite a few of them. And what 'anti-semitic' tendences of PLC society do you mean? I thought we agreed they were fewer anti-semitic tendencies in pre-19th century Poland then in majority of other contemporaries countries?--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 11:12, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The Jews were not forced directly, but in the following manner: Most other jobs were usually not offered to them. They often had the choice of being unemployed or working in the above-mentioned capacities. The jobs <b>did not</b> pay "really well" (except for moneylending which provided a variable and unpredictable income that was sometimes high, and, to a lesser degree, estate administration, which, while being a difficult position to acquire, paid more than most positions). In most cases, the Jewish workers had to settle for whatever cut of the profits the landowners were willing to offer. Additionally, taxes were extremely high. It is true that the non-Jewish workers had the same problems: high taxes and little negotiating leverage. Also, you are absolutely correct that many non-Jews were also tax-collectors, tavern keepers, estate administrators, and moneylenders. However, non-Jews were typically given preference for job positions, and they made up a much greater variety in the workforce. Because the Jews were more cloistered within positions such as tax-collector, estate administrator, and moneylender, resentment against Jews only increased, as I mentioned before. The image of the money-grubbing Jew was engraved in the minds of many. This dynamic was certainly not unique to Poland, nor was Poland the most anti-semetic country around. However, to describe it as egalitarian and "<i>tolerant</i>", is, in my opinion, inaccurate. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 20:43, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The most developed Jewish communities were in Poland, Poland was admittedly not the worst place in Europe, and it was extremely difficult for people in the eighteenth century to move to a different country. That's why! Also, the dynamics (including expulsions from other countries) that led to the Jewish population explosion in Poland really were in place from the sixteenth century. One more thing: <b>Why didn't southern blacks in the US at the beginning of the twentieth century move elsewhere?! Does that prove that they weren't persecuted??!!!</b> In fact, I believe that, at that time, more blacks lived in the south than the more tolerant north! But that's an interesting argument, isn't is: "If they you're so persecuted, why don't you just leave!" <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 23:16, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I compared it with the history of discrimination against southern blacks <i>throughout the hundred years following the cessation of slavery</i>! To assert that I was comparing "<i>the history of Jews in Poland with the history of slavery of black people in the USA</i>" is to assert that blacks were enslaved in the US during the twentieth century. Such an assertion demonstrates a "fatally flawed" understanding of American History, as I wrote.

<dd>Tnx for those very-MPOVed quotes from those ancient text. I'd appreciate some moddern, academic research, though. Besides, as the above quotes show, in many cases the persecutions in PLC territory were caused by external agressors (Sweden, Muscovy) or happened at a time of war (the Deluge), and do remember that the towns of that time were often pillaged or sacked, no matter if their inhabitants were Poles, Jews, Germans or other. But mostly, you are breaking an open door. I am not arguing PLC was heaven on earth for Jews - until Isreal was founded in the 20th century, nowhere on Earth have they been truly safe and unpersecuted. There were various incidents in PLC, I could give you more examples myself and I wont dispute the validity of examples you mention (although the language of the quotes is seriously POVed). What I am trying to show is that PLC (and earlier Kingdom of Poland) - from its early times to its end in the 18th century - was one of the most tolerant places for Jews, and certainly the most stable and long lasting place with such a policy of religious tolerance (one may show places which rivaled PLC tolerance, but not for *centuries*).

According to the article on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> <i>In 1750 Maria Theresa ordered Jews out of Bohemia but soon reversed her position, on condition that Jews pay for readmission every ten years. (...)In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, Joseph II abolished most of persecution practices in his Toleranzpatent, on the condition that Yiddish and Hebrew are eliminated from public records and judicial autonomy is annulled. Moses Mendelssohn wrote that "Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution".</i></dd>
<dd>As to England, from the middle ages the Jews were required to wear yellow badges. Then Edward I exiled or killed most English Jews and it wasn't until Cromwell when the ban on Jewish settlement was lifted - and even then not many settled there.</dd>
<dd>As to Prussia - another completely missed shot. According to the same article, <i>In 1744, Frederick II of Prussia limited Breslau to only ten so-called "protected" Jewish families and encouraged similar practice in other Prussian cities. In 1750 he issued Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft: the "protected" Jews had an alternative to "either abstain from marriage or leave Berlin"</i>. Other German states varied in tolerance, but the number of Jews executed or killed in pogroms was tremendous. After all this was the reason why Yiddish, a Germanic language, was spoken mainly in Poland and not in Germany, where it was formed.</dd>
<dd>Since mid-16th century, when the Jews were given special status within the Commonwealth and king Sigismund even forbade any charges of ritual murder, there were zillions of examples of bad treatment of Jews all over the Reich. After mid-17th century, when king Władysław IV forbade all anti-Semitic prints, there was a huge number of such pamphlets published in Germany.

<p>I believe this article should be moved to Walentyn Potocki. <b>Abraham ben Abraham</b> is a very common name (lots of different people on google hits), thus deserving a disambig page, as it is in fact the most common name for converts to Judaism (Abraham, common first name, son of Abraham, surname given to all who didn't have Jewish parents).

<dd>By the way, Abraham ben Abraham is probably not the most common name for a convert. Despite Abraham being a common name (perhaps 1% (generously speaking) of all Jews go by that name), the most notable Abraham ben Abraham is Potocki. On a google search (if I recall correctly from a search I entered last week), the only references (among the first ten hits) to a specific person refer to Potocki. I think about half referred to Potocki and half to an example of what a convert's name might be. Additionally, many converts might not choose the name Abraham just to avoid the repetition! I'm unaware of any other notable "AbA"s, but maybe some will pop up in the future. As of now, I don't think a disambig page would be necessary. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 23:39, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>IZAK wrote in his edit descriptions "Remove legend and apocrypha beecause they are misused here. In Judaism "legend" may be applied to the ancient Midrash and "apocrypha" refers to works from the BIBLICAL era". Well, if not apocrypha, and not a legend, we are left with a plain tale or story, I am afraid. Also, IZAK, please read and discuss here the text before making major changes, you replaced "So far no historical evidence for Walentyn Potocki's story or very existence has been discovered." with "Multiple oral histories, backed up by several printed versions of the story, of many Jewish communities over the past two hundred and fifty years, serve as sufficient historical evidence for Walentyn Potocki's story and existence.", which is an exact opposite. While I admint that a notion of Jewish oral tradition is important and deserves mention, the facts are that there is NO HISTORICAL EVIDENCE except for this oral tradition, as discussed in lenght above. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 08:59, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

Hopefully you will be reasonable and not stick to biased views. You may insert that some non-Jews think the story is maybe a "myth" just like non-Jews think that Jews have horns and that lots of things Jews believe in or achieved are "myths"...the list is endless. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 11:27, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>IZAK, cool down, accusing people of anti-Semitism is not the best way to reach a compromise, not to mention that it's hardly any point. As to conversion to Jewish religion, there are plenty of such cases, parts of my family being a fair example. As to the sources being biased - I don't really know what you mean. Nobody is disproving the fact that the person existed in Jewish oral tradition and that his cult was quite widespread. However, so far we could not find any primary source (be it written or oral, be it Jewish, Polish or Martian) that would not be based on Kraszewski's work, which is often questioned as a valid historical source and was more of a novel than a chronicle. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 13:05, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IZAK. For once, the Moskal article mentions several other converts to Judaism, who either emigrated to Amsterad or lived peacefuly in Poland. Second, as I explained above, there was no law - then or now - banning convertion to Judaism. Third, various religious disputed were hotly debated by Polish and foreign surces (books, pamphlets, diaries), and there is no evidence of any conspiracy to hide Potocki's fate (not to mention it would be extremly difficult), so claiming there was a conspiracy is as serious as claiming we are ruled by Martians (got any proof?). Fourth, I am open for non-Polish sources (as I have indicated on your talk page, and on this talk page), please show me English/Hebrew or other sources that would have a proof of his existence (beyond the existence of Jewish oral tradition, and cult in Wilno, which I don't question, as they are obviously well-documented, and is mentioned in lead and historical section of the article). Firth, note that as Halibutt writes, so far the only primary source we have is the Kraszewski's (who was a Pole, btw) book, and Kraszewski has been found 'guilty' of inventing some historical facts and claiming they were true, so when you give us a source, please make sure it is not based on Kraszewski's work (for obvious reasons). Sixth, as you yourself admit, the Jewish Encyclopedia is a very reliable source, and it wrote in the 70' 'there is no evidence to back this story' (I'd assume they mean no evidence except Kraszewski's work). I would like to see what a newer edition of this encyclopedia has to say, but unless you can find sources proving otherwise, please consider this is just a fictional tale. Seventh, the only academic work I could find mentions there is no evidence - Moskal and Tabzir checked archives (not only Polish, Vatican and US as well), genealogy lines, libraries... nothing. Eight and final point: I hope that questioning this story does not make one an anti-Semite? --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 16:52, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tnx. Two points. One - I'd still like for a knowledgable person do add to the article a para on Jewish oral tradition, perhaps based on our talk above. Second: your version "<b>some</b> Polish and Lithuanian historians" has one problem: I have not found a single Polish a Lithuanian source claiming otherwise, so saying some creates a mistaken impression there are some historians arguing otherwise. Moskal, in his article, states that 1) Lithuanian historian he talked (name above in my post about his article) claims all Lithuanuian historians consider his story false 2) the only historian dealing with this matter in Poland, other then Moskal, is Tabzir. Not to much suprise, this is a rather tiny aspect of history, and thus one-two articles is all it takes to deal with this matter. Concluding, I think it should be changed to "all Polish and Lithuanian historians" (unless sb can find evidence to the contrary?). Plz note it is not my orginal research, it is what is written in Moskal article. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 10:00, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>There's no mystery about his identity or immediate origins. There is a debate about whether or not he existed; if he existed, then he was a Potocki. If he didn't exist, then he has no origins.

Presupposing his existence, there's still disagreement about his identity and origins (e.g., his name may have been Pototzki (unless this is just a foreign variant of Potocki(?))). <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 6 July 2005 02:55 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please re-read my previous comment. The category includes people generally thought to be real, but whose origins are mysterious. The Polish editors here have been arguing that Abraham ben Abraham was not real at all; ironically, by including him in this category, they are now arguing that he existed. And yes, Pototzki is just a variant transliteration of Potocki. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 6 July 2005 03:33 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So the main problem is the implication that Potocki existed (and inconsistant editing)? I don't really mind that implication, but I don't feel strongly about this, either. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 6 July 2005 04:20 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you want to remove this cat, do so, I want bring it back. I think it is as correct as it is incorrect. Ask Wiktacy who added it here why he has done so. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 6 July 2005 14:19 (UTC)</p>
