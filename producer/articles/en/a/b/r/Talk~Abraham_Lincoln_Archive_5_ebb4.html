<h2><span class="mw-headline">House Term</span></h2>
<p>The article states that "Lincoln himself was despondent, and he decided not to run for reelection." in reference to his speeches denouncing the Mexican-American War. I've read a few biographies of Lincoln (D.H. Donald, Sandburg, Oates, and Goodwin), and none of them state that this was his reason for not running again. They all, however, talk about how he and two other Whigs, John Hardin and Edward Baker, had agreed to rotate the safe seat between them, and that Lincoln subscibed to this plan and wanted to abide by it (while also taking great pains to convince Hardin to abide by the plan and not try to run again). There never seemed to be a plan for Lincoln to run again. Is there a source saying the poor reaction to his speech was his reason for not running again? Does anyone else remember the rotation plan? I figured I would get some opinions before changing it.<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattweng_904a.html" title="User:Mattweng">Mattweng</a>8:00pm 24 August 2006 EST</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Railsplitter</span></h2>
<p>"Poor boy makes good" -- is that really the theme they were pushing, as opposed to "poor boy just like most of you"? I'd be more inclined to refer instead to "humble origins" or something like that. What would the contemporary reaction to the rail-splitting iconography have been? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 15:07, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The GOP in 1860 gave heavy emphasis to Lincoln's poverty and rise to the top. It was Lincoln himslef who emphasized "poor-boy-makes-good" theme. Like the log cabin images in 1840, the rails seem to have been effective--they show up in many cartoons for example. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 15:12, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course I know about the log cabin and rail splitting iconography -- I was just wondering about the "poor boy makes good" language. Is "poor boy makes good" mid-19th century phrasing, or might we find something contemporary with the same flavor? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 15:35, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Biographer Thomas (1952) says: "when Abraham Lincoln was a candidate for President of the United States, and John Locke Scripps, a campaign biographer, asked him about his boyhood years, he replied: "Why, Scripps, it is a great piece of folly to attempt to make anything out of my early life. It can all be condensed into a single sentence and that sentence you will find in Gray's Elegy-- 'The short and simple annals of the poor.'" Thomas adds: "Republican organization was thorough. The party's techniques were skilled. Speakers and campaign literature made the most of Lincoln's boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, his rise from obscurity to fame. His nicknames, "Honest Abe" and "the Rail-Splitter," were exploited to the full.

<dd>Good. Now, is "poor boy makes good" mid-19th century phrasing? All I'm asking about now is the particular language; certainly the meaning and intent of the phrase is correct, but it sounds <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Alger_838d.html" title="Horatio Alger">Horatio Alger</a> than Abraham Lincoln to me. (Of course, now that I said that, I notice that the very first entry in our Alger bio is <i>Abraham Lincoln: the Backwoods Boy; or, How A Young Rail-Splitter Became President (1883)</i>.) --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 15:57, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Summary</span></h2>
<p>Isn't the lead and the summary serving the same purpose? So in my opinion, the summary heading is redundant and should be eliminated, with some of the essential items moved up to the lead. The lead is rather short for such a long article anyway. Some of the information is even a repeat of the lead, or a repeat with a little more information, which is then fully explained in the article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Add Lincoln's "Lost Speech" to Abraham Lincoln page</span></h2>
<p>I was just wanting to suggest that you add some information on Lincoln's "Lost Speech" which took place on May 29th, 1856 in Bloomington, IL. "It furnished the setting for one of the most dramatic episodes of Lincoln's life ... A speech by Lincoln was rarely an ordinary occurrence, but on this occasion he made one of the really great efforts of his life. So powerful was his eloquence that the reporters forgot to take notes of what he was saying. Several commenced, but in a few minutes they were entirely captured by the speaker's power, and their pencils were still." Since I am a resident of Bloomington/Normal, it would be greatly appreciated if this information were added. Thank You, dither1987</p>

<p>As a featured article, this article should NOT have a trivia section, a practice heavily frowned upon on Wikipedia. However, if you find a constructive way to incorporate any of this information as prose elsewhere in the article, please do so.</p>

<dd>I don't agree. I'm not aware of any policy or guideline against trivia sections as such. If there is, please point me to them and I'll stand corrected. What <b>I</b> personally dislike about trivia sections is that they attract lazy "drive-by" additions by people who don't bother to cite sources their items... and, if source citation isn't enforced, tend to accumulate a fair number of inaccurate items.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I don't see any reason not to keep the <b>sourced</b> items.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Many of the unsourced items are probably accurate and not too hard to source. The burden of supplying references is on those wishing to keep items like "He was born on the same day as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>" and "Lincoln was the first President to sport a beard" and "Lincoln stood 6 feet 3¾ inches (192.4 cm) tall," but the burden is probably not very heavy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even "according to legend" items are legitimate enough if there's a good source attesting that the legend is widely known. It is quite appropriate for the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> article to contain a mention of the Parson Weems' "cherry tree" story... in its <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html#Myths_and_misconceptions" title="George Washington">Myths and misconceptions</a> section, which is really just a trivia section that selectively contains only <i>inaccurate</i> trivia. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:37, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are two articles that address trivia sections. The <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_trivia_sections_in_articles_c909.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles">first</a> is a guideline from the Manual of Style that states that trivia sections should be minimized. The <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">second</a> is a proposed policy or guideline (I believe it was formerly an essay) that makes, IMHO, a very good argument for eliminating trivia sections altogether. Rather than repeat that argument I would direct interested editors to that article.</dd>
<dd>Further, if the burden of proof is so low then I would advise those who wish the material be kept meet that burden and provide a source. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 18:42, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some of the objection to trivia sections stems from having a list of random facts tacked onto the end of an article. I suggest that weherever possible the trivia items be integrated into the article in their logical locations. Some of these trivia items are quotes, which should simply be moved to Wikiquote if they aren't needed here. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 18:56, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Lincoln stood 6 feet 3¾ inches (192.4 cm) tall (not including his hat) and thus was the tallest president in U.S. history, just edging out <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_Johnson_a119.html" title="Lyndon Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> at 6 feet 3½ inches (191.8 cm) tall.</li>
<li>He was born on the same day as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>.</li>
<li>The last surviving self-described witness to Lincoln's assassination was <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_J._Seymour_c7c1.html" title="Samuel J. Seymour">Samuel J. Seymour</a> (~1860–<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_14.html" title="April 14">April 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>), who appeared two months before his death at age 96 on the <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>-TV <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiz_show.html" title="Quiz show">quiz show</a> <i><a href="../../../i/27/v/I%27ve_Got_a_Secret_d18a.html" title="I've Got a Secret">I've Got a Secret</a></i>. He said that as a five-year-old he had thought at first that he—instead of Lincoln—had been shot because his nurse, trying to fix a torn place in his blouse, stuck him with a pin at the moment of the gun's discharge.</li>
<li>According to legend, Lincoln was referred to as "two-faced" by his opponent in the 1858 Senate election, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_A._Douglas_4065.html" title="Stephen A. Douglas">Stephen Douglas</a>. Upon hearing about this Lincoln jokingly replied, "If I had another face to wear, do you really think I would be wearing this one?"</li>
<li>According to legend, Lincoln also said, as a young man, on his appearance one day when looking in the mirror: "It's a fact, Abe! You are the ugliest man in the world. If ever I see a man uglier than you, I'm going to shoot him on the spot!" It would no doubt, he thought, be an act of mercy.</li>
<li>Based on written descriptions of Lincoln, it has been conjectured since the 1960s that Lincoln may have suffered from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marfan_syndrome.html" title="Marfan syndrome">Marfan syndrome</a>, including the observations that he was much taller than most men of his day and had long limbs, an abnormally-shaped chest, and loose or lax joints.</li>
<li>Lincoln suffered lifelong <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">depression</a>. During one severe episode triggered by the death of his fiancée, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Rutledge_591f.html" title="Ann Rutledge">Ann Rutledge</a>, in 1835, his close friends, fearing him suicidal, kept constant watch over him. At one point during his presidency, his depression became so severe that he held a cabinet meeting from his bed. He also suffered from frequent nightmares.</li>
<li>For a period of years, Lincoln took <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_mass.html" title="Blue mass">blue mass</a> pills to alleviate his depression. The main ingredient of these pills was <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28element%29.html" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, which is toxic. Some historians now speculate that <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_poisoning.html" title="Mercury poisoning">mercury poisoning</a> may have accounted for the erratic behavior of Lincoln during the years he was taking the pills. He stopped taking them just after his inauguration and his erratic behavior seemed to subside at the same time. Reports of his behavior are consistent with symptoms of mercury poisoning. However, without hair samples from Lincoln during the period in question, it is impossible to confirm or invalidate this hypothesis.</li>
<li>He once mentioned one of his haunting nightmares to his friend. Lincoln mentioned that he was standing in a mourning crowd surrounding a train, and when he asked a grieving woman what had happened, she replied, "The President has been shot, and he has died."</li>
<li>Lincoln is the only American president to hold a <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent.html" title="Patent">patent</a>. The patent is for a device that lifts <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boat.html" title="Boat">boats</a> over <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoal.html" title="Shoal">shoals</a>.</li>
<li>Lincoln was famous for many presidential speeches and quotes, one short quote being "No man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar."</li>
<li>Lincoln was the first President to sport a beard.</li>
<li>Lincoln's son, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Todd_Lincoln_8576.html" title="Robert Todd Lincoln">Robert Todd Lincoln</a>, was returning home from Harvard University, when he lost his balance and fell between two railway cars. A fellow passenger reacted quickly, pulling him from certain death.

<li>In 1865 Lincoln received a letter from the International Working Men's Association, congratulating him on his reelection and praising his anti-slavery stance.

<dd>Regarding the claim that Lincoln may have had Marfan's syndrome: The three major indicators of Marfan's syndrome are heart problems, abnormally long arms and legs, and nearsightedness. Lincoln had no heart trouble, had limbs proportional to his height, and was farsighted, not nearsighted.

<li>A couple of misconceptions here.

<p>"To preserve the Union, Lincoln had to overthrow slavery, which he did through the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment. He took personal charge of Reconstruction, seeking to speedily re-unite the nation. He was opposed by the Radical Republicans who advocated much harsher policies."</p>
<p>-Lincoln did NOT have to "overthrow slavery" to preserve the Union. Before 1861 Lincoln did not want to end slavery. He wanted to preserve the Union with or without slavery in the South. Also, is "overthrow" the best possible word to use? Lincoln did not "overthrow" slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation. He outlawed it.</p>
<p>- Lincoln did NOT take personnal charge of Reconstruction. He was dead during Reconstruction.</p>

<dd>According to its Wikipedia page, "<b>Reconstruction</b> was a period in United States history, 1865–1877, that attempted to resolve the issues of the American Civil War when both the Confederacy and its system of slavery were destroyed." Although Lincoln was working on policies to restore states to the Union during the war, I do not believe the term Reconstruction is popularly used to describe Lincoln's actions. You could say that he attempted to direct the process of reconstruction through his actions in Louisiana and his language in the second inaugural, but that its actual implementation after his death did not follow his intentions. As to the 13th amendment, I was considering its effective date (December 1865), which was the event that actually ended slavery. If you wish to reword that sentence to indicate he submitted it to Congress before he died, that is fine. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 22:41, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>""Reconstruction began in 1862 or 1863 as this Lincoln article and all recent Lincoln biographies state. The "reconstruction" as standard usage; thus "Lincoln's Plan for Reconstruction" by William Hesseltine appeared 46 years ago. The 1865 date is merely a useful dividing line for textbooks. Constitutitional amendments are dated by their passage by Congress--which was the central event after all. What happened AFTER his death is very important indeed, but that's another story. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 22:55, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reconstruction did not start until the Civil War was over. Let us use some common sense here. How can Reconstruction start in 1861 if the War was not over? World Book Encyclopedia agrees with me.</p>
<p>" Reconstruction lasted from 1865 to 1877 and was one of the most controversial periods in the nation's history. Scholars still debate its successes and failures." <a href="http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Article?id=ar461540" class="external free" title="http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Article?id=ar461540" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Article?id=ar461540</a></p>
<p>To say, "He took PERSONAL charge of Reconstruction" is just asinine. Lincoln had ideas on Reconstruction. Lincoln had theories on Reconstruction but to say he took "PERSONAL" charge over Reconstruction is the type of gross error that makes people laugh at Wikipedia. Lincoln was not a PERSON during Reconstruction. He was a corpse.</p>
<p>This next sentence might and I say might pass without an error mark in an 8th grade Lincoln essay. But anything beyond the 8th grade and this sentence would be flagged.</p>
<p>"To achieve his main goal of preserving the Union, Lincoln decided to abolish slavery"</p>
<p>Lincoln did not "abolish slavery" through the Eman. Proc. until 1863. Lincoln stated in his famous letter to Horace Greeley in 1862 that abolishing slavery was not his goal in preserving the Union.</p>
<p>"If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that." <a href="http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm" class="external free" title="http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm" rel="nofollow">http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm</a></p>
<p>So to suggest that Lincoln decided to abolish slavery to preserve the Union as a declarative statement with no reference to time (the 1862 Greeley letter compared to Lincoln's 2nd inaugural in March of 1865) is such simplistic history it borders on the comic.

<dd>We can do better than World Book I hope. Reconstruction began in 1862-3--read Eric Foner's standard history of <i>Reconstruction 1863-1877</i> for example, Try one of the books listed in our Bibliography. Historians for 50 years have said Lincoln began reconstruction and took personal charge of the planning and policies--and indeed that point is made in our article and in <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstruction.html" title="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a>. Look at the big fight over the Wade Davis Act for example. Lincoln of course used the term--as in Lincoln's "Declaration of Amnesty and Reconstruction," proclaimed in 1863.

ISSN: 0735-8342 . <i>Abstract: In June 1864 the US Senate refused to admit Elisha Baxter and William Meade Fishback as members from the state of Arkansas. This was the first stage in the struggle between President Abraham Lincoln and Congress over who was going to direct Reconstruction in the South. The president had begun Reconstruction under the direction of military commanders. In January 1864 a new Arkansas state constitution had been drawn up which outlawed slavery. Congress would probably not have seated any men chosen by a presidential plan, but Fishback's corrupt election sealed the case against Arkansas.</i></dd>

<p>Abstract: <i>After the summer of 1862, Governor Andrew Johnson moved Tennessee onto a radical path opposed by both the state's Confederate-sympathizing majority and the restoration-minded conservative party dominated by the prewar Whigs. President Abraham Lincoln's continuing support of Johnson's reconstruction plan indicated the president's own radical drift and resulted in Tennessee abolishing slavery, repudiating secession, proscribing the political rights of ex-Confederates, and ratifying the 13th Amendment.</i> In a word, scholars are agreed that Limcoln began Reconstruction abd it was one of his major concerns. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 03:20, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Are you going to defend the statement that Lincoln, "took PERSONAL charge of Reconstruction"? You might think I am arguing over semantics here but to keep this statement in an article as pivotal as the Lincoln article makes Wikipedia wish it had the credibility of a 90 year old publication such as World Book.</p>
<p>Lincoln was DEAD during Reconstruction ergo he could not take PERSONAL control over it. I would be be satisfied if just the word "personal" was taken out of that statement.</p>

<p>This is my last comment on this issue. To say, "To achieve his main goal of preserving the Union, Lincoln decided to abolish slavery, which he did through the Emancipation Proclamation..." is just incomplete history.

It's true that Lincoln did not live into the period called "reconstruction"; however, he was a leader in establishing the process. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 14:26, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am a retired American history teacher who helps people with their Lincoln-related questions through e-mail.

I am wondering if an administrator would consider adding one or both of my links to the "External Links" section of Wikipedia's Abraham Lincoln article. Thank you for your possible consideration. Sincerely, Roger Norton</p>
<ul>
<li>Not an admin, but I added the first link Mr Norton suggested. While I hesitated in adding yet another link in a rather long article, and while I do have some criticisms of this site, overall it is a good site, which I have visited previously. A GWS on Lincoln will not infrequently link to this site. It is well designed, well illustrated, and would appear to be the result of a good deal of conscientious effort.

<p>Obviously, the quickest way to get this animal under control is to drop the ultra-lengthy Civil War section. It's already covered aplenty in its own article. any tidbits worth saving can always be accessed later and incorporated in the main article. I plan to remove it in about a week, but would like to hear from others before i do. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevewk_8d14.html" title="User:Stevewk">Stevewk</a> 21:34, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>i still plan to make the switch late this week, so if anyone else has something to offer, now would be the time. Hal et al., i'm simply going to <i>remove</i> the Civil War section because 1) its not a true deletion anyway (if the need arises, it can always be obtained from History); 2) Wiki already has a very full 'American Civil War' article. anything else i do, will be posted here, so all will know. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevewk_8d14.html" title="User:Stevewk">Stevewk</a> 16:43, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong objection</b>. The article on Abraham Lincoln will be one of the most read articles. Elementary and secondary students and teachers as well as collegiate students and teachers will consult this article as they begin studying slavery &amp; civil rights, powerful Presidents (Lincoln is always listed in the top 3 by scholars in the polls) and even the Civil War (causes, consequences, etc). More students know about the Gettysburg Address than the Declaration of Independence. However, to understand the Gettysburg Address the student needs background on Lincoln's role in the Civil War. The beauty of online encyclopedias is that we don't have to worry about space. We need to provide a complete picture and limiting material on the Civil War won't help anyone.</li>

<dd>Although Gary and Jim are certainly two of the most prominent Civil War scholars, neither has attempted a biography of Lincoln that I know of. Jim's 1991 <i>Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution</i> is an analysis in seven essays of how American society was revolutionized by the Civil War; his <i>Battle Cry of Freedom</i> is superb, but it is about the war era in a concise single volume, not focused on Lincoln per se. David H. Donald's 1995 <i>Lincoln</i> has been described as the "best single volume biography of Abraham Lincoln." Carl Sandberg's <i>Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years</i> and <i>Abraham Lincoln: The War Years</i>, six volumes published from 1926 to 1939, have been described as a "masterpiece of poetic biography" but they are not known for historical accuracy, particularly about his antebellum life. I understand that Michael Burlingame is working on a four volume biography of Lincoln, to be released in 2007 and 2008. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 00:25, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>no the deed is not done.

<dd>I agree with Rjensen on this. There was no consensus in this page on whether to remove all that material, whether it went into a separate article or not. In fact, I believe most of the comments to your proposal were quite negative. If a separate article remains, which I think is neither necessary or desirable, the parent article must retain an adequate summary of the subject. I do not intend to write such a summary because I am perfectly happy with the existing state of the article. Therefore, the burden is on those who wish to make this arbitrary change. If you would like to see an example of how a subarticle is to be treated, look at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gettysburg_849f.html" title="Battle of Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a>, which has very lengthy subarticles, but the main article has adequate detail for people to understand the main points without reading those subarticles. The Lincoln article must follow a similar standard. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 23:01, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Second, I noticed from <a href="../../../l/o/n/Special%7ELongpages_b363.html" title="Special:Longpages">Special:Longpages</a> that there are 804 pages longer than this one, meaning that we really need not spend much intellectual energy discussing this. The <a href="../../../l/o/n/Wikipedia%7ELongpages_869e.html" title="Wikipedia:Longpages">guidelines</a> about lengthy articles indicate that "Long pages are generally good, indicating in-depth and interesting content. However, it can also indicate that several topics have been lumped together." I do not believe it is reasonable to say that this biography consists of multiple topics that have been lumped together and since this is one of the most significant men in American history, I think a lengthy page is quite appropriate. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 23:25, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Lincoln's height, long legs, leanness, and thin face are skeletal features of Marfan syndrome. Evidence for other features of Marfan syndrome (ocular, cardiovascular) in Lincoln has been presented, but found weak. In 1959, Marfan syndrome was diagnosed in a distant relative of Lincoln's (a third cousin four times removed). Sharing 1/4096th of Lincoln's genetic material, it is difficult to ascribe much significance to this fact. Although the world's greatest authority on Marfan syndrome thinks it's "50-50" that Lincoln had the condition, other geneticists think it unlikely.</dd>
