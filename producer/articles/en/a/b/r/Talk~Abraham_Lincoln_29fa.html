<p>There used to be a trivia section in this article that had useful information like Lincoln's height, the fact that he was the first president with a beard and such. It's gone now because of this misguided moratorium on trivia sections. Can we get this useful information back please?

<p>Should Lincoln's "Lost Speech" be mentioned (May 29, 1856, in Bloomington, Illinois)? It "may have been the most influential oration delivered in America since the founding of the Republic," and it is considered a major event in strengthening the new Republican party and furthering Lincoln's political career. See: <a href="http://members.aol.com/RVSNorton1/Lincoln63.html" class="external free" title="http://members.aol.com/RVSNorton1/Lincoln63.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.aol.com/RVSNorton1/Lincoln63.html</a> which is linked in the WP articles on Oratory and Eloquence.</p>
<p>If the Lost Speech is mentioned (and perhaps even if not), Wilson Tucker's time-travel novel The Lincoln Hunters could be added under "Lincoln in art and popular culture". Its focus is the quest for the Lost Speech. 4granite 03:51, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could someone clarify something for me. As I understand it the story goes that Lincoln borrowed money to invest in a store in 1833. The store failed, I don't know if it was formally wound up or even if there was legislation to do that. Lincoln's personal debt became due and the law got involved, a sheriff seizing his possessions. Was this formal insolvency or was it a court judgement to seize assets from a delinquent debtor? I suppose in 1833 it could have been a criminal matter? The story that he took on his former partners debts voluntarily suggests to me it wasn't formal bankruptcy as does his legal and public career - in England it would have been difficult to practice law or take public office as a bankrupt. I'd like to get some clarification on a story which is clouded by his subsequent achivements. <small>—The preceding Johnnybriggs 05:36, 10 February 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Johnnybriggs (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnnybriggs_c5b0.html" title="User talk:Johnnybriggs">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johnnybriggs_9ed1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johnnybriggs">contribs</a>) 05:35, 10 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I think that this section needs to be expanded and cited. Also, the capture and holding of the 18,000 troops was already mentioned earlier. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikifier_62ae.html" title="User:Wikifier">Wikifier</a> 02:01, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The suspension of civil liberties was an issue that effected both the Union and the CSA and involved more leaders than just Lincoln. Habeas corpus was suspended in both the North and the South and both sides had political prisoners. Historian Mark Neely Jr has written two excellent books on the subject, "The Fate of Liberty: Abraham Lincoln and Civil Liberties" and "Southern Rights: Political Prisoners and the Myth of Confederate Constitutionalism".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I can tell, there is no specific reference to these issues in the main Civil War article. It seems like the best resolution would be to create a new, comprehensive article titled something like "Civil Liberties in the American Civil War". I note that the Heidler's "Encyclopedia of the American Civil War" has two separate articles on this subject, "Civil Liberties, C.S.A." and "Civil Liberties, U.S.A".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Any thoughts? Specifically:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. Should a separate article be created?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Should there be one article or two?<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorth_Shoreman_eb82.html" title="User:North Shoreman">Tom</a> 23:25, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Shoreman has an excellent idea: let's have two articles on Civil Liberties in USA and Civil Liberties in CSa, using Neely. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 23:50, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many readers read only the opening. It has to concisely summarize his important actions, before the war and during the war, covering military and civilian phases.

<p>The sentence should read, "Lincoln's attacks on Polk and Taylor came back to haunt him during the Civil War and indeed *were* held against him when he applied for a major patronage job from the new Taylor administration." Easy mistake to make; probably came from the combining of two originally separate sentences. It's so minor I probably wouldn't point it out except that it's an example of the problems of locking a page.

<p>Editors,</p>
<p>I am a presidential librarian at the Miller Center of Public Affairs (a research institution affiliated with the University of Virginia). We run a non-partisan, non-profit website on the American Presidency. We have a section on each president that includes an extensive essay on the president and shorter essays on the first lady and each cabinet member. Each essay is vetted by a prominent scholar of that particular president. We also provide quick facts, key events, and links to a growing collection of multimedia materials specific to the president. I believe that a external link to our Lincoln page would be a valuable addition to the Lincoln wiki entry. Please take a look at the following page and if you think it is appropriate, we would appreciate you adding it as an external link.</p>

<p>For 160 years, people have been citing quotes falsely or dubiously attributed to Lincoln.</p>
<p>For instance, did Lincoln refer to elements of the U.S. military as "demons from hell" in his first floor speech as a congressman?</p>
<p>One doubts it -- that speech was a carefully constructed legal argument. Would Lincoln have carelessly or deliberately wrecked his own construction? It seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Such words don't appear in the standard record of Lincoln's speech of January 12, 1848.</p>
<p><a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mal:@field(DOCID+@lit(d0007400))" class="external free" title="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mal:@field(DOCID+@lit(d0007400))" rel="nofollow">http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mal:@field(DOCID+@lit(d0007400))</a></p>
<p>The "demons from hell" words, and other dubious verbage, appeared a couple of months later, in a newspaper account by a supposed ear witness who claimed that the standard record omitted all the really bad stuff that Lincoln actually said.</p>
<p>This account was dismissed at the time as being the work of locofocoists (extremely partisan Democrats, presumably willing to lie about Whig politicians such as Lincoln).</p>
<p>See the book, "Abraham Lincoln: A Press Portrait, His Life and Times from the Original Newspaper Documents of the Union, the Confederacy, and Europe" -- edited by Herbert Mitgang (New York: Fordham University Press, 2000).</p>
<p>Since the "demons from hell" words are of disputed authenticity, the Wikipedia page on Lincoln should either drop those words, or else should indicate that they may or may not be Lincoln's actual words. Skeptic99 23:59, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The leading Lincoln specialist on this period (Beveridge) believes Lincoln did say that in his speech but erased the term when he sent it to the printer. Beveridge says: <i>"Obviously Lincoln had been unrestrained while delivering his</i> speech; and, when he came to write out his remarks for the Congressional Globe, had left out the violent part which so incensed the newspaper correspondent." <i>Beveridge goes on:</i> "The version by the newspaper correspondent resembles the language of Giddings and Corwin. The reporter's account was from memory of what he heard Lincoln say, and not from the speech as it afterward appeared in the Globe. Speeches published in the Appendix of the Cong. Globe were always written out, either before or after delivery....Often speeches as delivered differed widely from the printed version in the Globe. <i>(Beveridge, "Lincoln" vol 1 p 430) The Springfield Democratic newspaper (the Register) editorialized:</i></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I think Lincoln will find that he had better remained quiet. He will . . . regret that he voted that' Illinois officers [naming them] 'fell while leading brave Illinoisans to ROBBERY AND DISHONOR . . . "IN AID OF A WAR OF RAPINE AND MURDER". . .; that he has thrown upon the escutcheon of Illinois the stain of having sent six thousand men to Mexico "to record their infamy and shame in the blood of poor, innocent, inoffending people, whose only crime was weakness". . .; that he has declared by his vote that the "God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just."</i> <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 18:02, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section "Antiwar activist" confusingly discusses Lincoln's speech of January 12, 1848, as if it were two different speeches. The first mention of the speech is in the first paragraph, and has a footnote linking to Lincoln's official version, as published in the "Globe". The second graf of the "Antiwar activist" section mentions "an intemperate speech" and should be made clearer to show that this is actually the same speech. The second graf contains a direct quote attributed to Lincoln but not footnoted. A footnote is required. In addition to a second footnote, the first and second grafs of the "Antiwar activist" section should be rewritten to make it clear that they are about two different versions of the same speech, not two different speeches, and the article should also make clear that the second version is the unofficial version published by a virulently anti-Lincoln newspaper, the "State Register", but endorsed by Beveridge, in whose judgment the "demons from hell" words were "obviously" authentic. Skeptic99 00:37, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The "Antiwar activist" section should at least acknowledge the possibility that maybe Lincoln didn't speak extemporaneously on January 12, 1848 -- but maybe stuck to his prepared text, which he then submitted to the Globe, and which might actually be the valid version of his speech.

<p>The picture of Lincoln in your article with the caption "last picture" is dated in your caption as April 10, 1865. According to "Lincoln's Greatest Speech: The Second Inaugural" by Ronald C.

White goes on to say, "For many years the photograph was misdated ..." (page 129, caption of picture). The author, Professor White, is listed on the inside back jacket of his book as the dean of American Religious History at San Francisco Theological Semincary.

<p>Well, rather than continue a cycle of reversion, let's discuss the issue of Lincoln's ancestry. For starters, I see here no authoritative Lincoln scholars here that supports this claim. The sources provided for this claim do not come from reliable academic sources. Therefore, it is my believe that these claims do not belong in an encyclopedic article about Lincoln. The sources provided are more along the line of "conspiracy theory" cruft that non-scholarly folks put out from time to time in order to sell books. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 15:44, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I reiterate your point that the issue has not made it into any scholarly biography of Lincoln that I am aware of. Apparently there was an attack of this sort made on Lincoln during the 1864 election by an anonymous source (the same type of charges were made against Hamlin). However it seems well beyond the scope of this article to go into the minutiae of unfounded campaign claims.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The challenge for anyone wishing to include the article would be to describe exactly what research was done by Dr. Leroy Vaughan et al (the sources quoted in the article)to arrive at their conclusions. The place to do this, first, is here on the Talk Pages. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorth_Shoreman_eb82.html" title="User:North Shoreman">Tom</a> 17:37, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I am extremely suspicious of the claim of Ethiopian ancestry for Lincoln. While it is not that unusual for whites in the US to have some African ancestry, the chances of Ethiopian ancestry for Lincoln are so infinitely small as to not be worth any serious consideration without extraordinary proof. Ethiopia (also formerly called "<a href="../../../a/b/y/Abyssinia.html" title="Abyssinia">Abyssinia</a>") was an independent kingdom all during the period African slavery was legal in European nations and their colonies. It was also rather isolated during that time. The vast majority of Africans taken into slavery and transported to the Americas were West Africans. The comparatively few East Africans sent to the Americas came from the Portugese colony (later nation) of <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozambique.html" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, which is several hundred miles south of Ethiopia. I am assuming, of course, that the contributor pushing for this section is referring to Ethiopian ancestry occurring during the historic period. As I understand it, many anthropologists now believe that all modern humans are descended from a small interrelated group of humans that lived in what we now call Ethiopia about 250,000 years ago. In <i>that</i> sense, we are <i>all</i> part Ethiopian. <a href="../../../e/d/e/User%7EEdeans_e140.html" title="User:Edeans">Edeans</a> 19:42, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>well you are right that we all maybe part ethiopians. Anyway the reality is we should try to come up with sources that directly disagree with Lincoln's Ethiopian background. I have studied a lot about Ethiopia but even i don't know enough about Lincoln's relation with Ethiopia as much as the biographer of Lincoln Mr.William Herndon who said Lincoln has Ethiopian ancestry. So it is hard for me disagree with the biographer of Lincoln until i find some extraordinary evidence doing so.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Secondly, about the above comment regarding slavery, i don't think Mr. Herndon or others implied Lincoln's ancestry being from that of slaves. I think he and others who study the tri-racial phenomena are connecting Lincoln's lineage to a wider range of ethnic mix, including Native American. Let us try to bring atleast equivalent sources to disagree with the biographer's claim before we remove that section again. Thank you. Jack248 19:42, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

But i think it is not right to delete this detail about Lincoln given by his own biographer, just because of our opinion and feelings.Jack248 01:12, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not how it works here. Wikipedia's standards aren't that we prove negatives as you suggest we do above. We don't get to say "XYZ" is "ABC" and it stays that way until you prove it isn't. Instead, we must source positives to reliable and verifiable sources. In the case of Lincoln, a crackpot with an M.D. and an M.B.A. has nothing to add to the work of dozens of Ph.D. historians.

<p>Well, so far i have not read any evidence suggesting the opposite of what Lincoln's own biographer said. It seems like most of the reasoning above appear like this JUST CAN'T BE REAL or along the lines of "no way, there is no chance of this" etc... Well,i hope we can keep our discussion based on evidence and also with fairness for non-Westerner viewpoints. Also the wild claim that Melungeons only have "west African ancesty" is false. Notice that Melugeons have sub-saharan ancestry as well as Middle Eastern. Similarly, the nation that has Semetic groups in Africa is Ethiopia, formerly known as Abyssinia (Which was an empire that stretched from Eastern sub-saharan Africa all the way to southern parts of what we now call the Middle East) Also i am afraid both Abraham Lincoln's biographer and the Melugeons resources affirm Lincoln's Ethiopian ancestry. Also about the third evidence...well insulting the educated man who wrote that book by calling him a "crackpot" is not a very nice thing to say at all. I don't know what more to say about this one. I guess i will wait for somebody else to bring some kind of evidence before i edit the page and put back the resourced info. Thank you and i would really appreciate getting professional reply here. I realize it is a taboo subject but we have to address it in a civilized manner. Thanks. .--Jack248 1:47, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a bit there already, but I would consider it culturally significant enough to merit a place on either Lincoln's or the US Presidents page.

<dd>McPherson in "Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution" makes the point that Lincoln was instrumental in shifting the focus of American Liberty from negative liberty (i.e. freedom from government intrusion) as embodied in the Bill of Rights to positive liberty -- the utilization of the government to expand, in McPherson's words, "notions of equity, justice, social welfare, equality of opportunity." (page 64). In Lincoln's words (from his July 4, 1861 speech to Congress), the war was "a struggle for maintaining in the world, that form, and substance of government, whose leading object is, to elevate the condition of men -- to lift artificial weights from all shoulders -- to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Harry Jaffa in "A New Birth of Freedom" looks at the same speech from Lincoln and concludes that it is consistent with Lincoln's consistent position, in Jaffa's words, was that "the Declaration of Independence had formed the 'sheet anchor' of American republicanism." (page 399) Jaffa concludes that this is a specific rejection of the Southern conception of republicanism in general and Calhoun's philosophy in particular.</dd>

For one thing it would be useful if those with access to biographies of him to provide more information about his relationship with his wife to aid the balance of that article. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 13:52, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, I am arguing this in the right spot. People with an agenda are pushing to have that article linked to this. Just because they share the same name in the article does not mean it automatically or deserves to be linked. This is well poisoning by association.

<dd>To aid navigation between related articles. The point of the "see also" section is to link related articles. In this case other articles about Abraham Lincoln are clearly relevant and the reader should be made aware that there is more content available on the subject of "Abraham Lincoln".

<dd>There are currently only seven references in the "See Also" section. In the category page “Abraham Lincoln” there are 92 different articles referring to Lincoln. I was under the impression that this was the primary avenue for making a reader aware that there is more content available on the subject of Abraham Lincoln. The category page is intended to be all inclusive whereas the “See Also” obviously is not. I would think that the point of this discussion should center on whether this single article about the opinion of primarily one non-biographer and non-historian merits special reference, in and above the other 92 articles on the category page. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorth_Shoreman_eb82.html" title="User:North Shoreman">Tom (North Shoreman)</a> 15:30, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That would make too much sense and be too reasonable. I, on the other hand, would like to get back to the agenda pushing issue here and would like editor(s) to come clean on WHY it is so important to have this article linked under "See also" rather than listed as a category of Abe?

<p>Okay, I think I mostly started this, and I am "coming clean" and explaining why this belongs in see also, other than that most people agree-- It belongs in see also because this page is largely a lincoln biography, and sexuality of abraham lincoln centers on several written biographies of different viewpoints on the subject. It is also a subject of controversy featured on many political news discussion shows on radio and television. Ease of navigation is important because Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln is not the term anyone would assume to type into wikipedia. If someone were looking for that article, they would read the section here on his early life first. And so, nobody has accused you of having an agenda, in accordance with good faith, likewise nobody has removed the list of kennedy-lincoln coincidences and accused whomever put it there of having a supernatural conspiracy agenda. The article on Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln is based on the work of biographers and historians, and more biographer and historian articles could be sourced for it, according to a quick peruse of what google scholar gives me on the subject. You are the last hold out on this issue. I feel the talk page has resolved that the link be included, except for you. So seriously cut it out.<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 17:14, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not sure who you are talking to, but to say that this is "featured on many political news discussion shows on radio and television" is beyond a stretch.

<dd>Including myself, I come up with three people at least contesting the link. Contrary to your claim, there should be no problem finding the article using the wikipedia search. Someone typing in "Abraham Lincoln gay" in the wikipedia search will come up first with "No page with that title exists", but when you then search the words from that page "Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln" is the first article that comes up. If you use "Abraham Lincoln sex" for the search it is the second article that comes up. Not to mention the fact that, as I've noted earlier, the article can be identified from the "Abraham Lincoln Category" page. Why should this one article be specially listed when all of the 94 other relevant articles are not? <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorth_Shoreman_eb82.html" title="User:North Shoreman">Tom (North Shoreman)</a> 23:06, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Accompanied, as it is, by several eruptions of intemperate language, I don't get Tom's point for deleting the link. User convenience ought to be one of the desirable editorial criteria.

<dd>Actually the agenda pushing about this is VERY relevant. Having that fringe theory article in the category Abe Lincoln is more than fair. Every fringe article should not be listed under "see also". Should I repeat more slowly? Again, until I see the 5 by 8 glossies of Abe in action, that article is beyond fringe, imo. --<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeafterthree_41a1.html" title="User:Threeafterthree">Tom</a> 13:06, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am the one that deleted your work. The following is what you added:
<dl>
<dd>"Lincoln expressed his opposition to slavery, from his first public statements in 1837, and never wavering.He recognized that the whole country did not share his views, and he did not force the issue. The closest he came to compromising his views came during his debates with Douglas, where he subordinated the cause of <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abolition_%28slavery%29.html" title="Abolition (slavery)">Abolition (slavery)</a> to the principle of maintaining the Union.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In actuality Lincoln was silent on the issue of slavery for much of the time between 1837 and 1854. Since he never proposed, until the Emancipation Proclamation, the abolition of slavery it is inaccurate to label him as an abolitionist even though Lincoln always thought slavery was wrong. In fact if you go back to 1837 you will find that he spoke out against abolitionists. In the Lincoln Douglas debates Lincoln was maneuvered into making many statements that, by today's standards, are racist, but the issue of subordinating the slavery issue to preserving the Union didn't really arise until after the war started (perhaps you had the exchange with Greeley in 1862 in mind). <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorth_Shoreman_eb82.html" title="User:North Shoreman">Tom (North Shoreman)</a> 19:42, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for explaining your edit, and for sharing your opinion about Lincoln's life. Can you provide a source for your assertion that he "silent on the issue of slavery for much of the time between 1837 and 1854"? If it's true, there must be countless of sources that would back that up, possibly even using the exact same words you did.</p>
<p>I added my two cents after seeing a list of quotations, dated during that period. In fact, the one that got me going was (hold on to your hat) <b>in protest of</b> a measure against abolitionists. I hope it's not "original research" to parse a double negative.</p>
<p>Anyway, I won't revert your change, since you were kind enough to explain it. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 19:48, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>When you referenced 1837 I assumed you were referring to the instance in which Lincoln indicated that abolitionists tended to aggravate rather than alleviate tensions over slavery. From 1837 until 1854 the two major public speeches of Lincoln were his congressional attacks on the Mexican War and his later eulogy on Henry Clay which did mention Clay's views on slavery -- although I believe he probably would have spoken out regarding the Wilmot Proviso. My intent was to differentiate Lincoln's career during this time period from Free Soilers and actual abolitionists in the 1840s who were starting to make slavery a primary focus of their politics. It was really not until Kansas-Nebraska that Lincoln chose to direct his focus in that area. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorth_Shoreman_eb82.html" title="User:North Shoreman">Tom (North Shoreman)</a> 20:31, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Lincoln was far from silent on the issue of slavery between 1837 to 1854. <a href="http://www.nps.gov/archive/liho/slavery/al01.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.nps.gov/archive/liho/slavery/al01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nps.gov/archive/liho/slavery/al01.htm</a></p>
<p>Although Lincoln could never be called a true abolitionist during this time I believe Uncle Ed was correct to state, "<i>Lincoln expressed his opposition to slavery, from his first public statements in 1837, and never wavering</i>."</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you check out the link you provided you will see that the site happens to also skip right from 1837 to 1854.

<p>I did not delete anything. I did not touch the article.</p>
<p>I just wanted to make the point that claiming Lincoln was "slient" on salvery from 1837 to 1854 is not correct. He made numerous statements during that time period and not to get to anal about this but the fact is, if Lincon made just one public statement he could not be called "slient" on the issue. <a href="http://academic.udayton.edu/race/02rights/slave07.htm" class="external free" title="http://academic.udayton.edu/race/02rights/slave07.htm" rel="nofollow">http://academic.udayton.edu/race/02rights/slave07.htm</a></p>
