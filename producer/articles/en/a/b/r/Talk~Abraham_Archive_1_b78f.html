<p><b>Vandalism notice:</b> Someone changed the Hebrew spelling of Abraham to קוס אמכ. This is a Hebrew insult derived from Arabic meaning "Your mother's vagina."</p>
<hr />
<p>I am not sure why mention of the pineapple was removed. Could someone please clarify what authority was given that mention of it should be removed? Abraham was inspired by the Holy Spirit to record the history of the human race, including the fall of mankind at the eating of the forbidden unripened pineapple fruit. contact: hotreference@hotmail.com</p>
<hr />
<p>The spelling Abraham was erased. As this is a redirect from Abraham as well, common use suggest that that spelling should be kept as well.--<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstroNomer_6120.html" title="User:AstroNomer">AN</a></p>

<p>Almost all of the information in this article comes from the Genesis, but it is presented in a very heavy-handed, editorialised fashion. I propose to rework it into more of a synopsis, shortening it somewhat in the process and removing the stuff about the authorship of Genesis, which is not germaine to the topic (besides being controversial). Is anyone going to object if I do that? --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonadab_d568.html" title="User:Jonadab">Jonadab</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Well, nobody objected, so I did it. The article in its former form is preserved at Abram in the 1911 Encyclopedia, which is linked from the new article under Modern Views. If someone with access to the 1911 Encyclopedia can restore that node to a more original state, that would be good. The new node still needs work in some sections. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonadab_d568.html" title="User:Jonadab">Jonadab</a></p>

<p>The word <i>Abram</i> in the above sentence is used both as a word, and as the thing that the word represents. This can be very confusing to the reader.</p>

<dd>"Abram, a Hebrew pun on Ibrim" - that sounds unlikely, given that ancient Hebrew would have had the two words beginning with different consonants, ayin and aleph. Any evidence? - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 05:20, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>The original form of the name, Abram, is apparently the Assyrian Abu-ramu. It is doubtful if the usual meaning attached to that word "lofty father", is correct. The meaning given to Abraham in Genesis 17:5 is popular word play, and the real meaning is unknown. The Assyriologist, Hommel suggests that in the Minnean dialect, the Hebrew letter Hê ("h") is written for long a. Perhaps here we may have the real derivation of the word, and Abraham may be only a dialectical form of Abram.</i> Catholic Encyclopedia, 1911 Edition.

<p>(comments moved from article to talk) I don't think this is true:...in Genesis 11:28, all it says is Haran died, not that Abraham was unscathed in a fire. I think the author is thinking about another story, with three characters instead of one. Sorry! In fact, many aspects of this article are questionable.</p>

<p>This paragraph seems to attempt a critique. It uses phrases like "very loose" and "ignores ... entirely", and reports that "most fundamental Christians" do not hold to it. Is this a list of how the view fairs against credentials of some sort or, is it how those who hold the view would describe their position? I think the former; and so I'd favor deleting or re-writing the paragraph. <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a> 21:49, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>However, some amillenialists hold that the Christian Church has replaced Israel and receives the promises on her behalf. This view arises from an interpretation of Galatians 3:7-9, but it requires a very loose interpretation of the book of Revelation, ignores Romans 11 entirely, and is not accepted by most fundamental Christians.

One part of this article says that there is no source for Abram's life other than the Bible/Torah; another says it is the main source. Do we know which is right? Also if there is no other source, then it would make sense to simply say so at the start of the article, and then recount the scriptural version, rather having having to put 'according to tradition' and suchlike every few sentences? <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 21:24, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is the term "Biblical" NPOV?</span></h2>
<p>Since Jews and Muslims don't necessarily believe in the Bible, is it appropriate to make multiple use of the word "biblical" in this article? Just wondering. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a>20:48, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is "so it is not possible to know if he was a historical figure" in the third paragraph NPOV? Wouldn't something like "so there is no additional confirmation that he was a historical figure" be more NPOV, given that Genesis, as a historical document, asserts his existence?</p>

<dd>The Jewish people hold sacred the TaNaK -- the Torah, Neviim and Kethuvim. These constitute what is known as the Hebrew Scriptures, and to Christians the Old Testament, though the catholic Bible includes as well the seven books known as Wisdom Literature. The Torah includes Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy -- The Abraham story is contained in Genesis. Wikipedia self-appointed citatation police, please note: the TaNaK, with its full explanatory notes, is available in Hebrew and English at Barnes and Noble and Amazon, among others, and the explanatory introductions to the Oxford Edition of the New revised Standard Version of the Bible, and the New Jerome Biblical Commentary provide ample discussion of this. The words "Jews and Muslims don't necessarily believe in the Bible," in the opinions of several individual persons who have read this page (no footnotes available, and therefore dismissable by Wiki Cite Police)are confusing, ambiguous and potentially misleading.<a href="../../../a/m/h/User%7EAmherst5282_f5e9.html" title="User:Amherst5282">Amherst5282</a> 05:23, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a trifle confused.

<p>It is an insult to all Christians to say that he lived "Before the Common Era" rather than "Before Christ." In addition, it is quite possible that he existed prior to 2000 B.C.

<p>Yuber again violated every principle that I put on his talk page (including discussing it on the talk page and not being deceptive), and this was after I paid him the biggest compliment that I could muster. This time, he did even worse: he tried to revert an edit made days ago and disguise it by saying it was minor. YUBER HAS NOW DONE <b>3 REVERSIONS</b> OF THE SAME PASSAGE. As to substance, he is entirely wrong. <b>I won't go into the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> page and interpret the religious aspects there, and he (or anyone else outside their religion) should not here</b>. Further, he has been warned by respected editors to stay off controversial pages. Since Yuber is being a serial reverter again, I should not need to address the substance of the edit, but here it is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Christianity does not view Abraham as the ancestor of the Arabs; the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">bible</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> simply do not address <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> or its history at all. And certainly the Old Testiment, based on Judaism, does not assert the part about Ishmael and the Arabs. Further, the word "ancestor" is a problem for many Christians because some believe it may not mean it in the literal sense.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Before Yuber got involved, this accurately described the Christian view. I will attempt to make it accurate again.</p>

<p>In addition, on the substance, Christians do not view themselves as an "Abrahamic religion" because they only believe in one, Christ. That is why they call themselves a Christian religion not an Abrahamic religion.</p>

<p>Noitall, Abraham is NOT considered the founder of Islam; he is one of the many prophets. Please clarify facts before editing.

<dd>Thus, you should have no problems understanding now what Muslims believe in this manner and secondly, I have edited to show the christian POV in this regard. Lastly, Yuber has every right to edit this article and Abraham is one of the major figures in Islam and by saying 'Arabs' it does not mean Abraham founded Islam. Also you can not speak for all christians because many of them may say that they do consider themselves to be Abrahamic religions. I know many myself.

<p>Noitall, read <b><a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a></b>. Now, back to business...</p>
<p>The Old Testament does indeed describe Ishmael as ancestor of the Ishmaelites, the Bedouin of the deserts east and south of Palestine (cf. <a href="http://www.searchgodsword.org/enc/isb/view.cgi?number=T4682" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.searchgodsword.org/enc/isb/view.cgi?number=T4682" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.) A long exegetical tradition identifies the Ishmaelites with the Arabs, plausibly enough (particularly in light of its apparent equivalence with the Midianites.) However, not all Christians accept the Old Testament genealogies as true, and not all Christians accept the traditional exegesis. The latter, at least, applies to Jews as well. A more appropriate wording should reflect both facts, say "He is regarded by all three religions as an ancestor of the Jews, through Isaac, and the Ishmaelites, through Ishmael. In Islam, and in many interpretations of Christianity and Judaism, the Ishmaelites are identified as the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arabs</a>." - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 00:16, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Catholic Christians regard themselves as belonging to an Abrahamic religion, as the Roman Catholic Mass makes specific reference to "Abraham, our Father in faith," Pope Pius IX said of Christians, "We are all spiritual Semites," and Catholic University of America sponsors presentations by "Interfaith Delegation of Abrahamic Faiths," including Jews, Muslims and a variety of Christians. reference and citations provided. <a href="../../../a/m/h/User%7EAmherst5282_f5e9.html" title="User:Amherst5282">Amherst5282</a> 05:31, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Protestants also believe that Christianity is an Abrahamic religion. There is plenty of this in the New Testament; for example, "Thus Abraham "believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness." So you see that it is men of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you shall all the nations be blessed." So then, those who are men of faith are blessed with Abraham who had faith.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Christian and Biblical Endorsement of Islam and Arabic Heritage</span></h2>
<p>It is trying to insert a POV to try to lump the views of all 3 religions into one common belief. It is just clear POV of trying to get some endorsement. The common belief of Christians is as I stated. But to summarize,</p>
<p>I made these points:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. The New Testament and Jesus simply do not address Islam or its history at all.</dd>
<dd>2. Certainly the Old Testament, based on Judaism, does not assert the part about Ishmael and the Arabs (but do recognize Mustafaa's statement, but this intro is not the place for it)</dd>
<dd>3. The word "ancestor" is a problem for many Christians because some believe it may not mean it in the literal sense.</dd>
<dd>4. Christians do not view themselves as an "Abrahamic religion" because they only believe in one, Christ. That is why they call themselves a Christian religion not an Abrahamic religion.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is my edit for the passage in the 2nd paragraph of <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a>, which the serial reverters keep taking out (and BTW, I invited changes to the Judaism and Muslim parts where I have less expertise):</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are sometimes referred to as the "<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrahamic_religion.html" title="Abrahamic religion">Abrahamic religions</a>" because they all refer to the lessons of Abraham to some degree. Although Christians do not refer to themselves by this term, they view Abraham as an early figure of faith and recognize his attempt to offer up Isaac as a foreshadowing of God's offering of his Son, Jesus (Gen. 22:1-14; Heb. 11:17-19). Judaism sees Abraham as the founder of the people of Israel and the ancestor of their people through his son <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac.html" title="Isaac">Isaac</a>. <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> recognize Abraham as the one of many religious prophets through his son <a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishmael.html" title="Ishmael">Ishmael</a>.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is accurate with regard to Christianity. Let's keep it that way and not insert a POV right up front in the intro.</p>

<dd><b>Noitall</b>, If you checked the current article you will find that the almost the same thing that you have said in your 'edit' is stated in more NPOV manner and in less generalized terms. You must realize that you do not speak for all christians, I know many who consider themselves to be of the Abrahamic religions. Mustafaa's sources further prove my point. Surely by saying Abrahamic religion, it does not mean those whose religion was founded by Abraham, but those peoples whose ancestry are linked through Abraham, through Ishmael and Isaac. Clearly by generalizing what you seem to think ALL 'christians refer to themelves as', you are inserting your POV in the first paragraph. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor">Anonymous editor</a> 02:05, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am on Wiki, so I make no claim that my edit was the <i>perfect</i> edit. The criticism regarding the word or implication regarding ALL christians is duly noted and I will modify accordingly.

<p>In looking further into this -- note my intent to not speaking for all Christians but to note the general practice of Christianity and Christians -- I see that I cut and pasted my edit, and somehow the word "generally" was left off.

<p>"In the Torah/Old Testament... Abraham is described as a patriarch blessed by God and promised great things, father of the People of Israel through his son Isaac, and of the Ishmaelites, generally identified as the Arabs, through his son Ishmael." I take it no one's arguing the first two clauses, so that leaves "father of the Ishmaelites, generally identified as the Arabs, through his son Ishmael."

<dl>
<dd>You are entirely inaccurate as to general Christian thought. Where to begin?:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>1. Your entire passage is read as a whole, and you have inserted it to make your POV. If you want to be accurate, copy the entire biblical section, but this would be inappropriate to the introduction and not make the POV that you are trying to assert. 2. Many Christians do not believe in the literal translation of Genesis. Historically, the stories orally passed down for thousand(s) of years before being written down (and somehow the 50 years before the Gospels were written down makes them inaccurate?!). Many Christians believe that Jesus used such stories as a parabel and that later Christians used the stories as a foreshadowing of Jesus's life. What all Christians agree on is that Abraham was an early figuire of faith, whether literally or figuratively.</p>
<p>There is too much more to educate you, but I don't think you want to be educated. You have a POV and that is it. I just can't imagine what would happen if I tried to edit <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> or tried to edit the Muslim sections in this article simply because I found a couple sources that, on the surface, agreed with my POV. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 01:12, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It doesn't matter whether Christians believe in the literal translation of Genesis or not; that's why I phrased it as "the Old Testament says" rather than "Christians believe". I am well aware that Christians of various denominations may believe anything from every word of the Bible to virtually none, and no doubt some don't even believe Abraham existed. Hence the value of sticking with well-defined sources. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 01:20, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>generally, the Torah is the first portion of the TNK (TaNaK). Technically, the Genesis text appears within the Torah, but Torah is only comprised of the pentateuch. Therefore, Torah and Old Testament do not refer to the same set of texts. Biblical schlarship has also begun to title this work the "Hebrew Bible" although I can not speak for the acceptance of this term outside of Christianity. Likewise, the use of the term "Old Testament" also implies a Christian trajectory...if there is not a "New Testament", such as with Judaism and Islam, then why would anyone call it "Old" I would personally recommend perhaps the term Hebrew Bible and a parenthetical mention that Christians would use the term "Old Testament."--<a href="../../../s/e/m/User%7ESeminarian_4486.html" title="User:Seminarian">Seminarian</a> 01:08, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>many biblical scholars would disagree with the blanket statement that "Christian belief considers Abraham's attempt to offer up Isaac as a foreshadowing...." Although some denominations would offer this as underlying theology in the old testament, this is not a prevalent or representative statement of Christian belief on the whole. The trajectory taken by the larger proportion of biblical scholars is to treat the "Hebrew Bible" (aka Old Testament) as a stand alone text. This means that the text is interpreted for its own inherent meaning, and attempts to discern what the narrator of the text was trying to teach by telling (or including in the case of redation) the story. Therefore, what this means is that the entire Abraham narrative cycle is interpreted through socio-cultural, historical and redactionary criticisms for its theological content. It then becomes necessary to ask the question about what Christians might then learn from the story.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, Abraham is not a foreshadow of any Christian belief, unless an individual chooses to bring that belief to the story. Rather, the Abraham narrative cycle illustrates a history of the questions of faith and patriarchal narrative for Israel, from which Christians derive their identity.--<a href="../../../s/e/m/User%7ESeminarian_4486.html" title="User:Seminarian">Seminarian</a> 00:59, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've removed the from the article, the following interesting text added by anon 200.11.242.33, because it was apparently copied from <a href="http://www.viewzone.com/abraham.html" class="external text" title="http://www.viewzone.com/abraham.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, The first part is a quote from a book by Tomás Doreste, the rest is a continuation of the article that the quote is from. (<i>Start of removed text</i>)</p>
<p><a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltaire.html" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> was of the opinion that Abraham descended from some of the numerous Brahman <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priests.html" title="Priests">priests</a> who left <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> to spread their teachings throughout the world; and in support of his thesis he presented the following elements: the similarity of names and the fact that the city of <a href="../../../u/r/_/Ur.html" title="Ur">Ur</a>, land of the patriarchs, was near the border of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a>, the road to India, where that Brahman had been born.</p>
<p>The name of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahma.html" title="Brahma">Brahma</a> was highly respected in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, and his influence spread throughout <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a> as far as the lands bathed by the rivers Euphrates and Tigris. The Persians adopted Brahma and made him their own. Later they would say that the <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> arrived from <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bactria.html" title="Bactria">Bactria</a>, a mountainous region situated midway on the road to India. (pp. 46-47.)</p>
<p>Bactria (a region of ancient Afghanistan) was the locality of a prototypical Jewish nation called Juhuda or Jaguda, also called Ur-Jaguda. Ur meant "place or town." Therefore, the bible was correct in stating that Abraham came from "Ur of the Chaldeans." "<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldean.html" title="Chaldean">Chaldean</a>," more correctly Kaul-Deva (Holy Kauls), was not the name of a specific ethnicity but the title of an ancient Hindu Brahmanical priestly caste who lived in what are now <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and the Indian state of <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashmir.html" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>.</p>
<p>"The tribe of Ioud or the Brahmin Abraham, was expelled from or left the Maturea of the kingdom of Oude in India and, settling in Goshen, or the house of the Sun or Heliopolis in Egypt, gave it the name of the place which they had left in India, Maturea." (Anacalypsis; Vol. I, p. 405.)</p>
<p>"He was of the religion or sect of Persia, and of Melchizedek."(Vol. I, p. 364.)</p>
<p>"The <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persians.html" title="Persians">Persians</a> also claim <a href="../../../i/b/r/Ibrahim.html" title="Ibrahim">Ibrahim</a>, i.e. <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a>, for their founder, as well as the Jews. Thus we see that according to all ancient history the Persians, the Jews, and the Arabians are descendants of Abraham.(p.85) ...We are told that Terah, the father of Abraham, originally came from an Eastern country called Ur, of the Chaldees or Culdees, to dwell in a district called Mesopotamia. Some time after he had dwelt there, <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a>, or <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abram.html" title="Abram">Abram</a>, or <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahma.html" title="Brahma">Brahma</a>, and his wife <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sara.html" title="Sara">Sara</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarai.html" title="Sarai">Sarai</a>, or Sara-iswati, left their father's family and came into Canaan. The identity of Abraham and Sara with Brahma and Saraiswati was first pointed out by the Jesuit missionaries."(Vol. I; p. 387.)</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_mythology.html" title="Hindu mythology">Hindu mythology</a>, Sarai-Svati is Brahm's sister. The bible gives two stories of Abraham. In this first version, Abraham told Pharaoh that he was lying when he introduced Sarai as his sister. In the second version, he also told the king of Gerar that Sarai was really his sister. However, when the king scolded him for lying, Abraham said that Sarai was in reality both his wife and his sister! "...and yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife." (Genesis 20:12.)</p>
<p>But the anomalies don't end here. In India, a tributary of the river Saraisvati is Ghaggar. Another tributary of the same river is Hakra. According to Jewish traditions, Hagar was Sarai's maidservant; the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moslems.html" title="Moslems">Moslems</a> say she was an Egyptian princess. Notice the similarities of <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghaggar.html" title="Ghaggar">Ghaggar</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakra.html" title="Hakra">Hakra</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagar.html" title="Hagar">Hagar</a>.</p>
<p>The bible also states that Ishmael, son of Hagar, and his descendants lived in India. "...Ishmael breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his kin... They dwelt from <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havilah.html" title="Havilah">Havilah</a> (India), by Shur, which is close to Egypt, all the way to Asshur." (Genesis 25:17-18.) It is an interesting fact that the names of <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_and_Ishmael_8f04.html" title="Isaac and Ishmael">Isaac and Ishmael</a> are derive from Sanskrit: (Hebrew) Ishaak = (Sanskrit) Ishakhu = "Friend of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>." (<a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>) <a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishmael.html" title="Ishmael">Ishmael</a> = (<a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>) Ish-Mahal = "Great Shiva."</p>
<p>A third mini-version of the Abraham story turns him into another "Noah." We know that a flood drove Abraham out of India. "...Thus saith the Lord God of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, Even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor; and they served other gods. And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan." (Joshua 24:2-3.)</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> 25 mentions some descendants of his concubine <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketura.html" title="Ketura">Ketura</a> (Note: The <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moslems.html" title="Moslems">Moslems</a> claim that Ketura is another name of <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagar.html" title="Hagar">Hagar</a>.): Jokshan; Sheba; Dedan; Epher. Some descendants of Noah were Joktan, Sheba, Dedan, and Ophir. These varying versions have caused me to suspect that the writers of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">bible</a> were trying to unite several different branches of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>.</p>
<p>About 1900 BC, the cult of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahm.html" title="Brahm">Brahm</a> was carried to the Middle and Near East by several different Indian groups after a severe rainfall and earthquake tore Northern India apart, even changing the courses of the Indus and Saraisvati rivers. The classical <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geographer.html" title="Geographer">geographer</a> Strabo tells us just how nearly complete the abandonment of Northwestern India was. "Aristobolus says that when he was sent upon a certain mission in India, he saw a country of more than a thousand cities, together with villages, that had been deserted because the Indus had abandoned its proper bed." (Strabo's Geography, XV.I.19.)</p>
<p>"The drying up of the <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarasvati.html" title="Sarasvati">Sarasvati</a> around 3000 BCE, which led to a major relocation of the population centered around in the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindhu.html" title="Sindhu">Sindhu</a> and the Sarasvati valleys, could have been the event that caused a migration westward from India. It is soon after this time that the Indic element begins to appear all over West Asia, Egypt, and Greece." (Indic Ideas in the Graeco-Roman World, by Subhash Kak, taken from IndiaStar online literary magazine; p.14)</p>
<p>Indian historian Kuttikhat Purushothama Chon believes that Abraham was driven out of India. He states that the <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryans.html" title="Aryans">Aryans</a>, unable to defeat the <a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuras.html" title="Asuras">Asuras</a> (The mercantile caste that once ruled in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indus_Valley_282f.html" title="Indus Valley">Indus Valley</a> or Harappans) spent so many years fighting covertly against the Asuras, such as destroying their huge system of irrigation lakes, causing destructive <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flooding.html" title="Flooding">flooding</a>, that Abraham and his kindred just gave up and marched to West Asia. (See Remedy the Frauds in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>.) Therefore, besides being driven out of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_India_7918.html" title="Northern India">Northern India</a> by floods, the Aryans also forced Indian merchants, artisans, and educated classes to flee to <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Asia_5561.html" title="West Asia">West Asia</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ishmaelites</span></h2>
<p>"and I will make him a great nation" — I guess that doesn't mean the same thing to one individual as it does to other people? When Abram is given the name "Abraham", one among those many nations he is to be the father of, is the nation and the princes descended from Ishmael. Is it the word "Ishmaelite" you have a problem with, so that you feel you need to remove it? Or, do you have a problem with the idea that Abraham is said to be the patriarch of Ishmael's descendents? <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a> <a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 01:02, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are a few problems with this assertion:</dd>
<dd>1. If referring to the Hebrew Bible, the historicity after 4000 years and interpretation from several languages, is not accurate by any means. It is solely a matter of faith.</dd>
<dd>2. Many Christians do not believe that Genesis was meant for historical or scientific purposes but instead were an amalgramation of paribles.</dd>
<dd>3. In reality, it comes down to 1 word, "nation" in the entire Bible. Even if you assume that "and I will make him a great nation" has been accurately handed down for 4000 years and if it has been accurately interpreted over many languages, there is still the problem with its meaning. "Nation" even in English could mean many things. It could be literal, rhetorical, or symbolic. This is not historical in any way, shape or form. It is a matter of belief. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 03:39, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

My question concerns whether the sentence was correct as it stood in describing what the Bible says, or whether you made it more accurate by deleting "Ishmaelites". You've settled the issue for me in what you say above - you did not intend to accurately complete the sentence "In the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> Abraham is described as ... " ( being the patriarch through Ishmael of a nation of 12 princes ). It seems you are saying that no one of a scientific bent of mind would want to complete this sentence, by merely reading what the Bible says, and then expressing it here, accurately. Must anyone who would dare venture into the thorny briars of discerning the meaning of a sentence really be so thorough armoured? with 4000 years worth of skepticism? <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a> <a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn"><small>(Talk)</small></a></dd>

<p>Try rereading the talk page (or better yet, the Bible). To quote myself from above: "The Old Testament does indeed describe Ishmael as ancestor of the Ishmaelites, the Bedouin of the deserts east and south of Palestine" and "In the Torah/Old Testament... Abraham is described as a patriarch blessed by God and promised great things, father of the People of Israel through his son Isaac, and of the Ishmaelites, generally identified as the Arabs, through his son Ishmael." I take it no one's arguing the first two clauses, so that leaves "father of the Ishmaelites, generally identified as the Arabs, through his son Ishmael." See Easton's Bible Encyclopedia ("He had twelve sons, who became the founders of so many Arab tribes or colonies, the Ishmaelites"), Smith's Bible Dictionary ("The sons of Ishmael peopled the north and west of the Arabian peninsula, and eventually formed the chief element of the Arab nation, the wandering Bedouin tribes.") and even the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia ("The character of Ishmael and his descendants (Arabian nomads or Bedouins)...")", and Mkmconn: "nor would I have guessed, that mention of the nation that came from Ishmael is missing on purpose, because of somebody's mysterious prejudice". I would quote you, but you have yet to produce an actual argument for why you, unlike the standard Biblical reference works quoted or indeed the ancient Hebrews themselves, believe the Ishmaelites were not the sons of Ishmael. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 00:12, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I addressed much of the issue before, but let me post comments from another talk page that discuss this issue:</p>
<p>Put 'midianites' 'ishmaelites' into Google. Choose one of 7,130 hits. Is Encyclopedia Britanica a good enough source? -&gt; "MIDIANITES (also called ISHMAELITES, Enc. Brit.)" Also, most standard reference works on Islam reject the Arab claim of Abrahamic descent. For example, the prestigious 'Encyclopedia of Islam' traces the Arabs to non-Abrahamic origins (Vol. 1, pp. 543-47). One will also find the 'Dictionary of Islam' questioning the whole idea that the Arabs are descended from Ishmael. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossnixon_c5b8.html" title="User:Rossnixon">RossNixon</a> 11:49, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What you are telling me, if you think through your argument logically, is that the origination (other than this passage) of "Midianites" and "Ishmaelites" and later history, is lost to history. This happens all the time in the Bible (that's why it is 1 volume and not 20, or 100, or 1000). What you are also stating is that there is no point whatsoever in recording that. In fact, based on your statement, it is misleading because of all the misunderstanding and wrongful conclusions that can be reached by including such names. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 12:54, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You said, "I have not begun my argument ... " My response, which I'm sorry I must press is, "are you admitting that you have been reverting the article without presenting a reasonable argument"? I am not going off the deep end, and I do not know what is uncivil about it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arab connection</span></h2>
<p>Heraclius, I think that you are overstating the case to write, "Although the Hebrew Bible contains no reference to the Arabs". Jeremiah 25:24, for example, reads: "all the <b>kings of Arabia</b> and all the <i>kings of the foreign people who live in <b>the desert</b></i>;" 1 Kings 10:15, " besides that from the traveling merchants, from the income of traders, from all the <i>kings of Arabia</i>, and from the governors of the country." I'm not certain, but I believe that this is the masculine form of <i>erev</i> (not Arabah), and these kings are kings of <i>erev</i>: are they not "Arabs"? <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a> <a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 06:09, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't speak for Judaism or Islam, but I note that -Ril- edited to note that this is the belief of the Koran.

<dd>What is your evidence that "Christians generally do not believe in this lineage thing"? When have you offered any proof of such a sweeping generalization? It is practically official Catholic policy to teach "the lineage thing". I know that all of my Christian life I have heard, believed, and have not been offered any urgent arguments against "the lineage thing". I would say that, it is generally traditional for Christians believe it, or at least they are not inclined to so off-handedly reject, "the lineage thing". It is not controversial in my world, as it evidently is in yours.

<p>Hi Blubberbrain, I think the reason Aiden reverted you is because he probably felt you were changing too much of the consensus version, too fast, with nary a word of discussion here first. The way it normally works around here (especially on the very high traffic / controversial articles like this) is discuss first, <i>then</i> change, if you have any big changes... But at any rate, welcome to the talk page, please let's all use the section below to discuss the relative merits of the old and new versions. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 21:47, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, I saw a lot of talk on this discussion page but I did not really see what were actually the disputed points. What part of the article is disputed and why? From this talk page this is not clear. So, that's why I cleaned up a little. But I preserved the info which was on the site.<br />
The article is really a mess and it needs really cleanup. What did I do?<br /></p>
<ol>
<li>removed some content in the introduction to sections (e.g. Ancestry of Abraham)</li>
<li>added the first section about abrahamic religion, added some content of this page to that page</li>
<li>added structure into "Abraham in the Hebrew Bible". It better reads now (not a lot of references to bible verses, but readable)</li>
<li>added info on "Abraham in the New Testament"<br /></li>

<p>Per <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a>, it is neccesary to use only one method of dating notation per article. This means that there shall not be a split usage of BC, BCE, CE, and AD. Only AD/BC or CE/BCE should be used within one article space. When I arrived at this article, it used both BC and BCE. Though BCE was used mainly in the opening paragraphs, BC was used later in the article (this is before my edits). In accordance with the above <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style</a> excerpt I provided, only one is acceptable. Since I cannot single-handedly decide which era notation is to be used, it is customary (see <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>) that <i>both</i> era notations be placed as neutrality until a consensus can be made on one era usage. Now if someone simply reverts my latest edit, this is a violation of the MOS; if someone simply reverts my edits and replaces all the "BC"'s with "BCE", that is again against Wikipedia standards as we need to arrive at consensus prior to a decision. I invite all to discuss which notation shall be used below. — <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyInSane_3df2.html" title="User:CrazyInSane">C<small>RAZY</small></a>`<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazyInSane_e382.html" title="User talk:CrazyInSane">(<small>IN</small>)</a>`<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CrazyInSane_cf68.html" title="Special:Contributions/CrazyInSane">S<small>ANE</small></a> 18:32, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

This predates most of the edits under discussion. Therefore, until such time as we all agree to a consensus as to what scheme to use, your own request should prevnt you from reverting dates in that section from BCE to BC. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 19:17, 28 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Due to the fact that I have supporting evidence that both "<i>BCE</i>" and "<i>BC</i>" were used on this article without any complaints from Wikipedians posted here on the Talk page, it is obvious there was never a consensus toward either <i><a href="../../../a/n/n/Anno_Domini_11cb.html" title="Anno Domini">anno Domini</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../c/e/_/CE_7a86.html" title="CE">CE</a></i>. Since both <b>cannot</b> be used sparingly within one article, it is much more appropriate to neutralize the article by including both notations throughout (i.e. - <a href="../../../4/0/0/400_BC_0f79.html" title="400 BC">400 BC/BCE</a>), rather than to revert all notations to BCE or all notations to BC. — <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyInSane_3df2.html" title="User:CrazyInSane">C<small>RAZY</small></a>`<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazyInSane_e382.html" title="User talk:CrazyInSane">(<small>IN</small>)</a>`<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CrazyInSane_cf68.html" title="Special:Contributions/CrazyInSane">S<small>ANE</small></a> 19:25, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then why in your last revert did you take OUT two BCE's in favor of BC? Is that impartial? If anything, the date schema should be left as the individual authors have added until we decide, but even if we agree to temporarily use this dual nomenclature, your removal of the dual in favor of the singular BC does not bespeak impartiality. I guess you reverted without checking, but it would help all of us handle this in a reasonable and cordial manner if we took the extra moment to check. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 19:35, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, my apologies for that I missed those two notations. They were originally BC, so I must have missed them. I see you've corrected this. — <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyInSane_3df2.html" title="User:CrazyInSane">C<small>RAZY</small></a>`<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazyInSane_e382.html" title="User talk:CrazyInSane">(<small>IN</small>)</a>`<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CrazyInSane_cf68.html" title="Special:Contributions/CrazyInSane">S<small>ANE</small></a> 19:39, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OK. Now, is there any overriding reason to choose one over the other for the sake of this article? My thought is that since <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a> is more closely identified with <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> than <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, the BCE nomenclature would be preferred as it is less directly Christian in connotation. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 20:37, 28 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe that Abraham is no more connotated with Judaism than with Christianity, due to the fact that both religions are <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrahamic_religions.html" title="Abrahamic religions">Abrahamic</a>. Abraham's actions are seen as very important in Christianity as a foreshadowing of God's gift of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> as the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_God_bcd3.html" title="Son of God">Son of God</a>. And even though Abraham may have been a Jew, so was Jesus, and he is of course connotated with Christianity; thus this should not be a deciding factor. Therefore, IMO, Christianity and Judaism are equally connotated with Abraham, and thus I would vote that we continue to use the <i>dual notations</i> of BC/BCE. If it came down to a decision, however, I would definitely pick solely "BC", due to the fact that I see "BCE/CE" as a narrow-minded attempt at political correctness by simply using the <i>anno Domini</i> calendar without respecting it's relation to Jesus Christ. It's like "the pot calling the kettle black". In my opinion, until there is a "World Calendar" based on the beginning of time, or similar, invented, we should stick with the historically used terms for as long as we're going to be using the Gregorian calendar. Let's not forget, it isn't only Westerners reading Wikipedia, and there is no "political correctness movement" outside the Western world, thus "BCE/CE" is certainly not accepted nor understood worldwide as terminology for the Gregorian calendar. — <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyInSane_3df2.html" title="User:CrazyInSane">C<small>RAZY</small></a>`<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazyInSane_e382.html" title="User talk:CrazyInSane">(<small>IN</small>)</a>`<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CrazyInSane_cf68.html" title="Special:Contributions/CrazyInSane">S<small>ANE</small></a> 22:02, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a> allows for both usages, as you pointed out earlier, therefore I disagree with your categorization of "BCE" as "narrow-minded." Further, I would think that most impartial people would tend to categorize <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a> as <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> and not <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> was born a Jew, true, but was the progenitor of a new religion; and as such would be much less associated with <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> than <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. Does the fact that Jesus is considered on of the pre-eminent prohpets in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> mean that we should be using the Islamic calendar? I do not believe so. Jesus, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul.html" title="Paul">Paul</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter.html" title="Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas.html" title="Judas">Judas</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary.html" title="Mary">Mary</a> were all Jews at one point, but no one would consider their Jewishness to overwhelm their Christianity. Conversely, albeit Abraham, <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac.html" title="Isaac">Isaac</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob.html" title="Jacob">Jacob</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judah.html" title="Judah">Judah</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph.html" title="Joseph">Joseph</a>, etc. are very important characters in Christianity, they are much more closely associated with Judaism. Now as for your point about BC/BCE. From your perspective, it seems a "narrow-minded attempt at political correctness." From another perspective, it is a way of using the Gregorian calendar without making direct reference to other religions. If you agree that it refers to the same arbitrary 0-point, then what does it matter to you that the term used is "Common Era" unless you have a specific religious overtone in mind that you feel the need to reference Jesus? I do not understand. Thank you. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 23:21, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I explained this above, "<i>...we should stick with the <b>historically used</b> (accepted) terms for as long as we're going to be using the Gregorian calendar.

<li>No, BCE/CE are more Western-centric. To say that AD/BC are more Western-centric is POV because you are essentially saying that all Westerners are Christian (i.e. - Christian-centric = Western-centric).

Even many Americans, Canadians, and other Westerners do not know of the terms. It is Western-centric to assume that everyone in the world is supposed to understand the politically-correct savvy terms that Americans made in order to cover-up the original history of things, as they often do (see <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_holiday.html" title="Spring holiday">Spring holiday</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secularization_of_Christmas_171d.html" title="Secularization of Christmas">Secularization of Christmas</a>).

<li>BCE/CE only surfaced in American/Western texts as recently as the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, let alone other countries. Saying that BC/AD are as unknown as BCE/CE is patently ridiculous. BC/AD have been around for over a thousand years (since <a href="../../../5/2/5/525.html" title="525">525 AD</a>), and are used constantly in historic texts. The fact that there is often subscripts stating "BCE is an alternative for BC" on even <b>American</b> texts, proves it is widely an unknown <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> even in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_world.html" title="Western world">Western world</a>. If you compare a term that was around since <a href="../../../5/2/5/525.html" title="525">525</a> to a term around since the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> (with usage limited to Jewish texts until ca. 1980), you can expect the former is more popular and known worldwide.

<li>Interesting, then, that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>'s <i>own article</i> on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Era_9a2d.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a> dates it as far back as <b>1716</b>, and the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia uses it synonomously with Christian Era and Vulgar Era, so the 1990's claim is weak at best, and wrong at worst. Now 1716 is much after 532, I agree, but almost 300 years of use is somewhat more considerable, and allows as much penetration into modern parlance as the corresponding term. Even 100 years of constant use is more than enough to make the terms nearly (if not absolutely) identically distributed in the public psyche. That particular article also references the USNO and others who use it, and the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_Channel_2ce1.html" title="History Channel">History Channel</a>'s usage of using it in non-Christian topics such as <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, which goes back to my original point that <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a> is much more closely identified with <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> than <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, by around 1800 years, and should use the BCE/CE nomencalture. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 01:43, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To make clear, I noted that BCE/CE terms have been around since the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> (1800s), so 1716 is not much off, sorry, I wasn't precise. As for the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, this is the approximate decade that it became <i>well-known</i> in the United States at least. As for texts, do you have any other than the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia? Public texts such as educational and historic texts and schoolbooks haven't been presented with the terms until circa the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> / <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a>. There is controversy (see External links at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_era.html" title="Common era">Common era</a>) <i>now</i>, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, about the usage of BCE/CE in public American texts. Anyhow, my point is that exposure has been limited as of present, and especially in non-Western countries. I stand with my opinion that Abraham is as closely related with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> as with <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>. Just because he was first associated with Judaism with an 1,800 year difference in no way asserts anything. Jesus was first associated with Judaism as well, and now he is associated with Christianity, but as well with Judaism and Islam. Since Abraham is responsible for the formation of all the aforementioned "Abrahamic" religions, I don't think he is exclusively associated with Judaism. In any case, the point here is to decide on an era notation usage. Since you and I disagree, the vote is currently tied and there is no consensus. The "BC/BCE" should remain until other users herein comment and we reach consensus. — <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyInSane_3df2.html" title="User:CrazyInSane">C<small>RAZY</small></a>`<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazyInSane_e382.html" title="User talk:CrazyInSane">(<small>IN</small>)</a>`<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CrazyInSane_cf68.html" title="Special:Contributions/CrazyInSane">S<small>ANE</small></a> 01:58, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Someone changed to BC earlier in the article, and then it was changed back to BCE, then someone changed to BC stating "revert back to BC" so I assumed it was originally BC, without checking for sure—which was my mistake but I realized this. This article is different. BC and BCE were <b>both</b> used sporatically throughout the article and we <b>need</b> to use only one notation. Since there is no current consensus we need to make a consensus, and for now we should use both notations on all years (i.e. BC/BCE).

<dd>Many of us calculate his birth having nothing to do with Jesus, and our sources pre-date Jesus's birth by a few centuries.

<p>Quote: While Sarah, his wife, lived, he never married any other woman. Abraham had an illegitimate son by Hagar. But that was an adulterous sin...... I think we can recognize extenuating circumstances. Sarah was barren. For a wife in ancient times to go childless was felt to be a disgrace. It was Sarah, Abraham's own wife, who brought to Abraham her servant handmaid, asking him to produce a child for Sarah by this servant woman.

<dd>It seems possible Abraham could of divorced Sarai during this, though the Bible doesn't mention it.

<p>No, Abram (God renamed him Abraham in Chapter 17) and Sarai were still marrried. It was a common practice at the time: if a rich man's wife was barren, then with his wife's permission, he could have sex with a lower class woman of the household (a servant or slave, ie Hagar) to produce an heir, which would then be adopted and raised by the high-class couple (ie, Abram and Sarai). (According to the custom, Hagar would have been a concubine). My NKJV Study Bible actually compares this to the modern practice of employing a <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrogate_mother.html" title="Surrogate mother">surrogate mother</a> (although, of course, no sex is involved).</p>
<p>Instead, Abram actually fell in love with Hagar. This, of course, made Sarai jealous. Sarai began to "deal harshly" with Hagar (Genesis 16:6), and Hagar and Ishmael fled from Sarai. However, the Angel of the LORD bid Hagar to return to Sarai and Abram (Genesis 16:9). But Sarah (her name changed, too) sent Hagar and Ishmael away again after Isaac was born (Genesis 21:9-20)</p>
<p>So much for Genesis. I wonder what the Qu'ran has to say?</p>

<dd>If you'll look at verses 16:3-5, you'll see a bit of a different story than you painted. First, the reason Sarai was upset was that her maidservant Hagar no longer showed her respect, because she had concieved while Sarai had not. Also, In 16:3, it clearly says that Abram takes Hagar as a wife (probably as a concubine, but that is way different than having sex with random servant women).

<dd>Old Testament polygamy seems to give fits to many Christians. Of course, being a Latter-day Saint, it does not offer concern. Many of the greatest prophets of the OT were polygamists. I have read many of the quotes similar to the one mentioned above, but they seem to do backflips trying to prove that it either did not really happen as the Bible says or that it was sin and God just looked the other way. My impression is the polygamy was not a universal "right" or "law" and it was not engaged in by the whim of the every man. When directed or approved by God it was acceptable, but for the majority of people it was and is a sin.</dd>
<dd>This would not be a unique situation. Only the Levites were allowed to serve in the temple while all others were forbidden. For others to attempt to serve was blasphemy against the law of God. In addition, there was only a single covenant people in the old world; all others were "secondary" in the eyes of God. (That is never a comfortable concept to contemplate, but seems to be true of the OT.) I think you will find other examples where God identifies sin for one is not sin for another or where favor is found in one and not others. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 06:38, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Excellent scripture. We are getting a little further afield. Question, based upon Deut. 21:15 Ishmael should have received the birth right because he was the first born. In reality, Issac received it and became one of the forefathers of the covenant people. Ishmael still received a blessing, he bacame the father of a great nation.</dd>
<dd>Back to the question at hand, if polygamy were such a grevious sin I suspect the Lord would have rebuked Abram. Instead of rebuking him, he greatly blessed him and his offspring from both wives. Maybe polygamy was not a sin, maybe it was still a sin, but a greater law was being observed by Abram, Sarai, and Hagar. What is absolutely certain is that Abraham was not punished for having two wives nor were his progeny. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:37, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems to me that there are a few archaeological remains that can be correlated with Abraham, i.e. cities with names that seem to correspond not only to Haran, but other relatives of Abraham, such as Terah, Serug and Nahor. Hammurabi should also be mentioned in this context, although some synchronize Abraham with the time of Sargon instead. Plausible archaeological parallels have been suggested for the kings mentioned in Gen. 14:1, in the time of Hammurabi. (The Amraphel of the Bible is thought by some to be none other than Hammurabi himself.) Thus, while there is no <i>compelling</i> archaeological evidence that Abraham ever existed, there are nonetheless at least some plausible archaeological parallels. Also interesting is the fact that some other nations retain memories of him which seem to be independent of the biblical materials. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaThinker_2e1b.html" title="User:ThaThinker">ThaThinker</a> 08:30, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also your motivations for manipulating the sources in order to create a "new" pov that Arabs are somehow not descended from Abraham, seems influenced by recent politics or perhaps some other agency.

<dd>There were three places named Havilah in the OT if I recall, one in Africa, one in Arabia and one in Persia. I'd argue that others are trying to manipulate the sources because of modern politics to claim that modern Arabs are descended from Ishmael when that is not what Jewish or Islamic sources really say. Already in the 1895 Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature by McClintock and Strong one finds a refutation of the claim of Arab descent from Ishmael. Off hand I remember reading up on this in the Encyclopedia Judaica and it also made it pretty clear that it was a late tradition that associated Ishmael with the Arabacized Arabs. I don't know any reliable sources that ever claimed Ishmael was the ancestor of all Arabs - as the explanation I tried to include that you reverted said: Arabians in Jewish works referred to the Nabateans - Josephus clearly indicates he is talking about the people of Nabatene when he says Arabians. Its also pretty standard knowledge that the Nabateans were not the ancestors of the Arab nation that arose with Islam.</dd>

<li>- This has already been done; I accept that Jubilees is older than Josephus (in fact I would say far, far older than Hellenistic!)</li>
<li>- This can certainly be done if you can dig up the specific Greek word so we can show it, transliterate it, and explain it...</li>
<li>- This is where we disagree. I am not convinced that there is such a gulf or chasm as you are trying to assert between the Arabs in "Jewish sources" and "modern Arabs". This is where we would need good sources to back up this point if it were valid. Even if the Nabateans were "northern" Arabs it does not follow that they had a completely separate ancestry from the more "southern" Arabs. People do intermingle with their neighbours and create new hybrid stocks quite often in history, you know. From an epigraphic standpoint, there is scarcely any doubt that Arabic letters came via Nabatean.</li>

<dd>Arabic letters certainly evolved from Nabatean. Some say&#160;;) that the Nabateans may have had an important role in the development of the Arabic language. A point of debate one finds in articles about the Nabateans is whether the traditional Jewish view is correct (that they derived from the Ishmaelites) or whether they were really Aramaeans who had south or even whether they were "true Arabs" who had migrated north. But whatever the case, the Nabateans assimilated into non-Arab peoples before the rise of the modern Arab nation. You have assimilation with Jews during the Hashmonean period and subsequently assimilation into the general Byzantine population of the middle east as their cities were abandoned. The modern Arabs move north from Arabia just after this. The Nabateans actually aren't "northen Arabs" in the sense the term is typically used when discussing the early Arabs - "northern Arab" typically means Adnanis from the Mecca region as opposed to "southern Arab" Qahtanis from Yemen, the Nabateans lived even further north than the "northern Arabs". This where the Jewish and Islamic claims differ - Jewish claims are from second Temple period and have Nabateans as the descendants of the Ishmaelites mixed with other tribes, Islamic claims are from the dawn of Islam and have the Adnanis of the Mecca region descended from Ishmael, a different people to the Nabateans. In addition the Islamic claims are weak by the very admissions of Arab historians who discuss the matter while the Jewish claims have a good chance of being partially correct at least considering the Nabateans historically took over the former Ishmaelite regions and would very likely have some ancestry from the original inhabitants.

<li>- I agree with this point, in fact I had added a mention of Joktan etc. myself, and wanted to keep it in there. Perhaps we are not saying things that are so different. The Arab tribes certainly miscegenated Semites in the north including those represented by Ishmael and Keturah, and non-Semites in the south represented by Cush's children Sheba, Saba etc. We should not be out trying to deny one or the other of these elements in their ethnogenesis. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 13:06, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
