	    <p><b>Abraham Van Buren</b> (<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_27.html" title="November 27">November 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a> – <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">March 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>) was the eldest son of the eighth <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Van_Buren_a34f.html" title="Martin Van Buren">Martin Van Buren</a> (Republican-Democrat) and his wife, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannah_Hoes_Van_Buren_65a1.html" title="Hannah Hoes Van Buren">Hannah Hoes Van Buren</a>. Born in <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinderhook%2C_New_York_40ba.html" title="Kinderhook, New York">Kinderhook, New York</a>, Abraham was named in honor of his paternal grandfather who was an officer in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Army_3e70.html" title="Continental Army">Continental Army</a> during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">Revolutionary War</a>.</p>
<p>Abraham, a career military man, graduated from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Military_Academy_177e.html" title="United States Military Academy">United States Military Academy</a> at <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Point%2C_New_York_847c.html" title="West Point, New York">West Point, New York</a> in 1827. He was appointed to West Point when he was 14 years of age. Some of his classmates included: 1. <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Davis_8885.html" title="Jefferson Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>, hero of the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican-American_War_f1a1.html" title="Mexican-American War">Mexican-American War</a> with his <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> infantry troops and eventual President of The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate States of America</a>, 2. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_E._Lee_733b.html" title="Robert E.

Lee</a>, eventual Commandant of <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Point_58bc.html" title="West Point">West Point</a> and General and Commander of The <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_Northern_Virginia_5129.html" title="Army of Northern Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a> and General and overall Commander of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate States of America</a> Army, and 3. <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_E._Johnston_d8d6.html" title="Joseph E. Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a>, eventual General and Commander of The <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_Tennessee_dc07.html" title="Army of Tennessee">Army of Tennessee</a> of the Confederate States of America Army.</p>
<p>Abraham took five years to advance from second lieutenant to first lieutenant in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a>. It took him four more years to obtain the rank of captain. According to Wead, it was “a slow promotion rate—particularly given his father's political positions of the time” (p. 53). He served two years on the American frontier and he also served under General <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winfield_Scott_03d8.html" title="Winfield Scott">Winfield Scott</a> in the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Seminole_War_adaf.html" title="Seminole War">Seminole War</a> in 1836. During this time, Abraham was made captain of the United States Army's First Dragoons; however, he resigned his commission to become his father's private secretary in the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a> starting in 1837.</p>
<p>In 1838, <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolley_Madison_09ab.html" title="Dolley Madison">Dolley Madison</a>, wife of former <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_James_Madison_fd36.html" title="President James Madison">President James Madison</a>, enticed Abraham to meet her cousin, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelica_Van_Buren_d1c4.html" title="Angelica Van Buren">Angelica Singleton</a>, at a <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a> dinner hosted by his father. Miss Singleton was a daughter of a wealthy <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Carolina_aeeb.html" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a> planter. Angelica was a refined lady who had been schooled in the fine arts at Madame Grelaud's Seminary in Philadelphia. Abraham fell in love with Angelica and the two were married at Colonel Richard Singleton's <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumter%2C_South_Carolina_615b.html" title="Sumter, South Carolina">Sumter, South Carolina</a> plantation named “Home Place.” The President was unable to attend the couple's wedding; however, he was delighted with the match. The two honeymooned in London. Upon returning to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, Angelica assumed the duties of “White House Hostess” because Hannah, Martin Van Buren's wife, had died after only twelve years of marriage in 1817. Angelica's and Abraham's first born, Rebecca, was born in March 1840; however, she died in the White House only months later. The couple later had three more children.</p>
<p>Abraham's career in the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a> ended when his father was defeated by <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whig_Party_%28United_States%29_806f.html" title="Whig Party (United States)">Whig</a> candidate <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Henry_Harrison_e87c.html" title="William Henry Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> in the presidential campaign of 1840. Abraham left Washington with Angelica in March of 1841 after Harrison's inauguration. Their first visit was with Angelica's family in Sumter, where Angelica gave birth to their first son, Singleton.</p>
<p>In 1846, at the outbreak of the war with <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, Abraham was reappointed to the military as a member of the regular army with the rank of major and position as paymaster. In spite of his absence while serving in the military, Abraham still enjoyed close relations with his father. When the former president renovated and expanded his estate <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindenwald.html" title="Lindenwald">Lindenwald</a>, located in Kinderhook, New York, during the years of 1849 to 1851, a corner room on the second floor opposite the master bedroom in the original home that was built in 1797 was reserved for Abraham and Angelica. The couple would enjoy extended stays with the former president along with Abraham's surviving brothers John, Martin, Jr., and Smith Thompson. Abraham and his family continued to winter at their plantation in South Carolina.</p>
<p>Abraham served for eighteen years in the First Dragoons as an infantry officer eventually reaching the rank of major. In August 1847, he was made a brevet lieutenant colonel during the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican-American_War_f1a1.html" title="Mexican-American War">Mexican-American War</a> for gallant and meritorious conduct during the battles of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contreras.html" title="Contreras">Contreras</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churubusco.html" title="Churubusco">Churubusco</a> (Heitman, p. 980). Abraham served in the war despite the fact that his father was opposed to the conflict. During the war, Abraham also served as an aide to General <a href="../../../z/a/c/Zachery_Taylor_1de9.html" title="Zachery Taylor">Zachery Taylor</a>. In 1848, Abraham's family moved to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. In 1854, Abraham retired from the military.</p>
<p>After his military career ended, Abraham spent his remaining years editing and publishing his father's presidential papers. Abraham served as the leading apologist for his father's oft-criticized United States Presidential legacy before his death. He is buried alongside his wife Angelica in <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodlawn_Cemetery_203a.html" title="Woodlawn Cemetery">Woodlawn Cemetery</a> in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronx%2C_New_York_faab.html" title="Bronx, New York">Bronx, New York</a>.</p>
