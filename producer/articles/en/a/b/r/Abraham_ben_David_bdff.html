<p>The center of the <i>Ravad's</i> activity was Posquières, after which place he is often called. It is difficult to determine when he moved to Posquières; but about 1165 <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_of_Tudela_f906.html" title="Benjamin of Tudela">Benjamin of Tudela</a>, at the outset of his travels, called upon him there. He spoke of the <i>Ravad's</i> wealth and benevolence. Not only did he erect and keep in repair a large school-building, but he cared for the material welfare of the poor students as well. It was his great wealth which brought him into peril of his life; for, in order to obtain some of it, Elzéar, the lord of Posquières, had him cast into prison, where, like Rabbi <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meir_of_Rothenburg_38cb.html" title="Meir of Rothenburg">Meir of Rothenburg</a>, he might have perished, had not Count Roger II of Carcassonne, who was friendly to the Jews, intervened, and by virtue of his sovereignty banished the lord of Posquières to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carcassonne.html" title="Carcassonne">Carcassonne</a>. Thereupon the <i>Ravad</i> returned to Posquières, where he remained until his death.</p>
<p>Among the many learned Talmudists who were his disciples in Posquières were <i>Rabbeinu</i> Isaac ha-Kohen of <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narbonne.html" title="Narbonne">Narbonne</a>, the first commentator upon the <a href="../../../y/e/r/Yerushalmi.html" title="Yerushalmi">Yerushalmi</a>; <i>Rabbeinu</i> Abraham ben Nathan of Lunel, author of <i>"Ha-Manhig"</i>; <i>Rabbeinu</i> Meir ben Isaac of Carcassonne, author of the <i>"Sefer ha-'Ezer"</i>; and <i>Rabbeinu</i> <a href="../../../a/s/h/Asher_ben_Meshullam_f614.html" title="Asher ben Meshullam">Asher ben Meshullam</a> of Lunel, author of several rabbinical works. The <i>Ravad'</i>s influence on <i>Rabbeinu</i> Jonathan of Lunel also is evident, though the latter did not attend his lectures.</p>
<p><a name="Literary_Works" id="Literary_Works"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_ben_David_bdff.html" title="Edit section: Literary Works">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Literary Works</span></h2>
<p>The <i>Ravad</i> was a prolific author. He not only wrote answers to hundreds of learned questions—which <a href="../../../r/e/s/Responsa.html" title="Responsa">responsa</a> are still partially preserved in the collections <i>"Temim De'im"</i>, <i>"Orot Hayyim"</i>, and <i>"Shibbale ha-Leket"</i> — but he also wrote a commentary on the whole Talmud and compiled several compendiums of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">rabbinical law</a>.</p>
<p>Most of his works are lost; but those which have been preserved, such as the <i>"Sefer Ba'ale ha-Nefesh"</i> (The Book of the Con-scientious), a treatise on the laws relating to women, published in 1602, and his commentary on <i>Torath Kohanim</i>, published in 1862 at Vienna.</p>
<p>The title of <i>"Baal Hasagot"</i> (Critic), given him frequently by the rabbis, shows that they viewed the direction in which his ability lay. Indeed, critical annotations display his powers at their best, and justify his being ranked with the <i><a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Alfasi_3c2d.html" title="Isaac Alfasi">Rif</a></i>, <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashi.html" title="Rashi">Rashi</a>, and the <i><a href="../../../m/a/i/Maimonides.html" title="Maimonides">Rambam</a></i> (Maimonides).</p>
<p>The <i>Ravad</i> did much for the study of the Talmud. Without accusing the <i>Rambam</i> of intending to supplant the study of the Talmud itself by means of his compendium, the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishneh_Torah_1cf7.html" title="Mishneh Torah">Mishneh Torah</a>, it is nevertheless a fact that if the <i>Rif</i> and <i>Rambam</i> had not encountered such keen opposition, rabbinical Judaism may have degenerated into an exclusive study of the legal code, which would have been fatal to any original intellectual development in a considerable portion of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>This danger was not so imminent for those Jews who lived in lands where Arabian culture ruled; for there the study of the Hebrew language and poetry, and especially of the sciences and philosophy, would always have afforded a wide field for intellectual development. It was, therefore, sufficient that the leading Jewish rabbis domiciled in Moorish countries should devote much attention to furnishing a clew to the labyrinth of the Talmud, intricate and perplexing as the latter had become by the addition of the copious post-Talmudic literature of law and custom. Some sort of guide had become imperatively necessary for the practical application of this voluminous and intricate material. But in Christian countries like France and Germany, where the largest communities of Jews existed, throughout the Middle Ages there was no such outlet for Jewish intellectuality as the culture of literature or of the sciences which existed in Moorish Spain. Their own religious law was the only field open to the intellects of the Jews of Germany and northern France.</p>

<p>In his commentary, Rashi furnished a well-paved road to the Talmud; while the Ravad, by his acute criticism, pointed out the way intelligently and with discrimination. This critical tendency is characteristic of all the writings of the <i>Ravad</i>. Thus, in his commentary upon <i>Torath Kohanim</i> (pp. 41a, 71b), we find the caustic observation that many obscure passages in rabbinical literature owe their obscurity to the fact that occasional explanatory or marginal notes not tending to elucidate the text have been incorporated.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_ben_David_bdff.html" title="Edit section: Attitude as a Critic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Attitude as a Critic</span></h2>
<p>The strength of <i>Ravad</i>, may be shown by his criticisms of the works of various authors. The tone which he employs is also characteristic of his attitude toward the persons under criticism. He treats the <i>Rif</i> with the utmost respect, almost with humility, and refers to him as "the sun by whose brilliant rays our eyes are dazzled" (<i>"Temim De'im"</i>, p. 22a). His language toward <i>Rabbeinu</i> <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zerachiah_ha-Levi_of_Girona_b8e8.html" title="Zerachiah ha-Levi of Girona">Zerachiah ha-Levi</a>, the <i>Baal Hamoer</i> is harsh, almost hostile. Though only eighteen years old, this scholar possessed the courage and the ability to write a sharp criticism upon the <i>Rif</i>, and the <i>Ravad</i> refers to him as an immature youth who has the audacity to criticize his teacher. However, in fairness it must be stated that <i>Rabbeinu</i> Zerachiah had himself provoked this treatment by sharply criticizing the <i>Ravad</i>, and by incorporating into his own work some of the <i>Ravad's</i> interpretations without acknowledgment to the author (compare Gross, l.c., 545, and Reifmann, "Toledot," p. 54).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_ben_David_bdff.html" title="Edit section: Maimonides (Rambam) and Ravad">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Maimonides (Rambam) and Ravad</span></h2>
<p>The <i>Ravad's</i> criticism of the <i>Rambam's</i> code of Jewish law, the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishneh_Torah_1cf7.html" title="Mishneh Torah">Mishneh Torah</a>, is very harsh. This was not due to personal feeling, but to radical differences of view in matters of faith between the two greatest Talmudists of the twelfth century.</p>
<p>The <i>Rambam's</i> aim was to bring order into the vast labyrinth of the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakah.html" title="Halakah">Halakah</a> by presenting final results in a definite, systematic, and methodical manner. But in the opinion of the <i>Ravad</i> this very aim was the principal defect of the work. A legal code which did not state the sources and authorities from which its decisions were derived, and offered no proofs of the correctness of its statements, was, in the opinion of the <i>Ravad</i>, entirely unreliable, even in the practical religious life, for which purpose the <i>Rambam</i> designed it.</p>
<p>Such a code, he considered, could be justified only if written by a man claiming infallibility - by one who could demand that his assertions be accepted without question. If it had been the intention of the <i>Rambam</i> to stem the further development of the study of the Talmud by reducing it to the form of a code, the <i>Ravad</i> felt it his duty to oppose such an attempt, as contrary to the free spirit of rabbinical Judaism, which refuses to surrender blindly to authority.</p>
<p><a name="Judaism_a_Religion_of_Deed.2C_not_of_Dogma" id="Judaism_a_Religion_of_Deed.2C_not_of_Dogma"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_ben_David_bdff.html" title="Edit section: Judaism a Religion of Deed, not of Dogma">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Judaism a Religion of Deed, not of Dogma</span></h2>
<p>The <i>Ravad</i> was thus an opponent to the codification of the Halakah; but he was even more strongly opposed to the construction of a system of dogmas in Judaism, particularly according to the method followed by the <i>Rambam</i> (Maimonides), who often set up the concepts of the Aristotelian philosophy as Jewish theology. The <i>Rambam</i>, for instance, in accordance with his philosophical conviction and in the true spirit of Judaism, declares the incorporeality of God to be a dogma of Judaism, or, as he formulates it, "whosoever conceives God to be a corporeal being is an apostate" (<i>"Yad ha-Chazakah</i>, <i>Teshuvah</i>," iii. 7).</p>
<p>In the circles with which the <i>Ravad</i> was connected, a certain mystical anthropomorphistic conception of the Deity was usual; and therefore it was but natural that a statement which practically declared his best friends apostates should arouse his resentment. He, therefore, appended to the <i>Rambam's</i> formula this brief but emphatic criticism: "Why does he call such persons apostates? Men better and worthier than he have held this view, for which they believe they have found authority in the Scriptures and in a confusing view of the Haggadah."</p>
<p>The phrase concerning the Haggadah shows that the <i>Ravad</i> is himself far from advocating the anthropomorphistic view. His opposition to the <i>Rambam's</i> statement of the doctrine of the incorporeality of God is only directed against its being raised into a dogma. Judaism is to the <i>Ravad</i> a religion of deed, and not one of dogmas. His attitude toward the teachings of the <i>Rambam</i> in regard to the future life and the eternity of the world is in harmony with this point of view. According to him the opinion of the <i>Rambam</i> on this question was as distinctly heretical as the corporeality of God from the standpoint of the <i>Rambam</i>; yet he has no word of vituperation for its author, but merely contents himself with recording his difference of opinion (l.c. viii. 2, 8). Thus, the ultra-conservative Talmudist was broader-minded and more tolerant than the greatest of the medieval Jewish philosophers (compare Smolensky, "'Am 'Olam," chap. 13).</p>
<p>The <i>Ravad</i> is particularly severe on the attempts of the <i>Rambam</i> to smuggle in his philosophic views under cover of Talmudic passages. To cite one example <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28paranormal%29.html" title="Magic (paranormal)">sorcery</a>, according to both Biblical and rabbinical law, is, under certain conditions, an offense punishable with death. The opinions in the Talmud on the various acts coming under the category of sorcery differ widely, owing, no doubt, to the fact that it was not practicable to look upon every superstitious practise, from which Talmudic Judaism itself was not entirely free, as a heinous offense. The <i>Rambam</i>, who, from the point of view of his philosophy, looks upon sorcery, astrology, augury, and the like as pure absurdities, decides that even the innocent actions which Scripture narrates of Eliezer (Gen. xxiv 14), and of Jonathan (I Sam. xiv. 8-10) are to be considered as falling under the ban.</p>
<p>Here the <i>Ravad</i> is not content with merely correcting the statement of the <i>Rambam</i>, but he declares that, in his opinion, the <i>Rambam</i> deserves the ban for the calumnious views he expresses concerning these Biblical personages (Yad. 'Akum, xi. 4). This suffices to explain the principle that actuated the <i>Ravad</i> in his intense opposition to the <i>Rambam</i>, and particularly to his <i>"Yad ha-Chazakah"</i>, which the <i>Ravad</i> himself designates as a great achievement (<i><a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilayim.html" title="Kilayim">Kilayim</a></i>, vi. 2).</p>
<p>Many <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalists</a> view the <i>Ravad</i> as one of the fathers of their system, and this is true to the extent that he was inclined to mysticism, which led him to follow an ascetic mode of life and gained for him the title of "the pious." He frequently spoke of "the holy spirit (or <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah.html" title="Elijah">Elijah</a>) disclosing to him God's secrets in his studies" (see his note to <i>"Yad ha-Chazakah"</i>, <i>Lulav</i>, viii. 5; <i>Beth ha-Bechirah</i>, vi. 11), great mysteries known only to the initiated (<i>"Yesode ha-Torah"</i>, i. 10).</p>
<p>The <i>Ravad</i> was not an enemy to secular science, as many deem him. His works show that he was a close student of Hebrew philology; and the fact that he encouraged the translation of <i>Rabbeinu</i> <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahya_ibn_Paquda_abbc.html" title="Bahya ibn Paquda">Bahya ibn Paquda</a>'s <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chovot_ha-Levavot_97e3.html" title="Chovot ha-Levavot">Chovot ha-Levavot</a> shows that he was not hostile to philosophy. This philosophic work argues strongly against the anthropomorphistic conception of the Deity; and the favor with which the <i>Ravad</i> looked upon it is sufficient ground on which to acquit him of the charge of having held anthropomorphistic views.</p>
<p>Some of his works show acquaintance with <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>; for instance, his remark on <i>"Hilchoth Teshuvah"</i>, v., end, is a literal quotation from Honein ben Isaac's "Musre ha-Philosophim," pp. 11, 12—or Loewenthal, p. 39, below—which is extant only in Al-Charizi's translation.</p>
