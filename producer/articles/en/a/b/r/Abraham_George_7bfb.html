<p>George was born and brought up in the seaside town of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivandrum.html" title="Trivandrum">Trivandrum</a> in the coastal state of <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a>, at the southwestern tip of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. He is the second son of Mathew and Aleyamma George, one of four children. As a young boy George was outgoing, and excelled in sports and other extracurricular activities. Perhaps not the model student, he learned his most vital lessons from the everyday experiences of life.</p>

Dr. George during the army days</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As a young man, George was attracted by the discipline and glamour of the military. At fourteen he was admitted to the highly selective and prestigious <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Defence_Academy_42a6.html" title="National Defence Academy">National Defence Academy</a> in <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khadakwasla.html" title="Khadakwasla">Khadakwasla</a>. He subsequently went on to graduate as a Second-Lieutenant in a medium artillery regiment of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Army_4554.html" title="Indian Army">Indian Army</a>. George's first posting in 1966 was to the North-East Frontier that borders <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, following the Chinese invasion of 1962. He was the first military officer to take medium artillery guns to an altitude of over 14,000 ft. above sea level at the Sela pass on the north-east frontier of India with China. It was a key point, a position India needed to defend if it was going to successfully ward off any <a href="../../../f/u/t/Future.html" title="Future">future</a> aggressions by China into its territory.</p>
<p>The assignment at Sela ended abruptly after only ten months, when George was injured in a <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamite.html" title="Dynamite">dynamite</a> explosion. Upon his return from convalescence, he was assigned to the Indo-Pak border where he served for nearly two more years and rose to the rank of Captain. He found both field assignments rewarding experiences that taught him lifelong lessons. Through his years in the army, he learned much about loyalty, leadership, teamwork and discipline. It taught him about his responsibility to others and about the needs of soldiers under his command. "There is, I suppose, some stage in each one’s life that has a greater impact on his future than all others. For me, it was these army experiences that helped shape much of my outlook on life."<sup id="_ref-India_Untouched_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-India_Untouched" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>During this time, George also realized that while he admired the dedication and values with which the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">military</a> functioned, it was not a lifetime career he wished to pursue. He felt there were other opportunities, possibilities for a future where he could apply what he had learned from the army.</p>
<p>In the third year of George's service, he suffered a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearing.html" title="Hearing">hearing</a> disability that would plaque him for the rest of his life. At the time, <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physician.html" title="Physician">doctors</a> in India were not trained to tackle his medical condition; it required specialized <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgery</a>. By this point, his mother was already in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, teaching physics and working for <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> as a research scientist. His mother's position afforded him the opportunity to come to America; he could have his surgery done there and start a new life. After considerable effort, he managed to persuade the Indian Army command to give him a medical discharge, and left for the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_7516.html" title="US">US</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_George_7bfb.html" title="Edit section: A New Life in America">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A New Life in America</span></h2>
<p>The transition from India to America was a startling, nearly overwhelming for George. He joined his mother in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>, during the heyday of the <a href="../../../s/e/g/Segregationist.html" title="Segregationist">segregationist</a> governor, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Wallace_0df8.html" title="George Wallace">George Wallace</a>. "I felt I had gone to another world, not simply another country".<sup id="_ref-India_Untouched_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-India_Untouched" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Soon after arriving in America, George began to attend <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_dca5.html" title="New York University">New York University</a>'s <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stern_School_of_Business_8f69.html" title="Stern School of Business">Stern School of Business</a> as a graduate student. He specialized in developmental economics and finance with the hope that one day he would be able to make a contribution to India or one of the impoverished <a href="../../../a/f/r/African.html" title="African">African</a> nations. "I was working part-time for the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singer_Company_d29b.html" title="Singer Company">Singer Company</a> to meet the expenses toward my studies, and as a young man too idealistic about what I should be doing with my life, I asked the management of the company to remove my name from its records after I had left so that I would never be identified with a profit-making institution". He attempted to join the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Bank_2c67.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> but was not offered a position. Soon after completing his <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctoral.html" title="Doctoral">doctoral</a> work he decided to enter the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teaching.html" title="Teaching">teaching</a> profession. But teaching was not sufficiently gratifying, and he wanted to go out and do for himself what he was preaching to his students. That was when <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_Bank_59ec.html" title="Chemical Bank">Chemical Bank</a>, now part of <a href="../../../j/p/_/JP_Morgan_Chase_4d0e.html" title="JP Morgan Chase">JP Morgan Chase</a> Bank, offered him a job as an officer in the bank. He felt it was time for him to put aside his idealism and work for a prestigious bank, and hopefully save enough money over the years to do something for <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanitarian.html" title="Humanitarian">humanitarian</a> causes.</p>
<p>George had worked for Chemical Bank for only two years when he decided to start his own company, Multinational Computer Models, Inc (MCM), which would offer computerized systems to large multinational corporations to enable them to deal with their international financial risks. In the mid-1970s, software solutions for management decisions, especially if they involved gathering and processing information across many international subsidiaries, were something new, and somewhat expensive. <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_computers.html" title="Personal computers">Personal computers</a> had not yet been invented, and companies had to rely on expensive <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainframe_computer.html" title="Mainframe computer">mainframe</a> computers and terminals that were connected through international <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone.html" title="Telephone">telephone</a> lines in a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time-sharing.html" title="Time-sharing">time-sharing</a> environment. It was several years before his business became somewhat profitable, but when personal computers came along, they migrated their software to this new environment with great success. During this period, MCM formed a joint venture with <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit_Suisse_First_Boston_990d.html" title="Credit Suisse First Boston">Credit Suisse First Boston</a> where he served as the Chief Consultant and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Managing_Director_789f.html" title="Managing Director">Managing Director</a> of its new operations. As his fortunes began to turn for better, he continued to think of the day when he would be able to help the poor.</p>
<p>By 1995, after 25 years in America, George felt he had accomplished what he had set out to do in his professional business career. He had not lost his youthful idealism; he felt there were more important things to accomplish than success in business. Over the years, he had built a company from the ground up, and would soon sell it to a large multinational firm, <a href="../../../s/u/n/SunGard_Data_Systems_798a.html" title="SunGard Data Systems">SunGard Data Systems</a>, thereby concluding another chapter of his life. It was time for him to pursue what he had originally set out to do, to work full-time in the non-profit sector. He had read about the hardships faced by the poor in India and elsewhere, and their problems had emotionally affected him. He always knew that after accomplishing his professional goals, he would turn towards non-profit work in developing nations. While he was most interested in India, it mattered less to him which country he worked in as long as his efforts would make a difference, and help alleviate the poverty and suffering that had spread worldwide.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_George_7bfb.html" title="Edit section: Pursuing a Dream">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pursuing a Dream</span></h2>
<p>It was during this time that George's good friend Angeline Nair decided to return to India and settle down in Bangalore after spending nearly 20 years in America. Both of them shared similar interests in social service and had worked together in America to offer a better education to <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-American_68b7.html" title="Afro-American">Afro-American</a> <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_city.html" title="Inner city">inner city</a> children who came from underprivileged and broken households. They both spent a great deal of time discussing the ills that the poor of India faced, and the sheer lack of hope to change their fates. The more they talked, the more they realized they had a duty and an opportunity to do something about it. She promised to help him start a foundation in India that eventually became The George Foundation; it was a promise that would take him on to the next chapter of his life.</p>
<p>It was in <a href="../../../j/a/n/January.html" title="January">January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> that George went back to India for the first time after a long absence. He returned with the goal of making his contribution to reducing the injustices and inequalities he had observed and learned about from the media and many published works. He had a renewed sense of purpose and a lifetime of experience to undertake what he thought was a social obligation. Money, he had decided, was not an end, but a means to an end. He had been professionally and financially successful because of the opportunities that he had seized in his lifetime. He believed that it was only the luck of his birth that allowed him to have these opportunities. He felt it was not fair for him to selfishly enjoy the fruits of his success when many others had never had a chance. It was his duty to do something about this inequity.</p>
<p>Angeline had organized a meeting with several prominent individuals of the Bangalore society; like-minded individuals who believed in the need for social service. George found an extraordinarily talented young man, Jude Devdas, who would soon head all of The George Foundation’s activities in India. "Over these years, he has proved himself to be one of the most determined and hardworking individuals I have ever met".<sup id="_ref-India_Untouched_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-India_Untouched" title="">[2]</a></sup> Devdas oversees and coordinates every project TGF runs, and closely works with George to manage the finances of the foundation.</p>
<p>This meeting was the birth of The George Foundation, a non-profit charitable trust that would work towards the goals of addressing some of the most persistent problems in Indian society, especially with regard to the poor. It was the turning point in his life and in his professional interests. The sale of his company in America soon followed; he was now committed totally to humanitarian work.</p>

<p><i>Main article</i> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_George_Foundation_db32.html" title="The George Foundation">The George Foundation</a></p>
<p>The George Foundation (TGF) is a <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-governmental_organization.html" title="Non-governmental organization">non-governmental organization</a> (<a href="../../../n/g/o/NGO_9dc2.html" title="NGO">NGO</a>) established in 1995 with head office in Bangalore, India. After a decade of operations, the foundation George started has laid the groundwork for several projects that are presently addressing rural poverty.</p>
<p>The principal geographic area covered is rural <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_Nadu_d7a5.html" title="Tamil Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> (mainly in <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishnagiri.html" title="Krishnagiri">Krishnagiri</a> district) and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> states, serving over 16,000 people in 17 villages. The communities are some of the poorest in the nation: over 70 percent of the population has daily income of less than one dollar per person; illiteracy and malnutrition are both over 60 percent; female infanticide and bonded labor are prevalent.</p>
<p><br />
TGF’s mission is to alleviate <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty.html" title="Poverty">poverty</a>, promote health and a clean environment, and strengthen <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic.html" title="Democratic">democratic</a> institutions and values in India.</p>

<p>TGF pursues integrated holistic approaches to solving human problems. Accordingly, their projects create economic opportunity for the poor through business activities, and facilitate planned development through <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education.html" title="Education">education</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_care.html" title="Health care">health care</a>, empowerment of women, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_justice.html" title="Social justice">social justice</a>, and <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_governance.html" title="Good governance">good governance</a>. Consistent with this mission, the Foundation initially embarked on two major projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Project Shanti Bhavan</i>: Facility to <a href="../../../h/o/u/House.html" title="House">house</a> and educate at a time 336 children of deprived backgrounds from pre-school to grade 12. It is a world-class institution committed to excellence and globally shared values.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Project Lead-Free</i>: Infrastructure to test for blood lead levels in urban population throughout India. In 1998-99, the project conducted 25,000 blood tests of children, pregnant women, and emergency referrals, and this study led to a world conference in Bangalore in 1999 that resulted in the initiation of prevention measures, including unleaded gasoline, by the Government of India and several other <a href="../../../d/e/v/Developing_countries.html" title="Developing countries">developing countries</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Subsequently, the Foundation initiated several new projects:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Healthcare Projects</i>: A medical diagnostic and management system (EDPS 2000) was developed and implemented in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> to improve the delivery of rural healthcare. Subsequently, the Baldev Medical &amp; Community Centre was opened in <a href="../../../d/e/c/December.html" title="December">December</a> 2000 to provide primary health care and health education for the rural communities around Shanti Bhavan. Presently (2006) it servers 16,000 people in seventeen villages.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Women's Empowerment</i>: Several initiatives are currently under way to empower women through education, cooperative farming (BALDEV FARMS), vocational training, savings plan, and business development. Today (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>) Baldev Farms is the second largest banana grower in South India with 250 acres under cultivation. Profits from the farm are used for improving the economic status of the workers and for running the other charitable activities of the foundation.</li>
