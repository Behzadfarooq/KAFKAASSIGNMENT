<h2><span class="mw-headline">Please stop degrading information given</span></h2>
<p>Recently this page has been worked over to downplay two important pieces of information, and to ask for fact cites on a third. I should like to address these issues with the hope of putting them to rest for all time:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Mathers' mistranslation</b>: It seems that folks who adulate Aleister Crowley don't want to admit that he followed Mathers' MISTKE, but such is the case. Refering to Crowley's adaptation of Mathers' "version" or other such jolly horse-laughs is not scholarly. Mathers did not make a "version" of the oil. He made an ERROR. He made a MISTRANSLATION. Please, let us simply agree that such edits are pointless and will continue to be reverted, because in truth Mathers' made a MISTAKE and that is important in understanding the break that Crowley followers have with European and non-Crowley British and American occultists.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>He made an ERROR.</i> And like it or not, that error has resulted in a new version of the oil. How many oils and magical impliments and anything else for that matter have resulted from error? An uncountable number, I would imagine. By all means, let's mention his use of Galangal instead of Calamus. That is factual. But to continuously mention the "error" makes it sound like oil based on it is somehow "wrong". From one point of view, because Galangal is edible and Calamus is not, the "error" can be seen as an improvement, if one wants to use it as a flavoring. The fact is that the oil based on his translation, erroneous or not, has become a fully mature recipe in its own right. To repeat: yes, mention his change in translation, but do not harp on it in context. –<b><a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater5_6a4f.html" title="User:Frater5">Frater5</a></b> <span style="font-size:75%;">(<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrater5_d76a.html" title="User talk:Frater5">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Frater5_1e55.html" title="Special:Contributions/Frater5">con</a>)</span> 22:28, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That doesn't have any factual implications for the oil. If you believe it has magical import, then that's your perogitive. But factually, it means nothing. It would only be "playing" with the facts if the article was edited to say that Mathers' translation was accurate. As it is, no "fact twisting" is occuring.

<dd>Ask youself, what is the relevance of mentioning his (mis)translation with every instance? If it is for simple information, one or two references is enough.

<p>Please understand that nothing you do, no amount of reverence for Aleister Crowley or MacGregor Mathers you have, is going to change the facts. Asking for citations to the original manuscipt, as someone just did, is also a straw man. The references are already given below -- the German comparative edition of the book and the soon-to-be-released Enlish translation of the German edition, cited both as books and as ext. links.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would look in the mirror before throwing this around. Absolutely everything I've added is verifiable in the literature, and paints a neutral picture of the topic. Many of your additions are pure opinion and spin, intended to discredit modern variants of the oil. And please, I'm not kidding here, stop assuming that I venerate Crowley. The fact that I have as many if not more problems with him than you do doesn't change the facts. Nor does it justify demonizing him or discrediting his work. This is an encyclopedia based on NPOV and that is how I'm going to edit it. –<b><a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater5_6a4f.html" title="User:Frater5">Frater5</a></b> <span style="font-size:75%;">(<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrater5_d76a.html" title="User talk:Frater5">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Frater5_1e55.html" title="Special:Contributions/Frater5">con</a>)</span> 22:28, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is beiggining to look like an attempt to obfuscate or soft-pedal scholarly citations. Over on the book's page you said you were disinclined to "trust" the new, upcoming English translation, thinking it was a re-translation from a German translation of Mathers's English translation from the French ms -- when in fact it is a collated translation from all original msss in existence -- German, French, and Aramaic (late vernacular Hebrew). In fact, when i first found the page on the book, it was falsely stated that only ONE copy of the ms. existed, namely the one in Paris that Mathers had used.</p>

<dd>Chances are, the original Jews who used it all had their own variations as well.

<dd>Are you attempting to create a bogus diversion by bringing in fictional Jews and their fictional variant recipes? In any case, it just won't fly. The "original Jews" -- just like Jews of today, are a literate people and they make their Holy Anointing Oil according to the recipe written down in Exodus 30. There are no "variations" -- until we get to Abramelin's recipe, a medieval variation written by a German Jew in the diaspora. And all he did was to combine Cassia and Cionnamon -- two species in the same genus -- as one. His reasons, as noted, may have been to avoid duplicating Holy Oil exactly, or, just as likely, to adapt the recipe to materials he could obtain in Germany. I suggest that before you go on about "original Jews" and other Jews, you take a good, long look at Jewish history in the Middle Ages, and particularly in the city of Worms, where the author of the book lived. This information is available in books and in the German wiki, and will soon be in the English wiki. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineyronwode_cae5.html" title="User:Catherineyronwode">Catherineyronwode</a> 20:48, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're killing me, Cat. The context of the article clearly discusses the oil from the point of view of ancient Jews and the recipe that they put into the Torah. I think it is reasonable to suggest that among the many tribes, there was more than one precise recipe, meaning that there was no "one true" oil, with all others being "false". The real point here is that any attempt on your part to paint the Mathers/Crowley recipe as a degraded or "false" oil is subjective opinion and bad editing, and will be corrected for NPOV. If you want to bring in an admin to check out the degree of subjectiveness going on, I will be happy to be mediated. –<b><a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater5_6a4f.html" title="User:Frater5">Frater5</a></b> <span style="font-size:75%;">(<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrater5_d76a.html" title="User talk:Frater5">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Frater5_1e55.html" title="Special:Contributions/Frater5">con</a>)</span> 22:28, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Who are these "many tribes" and why do you call it "reasonable to suggest" that they used variant recipes? Basic Jewish history tells us that there is a book called "The Book of Exodus," within the Tanakh. (Tanakh is an acronym for Torah (Five Books of Moses), Nevi'im (Books of Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings or Hagiographa) and comprises what Christians call "The Old Testament".) In chapter 30 of "The Book of Exodus," a recipe is given for Holy Anointing Oil. No matter how many tribes of Jews exist now or existed in the historical past, they all referred to "The Book of Exodus," for the recipe for Holy Anointing Oil.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Variant copies of the Book of Exodus do exist, but those variations do not contain variants of the Holy Oil recipe. In short, your "reasonable" theory that "more than one precise recipe" exists fails of proof. It is impossible to disprove such a fiction, since not all copies of the book have survived to this day, but since there are no extant Exodus manuscripts mentioning variant recipes and no tribes of Jews in the historical past or the present can be demonstrated to have used or to presently use variant recipes, then, like it or not, and lacking evidence to the contrary, there really is "one true" recipe for Holy Anointing Oil. If you think otherwise, it is incumbant upon YOU to supply a citation at this point.</dd>

<dd>Cat, I believe you are missing Frater5's point, and are chasing your own tail. The point is that there is no "true" Abramelin oil, since ancient Hebrews probably had multiple recipies before they settled on the one in Exodus. For this article, it would be best to avoid any judgement calls about the "trueness" or legitimacy of the various recipies, and assume that they all have equal value to the people who use them. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomecallmetim_98fe.html" title="User:Somecallmetim">Somecallmetim</a> 00:26, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Cinnamon Essential Oil is toxic</b>: I put in a simple warning about the problems attendant upon the use of Crowley's essential oil recipe. This was chopped down and rendered inane by someone i suppose to be a supporter of Crowley. I have reinstated that warning and added more, concerning safety guidelines for the dilution of Cinnamon essential oil on the skin, in thw text, in an external link, and with a book reference. I have eye-witness accounts of Gnostic masses that had to be stopped in mid-rite due to the Crowley Oil of Abramelin running down a participant's sweaty forehead and into the eyes. I also have eye-witness account of a woman who rubbed insufficiently diluted Cinnamon essential oil on her husband's penis as part of a love-making rite and the burns were so bad that she had to drive him to the hospital ER, because mere water would not wash it off. I did not mention those situations on the page, but they are evidence that the issue of Cinnamon essential oil toxicity should never be reduced on the page. It is a SERIOUS issue. [cat yronwode]</li>

<dd>I put it as a foot note. It isn't serious. Thousands of people use Crowley's version every day, and none of them are going to the hospital for it (except for your unfortunate friend...in my 14+ years of working with it, I've never seen a problem). A simple statement that it is hot and people should avoid sensitive areas is enough.

<dd>That inference is all in you mind; i did not imply it in any way. The Mathers translation is not substandard or fake; it is an ERROR. The Mathers recipe for the oil is NOT dangerous. The Crowley recipe is not substandard or fake; it is based on TWO ERRORS -- the first being Mathers' errorand the second being Crowley's error in making a weight-for-weight substituion of essential oils for raw ingedients, which is his error alone and indicates that he had no idea of what was mant by the term "according to the art of the apothecary." This oil is DANGEROUS to use except under highly limited conditions. That Crowley liked having his skin burned is neither fake, nor substandard, nr an error on his part: It accords very well with his other interests in sado-masochism and pain.</dd>

<p>Although I usually play the role of peacemaker around here, I have to agree with Frater5 on this one. It really does sound like you're trying to discredit the Mathers/Crowley version by repeating "mistranslation" over and over again. It is redundant and very noticable. Maybe you really don't have an agenda to make Crowley or Thelema look bad (I'd like to think that you don't), but it <i>reads</i> that way. Honestly, the article as it stands really does make it super clear that Mathers wrote Galangal for the original Calamus. Harping on it just sounds bad and makes it look like you're trying to discredit modern recipes. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomecallmetim_98fe.html" title="User:Somecallmetim">Somecallmetim</a> 23:07, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><i>This is not in accord with the Jewish symbolism for Holy Anointing Oil, and it places Crowley's <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occultism.html" title="Occultism">occultism</a> outside the realm of traditional <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalistic</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimoire.html" title="Grimoire">grimoire</a> magic.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>This sounds judgemental. It could just as easily say, "Thus Crowley's substituted the symbol of microcosm/macrocosm for the symbol of phallic virility. While not in accord with Jewish symbolism for Holy Anointing Oil, it is in perfect alignment with Thelemic mysticsm, which reflects the ancient spiritual aim for union between the microcosm and the macrocosm." Can we reach a better compromise? <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomecallmetim_98fe.html" title="User:Somecallmetim">Somecallmetim</a> 23:07, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note that you have deleted the important phrase <b>traditional <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalistic</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimoire.html" title="Grimoire">grimoire</a> magic</b> in your rewrite. By doing this, you have created a false dichotomy between Thelema and JEWISH magic. However, CHRISTIAN occultists use the same recipe (with Calamus) that Jews do. Thus the statement <b>traditional <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalistic</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimoire.html" title="Grimoire">grimoire</a> magic</b> is accurate and must stand. These words were carefully selected: the word <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalistic</a> refers to Jewish occultism and <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimoire.html" title="Grimoire">grimoire</a> magic refers to Christian mdieval magic based on Jewish models. And thus, in this case, Thelema is indeed "outside the realm of traditional <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalistic</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimoire.html" title="Grimoire">grimoire</a> magic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Further, since Mathers made an error in translation, it is "judgemental" and speculative to the point of illogic to say that his mistake "reflects the ancient spiritual aim for union between the microcosm and the macrocosm." It does not do so. It reflects simply his mistake, nothing more.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The translation is utterly irrelevant to Crowley's mystical interpretation of Galangal. Something which you aren't getting is that the Crowley recipe now stands on its own. Moreover, the recipe was delivered to him during his Enochian Aethyrs vision quest, which, as an established holy book (printed as <i>The Vision and the Voice</i>) many Thelemites believe trumps all past references. You might not agree, but you don't get to judge. As long as Thelemites aren't devaluing the original Hebrew recipe, you don't get to devalue the Thelemic version. That is good NPOV. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomecallmetim_98fe.html" title="User:Somecallmetim">User:Somecallmetim</a> 03:16, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, you say that "Crowley's substituted the symbol" -- but Crowley did not make the substitution. It was MATHERS.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Crowley accepted the existance of Gelangal, and for most Thelemites, that's all that matters. The fact that it derived from Mathers' mistranslation is meaningless. Point in fact, it is possible to interpret it as mandated by the Secret Chiefs, who worked through Mathers to "update" the recipe. Again, we are dealing with HOLY oil...you only get to write what is, you don't get to decide which recipes are "true" and which are "false".

<p>I have to say, some of this article sounds like it might need to be reworded and some content possibly moved to a different heading. For instance, the intro is kind of long, and the other half might serve well in a section called "Controversy". Also some of the different oils could be shortened, and a different section called "differences" could be made, to display the smaller differences, instead of devoting a whole section header that only has 1 maybe 2 differences. Plus, do we really need to see that Mathers mistranslated it so often? This may play an importance, but it should be left up to the reader in this case, whether to use which version. I'm planning on trying to improve this article a little more, maybe throw in some citations and take that long one (ref # 4, its too long) out, or rephrase it (who put that in there by the way?). Anyway, any objections, I'd like to hear them, I'm than willing to discuss this before the article gets re worked. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">Zos</a> 01:50, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Disagree</b>: In general, i think that removing useful information from Wiki is not good. Specifically, i put a lot of work into researching, collecting, and posting those variant recipes in full form and i have no reason to want them "shortened" or taken down, but if y'all do it, then i will just host the whole batch at my own occultism site because i know from experience that this is information that people want and need and ask me about on a regular basis.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm going to be very blunt about the rest of your suggestion, Maggot:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My text about the counter-indications that you found in a "note" was removed from the article proper, where it had appeared first, and placed it in "note" status, even though it read just fine in the body of the text. I didn't kick; i figured that if this is what was wanted, okay, it's just a format change. I did not like the accompanying specious charge that i was verging on giving out medical advice (!!!!!) (This just stiupified me -- go read any web site on essential oils.) But now, on the excuse that the "note" is too long, you want to remove it too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I compound perfumes for a living. I supplied one of my proprietary recipes free to the public as part of an educational attempt to make WP a useful encyclopedia. All i have receivbed in exchange is a bunch of time-wasting crap. I will be perfectly happy to take the full format recipes, and all the essential oil information and host it at <a href="http://www.luckymojo.com/abramelin.html" class="external free" title="http://www.luckymojo.com/abramelin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.luckymojo.com/abramelin.html</a>. It is not worth my time as a professional writer and professional perfumer to try to cooperate with people who have an agenda, that agenda being to remove from Wikipdia any mention that their guru, Aleister Crowley, may have done things in error, sloppily, stupidly, or in such a way as to render potential physical harm to those who follow his perfume-compounding advice.</dd>

<dd>I didn't mean move the content to another article.

<dd>Oh, come on. This article has <i>extensive</i> references. There are a range of acceptable styles for citing sources for an article.

<dd>Plus, there seems to be a difference here. Some of the citations that are made, are in the "notes" area. I re read the WP page for footnotes, and no longer disagree with the usage of footnotes (but if someone could have pointed me there, instead of arguing). But its kind of confusing when you have citations being used in the footnotes area, then the last note is an actual footnote. Shouldnt the citations be moved to references?

<dd>You are not reading correctly. The word "manuscripts" is PLURAL. All of the pre-20th century versions are considered original manuscipys (not PRINTED, but MANUSCRIPTS) and they all agree on the ingedients. the only DISagreement occrs in one 20th century edition, This is explained in the article.</dd>

<li>Here is the recipe for Jewish Holy Oil from the Bible:</li>

<dd>Where in the Bible? And in which Bible?</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you are incapable of looking up a Bible passage yourself at google by grabbing some of the text in quotes and adding the citation you feel it needs, then you are not IMPORIVING Wikipedia, but using citation tags as a form of time-wasting harrassment. Do the work yourself. ANYONE who wants WP to be a better encyclopedia and who has edited here for more than a few days knows how to look up a Bible citation. That you would rather not go online and get the cite yourself and but would waste your time coming here and demanding a citation says a lot about your intentions. Your question "which Bible" is ludicrous. Any Bible -- the Tanakh, the KJV, the RSV -- it's in all of them. Look it up. Help out for a change and stop being a trouble-maker.</dd>

<ul>
<li>According to the S.L. MacGregor Mathers English translation, which derives from an incomplete French manuscript copy of the book, the recipe is as follows:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Who thinks this? And why?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Thinks"???? "WHY"???? Well, for starters, the books are there for any scholar to view and comparative editions have been published. They are noted in the Source material for the article. Can't you get it?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Those who hold that Mathers mistranslated the French manuscript or who have never consulted the Mathers version because they have read the text in the original German, French, or Aramaic, make a macerated version of Abramelin oil as follows:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Those who"... Who hold to this? Who claims this?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Two groups of "who" are mentioned. Please specify which one you are askin about.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Those who make Abramelin according to the English translation of Mathers' book compound their Abramelin oil from raw ingredients. They use the ratio given in the book:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again. Who are "those" people, who are "they".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Why, read it again -- the people who use the Mathers recipe are the ones who use Mathers's ingredients and compund it from raw ingredients.. Are you being dull on purpose? Do you want names? Social security numbrs? I do know of one place that sells theirs according to that recipe -- Alchemy Works. I even gave a link to their web site. But they are one of dozens. I used to make it that way myself, back before i found ou abou Mathers' mistake.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Many traditions of magic work with plant materials, and most also assign some symbolic meanings or ascriptions to these ingredients.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Which traditions are these? And what symbolic meanings?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>You are asking for a citation for each of the many hundreds of traditions of natural magic that work with plant materials as well as a citation for the symbolical meanings ascribed to every plants under each of these systems, as described by every author who has written on the subject. How many volumes of information about Obeah, Hoodoo, Pow Wow, Agrippa, Culpepper, Girard, Sassafras, Five Finger Grass, Cunningham, Brujeria, Bat Nuts, Buckeyes, Stregheria, Natural Magic, Safflower, Calendula, Magical Herbalsim, Beyerl, Arthaveda, Grieve, Hohman, Jordan, the Doctrine of Signatures, Appalachian Magic, Cherokee Magic, Iroquois Magic, Navajo Magic, Myrtle, Broom Corn, Umbanda, Kimbisa, Palo, Santeria, Lukumi, Thyme, lavender, Palo Monte Mayombe, Albertus Magnus, Pliny, Kemetic Magic, Dunwich, alnus, et al do you require? How would you like these THOUSANDS of citations written up? Be specific. You are asking for something so far beyond the scope of WP that it is incumbant upon you to explain your need for these citations. I myself wrote one book of 224 pages giving the symbolic meaning of 500 plants in just ONE of the word's many magical traditions. To cite all the magical traditions on Earth that deal or have dealt with plant materials, plus all the plant symbolisms in each tadition, would be the work of eighty to ninety years for ten people.</li>

<dd>If I go to read this article, I'm left with more questions than when I started. I'm actually finding questions.</dd>
<dd>These examples are only a few. It would take me the majority of the day to copy all of them. I'm not sure that all of these books in the reference section cover all of this, but if they do, please cite them.</dd>
<dd>Like I said, I'm willing to discuss this first, instead of adding cite tags to the article to prove this point. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">Zos</a> 19:14, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>catherine, let me know if you file a complaint against Zos. I'd be glad to support a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html#User-conduct_RfC" title="WP:RfC">user-conduct RfC</a>. He's being incredibly pushy, and not just on this article. However, I must warn you against making <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> as you did on <a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAleister_Crowley_766e.html" title="Talk:Aleister Crowley">Talk:Aleister Crowley</a>. Such attacks can only harm your case against Zos. He knows this and appears to be deliberately pushing you to provoke incivility. He probably wants to use such evidence to get you blocked from WP so he can then rewrite your excellent material on Abramelin oil. (P.S. I still do not agree with on how you have documented Crowley's "racism" - what you have done appears to be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. I suggest you simply find a biography that discusses Crowley's racist expressions, summarize what the biographer says about it, and cite it. Any other way of doing it will remain too controversial to be kept.) -<a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> 18:04, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
