<p>After education at Blundell's school, <a href="../../../t/i/v/Tiverton%2C_Devon_c9e7.html" title="Tiverton, Devon">Tiverton</a>, he entered the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_Temple_3dd9.html" title="Inner Temple">Inner Temple</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1824.html" title="1824">1824</a>, and was called to the bar in June 1832. He took part as a conservative in the discussions of the London Debating Society, where his opponents were <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Arthur_Roebuck_1a9c.html" title="John Arthur Roebuck">JA Roebuck</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stuart_Mill_d597.html" title="John Stuart Mill">John Stuart Mill</a>. The editorship of the <i>Law Magazine</i>, or, <i>Quarterly Review of Jurisprudence</i>, which he held from 1828 to 1844, brought him into connection with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Austin_%28legal_philosophy%29_2249.html" title="John Austin (legal philosophy)">John Austin</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cornewall_Lewis_4346.html" title="George Cornewall Lewis">G Cornewall Lewis</a>, and such foreign jurists as <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Karl_von_Savigny_e6a6.html" title="Friedrich Karl von Savigny">Savigny</a>, whose tractate on contemporary legislation and jurisprudence he rendered into <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/3/1833.html" title="1833">1833</a> he travelled abroad, and on his return printed privately a translation of <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe_cb5b.html" title="Johann Wolfgang von Goethe">Goethe</a>'s <i><a href="../../../f/a/u/Faust.html" title="Faust">Faust</a></i> into English prose (pronounced by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Carlyle_703b.html" title="Thomas Carlyle">Carlyle</a> to be the best version extant in his time). A second and revised edition was published after another visit to Germany in January 1834, in the course of which Hayward met <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Ludwig_Tieck_8d16.html" title="Johann Ludwig Tieck">Tieck</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelbert_von_Chamisso_b703.html" title="Adelbert von Chamisso">Chamisso</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Heinrich_Karl_de_la_Motte%2C_baron_Fouqu%C3%A9_717e.html" title="Friedrich Heinrich Karl de la Motte, baron Fouqué">De La Motte Fouqué</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_August_Varnhagen_von_Ense_1cbc.html" title="Karl August Varnhagen von Ense">Varnhagen von Ense</a> and Madame Goethe. In 1878 he contributed the rather colourless volume on Goethe to Blackwood's Foreign Classics. A successful translation. was in those days a first-rate credential for a reviewer, and Hayward began contributing to the <i>New Monthly</i>, the <i>Foreign Quarterly</i>, the <i>Quarterly Review</i> and the <i><a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh_Review_fa8b.html" title="Edinburgh Review">Edinburgh Review</a></i>.</p>
<p>His first successes in this new field were won in 1835-1836 by articles on "Walker's Original" and on "Gastronomy." The essays were reprinted to form one of his best volumes, <i>The Art of Dining</i>, in 1852. In February 1835 he was elected to the Athenaeum Club under Rule 11, and he remained for nearly fifty years one of its most conspicuous and most influential members. He was also a subscriber to the Carlton, but ceased to frequent it when he became a <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Robert_Peel_0b33.html" title="Sir Robert Peel">Peelite</a>. At the Temple, Hayward, whose reputation was rapidly growing as a connoisseur not only of a bill of fare but also (as <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Swift_100b.html" title="Jonathan Swift">Swift</a> would have said) of a bill of company, gave <i>recherché</i> dinners, at which ladies of rank and fashion appreciated the wit of <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Smith_c125.html" title="Sydney Smith">Sydney Smith</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Edward_Hook_44e4.html" title="Theodore Edward Hook">Theodore Hook</a>, the dignity of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Gibson_Lockhart_12be.html" title="John Gibson Lockhart">Lockhart</a> and Lyndhurst and the oratory of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Macaulay_aeaf.html" title="Thomas Macaulay">Macaulay</a>. At the Athenaeum and in political society he to some extent succeeded to the position of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wilson_Croker_f94c.html" title="John Wilson Croker">Croker</a>. He and Macaulay were commonly said to be the two best-read men in town.</p>
<p>Hayward got up every important subject of discussion immediately it came into prominence, and concentrated his information in such a way that he habitually had the last word to say on a topic. When <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Rogers_b14a.html" title="Samuel Rogers">Rogers</a> died, when <i><a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_Fair_97ac.html" title="Vanity Fair">Vanity Fair</a></i> was published, when the <i>Greville Memoirs</i> was issued or a revolution occurred on the continent, Hayward, whose memory was as retentive as his power of accumulating documentary evidence was exhaustive, wrote an elaborate essay on the subject for the <i>Quarterly</i> or the <i>Edinburgh</i>. He followed up his paper by giving his acquaintances no rest until they either assimilated or undertook to combat his views. Political ladies first, and statesmen afterwards, came to recognize the advantage of obtaining Hayward's good opinion. In this way the "old reviewing hand" became an acknowledged link between society, letters and politics. As a professional man he was less successful; his promotion to be Q.C. in 1845 excited a storm of opposition, and, disgusted at not being elected a Bencher of his Inn in the usual course,</p>
<p>Hayward virtually withdrew from legal practice. In February 1848 he became one of the chief leader-writers for the Peelite organ, the <i><a href="../../../m/o/r/Morning_Chronicle_b9e1.html" title="Morning Chronicle">Morning Chronicle</a></i>. The morbid activity of his memory, however, continued to make him many enemies. He alienated Disraeli by tracing a <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purple_patch.html" title="Purple patch">purple patch</a> in his official eulogy of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington_10be.html" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> to a newspaper translation from <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolphe_Thiers_18fb.html" title="Adolphe Thiers">Thiers</a>'s funeral <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panegyric.html" title="Panegyric">panegyric</a> on General St Cyr. His sharp tongue made an enemy of Roebuck, and he disgusted the friends of Mill by the stories he raked up for an obituary notice of the great economist (<i>The Times</i>, <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_10.html" title="May 10">May 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>). He broke with <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Reeve_423e.html" title="Henry Reeve">Henry Reeve</a> in 1874 by a venomous review of the <i>Greville Memoirs</i>, in which Reeve was compared to the beggarly Scot deputed to let off the blunderbuss which Bolingbroke (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Cavendish_Fulke_Greville_fc9a.html" title="Charles Cavendish Fulke Greville">Greville</a>) had charged. His enemies prevented him from enjoying a well-selected quasisinecure, which both <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_John_Temple%2C_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston_ec3c.html" title="Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston">Palmerston</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Hamilton-Gordon%2C_4th_Earl_of_Aberdeen_8c4e.html" title="George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> admitted to be his due. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Warren_%28English_lawyer%29_b6c0.html" title="Samuel Warren (English lawyer)">Samuel Warren</a> attacked him (very unjustly, for Hayward was anything but a parasite) as Venom Tuft in <i>Ten Thousand a Year</i>; and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Disraeli_2257.html" title="Benjamin Disraeli">Disraeli</a> aimed at him partially in Ste Barbe (in <i>Endymion</i>), though the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a> here was directed primarily against <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Makepeace_Thackeray_2163.html" title="William Makepeace Thackeray">Thackeray</a>.</p>
<p>After his break with Reeve, Hayward devoted himself more exclusively to the <i>Quarterly</i>. His essays on Chesterfield and Selwyn were reprinted in 1854. Collective editions of his articles appeared in volume form in 1858, 1873 and 1874, and Selected Essays in two volumes, 1878. In his useful but far from flawless edition of the <i>Autobiography, Letters and Literary Remains of Mrs (Thrale) Piozzi</i> (1861), he again appears as a supplementer and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuator.html" title="Continuator">continuator</a> of <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._W._Croker_4e2f.html" title="J. W. Croker">J. W. Croker</a>. His <i>Eminent Statesmen and Writers</i> (1880) commemorates to a large extent personal friendships with such men as <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandre_Dumas%2C_p%C3%A8re_e897.html" title="Alexandre Dumas, père">Dumas</a>, Cavour and Thiers, whom he knew intimately. As a counsellor of great ladies and of politicians,, to whom he held forth with a sense of all-round responsibility surpassing that of a cabinet minister, Hayward retained his influence to the last years of his life. But he had little sympathy with modern ideas. He used to say that he had outlived every one that he could really look up to. He died, a bachelor, in his rooms at 8 St James's Street (a small museum of autograph portraits and reviewing trophies).</p>
<p>Two volumes of Hayward's <i>Correspondence</i> (edited by HE Carlisle) were published in 1886. In <i>Vanity Fair</i> (<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_27.html" title="November 27">November 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1875.html" title="1875">1875</a>) he may be seen as he appeared in later life.</p>
