<p>Well OK, "God im Himmel" isn't proper Dutch. But it's not proper German either! The German word for "God" is "Gott". —<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabbe_a391.html" title="User:Gabbe">Gabbe</a> 19:53, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Its actually "Gott in Himmel!" in the original found on <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext95/dracu13.txt" class="external free" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext95/dracu13.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext95/dracu13.txt</a> Sitethief 12:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Talk%7EAbraham_Van_Helsing_1aad.html" title="Edit section: van Helsing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">van Helsing</span></h2>
<p>Maybe a good idea to write the name of van Helsing correct. The "van" in his name is like the "of" in Robin of Locksley, its not written in capital. Yes I know that Bram Stoker himself wrote the name this way, but thats not a reason to write it wrong like he did. So if it would be a real Dutch surname then it would be written "van Helsing" and not "Van Helsing" . Oh and SAMPA wise it would be "vAn" instead of "ven". Sitethief 12:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree -- as a fictional character, it's Stoker's usage sets the standard by which criticism should adhere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's a sticky issue besides: although "Van Helsing" may litterally translate into "of Helsing," that does not mean that it is being used in the archaic sense. While <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_da_Vinci_1ee9.html" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>'s name is clearly "Leonardo" and not "da Vinci," this naming convention has developed into last names as well: <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_van_Beethoven_69c9.html" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> is not "Ludwig" of "Beethoven," his last name is "Beethoven," same as his father's. "Van Helsing" is clearly closer to the later example than the former, except that Stoker included the "Van" as part of the last name, instead of as a conjunction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So -- the question at hand is really wheather this is a common convention in modern names, or a mistake on Stoker's part. I know nothing about how to speak Dutch, so it is impossible for me to say wheather the Duch langauge has adopted the "van" into last names. Something in the back of my head is saying that in English, however, people of Germanic origins have often done so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At the end of the day, however, this point is moot. Stoker clearly intended "Van Helsing" to function, in its entirty, as a last name. The character is always called "Van Helsing," never just "Helsing," and always with a capital "V." <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 18:41, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tried to revise the following lines, but the points themselves border on irrelevance:</p>
<p><i>It is interesting to note Van Helsing's speech in the novel. He generally speaks English approximatively, redundantly, filling it with biblical allusions - while Dracula is also a foreigner but speaks English without accent. But when he is in agitation, he suddenly begins to speak correctly.</i></p>
<p><i>When Van Helsing is upset, he begins speaking German: "Gott im Himmel!" It is possible that Bram Stoker thought it was Dutch, but the correct Dutch would be "God in de hemel!"</i></p>
<p>Futhermore, I would bet Stoker knew what was Dutch and what was German. People often adopt single phrases from other languages, especially since the Dutch tradition is multilingual and the character is a doctor. Regardless, it's unsourced and speculative at best. - <a href="../../../i/s/t/User%7EIstvanWolf_aaa4.html" title="User:IstvanWolf">IstvanWolf</a> 23:45, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei-Ginsei_3cc1.html" title="User:Rei-Ginsei">User:Rei-Ginsei</a> moved the article to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Helsing%28Novel_Character%29_e650.html" title="Van Helsing(Novel Character)">Van Helsing(Novel Character)</a>, saying (in the edit history) "Abraham is subject to frequent change in the movies. Half of which dont even reveal first name."</p>
<p>I have moved it back, because this article is about the character in the novel (a point <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei-Ginsei_3cc1.html" title="User:Rei-Ginsei">User:Rei-Ginsei</a> admits in his/her choice of alternative title), and so what happens in the movies is irrelevant: this article is about the character in the novel, whose name is Abraham Van Helsing. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_A_a8ca.html" title="User:Paul A">Paul A</a> 02:04, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I notice that <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei-Ginsei_3cc1.html" title="User:Rei-Ginsei">User:Rei-Ginsei</a> has moved this page again. I find this rather absurd. This article is clearly about the original character "Abraham Van Helsing," from the novel. The article rightfully mentions variant names in various adaptations at the bottom of the article, but I do not believe that this is a reason for an article move. Furthermore, if the adaptations' name changes are the problem with calling this page "<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Van_Helsing_ecd9.html" title="Abraham Van Helsing">Abraham Van Helsing</a>", why on Earth would "<a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Helsing_%28Novel_character%29_5ae6.html" title="Van Helsing (Novel character)">Van Helsing (Novel character)</a>" be an improvement? If anything, it indicates that this page operates at the exclusion of film adaptations, where the original title did not. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 04:07, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well shouldn't the article be about the overall character and not just the original. The way the Dracula, and Frankenstein pages, should be more about the overall pop-culture phenomana of the franchises, than the original works? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei-Ginsei_3cc1.html" title="User:Rei-Ginsei">Rei-Ginsei</a> (<a href="../../../r/e/i/User_talk%7ERei-Ginsei_eb0d.html" title="User talk:Rei-Ginsei">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rei-Ginsei_11bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rei-Ginsei">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>I can't even begin to understand what you mean. Both the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula.html" title="Dracula">Dracula</a> and the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankenstein.html" title="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a> articles are about the novels by that name. Later adaptations are mentioned at the bottom of the articles, and links are given to other pages regarding modern works that 'borrow' the characters. This article has a long way to go before it's of the same quality as the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula.html" title="Dracula">Dracula</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankenstein.html" title="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a> articles, but like them it should give weight first and foremost to the literary character. All other uses are incidental, or belong in separate articles.</dd>
