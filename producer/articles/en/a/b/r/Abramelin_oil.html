<p>There are, especially among English-speaking occulists, numerous variant forms of Abramelin Oil.</p>
<p><a name="Abramelin_Oil" id="Abramelin_Oil"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Edit section: Abramelin Oil">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Abramelin Oil</span></h3>
<p>In the English translation by Steven Guth of Georg Dehn's edition, which was compiled from all the known German manuscript sources,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> the formula reads as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Take one part of the best myrrh, half a part of cinnamon, one part of cassia, one part galanga root, and a quarter of the combined total weight of good, fresh olive oil. Make these into an ointment or oil as is done by the chemists. Keep it in a clean container until you need it. Put the container together with the other accessories in the cupboard under the altar.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Guth's translation of the recipe may be incorrect. The German sources clearly list "Calmus" or "Kalmus". Guth has translated these as "galanga root". Taking this into account, the five ingedients listed by Abraham of Worms in <i>The Book of Abramelin</i> are identical to those listed in the Bible. Only the proportions are slightly different (one-half versus one part of calamus).</p>
<p>In the first printed edition, Peter Hammer, 1725, the recipe reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nimm Mhrrhen des besten 1 Theil, Zimmt 1/2 Theil, soviel des Calmus als Zimmet, Cassien soviel als der Myrrhen im Gewicht und gutes frisches Baumöl..." (Take 1 part of the best myrrh, 1/2 part cinnamon, as much calamus as cinnamon, of cassia as much as the myrrh in weight and good fresh tree oil...)<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that the proportions in this edition have been changed to conform with the recipe for <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_anointing_oil.html" title="Holy anointing oil">Holy anointing oil</a> from the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred [shekels], and of sweet cinnamon half so much, [even] two hundred and fifty [shekels], and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty [shekels], And of cassia five hundred [shekels], after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin: And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compounded after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Edit section: Samuel Mathers' Abramelin Oil">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Samuel Mathers' Abramelin Oil</span></h3>
<p>According to the S.L. MacGregor Mathers English translation, which derives from an incomplete French manuscript copy of the book, the recipe is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>You shall prepare the sacred oil in this manner: Take of myrrh in tears, one part; of fine cinnamon, two parts; of galangal half a part; and the half of the total weight of these drugs of the best oil olive. The which aromatics you shall mix together according unto the art of the apothecary, and shall make thereof a balsam, the which you shall keep in a glass vial which you shall put within the cupboard (formed by the interior) of the altar. <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The four ingedients listed by Mathers in his translation of <i>The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage</i> are Myrrh, Cinnamon, Galangal, and Olive oil. The word that he translated from the French as "Galangal" is actually the word "Calamus." The other extant manuscripts also list "Calamus" as the ingredient. It is unknown if Mathers' use of Galangal instead of Calamus was intentional or a mistranslation, but it was to result in several notable changes, including symbolism and use.</p>
<p>Since Cinnamon and Cassia are two species of the same Cinnamomum genus, their doubling up into one name by the translator of the French manuscript is not unexpected. His reasons for doing so may have been prompted by a pious decision to avoid duplicating true Holy Oil, or by a tacit admission that in medieval Europe, it was difficult to obtain Cinnamon and Cassia as separate products.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Edit section: Abramelin Oil made with essential oils">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Abramelin Oil made with essential oils</span></h3>
<p>A recipe for Abramelin oil using essential oils is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>half part <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinnamon.html" title="Cinnamon">Cinnamon</a> essential oil</li>
<li>1 parts <a href="../../../m/y/r/Myrrh.html" title="Myrrh">Myrrh</a> essential oil</li>
<li>1 part <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweet_Flag_68c0.html" title="Sweet Flag">Calamus</a> essential oil</li>

<li>one-quarter of the foregoing total weight <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olive_oil.html" title="Olive oil">Olive oil</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Since ancient perfumers and apothecaries never compounded their fragrances by mixing essential oils in such large ratio with respect to carrier oils—because the original formula was to be distilled after maceration, not before—it is possible to restore the proportions to something like what they might have been if maceration and distillation had occurred "according to the art of the apothecary":</p>
<ul>
<li>half part <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinnamon.html" title="Cinnamon">Cinnamon</a> essential oil</li>
<li>1 parts <a href="../../../m/y/r/Myrrh.html" title="Myrrh">Myrrh</a> essential oil</li>
<li>1 part <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweet_Flag_68c0.html" title="Sweet Flag">Calamus</a> essential oil</li>
<li>1 part <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassia.html" title="Cassia">Cassia</a> essential oil</li>
<li>7 parts <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olive_oil.html" title="Olive oil">Olive oil</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a highly fragranced oil that may be applied to the skin in more liberal amounts; it is a close, modern approximation of the oil described by Abramelin to Abraham of Worms.</p>
<p><a name="Macerated_Abramelin_Oil" id="Macerated_Abramelin_Oil"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Edit section: Macerated Abramelin Oil">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Macerated Abramelin Oil</span></h3>
<p>A recipe for Abramelin oil based upon the French manuscript:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 parts <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinnamon.html" title="Cinnamon">Cinnamon</a> bark quills, reduced to powder</li>
<li>2 parts <a href="../../../m/y/r/Myrrh.html" title="Myrrh">Myrrh</a> resin, finely ground</li>
<li>1 part <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweet_Flag_68c0.html" title="Sweet Flag">Calamus</a> chopped root, reduced to powder</li>
<li>half of the foregoing total weight <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olive_oil.html" title="Olive oil">Olive oil</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The mixture is macerated for one month, then decanted and bottled for use, producing a fragranced oil suitable for anointing any portion of the body, and will not burn the skin. It may be applied liberally, after the manner of traditional Jewish Holy Oils, such as the one which was poured on Aaron's head until it ran down his beard. It is not, however, made "according unto the art of the apothecary", since it is not distilled after the maceration but decanted into bottles.</p>

<p>Making Abramelin oil according to Mathers' translation of the French manuscript requires compounding the oil from raw ingredients. The ratio given in the book is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 parts <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinnamon.html" title="Cinnamon">Cinnamon</a> bark quills, reduced to powder</li>
<li>2 parts <a href="../../../m/y/r/Myrrh.html" title="Myrrh">Myrrh</a> resin tears, finely ground</li>
<li>1 part <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galangal.html" title="Galangal">Galangal</a> sliced root, reduced to powder</li>
<li>half of the foregoing total weight <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olive_oil.html" title="Olive oil">Olive oil</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This mixture is macerated for one month, then decanted and bottled for use. The result is a fragranced oil suitable for anointing any portion of the body, and it will not burn the skin.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Edit section: Crowley's Abramelin Oil made with essential oils">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Crowley's Abramelin Oil made with essential oils</span></h3>
<p>Early in the 20th century, the British <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occultism.html" title="Occultism">occultist</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> created his own version of Abramelin Oil, which he called "Oil of Abramelin," and sometimes referred to as the "Holy Oil of Aspiration." It was based on Mathers' substitution of Galangal for Calamus. Crowley also abandoned the book's method of preparation—which specifies blending Myrrh "tears" (resin) and "fine" (finely ground) Cinnamon—instead opting for pouring together distilled <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essential_oil.html" title="Essential oil">essential oils</a> with a small amount of olive oil. His recipe (from his Commentary to <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liber_Legis_32c4.html" title="Liber Legis">Liber Legis</a> <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/220/crowley-comments.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hermetic.com/220/crowley-comments.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) reads as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 parts <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinnamon.html" title="Cinnamon">Cinnamon</a> essential oil</li>
<li>4 parts <a href="../../../m/y/r/Myrrh.html" title="Myrrh">Myrrh</a> essential oil</li>
<li>2 parts <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galangal.html" title="Galangal">Galangal</a> essential oil</li>
<li>7 parts <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olive_oil.html" title="Olive oil">Olive oil</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Crowley weighed out his proportions of essential oils according to the recipe specified by Mathers' translation for weighing out raw materials. The result is to give the Cinnamon a strong presence, so that when it is placed upon the skin "it should burn and thrill through the body with an intensity as of fire." <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> This formula is unlike the <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimoire.html" title="Grimoire">grimoire</a> recipe and it cannot be used for practices that require the oil to be poured over the head. Rather, Crowley intended it to be applied in small amounts, usually to the top of the head or the forehead, and to be used for anointment of magical equipment as an act of consecration.</p>

<p>It is possible to add 1 part of a previously <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consecrated.html" title="Consecrated">consecrated</a> batch of the Crowley version of Abramelin oil to each new batch. This can be done for magical reasons and does not change the proportions of the ingredients.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Edit section: Symbolism of the ingredients">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Symbolism of the ingredients</span></h2>
<p>Many traditions of magic work with plant materials, and most also assign some symbolic meanings or ascriptions to these ingredients.</p>
<p>In the Jewish tradition, from whence came the original Biblical recipe upon which Abramelin Oil is based, the Olive is a symbol of domestic felicity and stability, Myrrh (which contains opioids) is believed to be sacred to the Lord, Calamus is known for its sweetness and phalliform fruiting body and stands for <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male_sexuality.html" title="Male sexuality">male sexuality</a> and love, while Cinnamon is favoured for its warming ability.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hoodoo.html" title="Hoodoo">hoodoo</a> folk magic, these symbolisms are somewhat changed: Myrrh and Olive remain the same, but Cinnamon is for money and luck, and Calamus is used to sweetly control others. (The Matherian alternative, Galangal, is employed in protective work, especially that involving court cases.)</p>
<p>Crowley also had a symbolic view of the ingredients that he found in the Mathers translation:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This oil is compounded of four substances. The basis of all is the oil of the olive. The olive is, traditionally, the gift of Minerva, the Wisdom of God, the Logos. In this are dissolved three other oils; oil of myrrh, oil of cinnamon, oil of galangal. The Myrrh is attributed to Binah, the Great Mother, who is both the understanding of the Magician and that sorrow and compassion which results from the contemplation of the Universe. The Cinnamon represents Tiphereth, the Sun -- the Son, in whom Glory and Suffering are identical. The Galangal represents both Kether and Malkuth, the First and the Last, the One and the Many, since in this Oil they are One. [...] These oils taken together represent therefore the whole Tree of Life. The ten Sephiroth are blended into the perfect gold. <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></dd>

<p>The original popularity of Abramelin Oil rested on the importance magicians place upon Jewish traditions of Holy Oils and, more recently, upon Mathers' translation of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Book_of_the_Sacred_Magic_of_Abramelin_the_Mage_6d86.html" title="The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage">The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage</a></i> and the resurgence of 20th century occultism, such as found in the works of the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_7912.html" title="Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>, and has since spread into other modern occult traditions.</p>
<p>Because it derives from the formula for <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> Holy Oil, Abramelin Oil also finds use among Jewish and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalists</a> who are not specifically performing the works described by Abraham of Worms. However, the oil can be used in the course of ritual activities outlined in the book by <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_the_Mage_dad7.html" title="Abramelin the Mage">Abramelin the Mage</a> in order to obtain the outcomes he promised those who successfully applied his system of "Divine Science" and "True Magic", namely, the gifts of flight, treasure-finding, and invisibility, as well as the power to cast effective love spells.</p>

<p>Oil of Abramelin was seen as highly important by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>, the founder of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thelema.html" title="Thelema">Thelema</a>, and he used his version of it throughout his life.

<p>Crowley went on to say</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Holy Oil is the Aspiration of the Magician; it is that which consecrates him to the performance of the Great Work; and such is its efficacy that it also consecrates all the furniture of the Temple and the instruments thereof. It is also the grace or chrism; for this aspiration is not ambition; it is a quality bestowed from above. For this reason the Magician will anoint first the top of his head before proceeding to consecrate the lower centres in their turn (...) It is the pure light translated into terms of desire. It is not the Will of the Magician, the desire of the lower to reach the higher; but it is that spark of the higher in the Magician which wishes to unite the lower with itself. <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>This oil is currently used in several ceremonies of the Thelemic church, <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesia_Gnostica_Catholica_ba84.html" title="Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica">Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica</a>, including the rites of <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">Baptism</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation.html" title="Confirmation">Confirmation</a>, and <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordination.html" title="Ordination">Ordination</a>. It is also commonly used to consecrate <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magick.html" title="Magick">magical</a> implements and temple furniture. The <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">eucharistic</a> host of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gnostic_Mass_ca75.html" title="The Gnostic Mass">the Gnostic Mass</a>—called the <a href="../../../c/a/k/Cake_of_Light_7de4.html" title="Cake of Light">Cake of Light</a>—includes this oil as an important ingredient.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramelin_oil.html" title="Edit section: Effects of Mathers' recipe and Crowley's use of essential oils">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Effects of Mathers' recipe and Crowley's use of essential oils</span></h2>
<p>Mathers' use of the ingredient galangal instead of calamus and/or Crowley's innovative use of essential oils rather than raw ingredients has resulted in some interesting changes from the original recipe:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Scent</b>: The oils of Mathers and Crowley have a different aroma from the Jewish Abramelin oil. The scent of galangal is gingergy and spicy whereas calamus is florally sweet yet a bit yeasty—although the scent of the final oil is strongly cinnamon.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Symbolism</b>: In Jewish, Greek, and European magical botanic symbolism, the ascription given to <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweet_Flag_68c0.html" title="Sweet Flag">sweet flag or calamus</a> is generally that of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male_sexuality.html" title="Male sexuality">male sexuality</a>, due to the shape of the plant's fruiting body. Crowley gave the following <a href="../../../q/a/b/Qabalah.html" title="Qabalah">Qabalistic</a> meaning for galangal: "Galangal represents both <a href="../../../k/e/t/Kether.html" title="Kether">Kether</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malkuth.html" title="Malkuth">Malkuth</a>, the First and the Last, the One and the Many." Thus Crowley's substitution therefore shifts the symbolism to microcosm/macrocosm unity, which is reflective of Thelema's mystical aim—the union of the adept with the Absolute. <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Skin sensation</b>: The original recipe for Abramelin Oil does not irritate the skin and can be applied according to traditional Jewish and Christian religious and magical practices. Crowley's recipe has a much higher concentration of cinnamon than the original recipe. This results in an oil which can be noticeably hot on the skin and can cause skin rashes if applied too liberally. <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Digestive toxicity</b>: Galangal is edible, calamus is not, as it has some toxicity. This is certainly relevant to those who use Crowley's Oil of Abramelin as a core ingredient for the eucharistic <a href="../../../c/a/k/Cake_of_Light_7de4.html" title="Cake of Light">Cake of Light</a>, giving it a mild opiated taste (from the myrrh) and a spicy tang (from the cinnamon and the ginger-like galangal). Heavy use of calamus in such a recipe would render the host inedible. <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></li>
