<p>Lincoln High School was constructed to address the increasing enrollment of students at nearby <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_High_School_%28Des_Moines%29_4ca8.html" title="East High School (Des Moines)">East High School</a>. During this time, the south side of Des Moines was home to new urban development. This further increased enrollment and the need for an additional school. A bond issue was passed on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_18.html" title="March 18">March 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, that provided the funds to build the school.<sup id="_ref-lhshistory_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lhshistory" title="">[2]</a></sup> By 1923, construction was completed, at a cost of $949,754.95 <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">USD</a>.<sup id="_ref-lhshistory_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lhshistory" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>At that time, the school had 55 classrooms, a swimming pool, two gymnasiums, several labs, an art and music room, cafeteria, and an auditorium, providing for a total student capacity of 1,300 people.<sup id="_ref-lhshistory_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lhshistory" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1962 an additional wing was constructed, which added additional classrooms, additional laboratory areas, and a library with over 13,000 volumes.<sup id="_ref-lhshistory_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lhshistory" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>A male faculty lounge was added in 1963.<sup id="_ref-lhshistory_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lhshistory" title="">[2]</a></sup> An existing light-well was enclosed to provide for this new room.</p>
<p>In 1964, further expansions were contracted at a total cost of $1,667,000.<sup id="_ref-lhshistory_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lhshistory" title="">[2]</a></sup> This provided for the construction of the Roundhouse, home to the various indoor sporting venues. On the lower level, a new swimming pool and boys' locker room was constructed. The old swimming pool was converted to classroom space, but the old gymnasiums are still in use. The old locker rooms were remodeled into the girls' locker rooms.</p>

<p>In November 2005, the Des Moines School Board approved contracts totaling $22,753,954 for the renovation and expansion of Lincoln High.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup> The work is scheduled to be completed by August 2008. Since Lincoln is at overcapacity, students in the 9th grade will attend classes at the Kurtz Junior High building, to be named Lincoln South, for the school years starting in 2006 and 2007. This separation has caused complications in schedules for students being bused back and forth between classes and after-school activities. Some after-school clubs have been started at Lincoln South like the Art Club and <i>Random Independent</i>, one of the school's newspapers.</p>

<p>The school day is split into seven periods of course instruction, with the fifth period being the longest to allow for a short lunch break. The school district requires students to take a number of core academic courses if they wish to graduate. This includes Social Studies, English, Mathematics, Science, Art, and Physical Education. The exact amount of academic credit needed to satisfy graduation requirements is determined by the school district.</p>
<p>All students are required by the district to enroll in four subject courses and a Physical Education course. However, the school compels lower-class students to schedule a full day of classes, in order to ensure satisfaction with district graduation requirements. Juniors and seniors have the option of having an "open period" during the first or last period of the school day ("Seniors may have open periods during any period"). However, juniors require parental permission to have an open period.</p>
<p>The district requires four years of Physical Education. Freshmen and sophomores usually take their P.E. courses at the school. Juniors and seniors have the option of taking alternative P.E. programs, including a bowling class that requires students to commute to a nearby bowling alley.</p>
