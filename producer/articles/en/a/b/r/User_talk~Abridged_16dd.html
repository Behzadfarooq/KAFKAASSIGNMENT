<p>A tag has been placed on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Murphy_260b.html" title="Robin Murphy">Robin Murphy</a>, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable</a>, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add <code>{{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}}</code> on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Talk%7ERobin_Murphy_f5bc.html" title="Talk:Robin Murphy">the article's talk page</a> explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.</p>
<p>For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">for biographies</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">for web sites</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">for bands</a>, or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">for companies</a>.

<dd>For the record, this page was up for about 5 minutes before it was deleted. It was a stub. It did indicate how the subject was notable--as an author of reference books that are considered to be standard in Homeopathy. <a href="../../../a/b/r/User%7EAbridged_690f.html" title="User:Abridged">Abridged</a> 21:29, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Arr... Actually, there was an old version, which is likely why it got deleted so quickly. The old one was a straight advertising piece. Also made claims about him being the most widely-known teacher of homeopathy that weren't supported by any source or popularity check I could come up with, at least that dealt with him having a relatively common name. ('"Robin Murphy" Homeopathy', with quotes around his name to remove chance hits, gets only 873 hits, for instance. Obviously, google hits aren't everything, but that was the only real assertion of notability) Is he really notable? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 09:52, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Adam, I have subsequently learned that you had deleted a previous page on Robin Murphy. I was able to save a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Abridged/drafts" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Abridged/drafts" rel="nofollow">draft version</a> since it was deleted while I still was actively working on it and had it in cache. You can look at it and see what you think. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHatch68_1537.html" title="User:Hatch68">Hatch68</a> and the deleting Admin (who has quite a collection of pages on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bobo192/MAP" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bobo192/MAP" rel="nofollow">rugby players</a> he apparantly does find notable), did not even read the page they speedily deleted because the reason for speedy deletion that <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHatch68_1537.html" title="User:Hatch68">Hatch68</a> placed on the page was completely bogus. <a href="../../../a/b/r/User%7EAbridged_690f.html" title="User:Abridged">Abridged</a> 12:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, all I can say is that I agree with your comments wholeheartedly. I think he is actually a well known teacher, but there was a lot of hyperbole and worse. I am not sure there is much there worth saving. I'm not sure where he went to school undergrad. One bio says Michigan State and one says Ann Arbor so I just put "michigan" in the version I did. The Abha Light stuff--who knows? I'll google it. The newspaper interviews are kind of thin. The school thesis and scholarship probably not so relevant to mention, but maybe they should go back.

<dd>"Well-known" is a fairly woolly term, and for a given value of "well", he probably fits. But, "one of the most well-known"? No. To be honest, I'm distrustful of anything on that page, and would be more inclined to just make use of the links. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 18:44, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hey, Abridged, do you think it's worth fusing <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathic_proving.html" title="Homeopathic proving">Homeopathic proving</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathic_Materia_Medica_5ace.html" title="Homeopathic Materia Medica">Homeopathic Materia Medica</a> (and possibly <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathic_repertory.html" title="Homeopathic repertory">Homeopathic repertory</a>, which is a mixture of the Materia Medica and clinical experience, though merging it all into <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materia_Medica_8370.html" title="Materia Medica">Materia Medica</a>, which has large sections not on might be a bit far.</p>
<p>I ask mainly because the Materia Medica is a collection of Homeopathic proving reports, so the information about homeopathic proving is necessary to understand it anyway.</p>
<p>Oh, also, I merged <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathic_Materia_Medica_5ace.html" title="Homeopathic Materia Medica">Homeopathic Materia Medica</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materia_Medica_Pura_582d.html" title="Materia Medica Pura">Materia Medica Pura</a> - we can resplit 'em later, but it made sense to talk about the first homeopathic Materia Medica in the article about them, and M.M.P. was a very short article once you lost the listiness. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 23:30, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey there Adam, Proving, materia medica, and repertory all are fundamentally different topics each deserving their own article. They are all interrelated (as you note), but should have separate articles. I haven't really looked at them, so I don't know if they are good or not. Totally ok and a good idea to fuse the other two. I was thinking along the same lines, actually. <a href="../../../a/b/r/User%7EAbridged_690f.html" title="User:Abridged">Abridged</a> 23:36, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmm. One thought, though: <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathic_proving.html" title="Homeopathic proving">Homeopathic proving</a> will presumably expand and change eventually. Why don't we add in its current, short version to Materia Medica now (keeping it as an article), then let them diverge over time?

<dd>I think it is a bad idea. "Proving" is a basic methodology in homeopathy (and I haven't gotten around to looking at the article and working on it, but I soon will). Materia medica is a collection of description of remedies based on the proving reports and also on observations of patient cases. The place where "proving" and "materia medica" belong together is the larger homeopathy article (with callouts to their own articles), becuase they are part and parcel of the larger homeopathic method. Merging them into one article by themselves just doesn't work. Think merging and article on the "scientific method" with articles on results of various experiments done by using the method. Extreme example, but it just doesn't work. Please don't do it. Consider having some patience and letting the articles improve. I honestly applaud what you are doing to make the articles better, but I think you are going too far to merge and delete. The deletions cause problems when someone comes along to innocently write a new article on the subject and find it is immediately regarded as suspicitious becaue prior article was deleted (recent Robin Murphy situation). <a href="../../../a/b/r/User%7EAbridged_690f.html" title="User:Abridged">Abridged</a> <sup><strong class="selflink">talk</strong></sup> 16:30, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I looked at the article. It is pretty stubby, but I don't think is is really bad. It cites two standard texts; that is good. The last paragraph of course needs a cite. In placebo controlled trials of medicaions, the placebo folks will often have a response or side effects similar to the intervention group. This in itself is not interesting without a statistical analysis to see if the groups are sig different. And of course when authors get unexpected results they attempt to figure out why that is happening and explain this in terms that they know and understand. I think this is what the homoepaths are doing. It is a little funny from a standard scientific and medical perspective, however, I'll give you that&#160;:=). <a href="../../../a/b/r/User%7EAbridged_690f.html" title="User:Abridged">Abridged</a> <sup><strong class="selflink">talk</strong></sup> 16:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see where there may have been confusion. 'Round here, people (at least in practice) criticize articles, edits, categorization schemes, etc., but not other editors personally. Anyone saying that the article was "spammy" (and note that I was joking about the comment at the DRV and not saying that the article was spammy) was criticizing the article and not you as a person or even as a Wikipedian. Sometimes, however, that gets lost on newer users (hell, I've been guilty of getting offended myself). That is why we all spout the "assume good Fatah" mantra, as it is easier to just assume the best possible meaning of a comment and move on rather than tell the person what you really feel about them (which can be oh so tempting at times. Guy, for one, has made me want to pull my hair out at times, but he genuinely has the best interests of the project at heart. As for your article, I will give it a good look as soon as the DRv finishes (it will be restored, I imagine) and give it a spit polishing and offer you constructive criticism.

<dd>Sometimes admins go overboard (I'm sure that I have myself). We literally get thousands of new articles from new users every day that are either from people trying to sell their crappy home-published book or that say stuff like "mr roberts is the best teacher and is soooo cool. he also came up with all of the ideas for star wars." In defending the integruity of Wikipedia, we clean 'em out with a flamethrower. Sometimes, we go too far and, hence, DRV. I'm just glad that the whole experience hasn't turned you off.

<p>It looks good, and I believe there's interest. The NPOV'll be the hardest one to maintain, though. Have to watch the pages, as, well, it's not uncommon for someone to go in and weaken some criticism, change wording to remove or diminish the scientific point of view, etc. (For instance, the other day, some anonymous user claimed a homeopathic product ha d been allowed back on the market after having been yanked under advertising standards. Luckily, the Australian governmental webpage in question was very detailed about everything that department was looking into, so I could quickly disprove that as true, but... <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 22:30, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I totally agree about those articles 100%, but I dont' think there is any need to impose tight deadlines and I feel that adding the prod templates all over the place is a bit confrontational. I am concerned about the deletions becuase of what happened here: <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_March_26_d477.html#Robin_Murphy" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 March 26">Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 March 26#Robin Murphy</a>. I came along an innocently wrote a new article on this guy because I thought he should have one and BAMM! it was deleted in <b>3 minutes</b> (look at the logs; I'm not even kidding). The former deletion had raised a suspiction about the new article, but the new article was a pefectly reasonable stub. I don't think this really should happen again. Jain probably deserves an article--they are a huge publisher of homeopathic books in India and the books are used internationally, but of course Wikipedia shouldn't advertise. Why not take the Jain article down to a stub due to the reasonable concerns you raise rather than asking for the article to be deleted? I'll put some more info on Nash, but have some other items on my agenda as well. <a href="../../../a/b/r/User%7EAbridged_690f.html" title="User:Abridged">Abridged</a> <sup><strong class="selflink">talk</strong></sup> 13:54, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

The articles I prodded were short, abandoned articles that did not demonstrate notability, and rudimentary googling indicated that there were not reliable sources to be found.
