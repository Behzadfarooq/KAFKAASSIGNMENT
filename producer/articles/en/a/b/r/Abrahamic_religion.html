<p><b>Abrahamic religions</b> is a term of Islamic/Muslim origin<sup id="_ref-J.Smith98_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-J.Smith98" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Anidjar2001_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anidjar2001" title="">[2]</a></sup> adopted to designate the three <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monotheism.html" title="Monotheism">monotheistic</a> religions – <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a><sup id="_ref-J.Smith98_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-J.Smith98" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Anidjar2001_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anidjar2001" title="">[2]</a></sup> – which claim <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a> (Hebrew "Avraham" אַבְרָהָם&#160;; Arabic "Ibrahim" ابراهيم ) as a part of their sacred history. Other, smaller religions that identify with this tradition – such as <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaritanism.html" title="Samaritanism">Samaritanism</a> or the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Baha%27i_Faith_be4d.html" title="Baha'i Faith">Baha'i Faith</a> – are sometimes included, but more often omitted (see also <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparative_religion.html" title="Comparative religion">comparative religion</a>). A number of commonalities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam exist:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monotheism.html" title="Monotheism">Monotheism</a>. All three religions worship one <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> (though Jews and Muslims sometimes criticize the common Christian doctrine of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Trinity_1d2e.html" title="Holy Trinity">Holy Trinity</a> as polytheistic). Indeed, there exists among their followers a general understanding that they worship the same God.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet.html" title="Prophet">prophetic</a> tradition. All three religions recognize figures called "prophets," though their lists differ, as do their interpretations of the prophetic role.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic.html" title="Semitic">Semitic</a> origins. Judaism and Islam originated among Semitic peoples – namely the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arabs</a>, respectively – while Christianity arose out of Judaism.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A basis in divine <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelation.html" title="Revelation">revelation</a> rather than, for example, philosophical speculation or custom.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethical</a> orientation. All three religions speak of a choice between good and evil, which is conflated with obedience or disobedience to God.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A linear concept of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a>, beginning with the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_%28theology%29.html" title="Creation (theology)">Creation</a> and the concept that God works through history.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Association with the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert.html" title="Desert">desert</a>, which some commentators believe has imbued these religions with a particular ethos.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Devotion to the traditions found in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> and the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>, such as the stories of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam.html" title="Adam">Adam</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">Noah</a>, Abraham, and <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of these criteria are necessarily connected with Abraham, or with one another. For example, <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrianism.html" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a> is monotheistic, prophetic, ethical, revelatory, oriented toward history, and associated with the desert, though it is Indo-Iranian rather than Semitic, and does not identify with the characters and events of the Bible and Qur'an. The likelihood of Zoroastrian influence on the Abrahamic religions calls into question the appropriateness of the "Abrahamic" category as currently conceived. Meanwhile <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a> is monotheistic, ethical, revelatory, and arguably prophetic, though its origins are Indic rather than <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle Eastern</a>.</p>
<p>The choice of Abraham as a common label may stem from his reputation as the "Father of many" (which is the literal meaning of his name). Since he is claimed by Jewish tradition as the ancestor of the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israelite.html" title="Israelite">Israelites</a>, and his son <a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishmael.html" title="Ishmael">Ishmael</a> (Isma'il) by Muslim tradition as the ancestor of the Arabs, the phrase may be meant to suggest that all three religions come from one source. By harkening back to a time when the current religious divisions had not yet arisen, it may also have been intended to further the prospects of peace and/or reconciliation.</p>
<p>Adam, Noah, and Moses, are also common to all three religions. As for why we do not speak of an "Adamic", "Noachian", or "Mosaic" family, this may be for fear of confusion. Adam and Noah are said to be the ancestors of all humanity (though as named characters they are specific to the Biblical / Qur'anic tradition). Moses is closely associated with Judaism and, through Judaism, continuing into Christianity; Moses is regarded as a Prophet in Islam, but the term "Mosaic" may imply a genealogical lineage which the first Muslims -- being Arab -- did not share (e.g., descending from Ishmael). Thus, the scope suggested by the first two terms is larger than intended, while the third is too small.</p>
<p>Abrahamic religions account for more than half<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup> of the world's total religious adherents. Today, there are around 3.8 billion followers of various Abrahamic religions. Other, comparable religious groupings include the <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharmic_religion.html" title="Dharmic religion">Dharmic religions</a> of India, and the <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoic_religion.html" title="Taoic religion">Taoic religions</a> of East Asia - both terms being parallels of the 'Abrahamic' category.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrahamic_religion.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>All the Abrahamic religions are related to (or even derived from) <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> as practiced in ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah prior to the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonian_captivity_of_Judah_337f.html" title="Babylonian captivity of Judah">Babylonian Exile</a>, at the beginning of the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_millennium_BC_633f.html" title="1st millennium BC">1st millennium BC</a>. Many believe that Judaism in Biblical Israel was renovated and reformed to some extent in the <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century_BC_8011.html" title="6th century BC">6th century BC</a> by <a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra.html" title="Ezra">Ezra</a> and other priests returning to Israel from the exile. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaritanism.html" title="Samaritanism">Samaritanism</a> separated from <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> in the next few centuries. Noachide faith, see also <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noahide_Law_52e5.html" title="Noahide Law">Noahide Law</a>, is also based upon the faith of Abraham as revealed in the Torah/Bible, yet Noachides are not necessarily descendants of Abraham, although a Noachide might be of Abrahamic lineage through any of the children of Abraham, because there is no way of tracing this accurately the Noachide is determined by their ancestral connection to Noah, who was Abraham's ancestor. It is taught that Noah, and his son, Shem, who was Abraham's grandfather and also taught Abraham's son Yitzhak/Issac, was also monotheistic, however there is no evidence to show that they attempted to influence any one other than family members regard the elements of their faith. The <a href="../../../d/r/u/Druze.html" title="Druze">Druze</a> of northern Israel and southern Lebanon hold to Abrahmic faith of the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenant_%28biblical%29.html#Noahic_Covenant" title="Covenant (biblical)">Noachide covenant</a> through their ancestor Yitro/Jethro, the father-in-law of Moshe/Moses (Israel's greatest prophet).</p>
<p>Some Christian religions teach that <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> began with Adam, but that its teachings were rejected and were temporarily replaced with what we now call Judaism, to be restored at the coming of the Messiah. Others believe that Christianity actually originated in <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea.html" title="Judea">Judea</a>, at the end of the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_century.html" title="1st century">1st century</a> A.D., as a radically reformed branch of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> (see <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Christianity_6b3f.html" title="Early Christianity">Early Christianity</a>). Regardless, the Christianity of the common era spread to ancient <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Rome</a>, and from there to most of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>, the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a>, and many other parts of the world. Over the centuries, Christianity split into many separate churches and denominations. A major split in the <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_century.html" title="5th century">5th century</a> separated various <a href="../../../o/r/i/Oriental_Orthodoxy_723b.html" title="Oriental Orthodoxy">Oriental Churches</a> from the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> church centered in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>. Other major splits were the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East-West_Schism_75cd.html" title="East-West Schism">East-West Schism</a> in the <a href="../../../1/1/t/11th_century.html" title="11th century">11th century</a>, separating the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> from the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_f7f5.html" title="Eastern Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> Churches; and the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> of the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a>, that gave birth to hundreds of independent <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> denominations.</p>
<p><a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> originated in the <a href="../../../7/t/h/7th_century.html" title="7th century">7th century</a>, in the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabia.html" title="Arabia">Arabian</a> cities of <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a>. Although not a dissident branch of either <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, Muslims believe it to be a continuation and replacement for them. According to the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>, holy book of Islam, that book was the final word of God and its message was that of all the prophets. As an example of the similarities between the faiths, Muslims believe in a version of the story of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> and in the lineal descent of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arabs</a> from Abraham through <a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishmael.html" title="Ishmael">Ishmael</a>, who was conceived through Abraham's servant <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagar.html" title="Hagar">Hagar</a>.</p>

<li>For Christians, Abraham is a spiritual forebear rather than a direct ancestor. For example, Christian iconography depicts him as an early witness to the Trinity in the form of three "angels" who visited him (the Hospitality of Abraham). In Christian belief, Abraham is a model of faith, and his intention to obey God by offering up Isaac is seen as a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreshadowing.html" title="Foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a> of God's offering of his son, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>.

<p><a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>'s origins—along with those of the ancestral Abrahamic religion—are still obscure. The only source generally agreed by all to be canonical that bears on that question is the Genesis book of the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, which according to Rabbinic tradition was written by <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> and received by <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a> after the <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exodus.html" title="Exodus">Exodus</a> from <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, sometime in the <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_millennium_BC_b088.html" title="2nd millennium BC">2nd millennium BC</a>.

<p>There are six notable figures in the Bible prior to Abraham: <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_and_Eve_6ed9.html" title="Adam and Eve">Adam and Eve</a>, their two sons <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cain.html" title="Cain">Cain</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abel.html" title="Abel">Abel</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/o/Enoch.html" title="Enoch">Enoch</a>, and his great-grandson, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">Noah</a>, who, according to the story, saved his own family and all animal life in <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Ark_8421.html" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a>. It is uncertain whether any of them (assuming they existed) left any recorded <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_code.html" title="Moral code">moral code</a>: some Christian churches maintain faith in ancient books like the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Enoch_2b5d.html" title="Book of Enoch">Book of Enoch</a> — and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> mentions the <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noahide_Laws_3e06.html" title="Noahide Laws">Noahide Laws</a> given by God to the family of Noah. For the most part, these 'patriarchs' serve as good (or bad, in the case of Cain) role models of behavior, without a more specific indication of how one interprets their actions in any <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Genesis_35b0.html" title="Book of Genesis">Book of Genesis</a>, Abraham is specifically instructed to leave <i>Ur of the Chaldees</i> so that God will "make of you a great nation". <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burton_Visotzky_2400.html" title="Burton Visotzky">Burton Visotzky</a>, an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethicist.html" title="Ethicist">ethicist</a>, wrote <i>Genesis of Ethics</i> to explore the detailed implications of these adventures for a modern <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethics</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the patriarch <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a> (or <i><a href="../../../i/b/r/Ibrahim.html" title="Ibrahim">Ibrahim</a></i>, in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>) had eight sons by three wives: one (<a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishmael.html" title="Ishmael">Ishmael</a>) by his wife's servant <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagar.html" title="Hagar">Hagar</a>, one (<a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac.html" title="Isaac">Isaac</a>) by his wife <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah.html" title="Sarah">Sarah</a>, and six by another wife <a href="../../../k/e/t/Keturah.html" title="Keturah">Keturah</a>. Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h.html" title="Bahá'u'lláh">Bahá'u'lláh</a> and other prominent figures are all claimed to be descendants of Abraham through one of these sons.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> see Abraham as the progenitor of the people of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, through his descendants <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac.html" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob.html" title="Jacob">Jacob</a>. Christians view Abraham as an important exemplar of faith, and a spiritual, as well as a physical, ancestor of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> — a Jew considered the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_God_bcd3.html" title="Son of God">Son of God</a> through whom God promised to bless all the families of the earth. In addition, Muslims refer to <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabeans.html" title="Sabeans">Sabeans</a>, Christians and Jews as <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_of_the_Book_3f79.html" title="People of the Book">People of the Book</a> ("the Book" referring to the Tanakh, the New Testament, and the Qur'an). They see Abraham as one of the most important of the many prophets sent by God. Thus Abraham represents for some, a point of commonality whom they seek to emphasize by means of this terminology.</p>
<p>So, rather than being the sole "founding figure", Abraham is described as the first figure in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> who (a) is clearly not of direct divine origin, such as Adam and Eve are claimed to be; (b) is accepted by three major monotheistic faiths as playing some major role in the founding of their common civilization; and (c) is not claimed as the male genetic forebear of all humans on the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> (as <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">Noah</a> is, in more literal interpretations).</p>
<p>Judaism treats Adam and Noah as minor <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet.html" title="Prophet">prophets</a>, while, along with Islam, it recognizes that there were possibly other prophets who are unknown today.</p>

<p>Jewish theology is based on the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, where the nature and commandments of God are revealed through the writings of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a>, the <i><a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a></i>, and the writings of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet.html" title="Prophet">prophets</a>, <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalm.html" title="Psalm">psalmists</a> and other ancient canonized scriptures, together with the Torah known as the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>. Additionally, it usually has a basis in its <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_Law_deef.html" title="Oral Law">Oral Law</a>, as recorded in the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishnah.html" title="Mishnah">Mishnah</a> and Gemora which form the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a>.</p>
<p>This Supreme Being is referred to in the Hebrew Bible in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_name_of_God_in_Judaism_fe2c.html" title="The name of God in Judaism">several ways</a>, such as <i>Elohim</i>, <i>Adonai</i> or by the four Hebrew letters "Y-H-V (or W) -H" (the <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetragrammaton.html" title="Tetragrammaton">tetragrammaton</a>), which observant Jews do not pronounce as a word. The Hebrew words <i>Eloheynu</i> (Our God) and <a href="../../../h/a/s/HaShem_5266.html" title="HaShem">HaShem</a> (The Name), as well as the English names "Lord" and "God", are also used in modern day Judaism. The latter is sometimes written "G-d" in reference to the taboo against pronouncing the tetragrammaton.</p>
<p>The word "Elohim" has the Hebrew plural ending "-īm", which some Biblical scholars have taken as support for the general notion that the ancient Hebrews were polytheists in the time of the patriarchs; however, as the word itself is used with singular verbs, this hypothesis is not accepted by most Jews. Jews point out other words in Hebrew that are used in the same manner according to the rule of <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html#Grammar" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew Grammar</a>, and denotes respect, majesty and deliberation, similar to the royal plural in English and ancient Egyptian, and the use of the plural form <i>"vous"</i> for individuals of higher standing in modern French. Jewish Biblical scholars and historical commentary on the passage also suggest that Elohim in the plural form points to God in conjunction with the heavenly court, i.e. the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angels.html" title="Angels">angels</a>. The pre-Christian era and early CE period Kabbalistic and later in the European Chasidic movements after the Baal Shem Tov, such as Breslov and Chabad, all point to the use of Elo<s>k</s>im as denoting the multidimensional existence of God on, in, and through every possible dimension of the created existence. See Likutei Moharan and the Tanya, as well as the Zohar, Bahir, and the Kabbalistic texts of Sefer Yitzirah, Sefer Refayim, and Sefer Malachim, to name a few. Including the writings of the Ramchal (R. Moshe Chaim Luzzatto), Drech HaShem and others such as the Rashbi (R. Shimon bar Yochai, author of the Zohar) all explain the use of the Elo<s>k</s>im as a pluralistic singularity, one essence sustaining all levels of creation from the mundane physical to the sublime and Holy spiritual.</p>

<p>Christians believe that the God worshipped by the faithful Hebrew people of the pre-Christian era has always revealed himself as he did through <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a>; but this was never obvious until the Word of the Lord, the revelation of God, became flesh and dwelt among us (see John 1). Also, despite the fact that the Angel of the Lord spoke to the Patriarchs, revealing God to them, it has always been only by the Spirit of God granting them understanding, that men have been able to perceive afterward that they had been visited by God himself. After Jesus was raised from the dead—according to Christian scriptures—this ancient Hebrew witness of how God reveals himself as <i>Messiah</i> came to be seen in a very different light. It was then that Jesus' followers began to speak widely of him as God himself (see John 20:28), although this had already been revealed to certain individuals during his Ministry, for example, the Samaritan woman in Shechem, and his closest apostles.</p>
<p>This belief was gradually developed into the modern formulation of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>, which is the doctrine that God is a single holy God (<a href="../../../y/h/w/YHWH_e7ed.html" title="YHWH">YHWH</a>), but that there is a real threeness in God's single being that has always been evident but not understood. This mysterious threeness has been described as, for want of better terms, <i>hypostases</i> in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek language</a> (<i>subsistences</i>), and as "persons" in English. In the traditional Christian conception, God the Father has only ever been revealed through his eternal Word (who was born as Jesus, of the Virgin Mary), and his Spirit (who after the resurrection was given to men, establishing the Christian church).</p>
<p>Trinitarian theology is developed from the Christian <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> (comprised by the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New</a> Testaments). As it was further elaborated by the early Church fathers, it was later codified by the <a href="../../../e/c/u/Ecumenical_council.html" title="Ecumenical council">Ecumenical councils</a> at <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Council_of_Nicaea_a44c.html" title="First Council of Nicaea">Nicaea</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Chalcedon_1cd3.html" title="Council of Chalcedon">Chalcedon</a>. Another famous formulation is called the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athanasian_Creed_efbe.html" title="Athanasian Creed">Athanasian Creed</a>. Some Trinitarian churches, however, do not accept the Chalcedon council at all, in part because it claimed to have excommunicated them. These are known as 'non-Chalcedonian', or <a href="../../../o/r/i/Oriental_Orthodox_4ce0.html" title="Oriental Orthodox">Oriental Orthodox</a> Churches.</p>
<p>This "trinitarian monotheism" has been rejected by <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nontrinitarianism.html" title="Nontrinitarianism">several Christian denominations and Christian-based religions</a>, such as <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arianism.html" title="Arianism">Arianism</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitarianism.html" title="Unitarianism">Unitarianism</a>. Strict unitarian Christians believe that God the Father is the only divine being, but the others believe that Jesus is a created deity. Another minority viewpoint is that the personality expressed in earthly mainifestation as Jesus is in fact that of the one-and-only God; this belief system is usually described as <a href="../../../o/n/e/Oneness_Pentecostal_3d95.html" title="Oneness Pentecostal">Oneness Pentecostal</a> and is largely found in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>.</p>

<p>The belief in the Oneness of God is central to the Bahá'í Faith. According to Bahá'í doctrine, God is one being, and has created all the creatures and forces in the universe. He is also imagined by Bahá'ís as omnipotent and omniscient. In order to educate humanity, Bahá'ís believe that God sends his messengers to humanity. These messengers are known in Bahá'í literature as "<a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifestations_of_God_80e1.html" title="Manifestations of God">Manifestations of God</a>," the most recent of whom Bahá'ís believe was <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h.html" title="Bahá'u'lláh">Bahá'u'lláh</a>. According to Bahá'í doctrine, these Manifestations reveal the nature and will of God in their teachings and through sacred texts, which (for Bahá'ís) include the Torah, the Christian Bible, the Qur'án, the <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kit%C3%A1b-i-Aqdas_384d.html" title="Kitáb-i-Aqdas">Aqdas</a> and the <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kit%C3%A1b-i-%C3%8Dq%C3%A1n_39ff.html" title="Kitáb-i-Íqán">Book of Certitude</a>, and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> scriptures. Bahá'ís maintain that the older texts contain allegories that should be interpreted in view of the most recent (and most perfect) revelations. However, Bahá'í doctrine teaches that the Supreme Deity is too great to be fully understood by humans.</p>

<p>The sacred scriptures of most Christian sects are the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>, which is largely the same as the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, which comprises four accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus (the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Gospels_aa2f.html" title="Four Gospels">Four Gospels</a>, traditionally attributed to his <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Apostles_56fc.html" title="Twelve Apostles">apostles</a> <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_the_Evangelist_83d8.html" title="Matthew the Evangelist">Matthew</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Evangelist_a628.html" title="John the Evangelist">John</a> and to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_the_Evangelist_b86a.html" title="Mark the Evangelist">Mark the Evangelist</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_the_Evangelist_2172.html" title="Luke the Evangelist">Luke the Evangelist</a>) and several writings by the apostles and early Fathers such as <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">Paul</a>. They are usually considered to be <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inspiration.html" title="Biblical inspiration">divinely inspired</a> in some sense and together comprise the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Christian Bible</a>. Thus Christians consider the fundamental teachings of the Old Testament, in particular the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_Commandments_716e.html" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a>, as valid, although most reject the <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabbath.html" title="Sabbath">Sabbath</a>; however they believe that the coming of Jesus as the messiah and savior of mankind as predicted in the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>, and the fact that Jesus was raised Jewish and became a teacher of Judaism, would shed light on the true relationship between God and mankind — by restoring the emphasis of universal love and compassion (as mentioned in the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shema.html" title="Shema">Shema</a>) above the other commandments, by de-emphasising the more "<a href="../../../l/e/g/Legalism_%28theology%29.html" title="Legalism (theology)">legalistic</a>" and material precepts of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosaic_Law_c43a.html" title="Mosaic Law">Mosaic Law</a> (such as the dietary constraints and temple rites). Many Christians believe that the link between Old and New Testaments in the Bible means that Judaism has been <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supersessionism.html" title="Supersessionism">superseded</a> by Christianity as the "new Israel" — and some hold that Jesus' teachings described Israel not as a geographic place but as an association with God and promise of salvation in heaven.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Christian religions (generally including <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_Church_72f2.html" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Orthodox Christianity</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglicans.html" title="Anglicans">Anglicans</a> and most forms of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>, but not <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restorationism.html" title="Restorationism">Restorationism</a>) derive their beliefs from the conclusions reached by the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Nicea_d0cb.html" title="Council of Nicea">Council of Nicea</a> in <a href="../../../3/2/5/325.html" title="325">325</a>, in a document known as the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene_Creed_e8a2.html" title="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creed</a>. This describes the beliefs that <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> (as a <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a> of distinct persons with one substance) became human on earth, born as <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> pursuant to the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> scriptures, was crucified by humanity, died and was buried, only to be resurrected on the third day, then to rise and enter the Kingdom of Heaven and "sit at the right hand of" God. Christians generally believe that faith in <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> is the only way to achieve salvation and to enter into <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">heaven</a>, and that salvation is a gift given by the grace of God.</p>
<p>Christians recognize that the Gospels were passed on by oral tradition only to be set to paper decades after the death of Jesus, and that the extant versions are only copies of those originals. Indeed, the version of the Bible considered to be most valid (in the sense of best conveying the true meaning of the word of God) has varied considerably: the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulgate.html" title="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>, the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_of_the_Bible_1536.html" title="King James Version of the Bible">King James Version</a>, and the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian</a> Synodal Bible have been authoritative to different communities at different times. In particular, Christians usually consult the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> version of the Old Testament when preparing new translations, although some believe that the Septuagint should be preferred, as it was the Bible of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Christian_69b2.html" title="Early Christian">Early Christian</a> Church, and because they believe its translators used a different Hebrew bible to the ones that make up the current Masoretic Hebrew text as there are some variant readings of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_Scrolls_dfda.html" title="Dead Sea Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a> that are confirmed by the Septuagint. In the same sense that the Jewish mystics viewed the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> as something living and existing prior to any written text, so too do Christians view the Bible and Jesus himself as God's "<a href="../../../w/o/r/Word.html" title="Word">Word</a>" (or <i><a href="../../../l/o/g/Logos.html" title="Logos">logos</a></i> in Greek), that transcends written documents.</p>
<p>The sacred scriptures of the Christian Bible are complemented by a large body of writings by individual Christians and councils of Christian leaders. Some Christian churches and denominations consider certain additional writings to be binding; other Christian groups consider only the Bible to be binding.</p>

<p><a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>'s holiest book is the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>, comprised of 114 <a href="../../../s/u/r/Sura.html" title="Sura">suras</a> ("chapters of the Qur'an.").

According to the Qur'an (and mainstream Muslim belief) the verses of the Quran were revealed from God through the Archangel <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabriel.html" title="Gabriel">Gabriel</a> to the Prophet <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> on separate occasions. These revelations were written down during <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>'s lifetime and collected into one official copy in <a href="../../../6/3/3/633.html" title="633">633</a> AD, one year after his death. Finally the Quran was given its present order in <a href="../../../6/5/3/653.html" title="653">653</a> AD by the <a href="../../../u/t/h/Uthman_ibn_Affan_8dbc.html" title="Uthman ibn Affan">third Caliph</a>.</p>
<p>The Qur'an mentions and reveres several of the Israelite Prophets, including <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html#Islamic_views" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, amongst others (see also: <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophets_of_Islam_5eee.html" title="Prophets of Islam">Prophets of Islam</a>). The stories of these Prophets are very similar to those in the Bible. However the detailed precepts of the Tanakh and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> are not adopted outright; they are replaced by the new commandments revealed directly by God (through Gabriel) to Muhammad and codified in the Qur'an.</p>
<p>Like the Jews with the Torah, Muslims consider the original <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> text of the Qur'an as uncorrupted and holy to the last letter, and any translations are considered to be interpretations of the meaning of the Qur'an, as only the original Arabic text is considered to be the divine scripture.</p>
<p>Like the Rabbinic <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_Law_deef.html" title="Oral Law">Oral Law</a> to the Hebrew Bible, the Qur'an is complemented by the <i><a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a></i>, a set of books by later authors that record the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. The Hadith interpret and elaborate Qur'anic precepts. There is no consensus within Islam on the authority of the Hadith collections, but Islamic scholars have categorized each Hadith at one of the following levels of authenticity or <a href="../../../i/s/n/Isnad.html" title="Isnad">isnad</a>: genuine (<i>sahih</i>), fair (<i>hasan</i>), or weak (<i>da'if</i>). Amongst Shia Muslims, no hadith is regarded as Sahih, and hadith in general are only accepted if there is no disagreement with the Qur'an.</p>
<p>By the ninth century, six collections of Hadiths were accepted as reliable to Sunni Muslims. Shia Muslims however, refer to an alternate tradition of authenticated Hadiths.</p>
<p>The Sunni Collections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Bukhari_1c99.html" title="Al-Bukhari">al-Bukhari</a> (d. 870)</li>

<p>Most Abrahamic religions agree that a human being comprises the body, which dies, and the soul, which need not do so. The soul, capable of remaining alive beyond human death, carries the essence of that person with it, and God will judge that person's life accordingly after they die. The importance of this, the focus on it, and the precise criteria and end result differs between religions.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">Reincarnation</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmigration.html" title="Transmigration">transmigration</a> tend not to feature prominently in Abrahamic religions. Although as a rule they all look to some form of afterlife, Christianity and Islam support a continuation of life, usually viewed as eternal, rather than reincarnation and transmigration which are a return (or repeated returns) to this Earth or some other <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_plane.html" title="Physical plane">plane</a> to live a complete new life cycle over again. Kabbalic Judaism, however, accepts the concept of returning in new births through a process called <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilgul_neshamot.html" title="Gilgul neshamot">gilgul neshamot</a>, but this is not Torah-derived, and is usually studied only among scholars and mystics within the faith.

<p>Judaism's views on the afterlife ("the World to Come") are quite diverse and its discussion is not encouraged. This can be attributed to the fact that even though there clearly are traditions in the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> of an afterlife (see <a href="../../../n/a/b/Naboth.html" title="Naboth">Naboth</a> and the <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch_of_Endor_c880.html" title="Witch of Endor">Witch of Endor</a>), Judaism focuses on this life and how to lead a holy life to please God, rather than future reward, and its attitude can be mostly summed up by the rabbinical observation that at the start of Genesis God clothed the naked (Adam and Eve), at the end of Deuteronomy He buried the dead (<a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a>), the Children of Israel mourned for 40 days, then got on with their lives.</p>
<p>Many feel that there is some sort of afterlife, maybe a return of the soul to God, some say that there is some sort of reward for the righteous in Gan ‘Edhen (the Garden of Eden) and (less agreed upon) punishment in Ge-Hinnom. Popularly it is claimed that the maximum time of punishment for all but the most evil is one year. The mystically inclined also claim the souls (or sparks of souls) may be reincarnated, through <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilgul.html" title="Gilgul">Gilgul</a>. If there is an afterlife all agree in Judaism that the good of all the nations will get to heaven and this is one of the reasons Judaism does not normally <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proselytize.html" title="Proselytize">proselytize</a>.</p>

<p>In Islam, God is said to be "Most Compassionate and Most Merciful" (Quran 1:1). However God is also "Most Just", Islam prescribes a literal <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html#Islam" title="Hell">Hell</a> for those who disobey God and commit gross sin. Those who obey God and submit to God will be rewarded with their own place in Paradise. While sinners are punished with fire, there are also many other forms of punishment described, depending on the sin committed; Hell is divided into numerous levels, an idea that found its way into Christian literature through <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dante_Alighieri_bba0.html" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante</a>'s borrowing of Muslim themes and tropes for his <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Divine_Comedy_73d7.html#Inferno" title="The Divine Comedy">Inferno</a>.</p>
<p>Those who worship and remember God are promised eternal abode in a physical and spiritual Paradise. In Islam, Heaven is divided into numerous <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levels.html" title="Levels">levels</a>, with the higher levels of Paradise being the reward of those who have been more virtuous, For example, the highest levels might contain the Prophets, those killed for believing, those who help orphans, and those who never tell a lie (among numerous other categories cited in the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a>).</p>
<p>Upon repentance to God, many sins can be forgiven as God is said to be the most Merciful. Additionally, those who ultimately believe in God, but have led sinful lives, may be punished for a time, and then ultimately released into Paradise. If anyone dies in a state of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirk_%28polytheism%29.html" title="Shirk (polytheism)">Shirk</a> (the association God in any way, such as claiming that He is equal with anything or worshiping other than Him), then it is possible he will stay forever in Hell; however, it is said that anyone with "one atom of faith" will eventually reach Heaven, and Muslim literature also records reference to even the greatly sinful, Muslim and otherwise, eventually being pardoned and released into Paradise.</p>
<p>Once a person is admitted to Paradise, this person will abide there for eternity.</p>

Accordingly, Bahá'ís view life as a preparatory stage, where one can develop and perfect those qualities which will be needed in the next life.<sup id="_ref-lafd_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lafd" title="">[4]</a></sup> The key to spiritual progress is to follow the path outlined by the current <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifestations_of_God_80e1.html" title="Manifestations of God">Manifestations of God</a>, which Bahá'ís believe is currently Bahá'u'lláh.</p>

<p>Worship, ceremonies, and religion-related customs differ substantially between the various Abrahamic religions. Among the few similarities are a seven-day cycle in which one day is nominally reserved for worship, prayer, or other religious activities; this custom is related to the Biblical story of Genesis, where God created the universe in six days, and rested in the seventh. Islam, which has Friday as a day for special congregational prayers, does not subscribe to the 'resting day' concept.</p>

<p>Christianity does not have any sacrificial rites as such, but its entire theology is based upon the concept of the sacrifice by God of his son <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> so that his blood might atone for mankind's sins. However, offerings to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Churches_08f5.html" title="Christian Churches">Christian Churches</a> and charity to poor are highly encouraged and take the place of sacrifice. Additionally, self-sacrifice in the form of lent, penitence and humbleness, in the name of Christ and according to his commandments (cf. <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>), is considered a form of sacrifice that appeals God.</p>
<p>The followers of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, Muslims, are to observe the <a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_Pillars_of_Islam_b5aa.html" title="Five Pillars of Islam">Five Pillars of Islam</a>. The first pillar is the belief in the oneness of God and in Muhammad as His final prophet. The second is to pray five times daily (<a href="../../../s/a/l/Salat.html" title="Salat">salat</a>) towards the direction (<a href="../../../q/i/b/Qibla.html" title="Qibla">qibla</a>) of the <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaaba.html" title="Kaaba">Kaaba</a> in <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a>. The third pillar is Zakah, is a portion of one’s wealth that must be given to the poor or to other specified causes, which means the giving of a specific share of one’s wealth and savings to persons or causes that Allah (God) mentions in the Qur’an. The normal share to be paid is two and a half percent of one’s saved earnings. and for able-bodied Muslims to <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast.html" title="Fast">fast</a> in the month of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramadan.html" title="Ramadan">Ramadan</a>. <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fasting.html" title="Fasting">Fasting</a> is the fourth pillar of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. Finally, Muslims are also urged to undertake a <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajj.html" title="Hajj">pilgrimage</a>, to <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a> at least once in one's life. During this pilgrimage, the Muslims spend several days in worship, repenting and most notably, circumambulating the <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaaba.html" title="Kaaba">Kaaba</a> among millions of other Muslims. At the end of the <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajj.html" title="Hajj">Hajj</a>, sheep and other permissible animals are slaughtered to commemorate the moment when God (Arabic:Allah) replaced Abraham's (Arabic:Ibrahim) son, <a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishmael.html" title="Ishmael">Ishmael</a> with a sheep preventing his sacrifice. The meat from these animals is then distributed around the world to needy Muslims, neighbors and relatives.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/a/h/Baha%27i_Faith_be4d.html" title="Baha'i Faith">Baha'is</a> do not have a strict worship regimen but do, however, follow guidelines for prayer passed on by <a href="../../../b/a/h/Baha%27u%27llah.html" title="Baha'u'llah">Baha'u'llah</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdu%27l_Baha_2a69.html" title="Abdu'l Baha">Abdu'l Baha</a>.

Many Baha'is also host devotional meetings in their homes where prayers and holy writings are read, sung, chanted or recited. Baha'i Devotional meetings are commonly open to people of any faith. A <a href="../../../b/a/h/Baha%27i_pilgrimage.html" title="Baha'i pilgrimage">Baha'i pilgrimage</a> was laid out by Baha'u'llah, but political conditions in Iraq and Iran prevent most Baha'is from visiting these locations.

It should also be noted that aside from prayer and pilgrimage, Baha'is put emphasis on grounding worship in daily life. Work is considered a form of honoring God as is scriptural study.</p>

<p>Both Judaism and Islam prescribe <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a> for males as a token symbol of dedication to the religion.

<p>Judaism and Islam have strict <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dietary_laws.html" title="Dietary laws">dietary laws</a>, with lawful food being called <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosher.html" title="Kosher">kosher</a> in Judaism and <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halaal.html" title="Halaal">halaal</a> in Islam.

Halaal restrictions can be seen as a subset of the <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashrut.html" title="Kashrut">kashrut</a> dietary laws, so many kosher foods are considered halaal; especially in the case of meat, which Islam prescribes must be slaughtered in the name of God. Catholic Christianity developed ritual prohibitions against the consumption of meat (but not fish) on Fridays, and the Christian calendars prescribe abstinence from some foods at various times of the year; but these customs vary from place to place, and have changed over time, and some sects have nothing comparable. Some Christians oppose the consumption of alcoholic beverages, while a few Christians also follow a kosher diet, sometimes identified as a "<a href="../../../w/h/a/What_would_Jesus_do__56b3.html" title="What would Jesus do?">What Would Jesus Eat</a>?" diet.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrahamic_religion.html" title="Edit section: Sexuality in Abrahamic religions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sexuality in Abrahamic religions</span></h2>
<p>It may be that a distinguishing characteristic of the Abrahamic religions is their generally negative stance on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoophilia.html" title="Zoophilia">zoophilia</a> and, in some cases, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sexuality.html" title="Human sexuality">human sexuality</a> in general, notably outside of marriage and in non-procreative contexts. This contrasts the Abrahamic traditions strongly against the backdrop of the views of their immediate neighbors. In the regions surrounding the geographical homelands of Abrahamic religions (i.e. the <a href="../../../n/e/a/Near_east.html" title="Near east">Near east</a> and <a href="../../../a/e/g/Aegean_Sea_b508.html" title="Aegean Sea">Aegean</a>), sexuality was considered in a more positive light (positive in the sense that it was not recommended by their Non-Abrahamic religions to legislate death punishments for the practices of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a>.)</p>
<p>It seems to be a mark among some versions of the rise of Abrahamic traditions that all sexuality was eliminated from the concept of the divine. Notable exceptions include Judaism (i.e. <a href="../../../s/o/n/Song_of_Songs_bf66.html" title="Song of Songs">Song of Songs</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hassidism.html" title="Hassidism">Hassidism</a>), <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a> and within <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>.</p>
<p>By the time of the triumph of Christianity, in the late 4th century CE this was generally true throughout the realms of the declining <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>. For example, within territories where Christianity and Judaism held political power the presence of femininity in local deities as well as the Godhead was eliminated. Contrastingly, the Non-Abrahamic religions accepted female high-priestesses. They also believed in the existence of many powerful female divinities like <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athena.html" title="Athena">Athena</a>, the Greek goddess of wisdom, and <a href="../../../i/s/i/Isis.html" title="Isis">Isis</a>, who was worshipped as the archetypal wife and mother. In general Abrahamic Religions negate the possibility of sexual openness with respect to the divine nature.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrahamic_religion.html" title="Edit section: Homosexuality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Homosexuality</span></h3>
<p>Many of the sacred texts of the Abrahamic Religions refer to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> behavior as an abomination, deriving from the Holiness Code of the book of <a href="../../../l/e/v/Leviticus.html" title="Leviticus">Leviticus</a> and an interpretation of the legend of <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodom_and_Gomorrah_832d.html" title="Sodom and Gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a>. By the first century, the writings of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philo_Judaeus_e0d0.html" title="Philo Judaeus">Philo Judaeus</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavius_Josephus_3997.html" title="Flavius Josephus">Flavius Josephus</a> evolved it into a fully developed form. Thus the condemnation of homosexuality in all Abrahamic religions has a single <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> source in addition to any separate reference in other holy books. While the Abrahamic religions unequivocally condemn male <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbianism.html" title="Lesbianism">lesbianism</a> is nowhere explicitly mentioned in the Old Testament, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, or the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>; though some scholars have argued the passage in <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Romans_ce93.html" title="Epistle to the Romans">Romans</a> 1:26, "Their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural," is a reference to it.</p>
<p>The enforcement of this prohibition took different forms in each religion. Early Judaism referenced <a href="../../../l/e/v/Leviticus.html" title="Leviticus">Leviticus</a> and later <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmudic</a> law in prescribing the death penalty. However, high legal hurdles, such as requiring two witnesses of the act following a previous warning by at least two people, made executions extremely rare. Early Christian emperors also advocated the death penalty: <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodosius_I_297b.html" title="Theodosius I">Theodosius I</a> ordained death by the sword, and the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Byzantine_Emperors_ea55.html" title="List of Byzantine Emperors">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justinian.html" title="Justinian">Justinian</a>, in his summary on Roman law, prescribed burning at the stake. Islamic jurists prescribe a death by stoning or crushing with a wall; however, this has almost never been enforced.</p>

<p>Christianity encourages <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelism.html" title="Evangelism">evangelism</a> — convincing others to convert to the religion; many Christian organizations, especially <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> churches, send <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionary.html" title="Missionary">missionaries</a> to non-Christian communities throughout the world. See also <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Commission_a9b6.html" title="Great Commission">Great Commission</a>.</p>
<p>Forced conversions to Catholicism have been documented at various points throughout history. The most prominently cited allegations are the conversions of the pagans after Constantine; of Muslims, Jews and Eastern Orthodox during the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusades.html" title="Crusades">Crusades</a>; of Jews and Muslims during the time of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Inquisition_6caf.html" title="Spanish Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a> where they were offered the choice exile, conversion or death; and of the Aztecs by <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hernan_Cortes_ffbb.html" title="Hernan Cortes">Hernan Cortes</a>. Many <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> organizations in India allege that some Christian missionaries in India are converting the illiterate <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalit_%28outcaste%29.html" title="Dalit (outcaste)">Dalits</a> (the so-called low castes of the Hindus) by "fraudulent means" (sic). Forced conversions are condemned as sinful by major denominations such as the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, which officially state that forced conversions pollute the Christian religion and offend human dignity, so that past or present offenses are regarded as a scandal (a cause of unbelief). <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>W. Heffening states that in Qur'an "the apostate is threatened with punishment in the next world only" however "in traditions, there is little echo of these punishments in the next world ... and instead, we have in many traditions a new element, the death penalty."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[6]</a></sup> Heffening states that Shafi'is interpret verse <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.217" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.217" rel="nofollow">2:217</a> as adducing the main evidence for the death penalty in Qur'an. The <i>Qur'an</i> has a chapter (<i>Sura</i>) dealing with non believers (called "<i>Al-Kafiroon</i>") (<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/109.qmt.html" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/109.qmt.html" rel="nofollow">Q 109</a>). In the chapter there is also an often quoted verse (<i>ayat</i>) which reads, "There is no compulsion in religion, the path of guidance stands out clear from error" [2:256] and [60:8]. This means that no one is to be compelled into Islam and that the righteous path is distinct from the rest. According to this verse, converts to Islam are ones that see this path. The Muslim expansion during the <a href="../../../u/m/m/Ummayad.html" title="Ummayad">Ummayad</a> dynasty held true to this teaching, affording second-class citizenship to <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_of_the_Book_3f79.html" title="People of the Book">People of the Book</a> instead of forced conversion. Nevertheless, it should be noted that pagan Arab tribes were given the choice of 'Islam or the sword.'<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[7]</a></sup> Another notable exception is the en masse forced conversion of the Jews of Mashhad in 1839. In the present day, Islam does not have <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionary.html" title="Missionary">missionaries</a> comparable to Christianity, though it does encourage its followers to learn about other religions and to teach others about Islam.</p>
<p>While Judaism accepts converts, it does not encourage them, and has no <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionary.html" title="Missionary">missionaries</a> as such. Only a few forced conversions to Judiasm have been recorded for example the Idumeans, were forced into conversion to Judaism by the Hasmonean kings. However Judaism states that non-Jews can achieve righteousness by following <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noahide_Laws_3e06.html" title="Noahide Laws">Noahide Laws</a>, a set of seven universal commandments that non-Jews are expected to follow. In this context the <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rambam.html" title="Rambam">Rambam</a> (Rabbi <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses_Maimonides_1735.html" title="Moses Maimonides">Moses Maimonides</a>, one of the major Jewish teachers) commented, "Quoting from our sages, the righteous people from other nations have a place in the world to come, if they have acquired what they should learn about the Creator." Because the commandments applicable to the Jews are much more detailed and onerous than Noahide laws, Jewish scholars have traditionally maintained that it is better to be a good non-Jew than a bad Jew, thus discouraging conversion. Most often, converts to Judaism are those who marry Jews; in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, the number of such converts is estimated at 10,000-15,000 per year. See also <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conversion_to_Judaism_06dd.html" title="Conversion to Judaism">Conversion to Judaism</a>.</p>
<p>The Baha'i Faith puts special emphasis on not proselytizing. It is actually prohibited. Baha'is do accept converts from all religious and ethnic backgrounds and actively support personal investigation into faith. Baha'is have special "pioneers" and "traveling teachers" that will move to areas where Baha'i communities are small to help strengthen and expand them. Believers of other faiths are held in high regard and seen in many ways as spiritual equals. While Baha'is view the Baha'i laws and revelation as unique, they do not discourage believers of other faiths in their spiritual endeavors and are leaders of interfaith efforts.</p>
