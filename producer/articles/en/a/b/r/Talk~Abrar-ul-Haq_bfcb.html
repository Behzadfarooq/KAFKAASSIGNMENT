<p>Okay, I've added Gurmukhi in addition to Shahmukhi because Abrar-ul-Haq is popular throughout the Punjab region and is not restricted to Pakistani Punjab.

<p>Using Gurmukhi implies that he can read and write Gurmukhi and he blongs to India. Such implications are not acceptible provided that he is Pakistani, extremely patriotic and he cannot read, write Gurmukhi script. In addition he speaks different punjabi which is actually a <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistani.html" title="Pakistani">Pakistani</a> blend of <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> and Punjabi; quite different from Indian punjabi (I know because I speak same punjabi as Abrar).</p>
<p>In addition, his name is basically <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> and there is no point writing an <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a>/<a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> name in Indian Punjabi Gurmukhi on English Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>It certainly doesn't imply anything - the article clearly states he is Pakistani. I doubt the Punjabi he speaks is very different from that across the border. The Punjabi in Lahore and Amritsar is the *same* dialect (Majhi).</dd>

<dd>My reasoning was that he represents a cross-border star, and indeed represents Punjabi culture as a whole rather than merely Pakistani Punjabi culture.

<p>Abrar spent most of his childhood in Gujrat city of Punjab (Pakistan). The Punjabi of Gujrat is very different from that of Lahore. Gujrat Dialect of Punjabi is considered much closer to Urdu than any other dialect as it contains a host of Urdu, Persian and Arabic words. <a href="../../../s/z/h/User%7ESzhaider_2a97.html" title="User:Szhaider">Szhaider</a> 09:21, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Can't say I've been to Gujrat myself to confirm this. However, Punjabi itself has many many words for Perso-Arabic origin. They might be pronounced differently, but they're still there. Also, Gujrat does seem to fall very much in the Punjabi speaking region of Punjab. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 10:58, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Its funny how little Pakistani Punjabis know about the Punjabi language. Especially, the second generation raised on a steady dose of Urdufied Punjabi since 1947. Indian Punjabi has also been Sanskritized but retains more original punjabi words and is taught and used as an official language so there is less confusion. Pakistani Punjabi's knowledge of Punjabi comes from songs and movies, as the majority reads, writes and converses in Urdu. If you read Punjabi of Sheikh Farid, Damodar, Bulleh Shah and Waris it is much closer to the Indian version less the obvious snaskritized words that are common today, while in Pakistani Punjabi even the words that have a substitue in Punjabi have been replaced by Urdu words. Punjabi already contains a lot of Perso-Arabic words because of historical contacts. The remote rural areas of Pakistani Punjab do retain the original language complete with idioms and traditional Punjabi words, but this is also being lost. As i listen to the Punjabi that my genration speaks in the cities compared to what my grandparents spoke in their village, it amazes me how much linguistic richness is being lost to mass media driven changes and outside influences.

<dd>In regards to Szhaider's point: "What is it that you have against Urdu? If you want remove Urdu from this article remove it from all articles about Pakistanis."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have nothing against Urdu. However, you seem to have something against labelling his name as "Punjabi". My point is, that you object to it be labelled as Punjabi because it's not a Punjabi language name - but it's not an Urdu language name EITHER, it's actually Arabic. The fact that his mother tongue is Punjabi and he is a PUNJABI SINGER, would suggest that his name is just as much Punjabi as it is Urdu. Hence, either label it as such, OR drop the label entirely because it's misleading. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 17:15, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is a baseless point emerged from Punjabi nationalism and FYI Abrar is no punjabi nationalist and all legal document of Abrar's nationality consider his name to be Urdu.

<dd>My point emerges from Punjabi nationalism? Right... And I presume you have seen Abrar's legal documents then? They must have a field that says "Urdu Name". So, if I were to take Pakistani nationality and were to write my name in Arabic script, would it become Urdu? NO!

<dd>Well, I told you waht you wanted to know. You have to accept some things in other countries whether you like them or not. If you want to discuss linguistics then its my favourite topic. By the way, Urdu font on Wikipedia is not Nastaliq, but a horrible form of Naskh introduced by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. In addition, Arabic is not written in Nastaliq. Urdu, Punjabi, Persian and almost all of Pakistani regional languages are written in this font. <a href="../../../s/z/h/User%7ESzhaider_2a97.html" title="User:Szhaider">Szhaider</a> 22:14, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're very ignorant when it comes to scripts. Why is Gurmukhi (a script) considered Hindi (a language)? Are all Pakistanis so ignorant? I sincerely hope not. You could say Gurmukhi is considered the same as Devanagari (both scripts) or that Punjabi is considered the same as Hindi/Urdu (both languages). Either way, you'd be plain WRONG. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 08:09, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I meant Hindi script. Plain and simple. I did not remember how to spell Devanagari so I did not use this word. Most Pakistanis cannot differentiate between Devanagari (Hindi script) and Gurmukhi (Punjabi script) and it is not considered ignorence. (And shouting is not polite. When you knew what I meant why would you shout. And do not use personal attacks. "Are all Pakistanis so ignorant?" It's a personal attack and I protest.) Being popular in Indian Punjab is no excuse for adding Gurmukhi. It provides a very convinient excuse for adding Urdu (MS based Naskh, Naskh, Nastaliq etc.) to all of popular Indian actors and proclaiming thier names <i>Urdu</i> because most of them are crazily popular among Pakistani youth. <a href="../../../s/z/h/User%7ESzhaider_2a97.html" title="User:Szhaider">Szhaider</a> 11:58, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you speak for most Pakistanis now? Why does it matter whether Pakistanis can distinguish between either Devanagari or Gurmukhi? "It's a personal attack and I protest." protest all you like - if you cannot distinguish between a personal attack and a response to your comment "In Pakistan, Gurmukhi is considered Hindi, because nobody reads it." then that again is your own problem.</dd>

<dd>Anyway, in case you hadn't noticed, I don't disagree with your rationale for removing Gurmukhi. That's why I never inserted it. However, you know what I disagree with and unless you have anything further to add, please, be quiet. I think it's time to remove Urdu from many Bollywood films/actors unless there is a direct link to Islam/Pakistan. We'd have to be fair across the board now wouldn't we? <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 12:45, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no interest, whatsoever, in Bollywood celebs. It would be a favour for me if you remove Urdu from articles about them. I haven't even opened any articles related to them that's why I do not know if they have Urdu script in them.

<dd>I can say taht as a Hindi speaker/reader, I cannot read Punjabi at all. To a Hindi speaker, the letters are all jumbled and stuff.

<dd>I have already told you, keep or remove Urdu scripts from bollywood articles. I don't care. FYI, most of them are completely wrong. I checked out of curiosity and found most of them laughably wrong. I never fixed any. Because I don't care. If you ask my personal opinion, I think nobody from Pakistan cares about Urdu in those article. It was <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a>, an Indian, not a Pakistani who added most of those scripts. Therefore, you should discuss this problem with your indian friends and stop seeking revenge from Pakistan related articles. You can go ahead and remove all Urdu from Indian articles and I couldn't care less. <a href="../../../s/z/h/User%7ESzhaider_2a97.html" title="User:Szhaider">Szhaider</a> 19:16, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gurmukhi comes from the ancient Takri script that originated in Punjab/Kashmir region between 5th and 8th centuries. Its very different from the Devnagri script used for Hindi, in essence gurmukhi/takri is the original script for Punjabi language. Szhaider is creating controversy on a misconcieved notion. 17:16, 12, March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Szhaider. Thanks for trying to keep this article referenced. I found two references discussing the material presenting the <i>Musical collaborations</i> section. As a result, I readded the material and the references I found. I hope this helps!
