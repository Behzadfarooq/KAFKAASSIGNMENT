	    <p>In <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_science.html" title="Computer science">computer science</a>, <b>abstraction</b> is a mechanism and practice to reduce and factor out details so that one can focus on a few concepts at a time.</p>
<p>The concept is by analogy with <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstraction_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Abstraction (mathematics)">abstraction</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>. The mathematical technique of abstraction begins with mathematical <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition.html" title="Definition">definitions</a>; this has the fortunate effect of finessing some of the vexing philosophical issues of <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstraction.html" title="Abstraction">abstraction</a>. For example, in both computing and in mathematics, <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number.html" title="Number">numbers</a> are concepts in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programming_language.html" title="Programming language">programming languages</a>, as founded in mathematics. Implementation details depend on the hardware and software, but this is not a restriction because the computing concept of number is still based on the mathematical concept.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, abstraction can be either that of control or data. <b>Control abstraction</b> is the abstraction of actions while <b>data abstraction</b> is that of data structures. For example, <b>control abstraction</b> in <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structured_programming.html" title="Structured programming">structured programming</a> is the use of <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subprogram.html" title="Subprogram">subprograms</a> and formatted <a href="../../../c/o/n/Control_flow.html" title="Control flow">control flows</a>. <b>Data abstraction</b> is to allow for handling data bits in meaningful manners. For example, it is the basic motivation behind <a href="../../../d/a/t/Datatype.html" title="Datatype">datatype</a>. <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object-oriented_programming.html" title="Object-oriented programming">Object-oriented programming</a> can be seen as an attempt to abstract both data and code.</p>

<p>Computing is mostly independent of the concrete world: The hardware implements a <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_of_computation.html" title="Model of computation">model of computation</a> that is interchangeable with others. The software is structured in <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_architecture.html" title="Software architecture">architectures</a> to enable humans to create the enormous systems by concentration on a few issues at a time. These architectures are made of specific choices of abstractions. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenspun%27s_Tenth_Rule_b0f6.html" title="Greenspun's Tenth Rule">Greenspun's Tenth Rule</a> is an aphorism on how such an architecture is both inevitable and complex.</p>
<p>A central form of abstraction in computing is the language abstraction: new artificial languages are developed to express specific aspects of a system. <i><a href="../../../m/o/d/Modelling_languages.html" title="Modelling languages">Modelling languages</a></i> help in planning. <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_language.html" title="Computer language">Computer languages</a></i> can be processed with a computer. An example of this abstraction process is the generational development of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programming_language.html" title="Programming language">programming languages</a> from the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-generation_programming_language.html" title="First-generation programming language">machine language</a> to the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second-generation_programming_language.html" title="Second-generation programming language">assembly language</a> and the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third-generation_programming_language.html" title="Third-generation programming language">high-level language</a>. Each stage can be used as a stepping stone for the next stage. The language abstraction continues for example in <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scripting_language.html" title="Scripting language">scripting languages</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domain-specific_programming_language.html" title="Domain-specific programming language">domain-specific programming languages</a>.</p>
<p>Within a programming language, some features let the programmer create new abstractions. These include the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subroutine.html" title="Subroutine">subroutine</a>, the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Module_%28programming%29.html" title="Module (programming)">module</a>, and the <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_component.html" title="Software component">software component</a>. Some other abstractions such as <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_design_pattern.html" title="Software design pattern">software design patterns</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_architecture.html#Architecture_examples" title="Software architecture">architectural styles</a> are not visible to a programming language but only in the design of a system.</p>
<p>Some abstractions try to limit the breadth of concepts a programmer needs by completely hiding the abstractions they in turn are built on. <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Spolsky_8e78.html" title="Joel Spolsky">Joel Spolsky</a> has criticised these efforts by claiming that all abstractions are <i><a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaky_abstraction.html" title="Leaky abstraction">leaky</a></i> — that they are never able to completely hide the details below. Some abstractions are designed to interoperate with others, for example a programming language may contain a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_function_interface.html" title="Foreign function interface">foreign function interface</a> for making calls to the lower-level language.</p>

<p>Different programming languages provide different types of abstraction, depending on the applications for which the language is intended. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object-oriented_programming_language.html" title="Object-oriented programming language">object-oriented programming languages</a> such as <a href="../../../c/%2B/%2B/C%2B%2B.html" title="C++">C++</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_%28programming_language%29.html" title="Java (programming language)">Java</a>, the concept of <b>abstraction</b> is itself a declarative statement, using the <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keyword_%28computer_programming%29.html" title="Keyword (computer programming)">keywords</a> <i><code>virtual</code></i> or <i><code>abstract</code></i>, respectively. After such a declaration, it is the responsibility of the programmer to implement a <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Class (computer science)">class</a> to instantiate the <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Object (computer science)">object</a> of the declaration.</li>
<li>In <a href="../../../f/u/n/Functional_programming_language.html" title="Functional programming language">functional programming languages</a>, it is common to find abstractions related to functions, such as <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambda_abstraction.html" title="Lambda abstraction">lambda abstractions</a> (making a term into a function of some variable), <a href="../../../h/i/g/Higher-order_function.html" title="Higher-order function">higher-order functions</a> (parameters are functions), bracket abstraction (making a term into a function of a variable).</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_%28coordination_language%29.html" title="Linda (coordination language)">Linda</a> abstracts the concepts of <i>server</i> and <i>shared data-space</i> to facilitate distributed programming.</li>

<p>Specification languages generally rely on abstractions of one kind or another, since specifications are typically defined earlier in a project, and at a more abstract level, than an eventual implementation. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unified_Modeling_Language_b552.html" title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</a> specification language, for example, allows the definition of <i>abstract</i> classes, which are simply left abstract during the architecture and specification phase of the project.</p>
<p><a name="Control_abstraction" id="Control_abstraction"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstraction_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Edit section: Control abstraction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Control abstraction</span></h2>

<div class="noprint"><i>Main article: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Control_flow.html" title="Control flow">Control flow</a></i></div>
</dd>

<p>Control abstraction is one of the main purposes of using programming languages. Computer machines understand operations at the very low level such as moving some bits from one location of the memory to another location and producing the sum of two sequences of bits. Programming languages allow this to be done in the higher level. For example, consider the high-level expression/program statement:</p>
<dl>
<dd><code>a&#160;:= (1 + 2) * 5</code></dd>
</dl>
<p>To a human, this is a fairly simple and obvious calculation (<i>"one plus two is three, times five is fifteen"</i>). However, the low-level steps necessary to carry out this evaluation, and return the value "15", and then assign that value to the variable "a", are actually quite subtle and complex. The values need to be converted to binary representation (often a much more complicated task than one would think) and the calculations decomposed (by the compiler or interpreter) into assembly instructions (again, which are much less intuitive to the programmer: operations such as shifting a binary register left, or adding the binary complement of the contents of one register to another, are simply not how humans think about the abstract arithmetical operations of addition or multiplication). Finally, assigning the resulting value of "15" to the variable labeled "a", so that "a" can be used later, involves additional 'behind-the-scenes' steps of looking up a variable's label and the resultant location in physical or virtual memory, storing the binary representation of "15" to that memory location, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Without control abstraction, a programmer would need to specify <i>all</i> the register/binary-level steps each time she simply wanted to add or multiply a couple of numbers and assign the result to a variable. This duplication of effort has two serious negative consequences: (a) it forces the programmer to constantly repeat fairly common tasks every time a similar operation is needed; and (b) it forces the programmer to program for the particular hardware and instruction set.</p>

<p>Structured programming involves the splitting of complex program tasks into smaller pieces with clear flow control and interfaces between components, with reduction of the complexity potential for side-effects.</p>
<p>In a simple program, this may be trying to ensure that loops have single or obvious exit points and trying, where it's most clear to do so, to have single exit points from functions and procedures.</p>
<p>In a larger system, it may involve breaking down complex tasks into many different modules. Consider a system handling payroll on ships and at shore offices:</p>
<ul>
<li>The uppermost level may be a menu of typical end user operations.</li>
<li>Within that could be standalone executables or libraries for tasks such as signing on and off employees or printing checks.</li>
<li>Within each of those standalone components there could be many different source files, each containing the program code to handle a part of the problem, with only selected interfaces available to other parts of the program. A sign on program could have source files for each data entry screen and the database interface (which may itself be a standalone third party library or a statically linked set of library routines).</li>
<li>Either the database or the payroll application also has to initiate the process of exchanging data with between ship and shore and that data transfer task will often contain many other components.</li>
</ul>
<p>These layers produce the effect of isolating the implementation details of one component and its assorted internal methods from the others. This concept was embraced and extended in object-oriented programming.</p>

<p><b>Data abstraction</b> is the enforcement of a clear separation between the <i>abstract</i> properties of a <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_type.html" title="Data type">data type</a> and the <i>concrete</i> details of its implementation. The abstract properties are those that are visible to client code that makes use of the data type--the <i>interface</i> to the data type--while the concrete implementation is kept entirely private, and indeed can change, for example to incorporate efficiency improvements over time. The idea is that such changes are not supposed to have any impact on client code, since they involve no difference in the abstract behaviour.</p>
<p>For example, one could define an <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_data_type.html" title="Abstract data type">abstract data type</a> called <i>lookup table</i>, where <i>keys</i> are uniquely associated with <i>values</i>, and values may be retrieved by specifying their corresponding keys. Such a lookup table may be implemented in various ways: as a <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hash_table.html" title="Hash table">hash table</a>, a <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_search_tree.html" title="Binary search tree">binary search tree</a>, or even a simple linear list. As far as client code is concerned, the abstract properties of the type are the same in each case.</p>
<p>Of course, this all relies on getting the details of the interface right in the first place, since any changes there can have major impacts on client code. Another way to look at this is that the interface forms a <i>contract</i> on agreed behaviour between the data type and client code; anything not spelled out in the contract is subject to change without notice.</p>
<p>Languages that implement data abstraction include <a href="../../../a/d/a/Ada_programming_language.html" title="Ada programming language">Ada</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modula-2.html" title="Modula-2">Modula-2</a>. <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object-oriented.html" title="Object-oriented">Object-oriented</a> languages are commonly claimed to offer data abstraction; however, their <a href="../../../i/n/h/Inheritance_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Inheritance (computer science)">inheritance</a> concept tends to put information in the interface that more properly belongs in the implementation; thus, changes to such information ends up impacting client code, leading directly to the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fragile_base_class.html" title="Fragile base class">fragile base class</a> problem.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object-oriented_programming.html" title="Object-oriented programming">object-oriented programming</a> theory, <b>abstraction</b> is the facility to define objects that represent abstract "actors" that can perform work, report on and change their state, and "communicate" with other objects in the system. The term <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_hiding.html" title="Information hiding">encapsulation</a> refers to the hiding of <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_%28computer_science%29.html" title="State (computer science)">state</a> details, but extending the concept of <i>data type</i> from earlier programming languages to associate <i>behavior</i> most strongly with the data, and standardizing the way that different data types interact, is the beginning of <b>abstraction</b>. When abstraction proceeds into the operations defined, enabling objects of different types to be substituted, it is called <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymorphism_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Polymorphism (computer science)">polymorphism</a>. When it proceeds in the opposite direction, inside the types or classes, structuring them to simplify a complex set of relationships, it is called <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delegation_%28programming%29.html" title="Delegation (programming)">delegation</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/h/Inheritance_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Inheritance (computer science)">inheritance</a>.</p>
<p>Various object-oriented programming languages offer similar facilities for abstraction, all to support a general strategy of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymorphism_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Polymorphism (computer science)">polymorphism</a> in object-oriented programming, which includes the substitution of one type for another in the same or similar role. Although it is not as generally supported, a configuration or image or package may predetermine a great many of these <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binding_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Binding (computer science)">bindings</a> at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compile-time.html" title="Compile-time">compile-time</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link-time.html" title="Link-time">link-time</a>, or <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loadtime.html" title="Loadtime">loadtime</a>. This would leave only a minimum of such bindings to change at <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run-time.html" title="Run-time">run-time</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../c/l/o/CLOS_8405.html" title="CLOS">CLOS</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self_programming_language.html" title="Self programming language">self</a>, for example, there is less of a class-instance distinction, more use of delegation for <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymorphism_in_object-oriented_programming.html" title="Polymorphism in object-oriented programming">polymorphism</a>, and individual objects and functions are abstracted more flexibly to better fit with a shared functional heritage from <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisp_programming_language.html" title="Lisp programming language">Lisp</a>.</p>
<p>Another extreme is C++, which relies heavily on <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generic_programming.html" title="Generic programming">templates</a> and <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overloading.html" title="Overloading">overloading</a> and other static bindings at compile-time, which in turn has certain flexibility problems.</p>
<p>Although these are alternate strategies for achieving the same abstraction, they do not fundamentally alter the need to support abstract nouns in code - all programming relies on an ability to abstract verbs as functions, nouns as data structures, and either as processes.</p>
<p>For example, here is a sample <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_%28programming_language%29.html" title="Java (programming language)">Java</a> fragment to represent some common farm "animals" to a level of abstraction suitable to model simple aspects of their hunger and feeding. It defines an <code>Animal</code> class to represent both the state of the animal and its functions:</p>
<pre>
class Animal extends LivingThing {
    Location loc;
    double energyReserves;
  
    boolean isHungry() {
        if (energyReserves &lt; 2.5) { return true; }
        else { return false; }
    }
    void eat(Food f) {
        // Consume food
        energyReserves += f.getCalories();
    }
    void moveTo(Location l) {
        // Move to new location
        loc = l;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>With the above definition, one could create objects of type <tt>Animal</tt> and call their methods like this:</p>
<pre>
thePig = new Animal();
theCow = new Animal();
if (thePig.isHungry()) { thePig.eat(tableScraps); }
if (theCow.isHungry()) { theCow.eat(grass); }
theCow.moveTo(theBarn);
</pre>
<p>In the above example, the class <i><code>Animal</code></i> is an abstraction used in place of an actual animal, <i><code>LivingThing</code></i> is a further abstraction (in this case a generalisation) of <code>Animal</code>.</p>
<p>If a more differentiated hierarchy of animals is required to differentiate, say, those who provide milk from those who provide nothing except meat at the end of their lives, that is an intermediary level of abstraction, probably DairyAnimal (cows, goats) who would eat foods suitable to giving good milk, and Animal (pigs, steers) who would eat foods to give the best meat quality.</p>
<p>Such an abstraction could remove the need for the application coder to specify the type of food, so s/he could concentrate instead on the feeding schedule. The two classes could be related using <a href="../../../i/n/h/Inheritance_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Inheritance (computer science)">inheritance</a> or stand alone, and varying degrees of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymorphism_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Polymorphism (computer science)">polymorphism</a> between the two types could be defined. These facilities tend to vary drastically between languages, but in general each can achieve anything that is possible with any of the others. A great many operation overloads, data type by data type, can have the same effect at compile-time as any degree of inheritance or other means to achieve polymorphism. The class notation is simply a coder's convenience.</p>

<p>Decisions regarding what to abstract and what to keep under the control of the coder are the major concern of object-oriented design and <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domain_analysis.html" title="Domain analysis">domain analysis</a>—actually determining the relevant relationships in the real world is the concern of <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object-oriented_analysis.html" title="Object-oriented analysis">object-oriented analysis</a> or legacy analysis.</p>
<p>In general, to determine appropriate abstraction, one must make many small decisions about scope, domain analysis, determine what other systems one must cooperate with, legacy analysis, then perform a detailed object-oriented analysis which is expressed within project time and budget constraints as an object-oriented design. In our simple example, the domain is the barnyard, the live pigs and cows and their eating habits are the legacy constraints, the detailed analysis is that coders must have the flexibility to feed the animals what is available and thus there is no reason to code the type of food into the class itself, and the design is a single simple Animal class of which pigs and cows are instances with the same functions. A decision to differentiate DairyAnimal would change the detailed analysis but the domain and legacy analysis would be unchanged—thus it is entirely under the control of the programmer, and we refer to abstraction in object-oriented programming as distinct from abstraction in domain or legacy analysis.</p>

<p>When discussing <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formal_semantics_of_programming_languages.html" title="Formal semantics of programming languages">formal semantics of programming languages</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formal_method.html" title="Formal method">formal methods</a> or <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_interpretation.html" title="Abstract interpretation">abstract interpretation</a>, <b>abstraction</b> refers to the act of considering a less accurate, but safe, definition of the observed program behaviors. For instance, one may observe only the final result of program executions instead of considering all the intermediate steps of executions. Abstraction is defined to a <b>concrete</b> (more precise) model of execution.</p>
<p>Abstraction may be <b>exact</b> or <b>faithful</b> with respect to a property if it is possible to answer a question about the property equally well on the concrete or abstract model. For instance, if we wish to know what the result of the evaluation of a mathematical expression involving only integers +, -, ×, is worth <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modular_arithmetic.html" title="Modular arithmetic">modulo</a> <i>n</i>, it is sufficient to perform all operations modulo <i>n</i> (a familiar form of this abstraction is <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casting_out_nines.html" title="Casting out nines">casting out nines</a>).</p>
<p>Abstractions, however, are not necessarily <b>exact</b>, but one requires that they should be <b>sound</b>. That is, it should be possible to get sound answers from them—even though the abstraction may simply yield a result of <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undecidability.html" title="Undecidability">undecidability</a>. For instance, we may abstract the students in a class by their minimal and maximal ages; if one asks whether a certain person belongs to that class, one may simply compare that person's age with the minimal and maximal ages; if his age lies outside the range, one may safely answer that the person does not belong to the class; if it does not, one may only answer "I don't know".</p>
<p>Abstractions are useful when dealing with computer programs, because non-trivial properties of computer programs are essentially <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undecidable.html" title="Undecidable">undecidable</a> (see <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rice%27s_theorem.html" title="Rice's theorem">Rice's theorem</a>). As a consequence, automatic methods for deriving information on the behavior of computer programs either have to drop termination (on some occasions, they may fail, crash or never yield out a result), soundness (they may provide false information), or precision (they may answer "I don't know" to some questions).</p>
<p>Abstraction is the core concept of <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_interpretation.html" title="Abstract interpretation">abstract interpretation</a>. <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_checking.html" title="Model checking">Model checking</a> is generally performed on abstract versions of the studied systems.</p>

<p>A common concept in computer science is <i>levels</i> (or, less commonly, <i>layers</i>) of abstraction, wherein each level represents a different model of the same information and processes, but uses a system of expression involving a unique set of objects and compositions that are applicable only to a particular domain. Each relatively abstract, "higher" level builds on a relatively concrete, "lower" level, which tends to provide an increasingly "granular" representation. For example, gates build on electronic circuits, binary on gates, machine language on binary, programming language on machine language, applications and operating systems on programming languages. Each level is embodied, but not determined, by the level beneath it, making it a language of description that is somewhat self-contained.</p>

Data abstraction levels of a database system</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Physical level:</b> The lowest level of abstraction describes <i>how</i> the data is actually stored. The physical level describes complex low-level data structures in detail.</p>
<p><b>Logical level:</b> The next higher level of abstraction describes <i>what</i> data are stored in the database, and what relationships exist among those data. The logical level thus describes an entire database in terms of a small number of relatively simple structures. Although implementation of the simple structures at the logical level may involve complex physical level structures, the user of the logical level does not need to be aware of this complexity. Database administrators, who must decide what information to keep in a database, use the logical level of abstraction.</p>
<p><b>View level:</b> The highest level of abstraction describes only part of the entire database. Even though the logical level uses simpler structures, complexity remains because of the variety of information stored in a large database. Many users of a database system do not need all this information; instead, they need to access only a part of the database. The view level of abstraction exists to simplify their interaction with the system. The system may provide many views for the same database.</p>
