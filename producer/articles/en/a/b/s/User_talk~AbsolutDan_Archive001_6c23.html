<p>You're right. I looked back through a years worth of contributions and there wasn't a single valid edit from the IP. Since its talk page says its a shared IP, I'm not going to block indefinately, but I'll put a three month block on and see if we get any complaints. Hopefully we can get someone in charge there who'll put a stop to it.

<p>What is your problem, "Dan"? If you have issues with people's opinions, find someone that posted one. I did not say Cynthia McKinney WAS insane. I said that most people believe that she is insane. Learn the difference between an opinion and a fact, idiot.</p>
<p>And quit using your "wizard" status to try and scare people. The whole idea of Wikipedia is to let the public perfect these articles. If you start banning people from offerering their input, you will have destroyed the very spirit of the online encyclodpedia you are overzealously patrolling. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.174.177.20 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.174.177.20.html" title="User talk:68.174.177.20">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.174.177.20_10b2.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.174.177.20">contribs</a>) April 09, 2006.</small></p>

<dd>Wikipedia is not the place for personal opinions, especially unsourced opinions. Articles here must be written in a neutral point of view, and Must be cited. If you want readers to conclude that Ms. McKinney is mentally imbalanced, present the facts of her behavior in an impartial, impassionate tone and let the facts speak for themselves. There is also no need to resort to personal attacks, as you have on my Talk page. If you have a problem with a user's edit, take it up calmly on their talk page as I am attempting to do here with you. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:26, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cynthia McKinney is mentally imbalanced. You know it. I know it. The rest of the United States, with the possible exception of the majority of her kooky district, knows it. I also know that if a poll were taken, the results would back my claim. Anyway, I chose my word carefully. I said that most people believe that Cynthia McKinney is insane, which is indeed a fact. People like you, who edit the encyclopedia for the sake of politcal correctness, do a disservice to the throngs of information seekers out there. Hiding the fact that Cynthia McKinney is crazy is like claiming the U.S. doesn't have an immigration problem. But you would probably paper that over, too.</dd>

<p>I have added a bunch of info to the phpWebSite page and have used the Wikipedia articles on Joomla! and TikiWiki as a guide. (Both are good articles and useful CMS.)</p>

<p>Thanks for your speedy reply Dan</p>
<p>Having read your comments I can see that there is definately too much information at present.</p>
<p>The difficulty I am having is writing in an "encyclopedic" style - or should that be wikipedic?</p>
<p>I can see that there is too much information and that excising the third party modules would be a good start.</p>
<p>I think I shall excise the Third Party Modules section and instead say that there are a number of third party modules across the range of component categories and then add a link to the phpWebSite official website information about third party modules then people could find out about them there.</p>

Hello i was not trying to spam. My site is non-profit and has not ads at all. I make no money off it. I saw other similar sites to mine and figured it was ok to add my link, especially after content from my site was put up on wikipedia's list of cannabis strains. I thought that allowed me to put my link up as a reference. As for the other links on other cannabis pages, i see other forums/message board sites doing the same thing and I don't understand what's wrong with it. How can you allow some sites but not others, and some of the ones you allow are PROFIT sites with ads everywhere. MINE HAS NO ADS AND IS NONPROFIT!! i really don't understand your policy about posting links.</p>
<p>For example on the cannabis page of wikipedia there is this link:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://variedades.cannabiscafe.net/index.php?_pantalla=en/intro.php" class="external text" title="http://variedades.cannabiscafe.net/index.php?_pantalla=en/intro.php" rel="nofollow">Strain's Bible</a> - A list about the different cannabis strains that exist, with grower reports and photos</li>
</ul>
<p>How is that any different than my site? I have a strain guide and photos and grow/smoke reports and message boards just like that site. So whats the difference? Also, we even have a link to wikipedia on our home page!! And on the cannabis strains page there are links just to cannabis forums, not even strain guides, i do not understand this at all. i was not trying to spam, i just thought you were allowed to post relevant links if you weren't a commerical website or profit. i'd understand that i put too many links up but can i at least be able to have a link on the cannabis strains page because my site is extremeley relevant to that, as well as the cannabis page. 209.51.82.222 16:09, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello ADN, I will be the first to admit that I am no car expert. However, the uploader of the image in question seems fairly convinced he took a picture of a Malibu. If you look closely, it is marked "Malibu" between the front driver-side door and the wheel well.</dd>
<dd>If you're <i>convinced</i> that the image is not a Malibu, the proper thing to do is to either:
<ol>
<li>Remove the image completely from the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevrolet_Malibu_b2b6.html" title="Chevrolet Malibu">Chevrolet Malibu</a> page and explain your reasoning on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Talk%7EChevrolet_Malibu_4418.html" title="Talk:Chevrolet Malibu">the article's talk page</a>, or</li>
<li>Explain your reasoning on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Talk%7EChevrolet_Malibu_4418.html" title="Talk:Chevrolet Malibu">the article's talk page</a> and let someone else correct the image.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Simply changing the image's caption looks like <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html" title="WP:Vandalism">vandalism</a>. Some of your previous edits have been deemed unhelpful to Wikipedia, so I hope you can understand why your change appeared to be simply vandalism as well.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">External Links Removed?</span></h2>
<p>Would you mind letting me know why you removed all the resource links posted from 67.103.169.42. I think the posts were reverted last night around 9pm. The links are not commercial and do not link to a commercial site. The links I've posted send Wikipedia users to the site for one of the most respected not-for-profits in the country, the American Academy of Achievement. The site honors achievers from every corner of the world and features extensive resources. All of them include photo galleries, video interviews, achiever bios and profiles, as well as printed interviews. Each achiever has been inducted into the American Academy of Achievement as a member.</p>
<p>What steps do I need to take so that I can continue with adding resources and not be labelled a "spammer?" Also, how can I go about retrieving the links I've already added? I can contribute to the content if needed. 67.103.169.42 18:46, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Academy of Achievement</span></h2>
<p>Thank you for your input.</p>
<p>I would welcome the opportunity to add content to each of these sites for achievers.</p>
<p>Is there a possibility of adding a "famous quotes" section to each site, adding quotes featured in Academy of Achievement interviews? How would I do this in a technical sense?</p>
<p>To add a quotes section, would I have to obtain permission from the editor of each site? If so, how do I do this?</p>
<p>Also, by adding content, will I then be able to add the external links to the Academy? Would I have to limit them to just the interview and photo gallery links, or can I still link to the biography and profile pages as well?</p>
<p>I know this is a lot of questions, but I am new to this process and don't want to step on any toes.</p>
<p>The Achievement website is a great resource and would act as a valuable supplemental tool for people wanting to access additional information.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>AbsolutDan,</p>
<p>You have removed several links to the Antislavery Literature Project from different articles related to slavery, apparently on grounds that these were commercial links.</p>
<p>This is a public education project involving scholars from different universities. It operates from Arizona State University and runs off the Eserver at Iowa State University. Many libraries carry links to this site. The goal of the Project is to provide high-quality, authenticated primary source materials to the interested public, students, and scholars. We share a common goal with Wikipedia of providing good information for educational purposes. In many cases, the Project's digitized texts -- for John Pierpont's poetry, for example, which links you removed -- are unique on the Internet. To remove links deprives Wikipedia readers of access to primary source materials that explicate or expand on the article they have read.</p>
<p>With this explanation, it would be appreciated if you restored the links you removed.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<dd>Dear AbsolutDan,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You responded as follows:</dd>
<dd>Dear Jlockard,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On nearly any notable topic one could find a wealth of other websites containing more information than the corresponding Wikipedia article; however we much endeavor to keep the articles' external links section down to a bare minimum. To this effect, myself and other volunteers must regularly traverse many articles and prune links.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One the primary methods used to determine whether a link should stay or go is the method in which it was added to the article(s). In this case (as I mentioned above) the links to the Antislavery Literature Project were added "bare" (with no additional content added to the article) across a multitude of pages. This raises a major red flag; had it not been me that reverted the changes, someone else likely would have.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia needs more content, not more external links. The best way to incorporate a link that points to an external website into an article is to contribute cited text - add information to the article that can be learned from the link in question and then cite it per normal guidelines. This is the happy medium that we strive for. You may also wish to consider adding the link to a smaller number of articles - preferrably one main article on the topic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I hope this helps to explain the reason these links were removed. In closing, I refer you to the following guidelines regarding external links:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>WP:SPAM#How_not_to_be_a_spammer information regarding link spamming (in particular, see point number 2 in this guideline)</li>
<li>WP:EL External Links guidelines</li>
<li>WP:CITE Wikipedia citation guidelines</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The addition of links was entirely consistent with the External Links guidelines, particularly section 5. Together with Documenting the American South, located at the University of North Carolina and often provided as a Wikipedia reference link, the Antislavery Literature Project is a major online resource for the literatures of slavery. It provides accurate and authoritative texts that directly relate to the article subject. Eliminating such links does active disservice to Wikipedia readers.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In eliminating the links to John Pierpont's poetry, you apparently failed to notice that I contributed the entire content of the article, one that had previously been a brief stub. Advice to contribute content to Wikipedia would seem gratuitous.</dd>

<dd>I have restored some of the links to slavery-related articles that you deleted. All of these links are in conformity with published Wikipedia policy on external links. To ensure that their contribution to the article is beyond question, in a couple cases sentences have been added to the text to explicate their meaning for general readers without specialized subject knowledge (see Black Canadians, William Still articles). Other links (e.g. the Henderson, Kentucky article) will be restored as time permits. Wikipedia readers from Henderson have a reasonable right to access electronic resources that inform them that their small town too has a literary history. Still other links will be made (e.g. to the Noah Porter article) as the Project publishes new texts and sees opportunities to contribute to Wikipedia's work.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A larger question lies in discrimination between educational electronic resources. Your edits removed links to Antislavery Literature Project materials, for example, even while leaving links in the same article to Project Gutenberg materials. Due to the focus of our digitization work the Project actually has better collections than Gutenberg in this specialized area. It does not appear to make solid editorial sense to eliminate the better source while keeping the lesser one, only because the latter is better-known.</dd>

<dd><b>Note</b>: as this discussion is becoming increasingly circular, I am disengaging. I'm still concerned that, since Mr. Lockard has a vested interest in his project, he will add more links than is necessary for the betterment of Wikipedia. However, since his project <i>is</i> academic in nature, I don't feel his additions are outright <i>harming</i> WP. I'll leave it up to future editors to determine the value of the links he adds on an article-by-article basis. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:31, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AbsolutDan: I have restored, temporarily, the content on the talk page, and added the following note so that members of our group would know what is going on:</p>
<p>NOTE: We would like to leave this content up until the end of the month. I do not disagree with AbsolutDan's comments that all of you can see. I could argue that the betterment of the group is discussing the value of NLPES as described in the WikiPedia article, however, that is nitpicking. We are looking into alternatives.

<p>Dan, I noticed you reverted an external link from the <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Miller_94de.html" title="Hugh Miller">Hugh Miller</a> page which had been placed 07:20, 10 May 2006 by 82.28.33.196</p>
<p>I've looked at the externally linked website (<a href="http://www.gerald-massey.org.uk/massey/cmc_hugh_miller.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.gerald-massey.org.uk/massey/cmc_hugh_miller.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gerald-massey.org.uk/massey/cmc_hugh_miller.htm</a>) and it appears to be a reasonably well-presented biography of Hugh Miller, and a useful addition to the page. So I've undone your reversion - hope you don't mind.</p>
<p>However, I have noticed that this unregistered user seems to have put about ten links from various places in Wikipedia to other pages on the same website - is this why you removed it? If so, please accept my apologies - I have no strong feelings about this particular link, so we can remove it if you like... <a href="../../../e/u/c/User%7EEuchiasmus_e847.html" title="User:Euchiasmus">Euchiasmus</a> 05:43, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I did remove the external link in the <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Miller_94de.html" title="Hugh Miller">Hugh Miller</a> article (and in the many other articles to which it was added) because it was spammed. When I go on a link-removing spree, my intentions are only to remove links that are added in violation of the guidelines in <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#How_not_to_be_a_spammer" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM#How_not_to_be_a_spammer</a>. My task is complete once the <i>linkspam</i> is removed. If future editors later determine a link to be useful to a particular article, then it's no longer spam and I welcome them to re-add it. Thus, I have no problem at all with the fact that you re-added it to Hugh Miller because (unlike the spammer) you:
<ol>
<li>Appear to contribute more than just external links (i.e. you're not here solely to promote a site or sites by spamming)</li>
<li>Took the time to explain the value of the external link in relation to the article rather than just adding the link "silently"</li>
<li>Only added the same link to one article that you felt it was relevant to.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I recommend taking only one further step: you might want to add the same explanation you left on my talk page to the talk page of the Hugh Miller article (<a href="../../../h/u/g/Talk%7EHugh_Miller_f98f.html" title="Talk:Hugh Miller">Talk:Hugh Miller</a>). This way other future spam-removers will see that there has been some intelligent dicussion about the link and that it shouldn't be automatically re-removed.
