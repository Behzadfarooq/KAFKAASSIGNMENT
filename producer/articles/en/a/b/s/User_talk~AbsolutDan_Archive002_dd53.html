<p><s>Wikipedia is not allowing me to register a screen name. It freezes every time i try.</s></p>
<p><s>You removed my link to a page that contained a full radio discography of linkin park with samples, complaining that it was a commercial site. Linkin park is a commercial entity. All the other links are commercial. There is nothing for sale at the site I put up. It contains good, scholarly information that is not available in wikipedia. Did you even look at the page linked?</s></p>
<p><s>Please put my link back up so linkin park fans like myself can get to it.</s></p>

<p><s>:In response to your post on my talk page, I removed the links you added because they were spammed across multiple pages.

<p><s>::There is nothing scholarly about vengeance.</s></p>
<p><s>::And you were less than honest too. You said I "spammed across multiple pages." I only put up one link. The other link was already there. I edited it. There is nothing "multiple" about that.</s></p>
<p><s>::I have been participating in posting on wikipedia, putting up content and providing good links, for well over a year. Do you have my entire history available?</s></p>
<p><s>::I see that you have lots of complaints about your overzealous reversions.</s></p>

<p><s>:::First of all, and most importantly, all of the complaints about link removal on my talk page <b>are from the users whose links I removed</b>. <i>Of course</i> they're going to be a little upset - it was their edit that I removed. This does not necessarily indicate my removals were in error.</s></p>
<p><s>:::Next, I didn't ignore your comments. I take every comment left on my page seriously and try to respond to every comment. I did leave a response on your talk page. For your convenience, I will be combining the entire conversation and posting it both on your talk page and mine.</s></p>
<p><s>:::Although technically your IP's history only shows you <i>adding</i> the link to one article, you did make <i>modifications</i> to the same link, and on the same articles, as another account - Tunecaster. See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.117.97.9_9110.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.117.97.9">Special:Contributions/69.117.97.9</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tunecaster_0e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tunecaster">Special:Contributions/Tunecaster</a>. Perhaps it's just coincidence, but this looks suspiciously like 69.117.97.9 and Tunecaster are one in the same.</s></p>
<p><s>:::Speaking of history, your IP only shows edits from the last few days. When spam-removers such as myself are determining whether to remove links we often check users' history. The fact that your IP only shows a history of adding or making changes to links to one particular website makes your edits look like spamming. <s>If you want your edits to carry more weight, and thus have less of any external links you add being removed, I highly recommend creating an account. By doing so, editors can review your entire history, which can help determine your motivation behind adding a link.</s></s></p>
<p><s>:::Lastly (but also importantly), please <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignature_f003.html" title="Wikipedia:Signature">sign your comments</a>. It's important to do this so that someone viewing a talk page can determine who made which comment.</s></p>
<p><s>:::In closing, I refer you to the following guidelines regarding external links and spamming. Please check them out before adding additional external links, as they discuss the types of links that are appropriate in Wikipedia articles, and also reasons why an editor can appear to be a spammer.</s> <s>:::*<a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a></s> <s>:::*<a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a></s> <s>:::I'll be posting a follow-up on your talk page regarding your account creation issues --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:43, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<p>Our members report that you've applied a global 'delete' to the various external links to the <a href="http://www.gerald-massey.org.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.gerald-massey.org.uk" rel="nofollow">Gerald Massey website</a> that we have added to various Wikipedia pages in an effort to enhance the often 'skeletal' information that they currently provide.</p>
<p>For example, the Wikipedia entry for the minor Victorian poet, Adelaide Anne Procter, contains little about her life and no examples of her verse. The link to the Gerald Massey site (now deleted) led a comprehensive biography and to all her published verse - and the same applies to about a dozen similar poets of that age that you catalogue on Wikipedia. (I notice that you recently posted correspondence on this page to this effect from someone else regarding your deletion of the external link we had posted to the entry on our site for the Scots poet/writer, Hugh Miller).</p>
<p>I really think that before you an delete external link, you ought to take a look at what lies at the end of it and assess how that material adds useful information to what your excellent facility already provides. And while you might disagree, I do not regard anything offered on my Society's site - to be taken or left as the visitor sees fit - as SPAM, as your notice to my IP address suggests. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.28.33.196 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.28.33.196.html" title="User talk:82.28.33.196">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.28.33.196_1363.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.28.33.196">contribs</a>) 13 May 2006.</small></p>

<dd>The link in question wasn't quite so cut-and-dry. The link was a citation, not just a normal external link. The page it linked to <i>does</i> provide information relevent to the topic. It was also unclear to me at first whether or not the site's primary purpose is to sell products. Upon further review by another editor and myself, we have determined that your removal was correct. Please understand that based on your recent activities, your <i>motives</i> in removing the link were questionable -- it appeared like you were removing the link in order to try to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">make a point</a>. In the future, when making edits that may be deemed controversial, it's a good idea to make note of your change on the article's talk page, giving a more extensive reasoning for your change. That way there's no question about your motive for said edit. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:15, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi fellow Wikiholic Dan! The reason I put it back is, aside from the fact that it was poorly added the first time, it is an attempt at community for those interested. If there is a better link to a related forum, please change it to that.&#160;:) I'm just trying to encourage connection for those of similar interest, and the link itself was not as bad as how it was put on there. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKintetsubuffalo_0363.html" title="User:Kintetsubuffalo">Chris</a> 16:44, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Site www.cigarettespedia.com</span></h2>
<p>The site www.cigarettespedia.com is not a commercial one. We haven’t placed any advertisements inside of it. It is clearly stated on our site that we are not for or against cigarettes. The only thing we did and do is presenting a huge collection (more than 20 000) of cigarettes packs of different brands and countries that anyone can take a look at.</p>
<p>Our resource is absolutely for free!!! We use open source PHPWiky. Each user can visit this site and edit a page. The site www.cigarettespedia.com is similar to www.wikipedia.org by structure.</p>
<p>It is not clear why you remove links from articles containing descriptions of cigarettes brands from the site www.wikipedia.org? For instance: (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regal_%28cigarette%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regal_%28cigarette%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regal_%28cigarette%29</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_%28cigarette%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_%28cigarette%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_%28cigarette%29</a>, ... I think that if a user visits the site in order to read for example about Regal cigarettes, he will be also interested in knowing how these cigarettes look like, what brands are manufactured in different countries. He won’t find such kind of information in the Internet. The information provided on our site is unique from this point of view!</p>
<p>And in regard to the links from the pages <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cigarette" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cigarette" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cigarette</a> ссылки, the site Cigarettespedia.com is a lot more informative than for instance the site: <a href="http://www.sickofsmoke.com" class="external free" title="http://www.sickofsmoke.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sickofsmoke.com</a>.</p>
<p>And it is also incomprehensible why there are links on 2 sites that have the same contents and are cross-linked: <a href="http://www.globalink.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.globalink.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalink.org/</a> <a href="http://www.tobaccopedia.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.tobaccopedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tobaccopedia.org/</a> that in essence represent the same organization.</p>
<p>This project was launched a month ago; we have been working on improving its content incessantly. Would you be so kind to explain us on what basis you remove links from the informative site www.cigarettespedia.com? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tutonhamon2006 (<a href="../../../t/u/t/User_talk%7ETutonhamon2006_fa78.html" title="User talk:Tutonhamon2006">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tutonhamon2006_6920.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tutonhamon2006">contribs</a>) 22 May 2006.</small></p>

<p>Well, I'm surprised at the efficiency of Wikipedia to respond to vadalizing. Anyway, you're right. Even though Fanta <i>has</i> been called "Nazi Coke," it is a tid bit too non-NPOV for inclusion in the article. I apologize.</p>
<p>I wasn't really trying to vandalize, I'm not that sort of person. If you check my edit history (my user name is atomsprengja, if I didn't log in, it was because I'm lazy and not because I wanted to hide) you'll see I do rather mild edits (dialects of Totonac, for example).</p>
<p>However, you really need to get the Fanta article looked at. "Shipping problems"? How odd. Although I'm certain a picture of der Führer drinkind das Coke would not have gone over well.</p>
<p>Also, is there any way to standardize the Arabic transliterations used here? Do people realize that the letter "o," as in Osama does not exist in Arabic? And he's not the son of Laden, but son of Muhammad, who was in turn the son of Ladin. Not to say I agree with al-Qa'ida. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.240.161.241 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.240.161.241.html" title="User talk:71.240.161.241">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.240.161.241_bd34.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.240.161.241">contribs</a>) 25 May 2006.</small></p>

<p>I appreciate that this probably was done because it was a pointer to a commercial provider. However I have mixed feelings about this because so much of this domain has been created and continues to be defined by vendors. At the least, I wouldn't characterize it as vandalism. Can you help me understand the operant Wikipedia policies? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_T._Betz_d167.html" title="User:Charles T. Betz">Charles T. Betz</a> 04:41, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dating site</span></h2>
<p>Dear AbsolutDan!</p>
<p>I've added noncommercial dating reviews site to the article. As noncommercial as sites on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>
 AURUM3 Movies (<a href="http://movies.aurum3.com/" class="external free" title="http://movies.aurum3.com/" rel="nofollow">http://movies.aurum3.com/</a>)
 Ain't It Cool News (<a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aintitcool.com/</a>)
</pre>
<p>But I don't want to make bad to somebody, I've just proposed realy good site with much information about dating and advices. So I will be very glad if you'll change your mind about this update to the article <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Svaryk (<a href="../../../s/v/a/User_talk%7ESvaryk_2a42.html" title="User talk:Svaryk">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Svaryk_bec2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Svaryk">contribs</a>) 15:45, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cigarette article</span></h2>
<p>The link that was added to the cigarette page, www.whyquit.com has perhaps THE most effective information on in for people that would like to quit smoking. There is so much false info out there, such as on the official link, www.sickofsmoke.com on the wikipedia page, about picking a date to quit smoking for example. Most people that quit, and stay smoke free, quit randomly, not with a pick date.</p>
<p>Take some time to read a little on the link that you removed, and you will understand better. It is not my site, either, just a good site to learn the truth from.</p>
