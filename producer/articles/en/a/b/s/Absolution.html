<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolution.html" title="Edit section: Roman Catholic Church">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Roman Catholic Church</span></h2>
<p>Absolution is an integral part of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confession.html#Roman_Catholicism" title="Confession">sacrament of penance and reconciliation</a>. The penitent makes a sacramental confession of all <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortal_sin.html" title="Mortal sin">mortal sins</a> to a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a> and prays an <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_contrition.html" title="Act of contrition">act of contrition</a>. The priest then assigns a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penance.html" title="Penance">penance</a> and offers absolution in the name of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>, on behalf of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Church</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"God, the Father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his Son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the Holy Spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins; through the ministry of the Church may God give you pardon and peace, and I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the Second Vatican Council, and still practiced in traditionalist parishes, absolution was given in Latin, followed by another Latin prayer by the priest:</p>
<p>Absolution: "Dominus noster Jesus Christus te absolvat; et ego auctoritate ipsius te absolvo ab omni vinculo excommunicationis (sespensionis) et interdicti in quantum possum et tu indiges. [making the Sign of the Cross:] Deinde, ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen."</p>
<p>Translation: "May our Lord Jesus Christ absolve you; and by His authority I absolve you from every bond of excommunication and interdict, so far as my power allows and your needs require. [making the Sign of the Cross:] Thereupon, I absolve you of your sins in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen."</p>
<p>Post-absolution prayer: "Passio Domini nostri Jesu Christi, merita Beatae Mariae Virginis et omnium sanctorum, quidquid boni feceris vel mail sustinueris sint tibi in remissionem peccatorum, augmentum gratiae et praemium vitae aeternae."</p>
<p>Translation: "May the Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the merits of the Blessed Virgin Mary and of all the saints obtain for you that whatever good you do or whatever evil you bear might merit for you the remission of your sins, the increase of grace and the reward of everlasting life."</p>
<p>Absolution forgives the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilt.html" title="Guilt">guilt</a> associated with the penitent's sins, and removes the eternal punishment (<a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a>) associated with <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortal_sin.html" title="Mortal sin">mortal sins</a>. The penitent is still responsible for the temporal punishment (<a href="../../../p/u/r/Purgatory.html" title="Purgatory">Purgatory</a>) associated with the confessed sins, unless an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indulgence.html" title="Indulgence">indulgence</a> is applied.</p>
<p>General absolution, where all eligible Catholics gathered at a given area are granted absolution for sins without prior individual confession to a priest, is lawfully granted in only 2 circumstances:<br />
(1) there is imminent danger of death and there is no time for a priest or priests to hear the confessions of the individual penitents,<br />
(2) a serious need is present, that is, the number of penitents is so large that there are not sufficient priests to hear the individual confessions properly within a reasonable time (generally considered to be 1 month) so that the Catholics, through no fault of their own, would be forced to be deprived of the sacrament or communion. The <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html#Bishops_in_Catholic.2C_Orthodox_and_Anglican_churches" title="Bishop">diocesan bishop</a> <b>must</b> give prior permission before general absolution may be given under this circumstance. It is important to note that the occurrence of a large number of penitents, such as may occur on a pilgrimage or at penitential services is not considered as sufficient to permit general absolution. Circumstance 2 is thus envisaged more for mission territories where priests may visit certain villages only a few times a year.</p>
<p>For a valid reception of general absolution, the penitent must be contrite for all his mortal sins and have the resolution to confess at the next earliest opportunity each of those mortal sins that is forgiven in general absolution. Anyone receiving general absolution is also required to make a complete, individual confession to a priest as soon as possible before receiving general absolution again. A contemporary example of general absolution was the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Mile_Island_41ed.html#Three_Mile_Island_nuclear_accident" title="Three Mile Island">Three Mile Island nuclear accident</a>, where general absolution was granted to all Catholics endangered by the incident.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolution.html" title="Edit section: In the Greek Church">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In the Greek Church</span></h3>
<p>The belief of the ancient Greek Church has been set forth above. That the Greeks have always believed that the Church has power to forgive sin, that they believe it at present, is clear from the formulæ of absolution in vogue among all branches of the Church; also from the decrees of synods which since the Reformation have again and again expressed this belief (Alzog on Cyril Lucaris III, 465; Synod of Constantinople, 1638; Synod of Jassy, 1642; Synod of Jerusalem, 1672). In the Synod of Jerusalem the Church reiterates its belief in Seven Sacraments, among them Penance, which the Lord established when He said: "Whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven them, and whose sins you shall retain they are retained." The formulæ of absolution are generally deprecatory, and if now and then the indicative form appears, it may be traced to Latin sources.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolution.html" title="Edit section: Russian Church">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Russian Church</span></h3>
<p>The belief of the Greek Church is naturally also that of the Russian. Russian theologians all hold that the Church possesses the power to forgive sins, where there is true repentance and sincere confession. The form in use at present is as follows: "My child, N. N., may our Lord and God Christ Jesus by the mercy of His love absolve thee from thy sins; and I, His unworthy priest, in virtue of the authority committed to me, absolve thee and declare thee absolved of thy sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolution.html" title="Edit section: Armenians">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Armenians</span></h3>
<p>Denzinger, in his "Ritus Orientalium" (1863), gives us a full translation of the penitential ritual used by the Armenians. The present version is from the ninth century. The form of absolution is declarative, though it is preceded by a prayer for mercy and for pardon. It is as follows: "May the merciful Lord have pity on thee and forgive thee thy faults; in virtue of my priestly power, by the authority and command of God expressed in these words, 'whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be hound in heaven', I absolve thee from thy sins, I absolve thee from thy thoughts, from thy words, from thy deeds, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and I restore thee to the Sacrament of the Holy Church. May all thy good works be for thee an increase of merit, may they be for the glory of life everlasting, Amen."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolution.html" title="Edit section: Copts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Copts</span></h3>
<p>Dr. Hyvernat asserts that the liturgical books of the Copts have no penitential formulæ, nor is this surprising, for they inscribe in the ritual only those things not found in other rituals. Father du Bernat, writing to Père Fleurian (Lettres édifiantes), says, in reference to the Sacrament of Penance among the Copts, that the Copts believe themselves bound to a full confession of their sins. This finished, the priest recites over them the prayer said at the beginning of the Mass, the prayer asking pardon and forgiveness from God; to this is added the so-called "Benediction", which Father Bernat says is like the prayer said in the Latin Church after absolution has been imparted. Dr. Hyvernat, however, asserts that Father Bernat is mistaken when he likens the Benediction to our Passio Domini, for it is like the Latin prayer only inasmuch as it is recited after absolution.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolution.html" title="Edit section: Jacobites">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jacobites</span></h3>
<p>(For the earliest tradition in the Syrian Church see Absolution in Patristic age.)</p>
<p>The Syrians who are united with the Roman See use the declarative form in imparting absolution, a relatively recent formula. The present Jacobite Church not only holds and has held the power to absolve from sin, but its ritual is expressive of this same power. Denzinger (Ritus Orientalium) has preserved for us a twelfth-century document which gives in full the order of absolution.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolution.html" title="Edit section: Nestorians">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nestorians</span></h3>
<p>The Nestorians have at all times believed in the power to absolve in the Sacrament of Penance. Assemani, Renaudot, Badger (Nestorians and their Rituals), also Denzinger, have the fullest information on this point. It is noticeable that their formula of absolution is deprecatory, not indicative.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolution.html" title="Edit section: Lutheranism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lutheranism</span></h2>
<p>Both private and corporate <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confession.html" title="Confession">confession</a> and absolution are practiced in the Lutheran tradition. Private confession and absolution have fallen into disuse due to the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pietism.html" title="Pietism">Pietism</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationalism.html" title="Rationalism">Rationalism</a> of the 17th through the 19th centuries.<a href="http://members.aol.com/SemperRef/private.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.aol.com/SemperRef/private.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> While confession of sins is the biblical pattern to be followed (Ps. 32:5: "I said, 'I will confess my transgressions to the LORD'; And You forgave the guilt of my sin."), only holy absolution is held to be specifically instituted by <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> (Matt. 16:19, John 20:23) in Lutheran theology. The common practice is to follow the rite of corporate confession of sins and absolution before the beginning of the Lutheran <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_Service_9349.html" title="Divine Service">Divine Service</a>. (Traditionally, the Divine Service begins with the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Introit.html" title="Introit">Introit</a>: the order of corporate confession and absolution is placed before it.) The Lutheran reformers held that a complete enumeration of sins is impossible (<i><a href="../../../a/u/g/Augsburg_Confession_9148.html" title="Augsburg Confession">Augsburg Confession</a></i> XI, see Ps. 19:12) and that one's confidence of forgiveness was based on the absolution, God's word, rather than on what the penitent did or might do: the sincerity of the penitent's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contrition.html" title="Contrition">contrition</a> or act of confession or deeds of satisfaction (<a href="../../../p/e/n/Penance.html" title="Penance">penance</a>). Deeds of satisfaction have been completely excluded from the Lutheran rite of confession and absolution. Faith in <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus'</a> sufficient active and passive satisfaction, implicit in the word of holy absolution, receives the forgiveness of sins and salvation. Generally, private confession and absolution are practiced in the Lutheran tradition only when requested by the penitent or recommended by the confessor or pastor.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolution.html" title="Edit section: The Reformed tradition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Reformed tradition</span></h2>
<p>The earliest Reformers attacked the penitential practice of the medieval church, particularly the confession of sins to a priest. Their opinions expressed in their later theological works do not differ as markedly from the old position as one might suppose.</p>
<p>The Lutheran tenet of justification by faith alone would make all absolution merely declarative, and reduce the pardon granted by the Church to the merest announcement of the Gospel, especially of remission of sins through Christ.</p>
<p><a href="../../../z/w/i/Zwingli.html" title="Zwingli">Zwingli</a> held that God alone pardoned sin, and he saw nothing but idolatry in the practice of hoping for pardon from a mere creature. If confession had aught of good it was merely as direction.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Calvin_f3ea.html" title="John Calvin">John Calvin</a> denied all idea of sacrament when there was question of Penance; but he held that the pardon expressed by the minister of the Church gave to the penitent a greater guarantee of forgiveness. The Confession styled "Helvetian" contents itself with denying the necessity of confession to a priest, but holds that the power granted by Christ to absolve is simply the power to preach to the people the Gospel of Jesus, and as a consequence the remission of sins: "Rite itaque et efficaciter ministri absolvunt dum evangelium Christi et in hoc remissionem peccatorum prædicant."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolution.html" title="Edit section: Anglicanism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anglicanism</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd><i>Main article: <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_sacraments.html" title="Anglican sacraments">Anglican sacraments</a></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Communion_20fc.html" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a>, absolution usually takes place after the General Confession during the <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> or a <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_office.html" title="Daily office">daily office</a>, and is a componet of the sacrament of confession and absolution. As a sacrament, absolution can only be pronounced by a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishop</a>; a <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laity.html" title="Laity">layperson</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon.html" title="Deacon">deacon</a> may only offer the assurance of pardon. Thus, while a priest or bishop would say "forgive you your sins", a deacon or layperson would say "forgive us our sins." Absolution is also pronounced after the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confession.html" title="Confession">reconciliation of a penitent</a> by the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a> hearing a private confession.</p>
<p>Often, physical actions accompany an absolution. A priest or bishop may make the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sign_of_the_cross.html" title="Sign of the cross">sign of the cross</a> in front of him or her, facing the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregation_%28worship%29.html" title="Congregation (worship)">congregation</a>. Those receiving the absolution may, in addition, make the sign of the cross across their chests.</p>
<p>At minimum, Anglican <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prayer_book.html" title="Prayer book">prayer books</a> contain a formula of absolution in the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_office.html" title="Daily office">daily offices</a>, at the <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, and in the <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anointing_of_the_sick.html" title="Anointing of the sick">visitation of the sick</a>. The first two are general, akin to the liturgical absolution in use in the Roman Church; the third is individual by the very nature of the case. The offices of the earliest <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Common_Prayer_9e7e.html" title="Book of Common Prayer">Books of Common Prayer</a> contained an absolution that read both as assurance of pardon, placing the agency with God ("He [God] pardoneth and absolveth all them that truly repent"), and as priestly mediation (God "hath given power and commandment to his ministers to declare and pronounce to his people...the absolution and remission of their sins"). The following is the form of absolution for the sick in the Book of Common Prayer: "OUR Lord Jesus Christ, who hath left power to his Church to absolve all sinners who truly repent and believe in him, of his great mercy forgive thee thine offences: And by his authority committed to me, I absolve thee from all thy sins, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen." <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/occasion/sick_visit.html" class="external free" title="http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/occasion/sick_visit.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/occasion/sick_visit.html</a></p>
