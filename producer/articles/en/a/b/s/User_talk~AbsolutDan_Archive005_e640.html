<p>Hi Thanks for your valuable suggestions. I have significantly reduced the essay like nature and also tried to make it more neutral by making simple slight changes.I've also added proper references and external links. Another thing that i realised was that the article should be a part of another article named <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causal_Determinism_b31d.html" title="Causal Determinism">Causal Determinism</a> as that is exactly the aspect of determinism that i've elaborated.That article is anyways a stub.So,i'm gonna support the deletion and add the contents of my to the article mentioned here. Kindly check out the article now and leave me a message if its satisfactory. thanks Raghavb 20:49, 6 July 2006 (UTC)<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fantasy Football</span></h2>
<p>Fantasy Football is an online activity and removing links to NFL.com ESPN.com CBS.com, fantasy rankings, fantasy projections and fantasy software would be censoring information from wikipedians. If a user wants to learn about Fantasy Football, an online event, he does so by visiting sites that play fantasy football or give him fantasy football information. Removing links to those sites is counter productive.</p>
<p><br />
I understand you are trying to remove spam. Tidying up pages is fine. But 'deleting' links is not progress. The page you referred to for fantasy football is in no way as complete as the link list that was on wikipedia.</p>
<p>If you want to continue to make progressive changes for the wikipedia community, do so. But, don't remove links with inferior links. If someone wants to know more about fantasy football, he will do so my continuing to established fantasy football sites where they can play fantasy football. Don't link the wikipedian to sites that are about football, instead of fantasy football. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Amrosent (<a href="../../../a/m/r/User_talk%7EAmrosent_b65d.html" title="User talk:Amrosent">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Amrosent_e776.html" title="Special:Contributions/Amrosent">contribs</a>) 22:19, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Not sure how to add information to this so that it gets to the needed sources, but I wasn't spamming. I'm new to Wikipedia and I'm not sure how it works. I just tested it out by adding some of my most resourcefull pages to the appropriate sources, considering the links on the pages that I found when I was researching the info for my site weren't all that good. I thought it would help out. I thought users would like to see that.</p>
<p>I realize Wiki isn't a source of just links to good info, but its not encouraging me much to help Wikimedia if my additions aren't even noted. I don't think they even looked at my site additions. Sheesh.</p>
<p>Besides, we're not commercial anyhow. We're a collection of 5 graduate students that make articles on biology info.</p>

<p>Hi, Dan. Reviewing your claim on <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> that WikiRoo had been "namecalling" in edit summaries, I thought it exaggerated. "Dissident" isn't even a negative word. I did write a lttle note advising him against using words like "progagandist" in edit summaries, though. But considering that you're in a content conflict with WikiRoo and have recently filed an RFC on him, you might want to consider that actions like WP:PAIN reports for such mild-to-non-existent infractions may reflect badly on you rather than him. I also frankly have a bit of a problem with the note from you that I saw on his page. It's misleading to suggest that editors have an obligation to " try to find something positive to say" to balance critical input that they make. Please review <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, as it's our most important policy. And please don't try to deter people from editing articles "if all you can think of is negativity"; that's misrepresenting <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in a big way.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cellular Automaton</span></h2>
<p>Dan,</p>
<p>First, as a recognised researcher in the field of cellular automata (I am the only person who has ever constructed a self-replicator within von Neumann's 29-state cellular automata), I am well placed to give these comments.</p>
<p>Second, Hiroki Sayama is also a well recognised researcher in this field. I suspect that it is he who added the link which you have construed to be spam. Frankly, the article is relevant to the field, for it discusses models of self-replicators within the space of a cellular automata. The link given is to his paper, as available from an MIT Press website.</p>
<p>Third, while I can agree that the article Cellular Automaton is becoming overly broad in its references, this would also include the mentions of Wolfram's work, and he is clearly interested in self-promotion. I know Wolfram (even if only as a passing acquaintance), and I do not regard his work in ANKOS as being particularly important. Sayama's work is far more relevant to the topic of cellular automata. ANKOS is relevant only as a picturebook of the output of some systems of cellular automata.</p>
<p>Forth, what may be more relevant to your act, is the creation of a list of topical papers, and have a single link to that list within the references section of the Cellular Automaton article. What should not be done is a wholesale exclusion of relevant material.</p>
<p>Finally, in my opinion, the article is poorly named. A cellular automaton is a (single) finite-state automaton that resides within a (single) cell of a system of cellular automata. In this regard, Wolfram is using the language correctly. I find it quite strange that persons having interest in the topic of cellular automata persist in misnaming (see the discussion page of the article for some relevant exchange between editors).</p>
<p>The article should be titled: Cellular Automata. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_R._Buckley_26ad.html" title="User:William R. Buckley">William R. Buckley</a> 16:28, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the near immediate reply. I have been reviewing the Wikipages respecting the issue of spam, and in particular those messages which discuss apparent actions of Scientific American. About this problem, I am probably in agreement with removal of the link, if only because such links are added to inappropriate places. I really do like the idea of having separate pages which list all relevant external publications (be they magazines, books, movies, websites, etc.), with a single link thereto within the references section of other Wikipedia articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The link to Sayama's paper, even though it is through the MIT Press website, is not promotional. Sayama's paper has been published (in 2000), and the link which you removed provides article readers with a means to obtain Sayama's paper. It is not promotional; it is informational. Further, since the paper has been published, it is citable. I will work to find a more suitable place to put such links. Perhaps the Wikipedia community could work with the Scientific American people to adjust their means of providing links. Wikipedia articles would clearly benefit from having external references, such as SciAm articles. It seems the issue is more a matter of how and where such links are obtained and provided. Please know, I do support your deletionist (is that the correct title) activities, even if I do not clearly understand the tendency. I am probably more of the inclusionist bent, even as I hold that Wikipedia should be a strong information source.</dd>

<dd>Finally, I do well appreciate your comment respecting the suitable place to discuss concepts like article naming. In fact, you will find (upon review) that the discussion page for the article Cellular Automaton does already have some debate of this issue.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">cyLEDGE</span></h2>
<p>The cyLEDGE article has now been edited to take into account justified criticisms by several users. Please accept our apologies for what may have seemed excessive or unclear marketing jargon (the jargon which, for better or worse, we are most familar with...), and have done our best to follow the Wiki Style manual. Though cyLEDGE contains the company site as an external link, it is not so much a marketing campaign than it is an attempt to communicate what we are doing and get reactions from other people working or interested in the field. Since there is a natural affinity to cyLEDGE's activities and open-platforms such as Wikipedia, it is important for us to be present there - an additional paragraph has been added to make as clear as possible what the issues at stake are, and which we are trying to come to terms with. I hope you will reconsider your proposed deletion in view of these changes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Knusper (<a href="../../../k/n/u/User_talk%7EKnusper_c8f1.html" title="User talk:Knusper">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Knusper_6535.html" title="Special:Contributions/Knusper">contribs</a>) 16:03, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">WikiRoo</span></h2>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You may very well be right. Two things in which to take solace, though: 1)WikiRoo is now blocked; and 2) IP addresses can't have their talkpages deleted as easily (being multi-user, they don't have a right to vanish of the same kind), so any griping he does from there will be universally visible. If the IP in question is WikiRoo, it is also possible that he's just confused, and didn't realize that asking to vanish meant that he'd be blocked permanently. As an eternal optimist, I still hope he'll figure all that out and set himself to constructive editing. Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 05:13, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I mentioned to GaryWill at his talk, the answer is no. Blocking an IP can lead to inadvertent "collateral damage" (the blocking of innocent users on the same network); as well, it is a virtual certainly that someone else will come to possess WikiRoo's exact current IP address someday (people move -- IPs move too.) For these two reasons, indefinite blocks of IP addresses are forbidden, more or less. The "right to vanish" only exists for registered accounts -- which makes sense, since editing behind an IP is a form of anonimity anyway.

<p>Hi AbsolutDan,</p>
<p>Looking for your support on my first article which I think I've put together properly and nicely. I have quite a few editors saying Keep, but I don't know if a bunch of other people are working together to show up at the last minute with a bunch of delete votes to kill my work. I expected a few like Will who have not cast their vote, so I believe they are holding back till the last minute to ambush this article just before the vote tally, to take away my ability to resolve or comment on their reasons.</p>
<p>I also have ideas for more articles and I don't what to invest too much time if others are going to use tactics to undermine it. This is the vote page and I would appreciate your review and comments and anyone else that may be interested in helping to expand Wiki wiht new content.</p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>I can't believe you would remove the link to a relevant article and leave the other links intact.</p>
<p>C'mon Dan. Do I need to make it a link to a PDF to make it valid? What is the differentiator here?</p>
<p>If people come here for info and value (as I hope they do,) then this link is clearly that and not promotional.</p>
<p>Yes, I run a for profit business, but I do not promote that business anywhere in the article and you have to look carefully for advertising on my site. That is not the case with most of the other articles; who are also "for profit" businesses (even though some pretend to be otherwise.)</p>
<p>I am also well aware of what is appropriate for Wikipedia and see your subjective judgement on the remaining links as very suspicious to say the least.</p>
<p>I wrote a bit of a treatise on this subject some time ago and will share it with you if you are open to another viewpoint if you'd like to email me at jb@tpslean.com</p>
<p>I'm not looking to pick a fight here, but I am a bit tired of people picking and choosing what links can stay or must go based on inconsistent criteria. It just seems to me that something is not working as designed here.</p>
<p>Look over the other links and tell me if they aren't promotional in some way or another. They are; and some are flagrantly advertising.</p>
<p>I wish to contribute every bit as much as the other folks on this site. And yes, like others, I appreciate traffic to my site from Wikipedia as well. Even though thus far it has only been an annoyance.</p>

<dd>Actually, we probably agree much more than you might think on maintaining the integrity of Wikipedia. I believe in its value and also want to preserve it</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't particularly like the argument that now that you are watching the Lean Manufacturing article that all of the previous posts must be relevant. I assure you that what you are calling an olive branch is exactly what most of the other posts are offering.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>If you are being so bold as to take links off an article page because of your supreme knowledge of how things should be, then maybe you should exercise some of this wisdom on the other links. Not to be a smart Alec about it, but is it just luck for the clearly promotional sites you let slip by or are you just doing your job half-way? Either seems insufficient and lacking due diligence.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>In the bigger picture shouldn't we put a category on the site (in the External Links section) for "Related Articles" and "Other Resources?" These links could lead to another wiki page separate from the main article page to avoid clutter and such, but still add value to the visitors.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>All I truly want here is fair treatment and due consideration for what I am trying to contribute.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm going to re-post the article link to a PDF version that does not reside in my main website. Visitors may read the article and benefit from it or not and click on the link on the final page of the article or not as they see fit. I've been told by many people in this field that this article is needed and appreciated. I want to share it. People will vote with their clicks.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>All I ask of you is that you leave my link there for a few days and see if anyone else takes issue with it. If the community determines that it is inappropriate I will pull it myself if they don't beat me to it. That said, if we are to get real "pure" and "letter of the law'ish" about it, then we all have some work to do on the main page, especially regarding the books and external links sections.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I understood you in your previous posts but fail to accept that it is appropriate or sufficient to only cut new posts to the external links section. It just seems to me that someone inclined to help keep wiki clean would be more thorough on the pages they monitor. Perhaps 1400+ pages is just too many to do justice to when it comes to spam hunting?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the meantime, I offered a free and relevant article with no strings attached and it is booted while blatant advertising that links to nothing but homepages and books remains. This is why I feel so indignant about all of this. Doing this job half-way is not doing it correctly in my humble opinion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is not my goal to somehow "beat the system," but there is no way anyone else can chime-in about the appropriateness of my links if you zap them as soon as they show up based on your interpretation of things. That just gives one editor too much power in my opinion. And that power and judgement is only being cast on new posts. Whether or not there is value in a post or a link should certainly be determined by more than one person. That is why I say let the people who know the topic decide.</dd>

<p>Dan tends to use the automated software called "Vandal Proof" to detect vandalism. This amatuerly written malware has a demonstrably high rate of errors due to poor software design.

<dd>Having had a couple hours to reflect on this, and having discussed the matter with a friend, I would like to start by offering my apologies for the reverts I made here today.

Also, I am open to discussing any other edits of mine that you disagree with. Perhaps if we talk about them I may be able to explain my motives or I might better explain why you disagree with them.

<dd>Dan, to reply to your question - as long as you refrain from asserting editorial control over my talk page (in terms of non warning content, that is), I have no problem with debating with you the merits of using the "Vandal Proof" software that intially caused the dispute. Let's do it here on your talk page. <a href="../../../c/s/h/User%7ECshay_6274.html" title="User:Cshay">Cshay</a> 03:59, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My thoughts are that the "Vandal Proof" software tends to hurt the Wikipedia community by erroneously labelling ordinary edits as vandalizations as well as making it far too easy to leave nasty warnings on people's talk page. This last bit tends to attract authoritatian neo-nazi types which is not good in general for the community. <a href="../../../c/s/h/User%7ECshay_6274.html" title="User:Cshay">Cshay</a> 04:16, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Ok good - I think we're talking about <a href="../../../v/i/p/Talk%7EViper_Room_b3ba.html" title="Talk:Viper Room">Talk:Viper Room</a>, right? If so, this is the first edit that I reverted: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AViper_Room&amp;diff=65324169&amp;oldid=63859733" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AViper_Room&amp;diff=65324169&amp;oldid=63859733" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I removed it because it appears to be a relevant discussion to the topic. I remember that specific revert - though I did use VandalProof to perform the revert, I did examine it with my own eyes first and determined it should be reverted.</dd>
<dd>May I ask why you thought the discussion should've been removed? --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:15, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Viper Room revert was an accident on my part which, because of the way the "Vandal Proof" software is designed makes it easy to label people as vandals and warn them as such, and this started the whole disagreement. Still, it points out how this software just makes disagreements much more likely. In my opinion, this software should be banned from use on Wikipedia. If that cannot be done, I intend to point out it's abuses. <a href="../../../c/s/h/User%7ECshay_6274.html" title="User:Cshay">Cshay</a> 04:19, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The process of reverting removals and leaving warning messages is standard practice. Essentially all VP does is make the process speedier. However, I agree with you that there is definitely a chance for such a powerful tool to be used for abuses. The creator, however, knew this and created a special abuse page to report editors who abuse it: <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VP_Abuse_5b0a.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/Abuse">User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/Abuse</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also in its defense, VP lets you choose the type of warning to leave. With the Viper Room revert, I started with the most base warning ({{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest1a-n_0b75.html" title="Template:Test1a-n">test1a-n</a>}}, because I believed even then that it could have been a simple mistake. Since it essentially says "I know you could've made this edit by mistake (etc)", can we agree that the warning was appropriate at the time?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There's also a discussion page at which you can bring up your issues with the software itself: <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VP_Discuss_267c.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/Discuss">User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/Discuss</a>. I've seen from past experience that Ami takes complaints about the software seriously - at one point another user had a similar complaint as you in that the edit summaries of reverts previously said "...by VandalProof" and made it sound like straight-up vandalism. He took this into account and shortened it to the current "VP". So, if you have a suggestion on how to make VP edits more neutral sounding I'm sure he'd be happy to hear from you. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the link. I have posted to that page and proposed that "Vandal Proof" maintain a "complaint page". It is my opinion that this tool is bad for the Wikipedia community.

<dd>You're welcome. I'm sorry that you feel this way about VP, but you're entitled to your own opinion.

<p>I am replying to your removal of the link we added on the deer section of Wikipedia. You removed our link because you consider our site a commerical private site. However, we added the link because we have great resources about deer and hunting. If you were to look through our site you would notice that we have nearly all speicies of north american deer and lots of content on hunting (which is generally associated with deer). Furthermore, we added a link to the exact page of our whitetail deer information page. We sincerely feel that we are adding content value by adding our link. We are a popular site which many people enjoy and benefit from. Our content and dynamic information formt is ever chaning/updating and a great place for people to get information.</p>

<p>Hi AbsolutDan... I just recently rewrote <a href="../../../r/o/o/Root_cause.html" title="Root cause">Root cause</a> (from a different IP), and had rewritten <a href="../../../r/o/o/Root_cause_analysis.html" title="Root cause analysis">Root cause analysis</a> previously. I've noticed that you've done a lot lately to clean up these two entries, and I was wondering if you had any comments/suggestions on the content and/or style of my edits? The previous versions were so bad that, in both cases, I ended up trashing the originals and starting over. Thanks for your help!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of Tobacco Images</span></h2>
<p>Hi Dan, I am wondering why I have been given a last warning for removing tobacco product images from Wikipedia? I had discussed my intentions in the discussion area of the page, and I truly believe that letting tobacco brands be placed on Wikipedia is morally and ethically wrong. Smoking causes so many diseases and deaths each year around the world, so why are there pictures of tobacco brands and products on Wikipedia pages? Are the tobacco companies paying you and/or Wikipedia to let them advertise their addictive and deadly products? It is not necessary for every article on Wikipedia to have images, so why are you defending the tobacco product pages? There are a number of pages on Wikipedia that do not have images, so it is not necessary to have tobacco-related images. I think it is pathetic that you are allowing free advertising for these companies. Tobacco companies are the most deceitful and sneaky companies in the world, who indirectly aim their products at young people and get them addicted, yet Wikipedia is willing to let them advertise and potentially gain new customers that will become addicted to their deadly products. Get back to me please. Gillies corner 01:05, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>hi Dan, thanks for quick response. Ok so the image that i got warning on i can ignore as i realised the error of my ways and added new image with details... old image will be deleted. Assume thats cool. However, it looks like my page is doomed as I dont fit the corpotaion outlines you linked me to. However, I do clearly outline that the name is reference to the corporate world and that the label is not an actual corporation. Does that count for anything and is there anything further you could suggest to help on this one. thanks so much for anonymity 03:58, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">wikipedia spam rules</span></h2>
<p>Hello Dan,</p>
<p>You recently removed some links I placed on various pages for spamming. A lot of those links I agree where spam links, but I am new to wikipedia and was not fully aware of the spam rules.</p>
<p>One link I added was to the <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lean_manufacturing.html" title="Lean manufacturing">lean manufacturing</a> page. The link was:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aster-training.co.uk/content/view/66/103/" class="external text" title="http://www.aster-training.co.uk/content/view/66/103/" rel="nofollow">How to Implement Lean Manufacturing</a> an article written by Paul Wilson who has been implementing lean throughout Europe for many years. Is this not a valid link? The site is a commercial site but also contains many useful articles written by Paul. The subject of the article is ideal for the lean manufacturing page, is it not?</p>
<p>www.leanadvisors.com has many external links throughout pages like <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Productive_Maintenance_0a71.html" title="Total Productive Maintenance">Total Productive Maintenance</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanban.html" title="Kanban">Kanban</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/k/Poka-yoke.html" title="Poka-yoke">Poka-yoke</a> and they are a commercial training company.</p>
<p>Could you please clarify the rules as there appears to be double standards?</p>
