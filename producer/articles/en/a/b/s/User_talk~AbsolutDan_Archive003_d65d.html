<h2><span class="mw-headline">Link removal</span></h2>
<p>I would argue that this link (and a couple of other links from related topics) to this specialist GNU educational content source is of relevant interest to many of the readers interest in the topics, and it is not a promotion of a commercial site. If you look at the destination you will see that it is a pro bono site containing a massive amount of open source technical content for use with e-learning/distance education/LMS/VLE etc. One of the biggest problems educators have with the whole idea of e-learning is the shortage of shareable content, and this pointer to an open content source is useful and encouraging. Most of the GNU content has been contributed privately, but some of it has been derived with acknowledgements from Wikipedia itself, so your decision that to link to it is inappropriate is surprising.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Maintenance tag removal</span></h2>
<p>In the spirit of civility, first of all, there is no such thing as "required" changes on Wikipedia. Secondly, Wikipedia policy is to not use citation in the scientific sense. It's an encyclopedia - that's all. Lastly, no need to raise the vandalism issue (that was way out of line). I noticed that in the past you're quick to call other people "vandals" or "spammers." You need to stop this now.</p>
<p><i>Replying to "Please do not remove maintenance notices from pages unless the required changes have been made. If you are uncertain whether the page requires further work, or if you disagree with the notice, please discuss these issues on the page's talk page before removing the notice from the page. These notices and comments are needed to establish community consensus about the status of an page, and removing them is considered vandalism. Thank you. --AbsolutDan (talk) 20:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)"</i> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDilettante99_3afc.html" title="User:Dilettante99">Dilettante99</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/l/User_talk%7EDilettante99_ddb0.html" title="User talk:Dilettante99">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dilettante99_6932.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dilettante99">contribs</a>) 14:57, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dl>
<dd>There's so many things wrong with your positions that I don't even know where to start. I don't agree with your "work model" in the encyclopedia. We don't need self-appointed "super-editors." Why don't you just focus on a few topics that you know something about, and leave the rest to the other experts. Also, it's ridiculous to think that every topic is going to be a fully-cited scientific monograph. I'll say it again - it's an encyclopedia. Few cites - and they better be good ones (like to a monograph or review article). Lastly, don't hide behind some standard message/template, when you call someone a vandal or spammer - libel is libel is libel.</dd>

<dd><i>The original message I left on your talk page ([1]) is not my own wording. It is a standard Wikipedia template that is recommended for placing on a user's talk page who has removed maintenance tags. The template is ... . While it may not be "honey and flowers", it is cordial and is intended to convey the importance of maintenance tags. If you disagree with the need for a particular maintenance tag, it is important to either do the requested work or discuss it on the article's talk page. Simply removing the tag can and often is interpretted as vandalism. I don't make up these rules, I just help to convey them. Regarding citing, it actually is Wikipedia policy that information in articles should be cited. See WP:CITE for guidelines regarding citing. As for my other edits, a number of the messages I leave on users' talk pages are templates like the above. Check out Template:TestTemplates for a complete list of the templates I use. Again, I don't write them, I just use them. Yes I do at times refer to some as spammers or vandals. If I were to rob a convenience store, I would be labeled a thief. Likewise, if someone spams or vandalizes, they will be referred to as a spammer or vandal. It's a label given based on behavior. I believe I'm fairly careful about labeling though - if a person inserts only one spam link, I may still leave a template message, but I won't necessarily refer to them as a spammer. In your case, the only edit of yours I questioned was the template removal, so I don't consider you a vandal and never referred to you as such. Please understand that the work I do here is primarily fighting vandalism and removing spam; as such it may seem like all I do is warn. If you pick through my edits though you'll notice that if anyone replies to my messages in a civil manner I do take the time to reply in kind. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns about either my edits or Wikipedia in general. --AbsolutDan (talk) 18:53, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>I appreciate your vigilance in keeping Wikipedia free of useless and irrelevant knowledge. I understand that Wikipedia is a community effort and it is wonderful that people like yourself have the dedication to create this invaluable resource. As a personal acquaintance of Jimmy Wales, I fully support the goals and mission of Wikipedia, and would do nothing intentionally to derail that effort nor to breach Wikipedia's policies.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I am hoping you can elaborate on why you deleted my link to the <a href="http://www.junglephotos.com/africa/afplants/trees/palm.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.junglephotos.com/africa/afplants/trees/palm.shtml" rel="nofollow">borassus palm photo and information page</a> on the Jungle Photos website. The photo page contains a picture and an internal link to additional <a href="http://www.junglephotos.com/africa/afplants/trees/palmnathist.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.junglephotos.com/africa/afplants/trees/palmnathist.shtml" rel="nofollow">natural history information.</a> I am sure that this photo and information would be useful to students, teachers and travellers who wanted to know more about this fascinating tree.</p>
<p>For me, the point is that I spent thousands of dollars getting this and other photos and spent several years in school obtaining advanced degrees in biology that enable me to bring a certain expertise to the subject matter. I am just not prepared to put this work out there in the public domain where it can be freely copied without acknowledgment of any kind. I guess I am just not that altruistic.</p>
<p>I am not entirely selfish, either. Over the years, I have made corrections to Wikipedia articles where I see mistakes, and added paragraphs here and there where I have noted omissions. But I do not want to put my entire intellectual and artistic effort into Wikipedia. Hence, I created Jungle Photos. Maybe one day, I'll hand over everything in Jungle Photos to Wikipedia (Jimmy and I talked about this) but right now I want some recognition for my efforts. By removing the link you are depriving Wikipedia visitors of the very thing they seek, which is free information (albeit on my page it is not copyright free). It would seem a shame that a website such as mine with its rich variety of subject matter, photos and high quality content should be denied to the very people you so diligently serve: the Wikipedia visitor.</p>
<p>I have just begun a wiki project on my own website, <a href="http://www.junglephotos.com/wiki/" class="external text" title="http://www.junglephotos.com/wiki/" rel="nofollow">Jungle Wiki</a>, and once I receive contributions, I will be happy to share those with Wikipedia.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I would appreciate a detailed consideration of your thinking on this subject.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Right, so then ... what counts as notable?</span></h2>
<p>Or, rather, how does something become notable if it isn't presented?</p>
<p>Though I'm expressly told not to take offence to my article being marked for deletion consideration, I have to admit that I am. What I thought set Wikipedia apart from other user-driven information sources was its grass-roots feel and breadth of content. I can see all-out advertising as being offensive, but why is a single individual able to determine what is considered "notable"&#160;?</p>
<p>Should you run a similar search on "Rose Colored Glass", a popular band of the seventies with two national hit records, you'd quickly strike through with your digital red pen any article featuring them, proclaiming that since Google did not pull up many web pages featuring their work they are clearly "not notable". However, Dick Clark would beg to differ, seeing as he once greeted them on the set of American Bandstand where they performed aforementioned hits.</p>
<p>Bottom line? I'd like to know what gives a single user the right to define noteworthy content, as I'm suddenly getting a very sour taste in my mouth about the whole thing. (And I obviously wouldn't seek to contribute if I wasn't already an avid reader. In fact, my boyfriend re-wrote the current article on agnosticism, and a good friend holds the title of creator for the article featuring the U.S. dollar and the gold standard debate. I'm not saying either of these facts makes me "wiki-worthy". I don't enjoy riding on coattails. My contributions are worthy in their own right. It's just a bit frustrating to be written off so quickly.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>On second thought, perhaps it does make sense in the context of a traditional encyclopaedia. Richard Kelly was a prodigious film student before the release of 'Donnie Darko', his overnight cult hit. Should he have attempted to make mention of it before its eventual fame in an encyclopaedic interface, I can see how it would appear rather backwards.</p>
<p>I suppose given the fact that this is simply the latest of many successful projects I have undertaken that it gave it a bit more buoyancy. (After all, the original edit credited it to me, and I have pages of Google hits, should that be the issue.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the better way to go is with a larger project that's garnished more notoreity. Leave the fledgling to walk before expecting an audience to watch it run.</p>

<p>Mmm... Indeed, Custom Wars may not have notibility yet. However seeing as beta hasn't been released, only time will tell. I, personally, expect atleast 1000 downloads within the beta release week. Even though the AW Community is a small one, this is big news there. It's going to get some notability from the press alone on the larger sites.</p>
<p>So, I implore, let it be until we see how it goes. Until then I plan on expanding the article to have a short guide of new content.</p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>You'd left me a message saying that I shouldn't add external commercial links or links to my own personal site on the KM page. However, I didn't add a commercial link or link to my own site. I added in the link for the Knowledge Management Professional Society (KMPro). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Knowledge_management&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58617643" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Knowledge_management&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58617643" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Knowledge_management&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=58617643</a></p>
<p>KMPro is a non-profit organization and is the world's largest KM professional society. I added the link because although I saw the link to the Canadian Institute of Knowledge Management (which isn't either a non-profit or a professional society/association) I realized KMPro wasn't listed and that certainly seemed to be an oversight.</p>
<p>FYI...I am a Meta Editor ("hudson") for the Open Directory Project (dmoz.org), and have been involved in that since nearly day one and a Meta Editor for six years. I understand well the goals of Wikipedia, but don't understand your rationale for not allowing this link. I'm hoping that you simply didn't understand the nature of the link and that you'll reconsider. Feel free to contact me at [e-mail address removed -Dan] if you'd like to ask other questions.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">KM Page</span></h3>
<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>Understand. Yes, did just signup -- primarily because I had been adding in links in Open Directory that were links to content in WP, and I followed a trackback to the WP page that had the other links. So while I wasn't necessarily coming to the page to add content so much as to look at it to see what other links were there (which is how ODP often finds new links), I realized that KMPro wasn't there and figured that was an oversight.</p>
<p>But adding an article/content is definitely a possibility and had thought about that when I realized that I do know personally some of the folks that have contributed to the current content there. I have over 16 years working in KM, along with a Ph.D. in management so I imagine that I might have something to add.</p>
<p>As for your question about the links and ODP -- every link there on that WP KM page is now contained inside of the ODP, and you could certainly list one single link that would cover that as well as anything that someone would want to submit as a general link (meaning not referred to directly in an article). That link would be as follows: <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Reference/Knowledge_Management/" class="external free" title="http://www.dmoz.org/Reference/Knowledge_Management/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dmoz.org/Reference/Knowledge_Management/</a> . That would take them to the top level inside of ODP's KM area, and from there they can do a search anywhere inside of that category.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pink Toe Tarantula</span></h2>
<p>Greetings AbsolutDan, I'm Lucas, I noticed that you have taged me for the links that I have added in regards to the pink toe tarantula. I know and understand that you patrol RC here on wikipedia. I do the same on wikiHow. However since I don't regularly work with wikipedia I might be at a bit of a disadvantage as to how things are done around here. On wikiHow we encourage relevant links in regards to the article. As a tarantula keeper I have found that many people have no idea how to properly care for a tarantula as a pet and they regularly go neglected or die prematurley. I arssure you that none of my added links are comercial or personal sites as you have indicated with you rubber stamp message. I only tried to contribute relevant educational information.</p>
<p>Since I'm only put down with all my edits, perhaps you can let me know how dose and average guy like me actually contribute to wikipedia. I spend normally 8 hours a day working on wikiHow.com and I would like to contribute to wikipedia as well without being a bother.</p>
<p>Any guildence for a novice like me&#160;??</p>

I was trying to be strictly neutral when I wrote the article, and I have no affiliation with the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild_for_Exceptional_Children_19b1.html" title="Guild for Exceptional Children">Guild for Exceptional Children</a>. I wasn't able to find any information about litigation in which it was involved or even any criticism from families or other agencies. Could you please take another look at the article and make whatever edits seem appropriate to you, so that the advert label can be removed? I added a bit more information to the history section. I think because of the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild_for_Exceptional_Children_19b1.html" title="Guild for Exceptional Children">Guild for Exceptional Children</a>'s size and 50-year-history, as well as its profile in the community, it's clearly notable, and I tried to do the best I could with the information I had available. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> 04:39, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My intention was to point out to the world that the field of KM is not in such a great standing as one might get from reading the page as it is now. Therefore I added some important issues that are important to the "well being" of the field. I was not asking to have a discussion on the KM page but rather expected that when updating/changing the page, you will react on these issues- meaning adding some of yours, editing mine and rather commenting on rules and regulations and not addressing the issues in your edits. I believe that my contibutions changed twice while reacting to your previous deletions <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Schmoozing (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchmoozing_580d.html" title="User talk:Schmoozing">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Schmoozing_aec0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Schmoozing">contribs</a>) 17:56, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>The vast majority of Wikipedia edits are not discussed on talk pages before they are added. Also, you clearly did not verify the authenticity of the links.

If you then review <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bondag_5ec1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bondag">Bondag's edits</a>, you'll see his only edits were to add the same link to 3 articles, one of which he wrote.

<dd>In general, I think spam patrol is fine. In cases like this, however, (a professional topic) some slack might be warranted here and there. A few months ago, I went to the U.S. association's discussion forum and tried to recruit editors for these types of articles. I got <i>zero</i> replies!&#160;:-( When I see someone who actually knows enough about the topic to even <i>be aware of a link</i>, I want to encourage them (assume good faith - don't bite the newbies, as it were). If a spam patrol "slaps them on the hand" with a terse and interpretably confrontational revert, I'm not at all surprised it's so hard to get newbies to dig into sparse but specialized articles.
