<p>To be honest, the "abstruse subjects", especially the ones about history, didn't strike me as "abstruse". For example, the articles under the "Mexican Revolution" sub-section are subjects that are bound to be mentioned when the writer talks about the Mexican Revolution - and I don't find them more "abstruse" than the "Mexican Revolution" described in some authentic history research books. I would suggest giving excerpts and writing some prose regarding every one of the abstruse subjects listed out here, and showing why they are abstruse and how they are mentioned in the book. Otherwise there's no way of defining, for example, how one topic is more abstruse than the other. Another thing: Constantinople, I think, is called "Istanbul" in modern times. Moreover it's not an European geographical location - it's both European and Asian. Mexico is in North America by some definitions, but more precisely it's in Central America. I have made changes regarding these to the article. Another question: What "Macedonia" is the list referring to? The current one lists to a disambiguation page, which gives three definitions of Macedonia - the historical region, the region in Greece and the modern country. I have also removed "Landmines" from the list of Abstruse subjects, which is too general (like, "<a href="../../../p/e/n/Pencil.html" title="Pencil">pencils</a>" and "<a href="../../../r/u/l/Ruler.html" title="Ruler">rulers</a>") unless you can give an example of how the book specifically talked about landmines.<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranherunar_05c3.html" title="User:Aranherunar">User:Aranherunar</a>|<a href="../../../a/r/a/User_talk%7EAranherunar_ee4b.html" title="User talk:Aranherunar">heru</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aranherunar_c9f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aranherunar">nar</a> 07:56, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm changing back some of these edits, keeping some others:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Mexico is in North America by every definition. "Central America" is sometimes used, but that introduces confusion becuse the nations from Guatamala to Costa Rica are usually considered the bounds of Central America. Also, there is no need to say "Americas". If we have information that South America is a location, we can change it to Americas if that is found to be convenient.</li>
<li>As a matter of convenience, we can put things like "Mexican Revolution" and "Marco Polo" in lists with abstruse topics. The "topic" of "Mexican Revolution" may not be abstruse at all, but information to be found in those articles may be.</li>
<li>"Constantinople" was the name used in the book, apparently. The standard for this is what would be easy for the reader. I have no objection to your putting in "Istanbul" in parentheses, but if Pynchon says "Constantinople" then we help the reader by saying "Constantinople." Moreover, it's in Europe — consult any geography book.</li>
<li>I have no idea which "Macedonia" is referred to. Leave it in and let the reader figure it out, or wait for a reader who knows to make a change. Until then, the "Macedonia" link is of some use.</li>
<li>Landmines — like "Macedonia" it's referenced in the book apparently, and keep it in the topics as an aid to the reader until some reader who knows that a more specific topic or no reference at all is needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, these topics have been put in because some book review has said they were mentioned in the book. If you have any information showing that the topic is irrelevant, then we can talk. Until then, each topic stays.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 22:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Looking again at your edits, I actually don't see anything at all that's justifiable. I thought there was something, but apparently I was mistaken. I'm reverting them all.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:05, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, I found it. One thing: "Citation needed" in Abstruse words" I'll keep that and fix it in time. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:07, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmines.html" title="Landmines">Landmines</a> should be expanded to include <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamite.html" title="Dynamite">dynamite</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitroglycerine.html" title="Nitroglycerine">nitroglycerine</a>; it may go with <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison_gas.html" title="Poison gas">poison gas</a>, already on the list, as well; the spirit of <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Nobel_e5b5.html" title="Alfred Nobel">Alfred Nobel</a> floats over this book; things blow up both to build anew and destroy. There's a fair bit of discussion of the science of explosives, and it's an ongoing theme.</dd>
<dd>I think it would be useful to just let this page build for a while. Another theme that's not yet well represented in this list is the detailed discussion of refining metals and mixing alloys, with a bit of <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a> thrown in. This is, after all, a book about a bunch of miners. I think it would be useful to try to add and build on this article right now, and see where it goes; remember, this book has popular reviews out, but the academic journal reviews are not yet out, so there is going to be a lot of change to how the book is perceived and there's going to be a lot to add. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 00:23, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>One more uncivil use of words like "rubbish" "silly" and "ridiculous" and you'll be reported; you've been repeatedly advised and you have repeatedly ignored the warnings.</li>
<li>Reasons have been given. Repeatedly. Simply because you refuse to accept them doesn't mean you rule. You might advance your argument further if you could give much more specific citations in Wikipedia guidelines, but you'd still have to show that your interpretation was best. I have also agreed that changes should be made as actual readers who are more knowledgeable about the subject than you or I eventually take a hand in editing this. Until then, I repeat yet again, let's serve those readers by making resources available to them as usefully as we can. Removing information is not useful to those readers.</li>

<dd><a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranherunar_05c3.html" title="User:Aranherunar">User:Aranherunar</a>, please note that you deleted a number of changes I made to this article, including changes that I have discussed, such as adding discussion of explosives. Please, let this build and let people work on it for a while. If you have thoughts on material to add, or changes to make other than wholesale reverts and deletions, please make them. And please revert those changes; it represents some significant work, and it included references and textual discussion, both things you have been looking for. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 11:38, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I waited a few hours for a response before reverting, and I see you've been active in that time. Please, I ask you, let people work on this article without these wholesale periodic reverts of the work. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 14:09, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I apologize for my mistaken revert and for not noticing the message here. If necessary, you can put a comment on my talk page next time.</dd>
<dd>I have made similar changes this time without reverting, some of which I feel perfectly meets the demands by Noroton. I would like users here to comment on all the changes I made instead of letting Noroton asserting them all useless without much of a glance and reverting them all. What I feel most justifiable is the combination of the history section and the Abstruse subjects section (this, after all, is about the Abstruse subjects), the deletion of the Years (totally useless, as I have said), changing Constantinople to Constantinople (Istanbul) - Constantinople is out of use for centuries, and putting it under a separate sub-section "Europe and Asia" - read the article itself, changing "North America" to "The Americas" - Mexico, by United Nations definition, is in Central America, not North America, and putting "Abstruse words" under "Abstruse subjects" - as I have said, it is the <i>usage</i> of abstruse words that make them notable, not the abstruse words themselves. Other minor changes are not substantial, merely suggestions that make the article easier to read.</dd>
<dd>I feel there should be a longer lead and another section, detailing the reactions or commentaries on the book's abstruse subjects, which would make the notability more obvious. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranherunar_05c3.html" title="User:Aranherunar">Aran</a>|<a href="../../../a/r/a/User_talk%7EAranherunar_ee4b.html" title="User talk:Aranherunar">heru</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aranherunar_c9f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aranherunar">nar</a> 04:37, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_America_93d9.html" title="Central America">Central America</a> for the usual definition of Central America; I would suggest that you see <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> for the Wikipedian standards of civility, but I've done that several times, even quoting the relevant passage, and nothing seems to penetrate; I've made my point on Constantinople/Istanbul and don't need to make it again; ditto with years; you haven't made any argument justifying "Americas" over "North America", but I have; I don't believe notability standards apply to sections of articles, just articles themselves, and that seems to be what Wikipedia guidelines refer to when they talk about notability. I've put a title on this discussion to make it easier to edit. Merry Christmas! <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 02:01, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In adding and building out a section on explosives here (and the book really is a tutorial on explosives and their history), I note that there are a number of items that really belong in multiple sections -- e.g., Haymarket bombing belongs in Explosives and US Labor History. What's preferable in the way of cross reference?</p>
<p>Also, does it make sense to break out the Science/Math discussion a bit- perhaps into Light and Explosives as subsets of the bigger category? <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 20:53, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
