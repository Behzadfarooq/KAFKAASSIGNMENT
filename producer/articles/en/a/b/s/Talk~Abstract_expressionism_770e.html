<p>"Although it is true that spontaneity or of the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. An exception might be the drip paintings of Pollock."</p>
<p>I believe this statement is based on a misconception about "Jack the Dripper" and his paintings, one which I shared until I read of the computer analysis related here: <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2001/nov/featpollock" class="external autonumber" title="http://discovermagazine.com/2001/nov/featpollock" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and here:<a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc99/9_18_99/mathland.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc99/9_18_99/mathland.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which discovered fractal patterns in Pollock's works. As the Discover article says, "Pollock's drip method was as complex and exquisitely controlled as it seemed crude and haphazard. It often took him weeks to achieve the fractal layerings in his paintings..."</p>
<p>Just FYI.</p>

<p>you had Willem dekooning listed twice so I removed the second one.</p>
<p>HELP!</p>
<p>ok well im trying to go through the artists and make it so its a direct link on all of them rather then going to a breakdown of all of people named that, the one i am working on now is Paul Jenkins and i am trying to do that but whenever i try to change it it never works, i try the thing which is</p>
<p>Paul Jenkins (Us painter)|Paul Jenkins</p>
<p>and it doesnt work, i would like someone to try to get thqat to work because its not working for me&#160;:( thanks</p>

<p>Somebody added <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piet_Mondriaan_cc55.html" title="Piet Mondriaan">Piet Mondriaan</a> as an abstract expressionist, but I've removed him.

I disagree, as I find that alot of Mondrains work is abstract,as he create images of landscapes that appear to be a selection of squares.Just because he didnt produce work in New York before and after WW II , why should that effect him being an adstract expressionist??</p>

<p>Abstract Art and Abstract Expressionism are not the same, but is a difference of kind, not degree. Jackson Pollack, Mondrian, and Kandinsky, all mentioned in this article, as being an example of Abstract Expressionism is simply wrong. The above were pure abstraction. An article at the; "The Bulfinch Guide to Art History"; <a href="http://artchive.com/artchive/abex.html" class="external free" title="http://artchive.com/artchive/abex.html" rel="nofollow">http://artchive.com/artchive/abex.html</a> strongly suggest a distinct difference of Pure abstraction and Abstract Expression. Edvard Munch, altered images to enhance the expression of his depiction of horror in his painting, The Scream. Pure abstraction has no pointed expression motive behind their works. The practice of altering and/or adding abstract elements into a more expressive image has influenced the art of commercial images. Van Gogh's work, A Starry Night, has all the elements of abstract expressionism. Excellent expressionism reference at; <a href="http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style20-Expressionism.htm" class="external free" title="http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style20-Expressionism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style20-Expressionism.htm</a> G.E.Wolfe</p>
<p><br />
My understanding of Abstract Expressionism is that it is a term applied to American Artists painting abstract work after World War II. Certainly there have been many painters painting abstractly before that. Modrian and Kandinsky certainly do not fit into that category. If you think Jackson Pollack is not an Abstract Expressionist, so be it. I will not argue. How Edvard Munch is the founder of Abstract Expressionism, I do not know. Ed Lynch</p>
<p><br />
"How Edvard Munch is the founder of Abstract Expressionism, I do not know." I agree and corrected my view. Thanks! G.E.Wolfe</p>

<p>A high-handed editor (not signed in) deleted the link to <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulgee.html" title="Gulgee">Gulgee</a>. Gulgee is directly relevant to the article's discussion of the international influence of this movement and its connection to the cold-war era projection of US cultural prestige and power. Since the person who deleted the link apparently didn't bother to look at the relevant articles in order to see the relevance and sources, I will quote here from the <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elaine_Hamilton_23e9.html" title="Elaine Hamilton">Elaine Hamilton</a> article:</p>
<p><b>According to Partha Mitter in <i>Indian Art</i> (Oxford History of Art), Elaine Hamilton was an important influence on the young Pakistani artist Ismail Gulgee (or Guljee, as it is sometimes spelled): "Impressed by the visiting American artist Elaine Hamilton, Guljee enthusiastically plunged into action painting...." [p.214]. In fact, according to David Craven, Hamilton became something of an ambassador for abstract expressionism in South Asia: "[Abstract expressionism] was promoted as a 'universal style' in Pakistan during the 1950s by a U.S. artist named Elaine Hamilton" [p. 23].</b></p>

<p>I would propose removing Marcel Duchamp from the list of AE artists. He produced virtually no original art of his own after 1923, and surely would not have subscribed to the ethos of AE, as it is a classic example of what he termed "retinal painting". He also advocated the divorce of art from subjective feeling, considering that art was an expression of idea, rather than inherently aesthetic. If no one disagrees here within 7 days, I'll knock him off the list. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnegin1_e656.html" title="User:Onegin1">Steve James</a> 15:06, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The quote "Since the subject matter was often totally abstract it became a safe strategy for artists to pursue this style. Abstract art could be seen as apolitical. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders" is highly objectionable. Abstract artists were held to just as much, if not more, scrutiny as other artists. Abstract art was not a safe political move; artists were even called on to "explain" their work as part of the anti-communist crusades. This statement should be removed. --Calegreen 01:11, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If not removed, it certainly requires supporting citations. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnegin1_e656.html" title="User:Onegin1">Steve James</a> 09:27, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Steve but would go farther. The statement requires not only citation but more context, including citation of opposing viewpoints. Though the statement as it stands is little more than a dawb of hostile graffiti, simply removing it would be the rude and lazy option. Better to flesh it out, expand on it, balance it, sourcing everything generously. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarylandArtLover_6b2e.html" title="User:MarylandArtLover">MdArtLover</a> 16:54, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This assumes a relationship between style in art and trends, which is really another way of saying styles, and that which is going on in the social and political realm beyond the artist's studio. While this relationship can be a tight one, I think it is more often impossible to tie artistic changes with the goings on in the world around them. It is an interesting theory. It could have relevance. But without citations it is original research. I therefore would just suggest tagging it as a questionable fact. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 17:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
