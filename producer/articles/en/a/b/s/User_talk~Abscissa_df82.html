<p>I thought the above welcome was in order - both for the sentiment, and for the usefulness of the links. As for your particular question, about your edits being labelled with a <b>top</b>: this isn't anything at all to worry about. It simply signifies that the edit in question is still the latest one, hence is on "top" in the history. For example, at the time of this writing, you were the last person to edit my talk page, which you can see by looking at the page's history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Peruvianllama&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Peruvianllama&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a>. But even just by looking at your contributions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Abscissa" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Abscissa" rel="nofollow">here</a>, you could tell that you were the last person to edit my talk page, since that edit is marked with the aforementioned <b>top</b>. Hope that clears things up! --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeruvianllama_baf8.html" title="User:Peruvianllama">P</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeruvianllama_baf8.html" title="User:Peruvianllama">ruvianLlama</a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeruvianllama_bd23.html" title="User talk:Peruvianllama">spit</a>)</small></sup> 03:30, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks. I definitely understand about having bad days. Sometimes I'm a little sensitive in the other direction and I worry that it's the racists here who are so eager to label every biography on Wikipedia by their ethnicity. Clearly not the case with you. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeruvianllama_baf8.html" title="User:Peruvianllama">PeruvianLlama</a> is right that most of us archive our talk pages instead of simply deleting stuff, but I've taken the liberty of re-removing my earlier warning, since I don't think it serves a real purpose at this point. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 14:53, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing up those point about my edits to the "Unan1mous" article. I actually did not fully remove the whole controversy section, that was done in this edit (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unan1mous&amp;diff=47403312&amp;oldid=47284054" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unan1mous&amp;diff=47403312&amp;oldid=47284054" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unan1mous&amp;diff=47403312&amp;oldid=47284054</a>). I fully agree that now someone has pointed out the IMDB page, the information relating ot Adam should be added back in.</p>
<p>My biggest reason for removing the porn link was that I didn't know the WP policy for including "adult" (and yes, it's relatively mild, but still "adult") links inside articles that one wouldn't expect to link to such material. I think the fact that he has done adult photography definitely should be included since there is that proof, but I'm still on the fence about whether or not that link should actually be present in the main article. If you feel that it's ok being there, feel free to add it back in and I won't remove it -- I just wanted to stay on the safe side without knowing if that link would be allowed according to WP policies or not. --SSTwinrova 22:23, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually I read an article about the transformation of this city in a Swedish newspaper (link <a href="http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&amp;a=532049" class="external free" title="http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&amp;a=532049" rel="nofollow">http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&amp;a=532049</a> ). The author referes to Baudrillard in his discussion.</p>
<p>Dubai fulfils the modern dream of a global village. It is a designed mix of commers and postmodern kitsch. The "team" that are directing Dubais transformation "into hyperreality" consists of consults, engineers and PR-people. They are gathered from all of the world but mostly from America and Europe, and their job is to design and market the city.</p>
<p>They are building exotic mysticicm with different layers of simulated and real modernity. There are a miniature version of Empire State Building housing the citys own version of Hard Rock Cafe. They are actually building the worlds largest building - Burg Dubai - half a mile high. But most of all they try to transmitte a stronger feeling of beeing in the middle east than any other "authentic" middle-eastern city can offer.</p>

<p>I'd strongly recommend not dragging in anything personal like that info an AfD debate - even if the information is public on his user page, bringing it up would still be implying a motivation for AfDing the page beyond simply believing that the page doesn't belong in Wikipedia... in other words, it would be an accusation of bad faith. Which certainly is a personal attack around here. Looking away from "personal attacks are a no-no" for a moment and speaking pragmatically, bringing that sort of thing up is unlikely to be productive: the closing admin should discount votes made without reasoning about the page (as opposed to the person), and personal arguments are just going to make the whole AfD more of a grudge match than it already is. I'd stick to pointing out the history of the deletion nomintations for the page, and listing reasons why you think the page should be kept, focusing on the content (or potential future content) of the article. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 04:09, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>About the advertisement tag, I consider the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_shock_sites.html" title="List of shock sites">List of shock sites</a> to be in violation of Wikipedia's policy of no advertisement/promotion because it is giving publicity to shock sites that are not significant enough to merit their own articles. Only 3 of the 20+ sites mentioned there have their own articles, and one of those is being nominatied for deletion. I am not the only one to comment on the article being like an advertisement, and as this issue is currently disputed, I believe that the tag should remain for the time being. - Conrad Devonshire 04:15, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>All custom boxes begin with &lt;div style and end with |} or your box will not display properly.</p>
<p>You can closely look at the construction of the box this way. 1st is the box border color of solid darkblue. 2nd is the background color around the image (white). 3rd is the image shown by brackets then image name. 4th you'll see is text for the userbox. Click (Edit this page) and view the code. Play around with the colors, image, and text for what you'd like to see. Box types are limitless.

<p>Actually, the odds of losing by <b>not</b> swapping has more to do with the number of doors at the outset than anything else. Starting with only three doors seems to be the most likely way to confound the greatest number of people, and that is the point after all. Imagine if you will that the "show" were to be lengthened so as to accommodate say one hundred doors with Monty dutifully revealing ninety-eight goats each night - wow! wouldn't that be a thriller, no viewers, no sponsors and no show. So, lets reduce the number of doors to the minimum - three. That way we can maximize the confusion (along with our profit). Clever. Look at the folks here at WP that are unwilling to "see the light", some marketeer got wealthy over that one!<br />

<p>Hi Abscissa. I completely agree with you and your reasoning over Ms Hopkins and her vanity article. But can you point me to a speedy deletion criterion that allows me to delete it?</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD</a>-A7 says: <b>Unremarkable people or groups/Vanity Pages</b>. An article about a real person, group of people, band, or club that does not assert the importance or significance of its subject.</p>
<p>Note the <i>does not assert the importance or significance of its subject</i>. This article does <i>assert</i> significance, although the assertions aren't up to much. Nevertheless, they exist - <i>"Melissa was employed at The Times managing the media relations office" "Melissa worked for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. She created, developed and managed an interactive radio actuality and satellite teleconferencing program for 25 Republican U.S. Senate candidates" "Conducted on-air interviews with U.S. Senators, Governors, high profile U.S. Senate staff" "credits have included roles for NBC television in “Sisters” and “Days of Our Lives”. As a member of L.A Theatre Works, appeared in Exchange for National Public Radio and BBC radio".</i> All of these are assertions of notability of one sort or another.</p>
<p>I don't think <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> allows me to speedy delete. However, I'm happy hear the community consensus at AfD (you could push for a speedy delete result there - personally, I would vote for deletion) to find if the community feels that a large pile of small notabilities add up to actual notability or not. I just don't see it as a speedy delete under the existing criteria.

<p>Hi, Sorry about the delay. From looking at my System Profiler, it looks like mine came with 128 in one slot, and 256 in the other. You might notice a bit of an improvement, but it probably wouldn't be that dramatic unless you were running something more resource-intensive. For things like video editing, I've noticed that my iBook handles two videos at the same time badly; the key is to change the power settings to "better performance" and this seems to clear it up well, but it drinks the battery. Anyway, they've got the new MacBooks out now so that's always an option too.</p>

<p>Hello Abscissa! I'm sorry if you have gotten tired of my timeless page edits. I am not as familiar with Wikipedia as I should (if it isn't obvious, I finally figured out how to chat with users). I really do appreciate what the Wikipedia team has done with this website. An open source of information is a precious contribution to society. But as open and uncensored as Wikipedia has become, I still do not understand why the codez4mac link has been censored time and time again. This is not an attempt of vandalism. I only want the viewers of Wikipedia to know that there are alternative websites to serials.to. Is this not what others want? Wouldn't they want to be aware of alternatives? Thanks - (This comment added by 71.141.157.145)</p>

<p>As per my post above, the deliberate use of exaggeration can be helpful for some to achieve their "Aha!" moment and I think that your addition of the banner is just fine. I believe that the problem starting with only three doors is the most difficult to grasp which of course why it is done that way. I was hoping to provide a tongue-in-cheek example that wasn't too belittling that we could point out when all else has failed to convert someone or whenever appropriate. Please feel free to edit the "article" or its talk towards that end. On the other subject, true. It's a time and energy thing and both seem in short supply these days but I'll take your comment as compliment and thank you for your confidence in us.&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/User_talk%7EHydnjo_4abf.html" title="User talk:Hydnjo">talk</a> 12:27, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, thanks for the joke although it's really only a chuckler for me. I'm a big fan of the engineer, mathematician, physicist jokes (if you don't know these, let me know), and I really like absurdist jokes (e.g. "Q. How many zen masters does it take to change a light bulb? A. A tree in a golden forest."). Two of my all time favorites:</p>
<p>A blond, brunette, and redhead are on an elevator. Their mutual boss gets on and stands in front of them. The brunette notices he's got a pretty bad case of dandruff. After he gets off, she turns to the redhead and says "we should give him some Head and Shoulders". The redhead says "yeah, sounds like a good idea". They turn to the blond. She says, "OK, I guess I'm in, too. But how do you give <i>shoulders</i>?".</p>
<p>A doctor, architect, and computer scientist are arguing about God's first profession. The doctor says, "Well, God removed a rib from Adam to make Eve which was clearly a surgical procedure". The architect interrupts, "Long before the Garden of Eden, God made the heavens and earth out of chaos - clearly an architectural feat.". The computer scientist says, "Where do you think the chaos came from?".</p>

<p>I'd like you to know that I'm a rather non-confrontational person and I have no wish to begin any sort of unproductive shouting match with you or anyone else. I'm a strong believer in the "agree to diagree" philosophy. Though I <b>strongly</b> disagree with your opinion, I'd be the first person to protect your right to hold it. After all, we're both Canadians, eh?&#160;:) That's part of our culture. (Btw, it's entirely up to you to keep this info confidential, but since you're from Canada, where in Canada do you live? Again, if you prefer not to answer the question, that's your right too.)</p>
<p>However, I think you misread my post (or perhaps your own). You did not merely state that you were ashamed of Israel. That would be one thing. Rather, you stated that you were ashamed to be a Jew. Reread your post. That's what it says. My response was simply that if you're ashamed to be a Jew, you're under no obligation to refer to yourself as such.</p>
<p>I'm a strong believer and a big fan of lively intellectual debate, provided that it remains civil, that mutual respect is maintained at all times, and that all parties ultimately "agree to disagree" in the end.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, whether they do see the hole cards live or not is irrelevant to whether it is illegal or not for them to do so. The unsupported claim that it's illegal is the center of my recent edits.</dd>

<dd>Also, if you can reference the VVP biography where he comments about how he has to pretend to be excited, that's exactly the kind of content that the article needs. After all, WPT is a television program, and production details are interesting and appropriate for an article about a television program.</dd>

<p>Hey, good addition to the Unsolved Problems of Philosophy article (re: Induction). I'm a bit concerned about your editing my moral luck section, though. It's probably more perspicuous the way you've written it, but are you sure that your description is actually more accurate/illustrative? Oh, you can reply to my talk page, please. Thanks! <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielpi_dd1f.html" title="User:Danielpi">Danny Pi</a> 13:33, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, my explanation was largely a paraphrase of Linda Zagzebski's characterization of it. To summarize, I would say that moral luck is the disconnect between justified action and the resultant state of affairs. The "luck" element affecting the "resultant state of affairs". So, I may have perfectly good intentions, but the result of those actions may be "bad" or "good" arbitrarily depending on "luck". What you're describing in your version of the article is "moral luck" as Bernard Williams describes it. And that's okay, because he did invent the <i>term</i> "moral luck", although the philosophical problem was debated for a considerable time before Williams. My objection would be that 1) Williams is only considering a certain case of moral luck, 2) Williams is really considering the meta-ethical problem, rather than the problem proper. So I think the prior use of the word "luck" in relation to morality, and the subsequent [mis]use of Williams's terminology favors the description that I had previously given, namely that justified actions (e.g. giving money to a charity) do not necessarily entail that intended state of affairs (e.g. the charity is actually a front for child trafficking). Of course, this is made more perspicuous when the resultant state of affairs does correspond to some intended good, but the justification for the action did not occur in intended fashion (e.g. the child traffickers somehow inadvertantly <i>do</i> end up helping impoverished children, and their trafficking plans are foiled). Again, I agree that your description is clearer, but I think mine is more accurate. Always open to further discussion, of course... <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielpi_dd1f.html" title="User:Danielpi">Danny Pi</a> 14:22, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, no RV. I was never particularly happy with my original edit. Yes, I think we're talking about two different problems. Or, more accurately, yours is a particular case of my general definition. Do we agree that moral luck pertains to certain results, which do not correspond to actions/intentions? And the disconnect occurs because the justification for action does not meet result? Williams tends to focus on the "blame" element (or moral culpability or whatever), but it's really a broader question. Williams also takes the issue broader still to examine whether intentionality itself is not merely the consequence of ontological "luck", as it were, and so that's a meta-ethical question, which perhaps we should include, but methinks not under the heading of "moral luck". <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielpi_dd1f.html" title="User:Danielpi">Danny Pi</a> 15:03, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your comments on my page.

<p>I have thought of creating a WikiProject for South Park since it is now near its' 10th anniversary and has more articles than ever. I feel we could all do the following things through this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleanup any short/poorly written/unformatted articles</li>
<li>Merge/lengthen the many character articles</li>
<li>Improve the South Park main page</li>

<p>I'd go with "very important book". Problem with calling it "The Bible" in my opinion is that #1 it has been updated and released with a 2nd edition...and #2 I think that some of the advice it gives is a bit outdated.

<p>I noticed that you just removed all references to Pauline Kael's being a Jew. Are you particularly opposed to having this publicly displayed? She was Jewish.

<dd>"All references", you say. There was <i>one</i> reference in the article, in the lead paragraph, which I removed. I removed it because the lead paragraph should concisely detail the subject's defining characteristics. Take a look at the following wikipedia articles devoted to other film critics: <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judith_Crist_a96d.html" title="Judith Crist">Judith Crist</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Cocks_826f.html" title="Jay Cocks">Jay Cocks</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Canby_2b13.html" title="Vincent Canby">Vincent Canby</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Sarris_bcbb.html" title="Andrew Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Ebert_1ae7.html" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armond_White_3a0d.html" title="Armond White">Armond White</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Agee_41ae.html" title="James Agee">James Agee</a>, etc. You will notice that they are simply defined as being film critics. If you believe it is very important to anyone remotely interested in Ms. Kael that she be identified as being a Jew, please add it in the biographical details of the article. Thanks.-<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 04:13, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact, I just took another look at the article and in the "Biography" section she is already described as having been born to Jewish immigrants. Why do you believe it so important to mention this fact in the lead paragraph? I honestly don't think most people would describe her as a "Jewish film critic".—<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 04:20, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>None of the people that you mentioned are Jewish (that I am aware). A couple of the articles (I looked at two or three) are a couple of sentences long. You say: "concisely detail the subject's defining characteristics" and being Jewish is obviously a defining characterisitic as it only describes about 1% of the population. Thus, being white, Christian, Chinese, male, etc. would not be defining characteristics? - <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbscissa_152a.html" title="User:Abscissa">Abscissa</a> 04:21, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, being an "American film critic" is her defining characteristic, at least in terms of an encyclopedic entry. If she had repeatedly proclaimed her Jewishness in her reviews, and had become famous as being a "Jewish American film critic", then that would be important to note in the opening paragraph. My point about the other critics was not that they are Jewish, but that whether or not they are Christian, Jewish, or otherwise is not even mentioned in the lead paragraphs of their articles. Why should the Kael entry be any different? Again, it is already mentioned in the article that her parents were Jewish, so its not like I'm attempting to keep something important from "public display".-<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 04:30, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of what relevance, is it then, that she is an "American film critic"? Since she doesn't deal only with American filims. This refers to her being an American. Why is that there? The plain and simple fact is that she is a Jew, religiously and ethnically. If it is so important that she not be labelled as such then we can just leave it out but let's make your rationale quite clear. - <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbscissa_152a.html" title="User:Abscissa">Abscissa</a> 05:52, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the relevance of Kael being described as an "American film critic" is because that is exactly why she is/was famous. It is standard to discuss somebody's nationality in the lead paragraph of an encyclopedic entry, not their religious beliefs unless that was one of the defining characteristics of their fame. And Kael was NOT famous for being a Jew, she was famous for being a film critic. If she was a practicing Jew (and I have no idea if she was or not), she never discussed it in print (as far as I can recall) or in any interviews, and it didn't seem to be reflected in her critical POV. Now, if she had repeatedly brought up her ethnicity/religion in her reviews as some kind of critical barometer, I could easily understand why somebody would feel compelled to describe Kael as a "Jewish film critic". But she didn't do that. And again I direct your attention to any of the other film critic articles on wikipedia. Is Roger Ebert a "Christian film critic"? Andrew Sarris an "atheist film critic"? Not according to wikipedia they're not. (I'm using those two as examples...I don't know or care what, if any, religious background they may have). And as I've previously pointed out, it is <i>already noted</i> in the "Biography" section of the article that her parents were Jewish. Removing this from the lead paragraph will not be "leaving it out" of the article at all.-<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 06:18, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You may be unaware but "Jew" is also an ethnicity -- and many "Jews" are "Jews" only by ethnicity, so it is no different from saying someone is "American". Again, there is no need to describe majorities using adjectives to describe their majority status, since, in your own words, this includes "defining characteristics" -- for majorities this might be male, white, anglosaxon, catholic, American, Chinese, etc. - <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbscissa_152a.html" title="User:Abscissa">Abscissa</a> 19:09, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, I am not unaware of that. I have no problem with your most recent edit to the article, but be aware that since referencing a subject's nationality is pretty much SOP for the lead paragraph in a biographical wikipedia entry, someone else will probably eventually add "American" back.-<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 13:25, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it resembles the mouth part much more than the eyes part, but yeah, dipping the scrotum into the mouth seems comparable to dipping a tea bag into a teapot.

<dd>Also, from the Routledge Dictionary of Philosophy: "Modern discussions start from two famous attacks on these two forms respectively, by Moore and Hume. Moore insisted that 'good' is indefinable, and that the questions what 'good' means and what things are good must be sharply distinguished, e.g. pleasure may be good, and even possibly the only good thing, but 'good' does not <i>mean</i> 'pleasant' or 'producing pleasure', etc. He called the neglect of this distinction the <i>naturalistic fallacy</i>, and said goodness is a nonnatural quality." <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielpi_dd1f.html" title="User:Danielpi">Danny Pi</a> 20:26, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why do you think that the regular players in the Big Game is irrelevant information? I maybe could see your point if this was a huge article with lots of information that need cleaning up, but it's not a huge article and a list of (semi)regular players adds something to an already tiny article 85.177.213.208</p>

<dd>Here's a new idea for ya: How about NOT reverting edits without comment without first discussing the changes? Especially since this entry on your Talk page is more than a month old and I really doubt you haven't read it. 85.177.216.7 11:56, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your information on the big game participants is 1) not verifiable 2) irrelevant and 3) not encyclopedic. Articles about other sports, games, tours, etc. have information about those things, not lists of the players who apparently play in them. Also, if you are not logged in, and/or don't have an account here, it is very difficult to contact you. -<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbscissa_152a.html" title="User:Abscissa">Abscissa</a> 07:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Mamet_cc6b.html" title="David Mamet">David Mamet</a> used to, once upon a time, send out form letters to people who wrote stuff objecting to the language and/or violence in his plays. The letter would read: "Too bad, you big crybaby." I had Mamet in mind when I wrote that quote you have on your user page. I thought it was a funny way of cutting through the madness plaguing Essjay's page during the debacle.-<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillDeanCarter_644b.html" title="User:BillDeanCarter">BillDeanCarter</a> 04:59, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Abscissa, regarding your post <i>"apparent flamebait"</i> - there's no intent to "bait" you. We're obviously not communicating well, so I've chosen to withdraw to avoid a fight. However - and this is quite important - I wish to clarify that your statement <i>"One particular user, who I will not name, has contributed to various anti-Semitic articles and his/her intentions are quite clear"</i> doesn't apply to me. (I'm certainly not asking you to name names. However, given that the discussion around the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> paragraph involved RJHall, you, and me, and given that you praised RJHall, the implication is that "one particular user" means "Ckatz".) Thank you in advance. --<b><a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i><small><sup><a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkatz_91bf.html" title="User talk:Ckatz"><font color="green">chat</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckatz_cb51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz"><font color="red">spy</font></a></sub></small></i> 22:22, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
