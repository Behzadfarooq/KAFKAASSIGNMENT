<h2><span class="mw-headline">Thanks for removing "spam" links</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for removing some of the many "spam" links in the BMW and related sections of Wikipedia. I have removed many additional "spam" links as well. I was wondering why when deleting these links you only delete some "spam" links and not others? I think that there should not be any personal or commercial links in these pages and would like to thank you for your deligence in this matter. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bimport (<a href="../../../b/i/m/User_talk%7EBimport_346a.html" title="User talk:Bimport">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bimport_e3c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bimport">contribs</a>) 14:40, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>&gt; Is there some project going on to replace the bio-notability tag with the importance tag?</p>
<p>&gt; I noticed the tag switch on a few articles I've edited and thought I'd ask.</p>
<p>&gt; Thanks --AbsolutDan (talk) 20:33, 21 June 2006 (UTC) Retrieved from "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ste4k" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ste4k" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ste4k</a>"</p>
<p>Yes, what used to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_whose_topics%27_importance_is_unclear" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_whose_topics%27_importance_is_unclear" rel="nofollow">Here</a> got finished. I do not know exactly what templates will be changed, but <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers">User:Redvers</a> gave me a star for finishing it. You might want to check with him. Ste4k 20:45, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Dan! Yes, I believe you are correct. I am very new however and your description sounds very accurate to me with only two details. I was givenn some help on how to do the cleanup, and I tried my best to make sure that the Edit Summary accruately reflected what was removed with a minus sign. If one of the articles had a &lt;div&gt; type, then I read it, removed it, and noted that as well with -div(whatever). Hope this helps.&#160;:) Ste4k 00:00, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Again, Dan. Yes, I understand about all of those concerns. The chief purpose of the cleanup was to remove a dual entry for the new importance Category. I am not qualified enough to say whether the bio template is scheduled for deletion. That tag though, referred to the old Category only though, and not the new Category page. The only other template besides the bio template which triggered that Category was the vanity template. Please feel free to revert any changes made, but be aware that you may end up recreating the old category. I cannot tell you if that would happen either way, yes or no. I would suggest that you drop Redvers a line though since he was notified after I had completed the task. You could TEST the idea to see if the old template triggers the old page, and if it does, simply undo it. That MIGHT even trigger an alarm bell for somebody somewhere, if they care. Thanks, and I wish I could be of more help. Ste4k 00:40, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had seen the veotag link added to <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Kean_Jr._b0b4.html" title="Thomas Kean Jr.">Thomas Kean Jr.</a> and saw your reversion of the addition. I was somewaht ambivalent as to leaving it in, but I want to understand your feeling that it constitutes linkspam. If this is a campaign video, why couldn't it be acceptable?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">SPAM</span></h2>
<p>OK</p>
<p>I've read all I could find on Wikpedia about "SPAM".</p>
<p>What I can see that is wrong is that I posted multiple links to multiple related sites. And one of the sites I do own.</p>
<p>However, others of the sites I don't own and were NOT multiple links and were relavent to the article. Did you actually check out the links or simply erase them?</p>
<p>And if you are carefully reviewing things, why don't you pick up almost identical links to other very similar sites that were posted by their owners?</p>
<p>I think you are overreacting to your definition (not Wikpedia's) of spam and I would ask that you be slightly more judicious on your use of the "revert" key.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should just stop contributing because this is Dan's personal playground? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.143.40.146 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.143.40.146.html" title="User talk:68.143.40.146">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.143.40.146_15db.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.143.40.146">contribs</a>) 22:04, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Hello - I removed the link <i>primarily</i> because we don't need more external links in our article, we need more content. I also removed the link because this is the English-language Wikipedia, so links that are in other languages aren't really appropriate unless the topic is specifically about something in that language. Furthermore, there are already 2 English-language forums in the article. That's plenty - reducing it to just one would be even better. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:18, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi,</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I added, some weeks ago (had by then another ip adresse), the 3 forums. A french one is perfectly relevant as many people look in first time on the english wikipedia and are then interested seeing that they can also find the info in other languages.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why did you not remove an englisch speaking one, if you think three too much? Is this some kind of French bashing? And who gave you authority to decide that kind of things?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I'm an XK owner and enthusiast. I contributed by corrections and add-ons where necessary. Giving links to forums is IMHO a good thing which enables people who did not find the info they were looking for to ask other people live, also in french. Even if you do not like French people.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, some guy did indeed, before you, suppress the French forum link, and put in a commercial site in place of it.You suppressed the commercial site, which is a good point, and I put again in the forum, that's all.</dd>

<dd>At the end, i do understand you're not an XK-fan but more a wikipedia fan, right? Please leave the enthusiasts decide by themselves what is good for a page. And do not judge of things so superficially: you did think at the beginning that the forum link was a commercial one: this is not very serious, sorry. Wikipedia is a marvellous invention. Abuses are to be condemned. But injustice must also be avoided, and brutal action is never a good thing. Wikipedia does not need any lynchers.</dd>

<dd>Easy with the dramatics buddy. First off, I am myself French, but that's irrelevant. The point is, this is the English article. If French readers want to learn more, they can read the corresponding (if present) article in the French Wikipedia (which if present you could easily link to in the article). If the link you're so adament about is useful, add it to the French Wikipedia article. <b>Or</b>, if there is <b>content</b> that you can add to this article regarding, for instance, a distinguishing feature of the vehicle as it's produced or sold in France, feel free to add that. However, again, <b>external links do not really help an article much</b> (unless they serve as a <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citation</a> for content in the article) and there is no obligation for Wikipedia to host any particular external link. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:49, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>why are you forcing people to watch an un-annotteded 60 minute video that is painful to sit through. The veotagged version is smarter, quicker and has much more value.</p>
<p>I have to question if you actually reviewed the original content before you deleted it.</p>
<p>Why is the stanford version ok ( which is long and painful to watch ) but the veotagged version spam ( which is much better viewer experience yet includes all of the original content )</p>

<p>yo dan, lots of people want to see the streaming video of the high school varsity baseball team playing a game. Why do you keep deleting this orignal content for the local high school television station? Have you reviewed this item before you deleted it?</p>
<p>these are not commercials these are a free way of viewing long format videos so they are easier to view and understand. THere are no commercial messages included in these links. I am having a hard time understanding your position. Why is a long boring video acceptable yet the same video enhanced wiht menus and the ability to navigate to the interesting parts considered spam? you are out of line. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Three_Sons_1b6f.html" title="User:My Three Sons">My Three Sons</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/_/User_talk%7EMy_Three_Sons_e49b.html" title="User talk:My Three Sons">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_My_Three_Sons_9433.html" title="Special:Contributions/My Three Sons">contribs</a>) 17:52, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Help me understand your issue with high quality annotated videos that have direct applicability to the subjects. Why do you allow a Tim Berners-Lee video that runs 90 minutes to be streamed from the Princeton Web site, but the same video that is streamed from the same princeton web site that has annotations, navigation and menus is now deamed as spam. Why don't you ask Tim Berners-Lee which one he would prefer? WHy don't you let users view it and let them decide if it is spam.

<p>Dan,</p>
<p>Would be happy to mention the availablity of these annotated videos in the context of the page to gauge the interest of the users.</p>
<p>As for your assertion that -- <i>You're adding multiple affiliated/related links across multiple articles</i> -- Each link I put up was specifically targeted to unique content that highly pertinent and extremely valuable, they all happen to use the same medium, however each item was unique. Using your logic, any contributor that posted two different links to two different streaming video files that used Windows Media Player as the viewing platform, would be spamming. Your logic fails to include the content of the link or the content of the video. The assertion that they are affiliated/related would be true for any video that uses Windows Media Player of Macromedia Flash player as the player medium. Veotag is a next genration rich media authoring and publishing tool that allows the publisher to provide annotations, navigation and menus. These items are essential for long format videos on the internet to become relevant and flourish. The end product is a much more meaningful viewing experience for long format videos. Much like the chapter features of a DVD, only more finite capability with annotations and comments.</p>
<p>Please actually view the links prior to deleting them. If at the end of the viewing experience you still feel that the annotated video doesn't dramatically add value to the page, then go ahead and delete it. If not, please leave the link so others can benefit as well.</p>
<p>thanks for your explanation. I will certainly try my best to add to the content and capability of the wikipedia community, <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Three_Sons_1b6f.html" title="User:My Three Sons">My Three Sons</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/_/User_talk%7EMy_Three_Sons_e49b.html" title="User talk:My Three Sons">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_My_Three_Sons_9433.html" title="Special:Contributions/My Three Sons">contribs</a>) 17:21, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Dear Dan,</p>
<p>I read your response to my articles. Firstly I would like to apologies for any offense, it was not my intention. Myself and numerous others have been engaged in developing shared and common understandings about intangibles for many years, please see: [<a href="http://www.standardsinstitute.org/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.standardsinstitute.org/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Homepage</a>]</p>
<p>Nothing I posted was intended for vanity purposes, corporate advertising, or other issue of that nature. Quite the opposite as I hope to explain.</p>
<p>Intangibles (knowledge, collaboration, engagement, and effectiveness) are at the heart of sustainability, social corporate responsibility, engagement, motivation, and many other issues that directly impact quality of life. Their purpose is to move corporations away from a "rape" and "pillage" attitude to one of inclusion and valuing people. As a result I believe they need to be known about by others. Executives and managers are often ignorant of intangible value and how to manage it (as it is not taught in universities or schools). Our aim is to equip others with knowledge and skill to create a more sustainable, happy, and well-balanced economic system with a greater focus on people, justice, and sustainability. It is difficult for people to take these "intangible goals" seriously without being aware of the key developments that have been made in these areas. Almost all areas were new at some stage (think the internet, wikis, computers, etc). Just because something is not widespread does not mean it is not important.</p>
<p>I would welcome coordinating with you and seeking your help and assistance to ensure that I do not accidentally violate Wiki rules.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your feedback and comments.</p>

<p>When I read the tag cloud article I was interested in learning the technique. However, there was no explanation/tutorial on the basic premise nor was there an external link to a tutorial. I googled the term tag cloud tutorial and found the page to which I linked to. After reading the article I found it to be clear and consise and felt that it would benefit other wikipedia readers who wanted more information than a description of what a tag cloud is. I have no affiliation with the website linked to and I feel that the author of the site linked to is an acceptable authority on the subject as he has authored major technical publications.

<p>I send thousands of hours to do original research words and phrases. [Someone wrote a Wiki page about me.] I post the research on the American Dialect Society site, discuss it with other scholars, and then list all the detailed citations on my website. It's the best information around, available nowhere else. You usually can't link or cite this stuff to any other site. You also can't add it all in the Wikipedia text. That's what a link/cite/reference is there for, isn't it?</p>
<p>I give away my work for free to the Oxford English Dictionary, Wikipedia, and others. I can assure you, it's not commercial. If it was commercial, I'd be able to afford health insurance.</p>
<p>My site is linked to the Wikipedia in many places by other people. I are don't understand why these other people (and I don't know them) are better than me. Would it be better if I had the North American editor of the Oxford English Dictionary place a link?</p>
<p>You suggest the "Talk" pages. I've discussed poor and outdated Wikipedia material on the Wiki's Talk pages before. No one "talks," and the material just sits there on the Talk pages, with the "stub" unchanged.</p>
<p>Again, I like to add content AND links/citations for that content. There's a lot of Wikipedia pages that need a lot of work. I'm going to revise "hot dog" this weekend. Gerald Cohen and I wrote a 300-page book on the origin of "hot dog." Our work will be on the History Channel's AMERICAN EATS next week. There's no other book like it, no other research like it, and it's very important to "hot dog" and Wikipedia. Must I add all of my "hot dog" work (work I'd spent thousands of dollars crossing the country to find) to the Wikipedia for free--and be unable to cite the sources?</p>

<p>Word scholar Barry Popik here again. Thanks for getting back to me so quickly! You wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whenever available, reference locations for your work other than your website. For instance, if one of your articles is published in the NYT, reference that article instead of the one on your website.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is just not right!</p>
<p>For example, see the origin of the New York "Yankees" nickname. I lectured before the Society for American Baseball Research. I was mentioned in the <i>New York Post</i> sports section, and my work is in the "Yankees" entry of Paul Dickson's <i>Baseball Dictionary</i>. My work is also in books specifically on the Yankees. The late baseball scholar (Lawrence Ritter) who wrote the "Yankees" entry in the <i>Encyclopedia of New York City</i> said he'd try to have my work in the next edition. I had checked every single New York City newspaper, and found "Yankees" earliest in the April 7th <i>New York Evening Journal</i> (not online). It's an incredible find. The Wikipedia had cited "Yankees" from months later.</p>
<p>The full story of my work is always going to be on my website! The full story often is more than just one newspaper citation. Often, I discuss several citations together, making sense of them. Yes, I can just cite a brief discussion of my work in the Dickson <i>baseball dictionary,</i> but it's less detailed and it's not online. It won't help anybody much.</p>
<p>It's pretty humiliating to give your research work out for free, and it's even more humiliating to have to rely on someone else's interpretation of it, and to give someone else credit.</p>
<p>I can help Wikipedia in thousands of ways with original research. (Again, I usually post my work on the American Dialect Society website, and those scholars use the same computer databases. I can add the scholarly ADS-L discussions--like a Wikipedia:Talk among language folks--as footnotes to the footnotes, but it will be messy.) If I have to wait for a book or a newspaper to pick up on something years later, and if I have to cite that slow and poor source, then what's the point of an internet encyclopedia?</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">More about my word origin posts.</span></h3>
<p>For example, I recently posted about "soul food" (an entry that the OED is revising and that my editor at the Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America had asked me about) on the American Dialect Society list, ADS-L. Benjamin Zimmer (of the Language Log and the University of Pennsylvania) beat my 1962 "soul food" citation with a 1961 citation from the <i>New Pittsburgh Courier</i> (newly on some ProQuest newspaper databases, but not mine).</p>
<p>I rounded up the earliest "soul food" citations and put them in the food section of my NYC website. I don't want to burden the Wikipedia "soul food" text with all the citations, but I added a link to the bottom of the Wikipedia "soul food" entry.</p>
<p>These are the best "soul food" citations anywhere, double-checked with scholars. Anyone interested in the term "soul food" would want to know this. It shouldn't be taken off because I put it there myself. That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>I'd like to contribute to Wikipedia for these reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some information is wrong or incomplete, and I can help thousands of entries.</li>
<li>Many of my website entries had previously been linked to the Wikipedia by readers of my site.</li>
<li>Google just changed its algorithm. Wikipedia comes up first, and my site has completely disappeared from the rankings. My same information appearing on other sites (in whole or in part) come up before my site. You type in "Barry Popik" + "Big Apple" and I'm on the eighth Google search page for my own site! So, I thought that now's a good time to finally get Wikipedia correct on the stuff where I am an expert.</li>
</ol>
<p>Can I speak at Cambridge and explain my situation?</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">The Unique Regional Government Structure in Ontario</span></h3>
<p>Ontario is unique among the provinces of Canada with its structure of Nine Regional Governments, namely Peel, Niagara, Waterloo, Oxford, Muskoka, Durham, York, Halton and Metro Toronto.</p>
<p>The unique structures created by the government of Wm. (Bill) Davis in the mid 1970's using his majority government over the objections of the local Villages, Communities, Towns and Cities affected. In the thirty years since creation they have been under a constant struggle for power and local control with the local level governments about which of them will become the Single Tier Municipality when the local development reaches maturity.</p>
<p>In the case of Metro Toronto the struggle was won by Metro Region who succeeded in annexing the local Cities of Toronto a few years ago. A similar struggle is currently underway in Peel Region most clearly, but similar struggles have been won and lost in other places as the local governments struggle to break free from their Region to become Single Tier Cities and preserve democratic government structures over less democratic ones.</p>
<p>In Canada, because our constitution only names two distinct government i.e.; The Federal and The Provincial; these Cities and Towns do not have any proper say in the matter of their Regions since both are created by Acts of Provincial Parliament and neither are constitutional governments.</p>
<p>Whereas Cities and Towns are democratically controlled government organization with elected representatives and elected mayors and leaders, the Regions are not. Regions have no elected leader, no full time elected representatives on their Council with offices or personal regional management staff, and there is no structured system for obtaining a majority vote in any proportionate representation of its citizens. Not even a political party system exists that can attract accountability by the votes of its citizens. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDoo_83ae.html" title="User:WikiDoo">WikiDoo</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikiDoo_7aad.html" title="User talk:WikiDoo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WikiDoo_8ef7.html" title="Special:Contributions/WikiDoo">contribs</a>) 19:32, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">FFXIclopedia</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure why the page is still being contested as not being notable. Wikipedia itself has borrowed information and refrenced the site in numerous places. If you can give me more details, I'd really appreciate it. I compare it to <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a>, and I believe FFXIclopedia is just as notable as that site. I see nothing on WoWWiki that would make it any more worthy of holding a page at Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaniman_fb34.html" title="User:Ganiman">Ganiman</a> 20:58, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Forgive me for continuing to compare FFXIclopedia to <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a>, but I still don't see how WoWWiki is notable where FFXIclopedia is not. WoWWiki has not recieved any awards. The two wikis, are about two similar games, and contain similar content. You mention the article was deleted over a year ago, and it was probably wrongfully deleted then too. You also are avoiding how I mention that Wikipedia itself has used it as a resource in numerous places. If it's so un-notable, why would it be referenced on Wikipedia already? The About and General Disclaimer pages at FFXIclopedia have much more content and detail than those at WoWWiki (they were actually reviewed by lawyers if you believe it). I doubt WoWWiki has been written about in any more major source than FFXIclopedia. As I keep saying, Wikipedia uses FFXIclopedia has a resource already, which to me would fulfill the "It has to be written about in some major source (website, newspaper, etc)" requirement. I understand that forums do not count, but can you specify what might? Using this Google Search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=ffxiclopedia+-site%3Affxiclopedia.org+-site%3Ateamavengers.org&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=ffxiclopedia+-site%3Affxiclopedia.org+-site%3Ateamavengers.org&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> which excludes ffxiclopedia.org links as results, I think you may begin to understand it's popularity and significance amongst the community. --<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaniman_fb34.html" title="User:Ganiman">Ganiman</a> 11:41, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you're missing something here. World of Warcraft has a much larger player base than Final Fantasy XI does. Amongst the Final Fantasy XI community, FFXIclopedia has become one of the top (if not the top) resource for FFXI players to find information. As Mierin's commented stated, it's like comparing New York City to Rhode Island, and saying that Rhode Island doesn't deserve to be a state, because there are cities with larger populations. That's just silly. If it were possible to run a poll of FFXI players who thought FFXIclopedia was notable or not, I can guarantee that FFXIclopedia would be considered notable amongst the community. As stated, the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> page is a <i>guideline</i> not a requirement. Wether the Wikipedia community can understand it or not, FFXIclopedia has become a piece of history for Final Fantasy XI, and as such, it should have it's place in gaming history. There are far worse things in Wikipedia than this. --<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaniman_fb34.html" title="User:Ganiman">Ganiman</a> 15:06, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many of your fellow wikipedians find it difficult to learn only by reading, and need something more tangible- an example (for example). The paid survey article is poorly structured, lacking any illustration, and almost impossible to read. I had hoped that my link to an example of a legitimate paid survey website would illustrate the topic for the curious and impatient. Now, no one can enjoy it. I hope that this tiny step in your quest to de-commercialize the encyclopedia has made you happy, because it has made me unhappy. -Dan H. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.8.205.106 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.8.205.106.html" title="User talk:68.8.205.106">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.8.205.106_bf21.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.8.205.106">contribs</a>) 14:49, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Dan. The paid surveys article is a joke, but I will not fix it. There is a perfectly good market research page that people can check out. I will continue, however, to seek free outlets for my spamming urges- if not on Wikipedia, then on any of the thousands of virgin Wikis available to me. And if you're not getting paid for what you're doing, you should join my evil master-plan. We have more than enough room for proofreaders, especially proofreaders accustomed to working for free.</p>

 Enjoy your spam-free encyclopedia.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Frustrated Author</span></h2>
<p>I think that you and I got off to an unfortunate start. Perhaps we can do better if I compltely explain myself.</p>
<p>You are just trying to enforce the rules - especially the SPAM rules - and I am just trying to post material that people should be interested in on particular topics that I am interested in.</p>
<p>I started off breaking the rules. It was unintentional - Wikipedia has a formidable set of rules to learn - and I did break them unintentionally.</p>
<p>I posted more than 3 links on a particular day. They were also commercial links. I did not post them for SPAM reasons but you can't tell that. They looked like SPAM to you (and I can understand that) but I saw them as links to valuable information. No matter if they were valuable or not, I broke the rules and I'm sorry. I'll stop breaking the rules as soon as I can figure them all out (there does seem to be quite a labyrinth of rules to negotiate for a new user and reading hundreds of pages is tedious at best).</p>
<p>Next, thanks for referring me to the Wikipedia policy on reliable sources. I have read the material (pages of material).</p>
<p>I have a comment about the application of this rule and a comments about the rule and how it may apply if it is applicable. (And I'll post this also on the applicable System discussion page.)</p>
<p>First comment - The Reliable Sources rule doesn't apply to the link I am proposing.</p>
<p>The link is not a primary or secondary source. Primary and Secondary sources deal with proving facts in an article. Rather, this link is an example. It provides examples of tools for Systematic Improvement. These are not "facts" ... they are neither right nor wrong. They are examples and thus can't be wrong (unless you say that they are NOT examples).</p>
<p>Thus the more I read the Reliable Sources rule, the more that I thought that it didn't apply to this link.</p>
<p>But even if the Reliable Sources rule does apply, read the following:</p>
<p>QUOTE 1:</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Wikipedia:Reliable sources</p>
<p><br />
Exceptions may be when a well-known, professional researcher writing within his field of expertise, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material. In some cases, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as their work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications, and they are writing under their own names, and not a pseudonym.</p>
<p>However, editors should exercise caution for two reasons: first, if the information on the professional researcher's blog is really worth reporting, someone else will have done so; secondly, because the information has been self-published, which means it has not been subject to any independent form of fact-checking.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>First, I think the link I am proposing meets this exception. The greatsystems.com web site is a good example of a well-known professional writing within his field of expertise. (Even if this is a very narrow field.)</p>
<p>However, I believe this guideline is probably outdated as on-line media becomes more popular and perhaps just as accurate (or inaccurate?) as the old traditional sources that are becoming more inaccurate to keep up with on-line sources and the 24 hour per day news cycle.</p>
<p><br />
QUOTE 2:</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Evaluating reliability</p>
<p>Evaluate the reliability of online sources just as you would print or other more traditional sources. Neither online nor print sources deserve an automatic assumption of reliability by virtue of the medium they are printed in. All reports must be evaluated according to the processes and people that created them.</p>
<p>Publications with teams of fact-checkers, reporters, editors, lawyers, and managers — like the New York Times or The Times of London — are likely to be reliable, and are regarded as reputable sources for the purposes of Wikipedia. At the other end of the reliability scale lie personal websites, blogs, bulletin boards, and Usenet posts, which are not acceptable as sources. Note that Wikipedia itself does not currently meet the reliability guidelines; however, nothing in this guideline is meant to contravene the associated guideline: Wikipedia:Build the web. Wikilink freely.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Newsmedia as a reliable source ... that's been a joke lately!</p>
<p>And the New York Times as an example? Please do some reading about Jason Blair!</p>
<p>At least in the US, the accuracy of the press has sunk to new low levels. That's what the Dan Rather scandal was all about.</p>
<p>But this isn't just a recent problem. Check out these old headlines:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.saveportland.com/Climate/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.saveportland.com/Climate/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.saveportland.com/Climate/index.html</a></p>
<p>Would Wikipedia be more reliable if these articles from newspapers and magazines (including the New York Times and Science) were used a sources?</p>
<p>And lawyers checking articles for accuracy? Someone at Wikipedia must be laughing about this.</p>
<p>Lawyers check for liability. They don't LET someone publish because someone may use what is publish and thereafter, sue the company. This is NOT a reliability issue - it is a liability (risk management) issue.</p>
<p>Besides, I bet that there isn't a single newspaper that has lawyers out checking articles to see if facts are correct. The lawyers too busy defending defamation and liable suits or prosecuting copyright infringement actions. Being from Scotland you may not know this. But being from America, I have experienced the "reliability" of lawyers - and you don't want to go there.</p>
<p>Wikipedia really should consider revising these outdated ideas about the reliability of sources - ideas that are reducing the accuracy of their on-line encyclopedia. The ideas seem to be from old academic research (perhaps developed in the days of hand written dissertations in early 1800's and last applicable in the 1980's or maybe even 1990's). Even previously "reliable", peer-reviewed publications now find themselves mired in controversy (for example the New England Journal of Medicine and the Merck/Vioxx publication controversy).</p>
<p>A recognized professional publishing under his or her own name and staking their professional reputation on their writing is much more likely to be accurate and fact-checked that a more traditional source of media (television or newspapers) in today's world of 24 hour news and instant deadlines.</p>
<p>Why else have dozens of "accuracy" web sites sprung up to challenge the inaccuracy of traditional print and broadcast media.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why the "exception" above will need to be used more and more to promote accuracy and provide applicable, reliable content.</p>
<p>To conclude, I guess I can sum up my "case" as follows:</p>
<p>1. The link to the Systems page (<a href="http://www.greatsystems.com/systems.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.greatsystems.com/systems.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatsystems.com/systems.htm</a>) at greatsystems.com is a good, accurate, reliable link for examples of systems to improve performance that either:</p>
<p>a) falls outside the realm of the Reliable Sources Rule, or</p>
<p>b) perfectly fits the exceptions clause in the rule.</p>
<p>2. Wikipedia should revise its rules to bring them in line with the ever changing world of on-line information (of which Wikipedia is a part). Otherwise they stand the chance of becoming obsolete (like old paper encyclopedias are today). Wikipedia should also recognize that some links aren't used to prove facts but rather are used as examples - a horse of a completely different color!</p>
<p>Thanks again in your patience - I can be rather vociferous when I think I'm being treated unfairly. I will try to be less offended by your (or others) critiques and, of course, follow the rules so that I get less critiques!</p>
<p>One last question, is their a way to pass this idea about examples on to more Wikipeadia editors? I think it really needs consideration for addition somewhere in the rules.</p>
<p>I know that this is a lot of material to consider so please feel free to take your time. The world won't end while we wait to improve the <a href="../../../s/y/s/System.html" title="System">System</a> article.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Dan</p>
<p>I got a notice saying you had deleted a link to our nzhistory.net.nz website from the Monarchy entry because you thought it was a commercial website. In fact it is run by the Minsitry for Culture and Heritage in New Zealand and has no commercial association. The content is developed by professional historians and where we have gaps we often link people back to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Since I got the notice I have created an account, but I now can't find the page that had the warning! Anyway, I also got told off for having the same link on different Wikipedia topics, so I'll make sure I don't do that from now on and only link to the page if it is specific to a topic.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">How do we get removed from your SPAM list?</span></h3>
<p>At this stage it appears that you are removing our links to different pages in our glossary as spam. I would like to stress again that all the links are DIFFERENT and each goes to a different page of a comprehensive online glossary. There are many other reference sites listed in many different articles and they are allowed to do that. So why NOT us?</p>
<p>It is very clear that Six Sigma is the only article in the topical area related to our free resources that had any discussion on External Links at all. It is also very suspicious that highly commercial site like Motorola University gets so much coverage in Wikipedia, even its own Category.</p>
<p>Can you provide us with the rationale for removing our links. Is the content not relevant? Do we have any Google or other ads on our site? Anything else that we missed when we considered adding our glossary pages to the Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Can you reveal your real name? We have added our real name to the entry and can easily be found on the Internet showing our background and credentials.</p>

<p>The external links policy states under "what should be linked to"</p>
<p>"Sites that contain neutral and accurate material not already in the article ......... in some cases this is not possible because ............ or because the site has alevel of detail which is innapropriate for the Wikipedia article"</p>
<p>I believe this is true of 6Sigma101.com</p>
<p>under "Links normally to be avoided"</p>
<p>"Except where noted the below do NOT (my capitals) override the list of what should be linked to:</p>
<p>The only point that would seem to be of concern is:</p>
<p>3. A website you own or maintain .... this is because of neutrality or point of view concerns</p>
<p>However the guidelines do not prohibit adding these links it does say they are "NORMALLY TO BE AVOIDED". It also says they do not override the list of links. In factual explanations of statistics there are no "neutrality or point of view" concerns. If somebody puts on an apparently commercial link without discussion, and from an anonymous source I can see the case for removing it without discussion; otherwise Wikipedia would be full of spam very quickly. However if that person comes back and argues the case for its inclusion it is not appropriate to revert it again without discussion. You should go on to the discussion and explain your actions.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">6sigma101</span></h3>
<p>&gt; However, please refer to WP:SPAM, particularly the section "How not to be a spammer." It is by this criteria that I most often remove external links.</p>
<p>I don't believe that I have contravened those guidelines. I am contributing a valuable resource that is fully compliant with Section 5 of "What should be linked to".</p>
<p>The only issue is, does it comply with Section 5.</p>
<p>If it does then it is, by definition, not spam, and it should not be removed.</p>
<p>I am new to Wikipedia but I believe that if it is to have a lasting value the points must be argued on objective criteria. People should base their arguments on the evidence and respected sources. That is equally true of contextual material and procedures. If you have a problem with the factual content of 6sigma101 then let us discuss it based on the evidence. If you think it contravenes the procedures then similarly, let's base it on the facts.</p>
<p>So far you have not done that. you have just said that in your opinion it breaches the procedure, but have not been prepared to argue the case.</p>
<p>The "Links normally to be avoided" clearly says "Except where noted the below do NOT override the list of what should be linked to"</p>
<p>You said in your reply to me:</p>
<p><br />
"I agree that in certain cases a link ovverides 'links to normally avoid' because it overwhelmingly meets 'What should be linked to.'</p>
<p><br />
The procedure does not say "in certain cases", nor does it say "overwhelingly meets". The procedure is clear and specific. It is not for you to add conditions. If you disagree with the procedure find a mechanism to get it changed by the powers that be. In the meantime please abide by it.</p>
