<p>Hi, I don't think there's any serious problem with its notability, not any more than with <a href="../../../s/c/o/SCons_5696.html" title="SCons">SCons</a> anyway, or any other build system. I created the page precisely because the software is little known (as it's rather young), and hardly googlable, yet being used by KDE as the designed build system automatically places it in the "rather important" category. I find "who, where, how" pages for relatively obscure software to be of great value, as it's often the only sensible resource, so if you don't have any concrete objections I could fix, I will remove the tag shortly. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathrick_447c.html" title="User:Mathrick">mathrick</a> 16:56, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Uhh, exactly how is app's homepage not a reliable source? I think the existence of something a very convincing evidence that it does indeed exist, and Waf exists. What I included is just general info on the app, plus a little bit of history that can be easily googled once you know what to look for, none of this is non-verifiable or disputable. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathrick_447c.html" title="User:Mathrick">mathrick</a> 17:06, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, it's getting ridiculous now. Can you please elaborate on why exactly you think SCons is not notable enough to be described in Wikipedia? Hint: the fact you don't know about it is not enough. It's rather well-known and used software, well-deserving a mention. Or do you perhaps think that WP should not describe software at all? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathrick_447c.html" title="User:Mathrick">mathrick</a> 17:23, 22 October 2006 (UTC) <span id="63286724289"></span></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have been editing the CIPD page this morning. I work for the CIPD as their website editor and noticed that you claim our wiki page needs more sources for the information within.</p>
<p>I cant see what the problem is when the information on our wiki page is soley factual information about our institute and its services.</p>
<p>Please can you let me know what you feel the page is missing?</p>

<p>I still cant see the issue. I/we are the primary source for this information. The notability comment will make users doubt the validty of this information when in actual fact it is prefectly accurate.</p>

<p>I have just read your latest reply. You seem to be intent on preventing me from contributing to wikipedia about a subject I have hard facts on. You have soley made me doubt the benefits of editing wiki pages.</p>
<p>The links I added are sources that can back up what I have written. Just because they dont state that on the page I am linking to doesnt mean they cant back this information up. If you like you can contact them to see if they back up this page as I can asure you they will? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Woodman1977 (<a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoodman1977_12a1.html" title="User talk:Woodman1977">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Woodman1977_be8e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Woodman1977">contribs</a>) 12:52, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">21CW Article</span></h2>
<p>That is 4 years on 21st Century Warfare tournament history. And people think it means nothing. Well 600 people playing in the tournament think is means something. Its not a gaming clan with a bunch of teenagers in it. Its a community of gamers that have fun together. Its also owned by a multi-thousand dollar company and was sold to that company by another company a few years back. So before some of your people start storming over others peoples work and history check the stuff out first. That was a ligit article. And I and 600 other people would like it if it were put back up.</p>

<p>Hey Dan,</p>
<p><br />
This is one of the first additions I've made to Wikipedia, so I'm not sure how to go about it. I created a Google Co-op search for apple computer. Basically, it searches a list of specified websites. I noticed that Google Finance is included on the wikipedia page, and I think that a search built specifically around Apple would be equally relevant. I started the co-op search, but other people are free to edit it and add additional sites. Do you think that this is an inappropriate link?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>hey Dan, I'm doing a research project, and i came across an ANOVA chart, and i have absolutely no idea how to read it. I spent half an hour reading wiki and other websites, but nothing explains basic symbolism. I found that you recently edited the ANOVA wiki page, so i assume you know something about this, here are the questions I have:</p>
<p>In my article, it says:</p>
<p>"One-way ANOVA showed significant effect of prime, F(1,64) = 5.59, p &lt;.05, effect size d = .60. The mean for prime was 13.70 (s.e.=.884)..."</p>
<p>please tell me what the following symbolism means:</p>
<p>F in general specifically F(1,64) = 5.59 p d s.e.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">DotNetNuke and notability</span></h2>
<p>Hi Dan; I have recently made a handful of changes to the entry for <a href="../../../d/o/t/Dotnetnuke.html" title="Dotnetnuke">Dotnetnuke</a>, trying to satisfy the notability and references tags placed there. It seems as though you're very familiar with that entry (and placed the tags there) so I'd like to get an idea if the recent edits are along the right track, or way off-base. Some of the references I added are drawn from official press releases from the Dotnetnuke site and from Microsoft Corp. Others are drawn from an historical account of the Dotnetnuke project written by Shaun Walker (founder of Dotnetnuke) which has been included in two titles from Wiley Press ("Professional DotNetNuke ASP.NET Portals," "Professional DotNetNuke 4: Open Source Web Application Framework for ASP.NET 2.0") and also re-printed with permission on the Dotnetnuke.com site.</p>
<p>Some of the references were also added to give credence to Dotnetnuke's notability factor. A quick search on Amazon will reveal 5 book titles dedicated exclusively to the topic of DotNetNuke, with two others to be released in the upcoming months. Sourceforge, which serves as the source code repository for DotNetNuke, has recorded <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/detail.php?group_id=77052&amp;ugn=dnn&amp;type=prdownload&amp;mode=alltime&amp;package_id=0" class="external text" title="http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/detail.php?group_id=77052&amp;ugn=dnn&amp;type=prdownload&amp;mode=alltime&amp;package_id=0" rel="nofollow">over two million downloads</a> of the DotNetNuke application since Mar 2003.</p>
<p>I believe these facts - which I wish to add next - illustrate that Dotnetnuke is notable enough for Wikipedia. I would just like to know if I'm on-track before I do so. Thanks. DNNsider 17:38, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Dan, I am new to Wikipedia so I still have much to learn. I am the creator/editor of ISO9000Resources.com. I am a ISO 9000 consultant and I created my website to give away free information that most consultants charge for. I am not trying to generate any business with my website, I am just presenting information about ISO 9001 based on my consulting business. I do have some pages with Adsense to help pay my expenses.</p>
<p>I added myself to the external links on the ISO 9000 page of Wiki and you removed me. At the same time you left other links to consultants that are trying to sell their information.. I understand your wanting to remove spamlinks but I must not understand what is considered a spamlink. Are consultants not spam and free resources considered spam? Is it becuase I have some pages with Adsense?</p>
<p>Of course, I would appriciate it if I got my link back but also would like to understand why other links are allowed and what I am doing wrong.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a freelance writer working on an article about the wide array of people who make Wikipedia their life, their passion, their pastime. Wikipedia “addicts” if you will. I’m looking for people just willing to tell their story of how they got sucked into the intellectual whirlwind that is Wikipedia, how you got started editing, how the obsession grew, and what you spend your time focusing on these days? Do you write articles from scratch? Is your main push toward one particular type of article? Do you patrol for typos and errors, or spend your time diligently fixing vandalism? Do you take part in the “social aspects” of Wikipedia; engaging in animated discussions or decorating your user page with all sorts of internet memes? Have you forced yourself to take a “Wikipedia break”? If so, what’s your 20/20 hindsight on the obsession? Basically I’m just trying to get an idea of what it’s like for various Wikipedia “addicts.” If you are interested in participating, please email me at brianrhodges@gmail.com</p>
<p>If anybody else, other than this user is interested in participating, feel free to email me as well. This article is intended to be a light informational piece, nothing too heavy or controversial, just merely introducing readers to a subculture that they likely had no idea existed. So please don’t email me with your conspiracy theories, or your grudge against the Wikipedia hierarchy… unless it directly applies to your overall experience with the site. This article is about the USERS, not about the pros and cons of the site itself.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mobile Search Changes</span></h2>
<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>I noticed that you modified the mobile search entry to remove the external links that had been added, mine included. I run a mobile search site at <a href="http://wampad.com" class="external free" title="http://wampad.com" rel="nofollow">http://wampad.com</a> and I would like to be listed in the mobile search providers. I'm more of a user of wikipedia so I thought I'd ask if i created a wiki page like this, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Search_and_Transfer" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Search_and_Transfer" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Search_and_Transfer</a>. Would it then be acceptable to list my site on the mobile search page? I really apprciate the time you put into wikipedia, it's a great resource.</p>
<p>In fact the reason I was on tonight was becuase of what I preceive as a blatant misuse of the wikipedia by a show called Jericho. Here's what I sent to the info-en-v@wikimedia.org mailbox tonight.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think that these two articles were planted by someone that is part of the show Jericho. There was a reference to the ravenwood company in the show tonight and I noticed someone posted on a blog about the company being real. Based on the history of both articles and that a worldwide company of 100,000 people would only be mentioned in wikipedia, I find them suspicious.</p>

<p>Hi AbsolutDan,</p>
<p>I was curious why you had deleted all of the links I had created for WikiAskew. It, like Wikipedia, is a wiki. What is the difference between linking to say, Wookieepedia in all the Star Wars related pages on this wiki and the ViewAskew sites on this wiki?</p>

<dd>is the source of these messages. I don't know why that guy is calling Wikipedia a bunch of Nazis since he hasn't editted this article since the middle of last month -- unless he's using a sockpuppet account. Moreover, from what I've read on the history page, you've been struggling to preserve that article just like he left it. I guess when someone says "Nazi", the speaker is driven to obey <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">Godwin's Law</a>, &amp; forget that the original point was to allude to a <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Soup_Nazi_cd12.html" title="The Soup Nazi">Seinfeld episode</a> -- which would be a starting point for a constructive discussion about Wikipedia.

<p>Hi AbsolutDan,</p>
<p>well I understand your policy to avoid promoting sites or adding a high ranked back link. This is not my intention; yet I ask you why not to give people a chance to get their own tag clouds? I have explicitly registered a domain now, www.tag-cloud.de which will solely used to provide free tag clouds for users homepages and I ask you if this will then be allowed. Del.ici.ous is nothing else, except the type of offering or showing tag clouds.</p>

<p>I'm not disagreeing with your actions, just an ignorant but curious noob, so I figured I'd seek an answer in more than just an obscure talk page... possibly it would also make people think twice about adding links that you've already removed. Thanks.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">buzzword bingo</span></h2>
<p>I respect your decision to omit my version of buzzword bingo but I respectfully disagree. Here is why:</p>
<p>(1) My version is at least as good, and generally better, than the existing external links, most of which are "print and use" rather than "enjoy online" versions. Please take a look:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~mcafee/Bin/meetingterminator.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~mcafee/Bin/meetingterminator.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~mcafee/Bin/meetingterminator.html</a></p>
<p>If mine doesn't belong, neither do most of these.</p>
<p>(2) My version will likely be maintained more than a decade; I generally support my links permanently. I have over 2 GB of material on my various websites.</p>
<p>(3) There is no advertising of any kind anywhere on my sites. I don't make a living -- or even any money -- off the web.</p>
<p>If after reading this you continue to think that the external link is inappropriate, I will defer to your greater experience and commitment. You need do nothing since I have not changed it since your edit.</p>
<p>Finally, the site is purely html and javascript and an alternate solution is to incorporate into wikipedia as a working example. The relevant files are</p>

<dd>Please note that the above user is an owner of a commercial OTR website (www.digitaldeliftp.com) who charges access to radio shows on his website. The sites he is removing are sites which offer people access to radio shows FOR FREE. Because the content is free, easily accessable and very relevent for the pages in question, they qualify for inclusion. What the above user is doing is simply trying to remove all links giving free access to the same type of OTR shows he CHARGES for. He is editing here in bad faith. The only things he is removing here are things given for FREE which he CHARGES for. His motive for the removals appears to be based totally on greed. If you see his Discussion page you will see that the majority of people disapprove of his selfish actions. PrinceAl 00:54, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PrinceAl is now in violation of cutting and pasting material from other discussion pages, and continued personal attacks, simply compounding the link spam abuse and reversions he or she is engaging in. I'd be pleased if you can help stop these abuses.

<dd>I am staying out of this quagmire for now. Both sides have obvious and blatant interest in having their links included in Wikipedia. The last time I got involved with these old time radio links, I spent far too much time trying to play referee. Let someone else fight this battle. For the record, my position continues to be that all links added to promote a site (free or otherwise) ought to be removed. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:46, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I respect your position, as you well know. I've long since reconciled myself to my links not being included in Wikipedia Golden Age Radio articles. You're well aware of that. Intimately aware of it, in fact. Indeed you're one of three people who explained, quite eloquently, your rationale at the time. I read it, understood it, and ceased proposing my links on that basis. But I see what's good for one, can be abused by any number of others. So be it. Thanks at least, for restating your position. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_76.170.239.56_e008.html" title="Special:Contributions/76.170.239.56">76.170.239.56</a> (<a href="../../../7/6/2E/User_talk%7E76.170.239.56.html" title="User talk:76.170.239.56">talk</a>) 05:32, 10 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I appriciate the efforts you are doing to keep WikiPedia a cleaner place. I would also be helping out with the cleaning process from now onwards.</p>
<p>You have called the external link I inserted in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link_bait.html" title="Link bait">Link_bait</a> as a spam. Well I do Understand how people keep adding links just to increase their popularity and would do anything to earn from anything famous. I hope that before removing links you should actually check what that link is all about, because it may be something useful that the users of Wikipedia might miss otherwise.</p>
<p>What Article I included there was very much related to the topic, was not self-promoting and did not use promotion for any other products, and in no case banefitial to me. It had been appreciated by many people. Apart from this, you did not remove the edits I made with this article, perhaps because they were actually useful. That was a part of another article I wrote about link_bait, in my blog.</p>
<p>It is a request that before removing links do check up its relativity to the topic and then decide its spam or not. I have re-added that link. Please give me enough reason to understand why you regarded it as a spam and then decide to remove it again. I promise I would appreciate your removing if it is not a useful article because even I do not personally like spammers. <a href="../../../d/i/v/User%7EDivs001_5ba0.html" title="User:Divs001">Divs001</a><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/i/v/User%7EDivs001_5ba0.html" title="User:Divs001">Divs001</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/v/User_talk%7EDivs001_7247.html" title="User talk:Divs001">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Divs001_9515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Divs001">contribs</a>) 15:48, 27 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>I just read most of the relevant article and I have noticed too many inappropriate external links all over wikipedia, even out of topic ones.</p>
<p>Its ok now that I reliazed what you meant to say, but I came across many such links. For example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podsafe" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podsafe" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podsafe</a></p>
<p>have these in-appropriate links in it</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">External Link on Anodizing page</span></h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You deleted the external link I posted to an informational/how to anodizing page. I do not feel that the link is spam, it gives a lot of very useful step by step information for someone who is trying to learn how to anodize on their own. The site is not selling any products and has a very small advertising bar, not what should be considered excessive. Without pages like the one posted, I would never known it was possible to anodize on your own and never would have tried it myself.</p>
<p>I re-posted the link because I was unsure why it was removed in the first place. Feel free to respond/clarify. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.85.170.56_36e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.85.170.56">130.85.170.56</a> (<a href="../../../1/3/0/User_talk%7E130.85.170.56.html" title="User talk:130.85.170.56">talk</a>) 20:22, 29 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
