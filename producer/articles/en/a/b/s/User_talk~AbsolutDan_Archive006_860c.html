<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fantasy Football link removal</span></h2>
<p>I put up some information relating to the origin of fantasy football, which I wrote and you left in place, you did not however leave the link to an article about the founding father of fantasy football Bill Winkenbach. I spent ages researching that and finding a decent article on Bill W. only for you to rip the heart out of it.</p>
<p>You are taking your role in this matter way too seriously and in this case have ruined a perfectly well written piece on the founder of the sport!</p>
<p><br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">FFXIclopedia</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to point out that FFXIclopedia has risen in Alexa rank, moving from the #4 spot to the #3 spot, surpassing the official Final Fantasy XI website. Give the site some credit... <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=596539" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=596539" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy XI Alexa Rankings</a> --<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaniman_fb34.html" title="User:Ganiman">Ganiman</a> 18:29, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: Personal Attacks</span></h2>
<p>Oh, please. Get over yourself. He attacked my AfD, which was almost a direct copy and paste of his. If that's not a personal attack, I don't know what is. You've obviously taken the FFXIclopedia AfD personal yourself, and try to hide behind some elitist Wikipedian attitude. You lost the battle during the second AfD (the first of which was rightfully deleted because the page content was garbage anyway and shouldn't even count in the arguments for it's second and third AfD, but you would know this if you actually checked the history), and you won't give it up. You continue to cite guidelines and not policy. You continue to believe that Alexa rankings are the end all be all, which I might add FFXIclopedia has only continued to RISE in rank, passing the <i>OFFICIAL</i> FFXI website. The entire editorial process here is a complete joke. You keep saying that for something to be notable, it has to be cited in a reliable source, when Wikipedia itself is a most unreliable source. If you could even read between the lines, the people fighting to keep the article are only doing it out of principle, because so many other articles, less notable and less worthy of existing on Wikipedia continue to have a home here. It's no wonder that <a href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=11109" class="external text" title="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=11109" rel="nofollow">accredited authors</a> who challange this site, <a href="http://news.com.com/2061-10802_3-6102088.html" class="external text" title="http://news.com.com/2061-10802_3-6102088.html" rel="nofollow">comical news anchors</a>, even the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_United_States_Congress_dd12.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/United States Congress">United States Congress</a> (for mostly trying to remove unflattering comments posted by wikipedians), and former assitant to the attorney general <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm" rel="nofollow">John Seigenthaler</a> (trying to save his own name from a false autobiography) have been <i>banned</i> from Wikipedia. This all stems from the attitudes of wikipedians like you and <a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">User:Peephole</a>. Number of edits/whatever is not equal to the number of brain cells one has. Anyone can make themselves wiki police around here. And anyone can defend any article to the death, even if it is completely inaccurate or not <i>notable</i>. There are countless pages in Wikipedia that are only definitions of words - items that belong in Wiktionary, yet people like you get on your high horse and think you are judge, jury and executioner. You believe you are all knowing here at Wikipedia. You think you are a gatekeeper of information. I run a wiki containing over 15,000 actual articles with only 3 people to maintain the validity of it's content, and we do a better job than any self-proclaimed Wikipedia vigilante. I can bet you yourself don't touch that many articles or interact with that many editors.</p>
<p>What's most amusing about this entire situation, is that the people building arguments to keep the FFXIclopedia article, which are more well thought out and well written than any arguments to keep any article of it's kind, have actually said to delete the article. We don't care if it's here or not. We're just trying to show you and your kind the double standards you have. You can't even see it. You are horrible at debating and we actually laugh about this entire thing off the record. It's comical how when someone builds an excellent argument, you tuck tail and run behind a <b>guideline</b> and can't even provide a valid argument. A monkey can link to guidelines. If a team of nobel prize winning scientists decided to release their latest findings on Wikipedia, you would mark the article for deletion and cite guidelines about notability, etc, when you have no credentials to back anything up. --<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaniman_fb34.html" title="User:Ganiman">Ganiman</a> 14:02, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the message, but I'm done with Wikipedia. I think this place is the most useless and hypocritical piece of trash on the internet. Wikipedia plays itself off as this great resource, but it is full of biased editors with no credentials editing and determining the fate of articles on topics they know absolutely nothing about. It's a total farce. I would never ever recommend this site to anyone. It is garbage. --Rolks 14:10, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">question about paid surveys</span></h2>
<p>Hi AbsolutDan,</p>
<p>I'm fairly new to the wikipedia community and could use some policy clarifications.</p>
<p>I recently contributed content to the <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paid_surveys.html" title="Paid surveys">Paid surveys</a> article, expanding and clarifying the section about legitimate paid surveys. I also added <a href="http://www.onlinesurveysource.com/free-online-surveys/" class="external text" title="http://www.onlinesurveysource.com/free-online-surveys/" rel="nofollow">Online Survey Source</a> to the "External Links" section. This resource is, in fact, a list of legitimate paid surveys that are free to join. It seems to me to be an appropriate link, as it is contexually relevant and coming from a contributor to the article, but you removed the link and claimed it was "spammy."</p>
<p>The irony of it is that the first link on the resources list is inactive, and the third link on the resources is obvious made-for-adsense spam site. How are these better than the resource I offered?</p>
<p>Thanks for any clarification you can offer me.</p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>I am a professor of conflict resolution and periodically go through wiki adding material and topics/resources which I believe are helpful and useful. Generally, I bring a single useful piece of information and go through wiki trying to contribute it where appropriate. You reverted a number of items which I feel should not have been. In looking at many of these pages, I see blatantly self-promoting material-which mine has not been.</p>
<p>The site has been a useful point of discussion and research for my classes and interns and I would hope to continue using the site. I realize you are trying to protect the site from spam and abuse, that is clearly your area of expertise: mine is conflict resolution and international relations and I believe I have something to offer on that front.</p>

<p>Hi Dan, Thank you for putting the "smarthome.com" link back onto the page, I took it off because it is a retail link and I thought that perhaps that was part of the issue, but if not I appreciate you putting it back up there. I understand that the page reads like an advertisement, however, I work in the marketing department of Smarthome and sometimes it is hard to take off my marketing hat and just be informative. I tried to add factual history to the page from our website, but was told I'm not allowed to use that text because of the copyright (which is funny because I'm putting the page up as an agent of the company and I have permission from the owner of the copyright to do so). I gather that you are somewhat of a wikipedia expert and if you had some time to give me some suggestions on how to make the page sound like less of an advertisement I would greatly appreciate it. I have a million other things to work on everyday and it is frustrating to just keep trying different changes and then getting rejected. Please help. Any suggestions or input would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>Regarding links in Bougainville. We are not a commercial organization, we are a not for profit NGO and work in the field of peacebuilding and conflict resolution. One of our funding values is the benefit of comparative learning - ie actors in conflict or post-conflict zones could benefit reading first hand experiences from people who have been involved in a similar situation - our aim (as wikipedia's) is to inform and educate. I would therefore appreciate if you would reconsider withdrawing our link from the Bougainville site, as our issue (which, in concert with our values is provided for free for all to see on the web) on the Bougainville conflict is probably the only one of its kind (not a high priority conflict for many) and offers first hand insights from those involved in the peace process mediators and belligerent parties alike, detailed chronology of the conflict and key texts and peace agreements.</p>

<dd>However, compared to many other links in the articles I've added links to - I find it absolutely ridicilous to remove links that provide users of wikipedia references to primary sources such as peace agreements and ceasefire agreements (especially in articles that are exclusively about the agreements in question) as well as in depth analysis of the conflicts and peace processes (all ofcourse free for all to see - and let me stress once again that this is not a for profit organisation). So please could you have a quick look and judge for yourselve before you let your robots indiscrimanately erase all links that I make.</dd>

<dd>Dan. Thanks and I understand. I have gone over it with another member of wikipedia and he helped us make the changes found on the page now...I hope they help. As you did mention our ranking on alexa of 73K... that is a 3 month ranking. the daily total for today was 32K. Most popular forums and review sites require that you are within the top 100K which we are by far. Although you are correct we are just coming out of beta, that doesnt negate the fact that we are on average getting consistent traffic and as of todays totals, we recieve more page views per user than google. So while our user base is small they are consistent and its growing.

<p>Dan,</p>
<p>The external link I added to The Noble Leader is legitimate. It is NOT a commercial site, and only provides content on the topic of leadership. Using external links that add to the content provided on a specific Wikipedia topic is a reasonable and responsible act. It is not spam. Accordingly, I plan to put the link back in.</p>

<dd>Kuru &amp; AbsoluteDan,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Allow me to clarify why The Noble Leader is a legitimate external link.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am writing a book on leadership, not just my 'musings' on leadership in a blog. I've spent several years researching the topic, and am considered an expert on the topic by my peer reviewers. If you're in doubt, then actually read what's on the website - not just what's on the front page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your point that I shouldn't add my own link is reasonable and I accept that. That's not a problem. It was a reviewer of mine that suggested that I put the link on Wikipedia. He thought it would be worth sharing. I will mention to him that it's not appropriate for me to add it, and will suggest that he do so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Additionally, I've changed my approach on my own website. I will not publish "rough draft" material, but rather material ready for publication only. This may reduce the content somewhat, but everything within would be considered expert opinion by reasonable leadership aficionados.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's one other thing that I want to say here. Wikipedia is about all of us. It's not just about your view of what you consider legitimate or not. I'm not in this for selfish reasons. I am passionate about leadership, and have spent years learning about it. I have a right to share my knowledge and a link to my book's non-commericial website is reasonable act.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please stop forcing your views of what is spam on other Wikipedians.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sincerely,</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">FFXIclopedia</span></h2>
<p>This is totally unbeleivable. This is what I mean by the wikipedia being a tyrannical dictatorship. I knew I shouldn't have bothered to even come back. You all all totally psychotic when it comes to control of this stupid database. I didn't "recreate" the page. I put in a redirect because there were FFXIclopedia links all over the Wikipedia. The redirect went to Final Fantasy XI page. So instead of dead end links, there would be a redirect. But I guess even that is too much for you psychotic control freaks. I had no intentions of "recreating" the page. It got voted down. I can think of nothing more to add that would get it past a vote. So I have given up on creating a FFXIclopedia page. I figured I'd be curteous, though, and put in a redirect so there wouldn't be a dead end link. But if you want to be that freakin' anal, I'll leave it alone.</p>

I'm having problems with <a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">User:Peephole</a> who keeps reverting all the changes I make to a page on <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Hoffman_a00e.html" title="Jim Hoffman">Jim Hoffman</a>. We've attempted some discussion of the changes on the discussion section but cannot agree on some of the issues. He has reported me for reverting his reverts, which have reposted wrong information (such as claims of nanotechnology involvement). Hoffman is a public figure, to some extent, gives talks and radio interviews, and it is problematic to have his website links deleted and re-insertions of citation requests via the reverts, after those have been provided. While <a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">User:Peephole</a> and I disagree on the description of Hoffman as a conspiracy theorist, I don't see why this should be a basis for him to make wholesale reverts of all page changes.

<p>Dear Dan,</p>
<p>I understand your concern. Lifelong Learning Management System a.k.a. LLMS is a trademark registered by Auguste Enterprises in 2001. Auguste Enterprises partnering with LERN (an international association of lifelong learning programming, <a href="http://www.lern.org" class="external free" title="http://www.lern.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.lern.org</a>) became the first company to produce a completely web based management tool to incorporate the administration of Lifelong Learning for high schools, colleges and universities. I do not believe the link I placed is out of context in that sense.</p>
<p>I will be adding more articles about lifelong learning and related subjects. Some of those articles would have external links including but not limited to Augusoft itself. I hope this will not cause any issues.</p>

<dd>I believe you will agree that an article about Kleenex could include a link to Kleenex.com, same as an article about Lifelong Learning Management System (LLMS) should include a link to the parent companies LERN and Augusoft. I do agree including a commercial link to Augusoft in an article about education would be irrelevant and should be avoided.</dd>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>I emailed you last night and today, but I'm not sure you received them. I am also unsure as to whether or not I should post here in response to your concerns.</p>
<p>I understand and agree with your decision to remove the link from the Angel site. That was a poor choice on my part.</p>
<p>In regards to your other concerns on the site, I'm not exactly sure how I am violating Wikipedia's policies. I referenced several commercial/vendor sites on Wikipedia that are not currently under editor review and used them as a template from which to base my entry on. I assumed that if I included similar information, then I would be okay. For example, Blackboard, WebCT, Desire2Learn, and several other vendors, have the same contents that my site has. In addition, I attempted, and would like feedback from you if this was insufficient, to write the site in a neutral manner. For instance, I had initially used the word "enhance", but changed it to "facilitate", because I thought that was more neutral sounding. Concerning the external links, I listed so many external links because I modeled that part after the Desire2Learn site that also had several external links.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd be glad to beef the site up and share more content there. However, I'm not exactly sure as to what you would like to see. The other commercial/vendor sites are listed in the category of "software companies". I imagine that this would be the right category for our site as well. I can share more about the company if you like or I can discuss our approach to elearning (integrating social networking and LMS technology). Whatever the case, I'll be happy to do so, please just email me with your recommendations.</p>

<dd>Hi Dan,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your response. I'll respond here and not email you in the future.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think we are in agreement on external links. However, I'm still sensing a little bit of a discrepency, or inconsistency, with the Desire2Learn site and, now, the Angel Learning site and our site. Initially, the Angel site was referred to as a "stub". I imagine you haven't seen the latest version, but it is now updated and in line with the other vendor sites. I believe it should have the same criticims you have of our entry and have the external links removed as you have already done with Desire2Learn. Thank you for being fair and consistent in that area. The primary area that I see as discrepent is Desire2Learn has one editor entry at the top that indicates it does not reference sources, whereas our entry has a big blue box that highlights that there are editor concerns. The Angel Learning site has neither a little box or a big blue box. I think that one way to maintain consistency would be to put a little blue box on our entry and a little blue box on Angel's entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'll work towards finding external sources as well. Some folks at Educause did a podcast on us and a couple of elearning blog sites have mentioned us. These are not considered traditional media, but I imagine the new media emphasis as evidenced here in Wikipedia will likely warrant that these links are okay and helpful in meeting the software guidelines.</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your efforts and integrity. I appreciate the compromise and will do my best to add additional, credible, external sources, in the near future. I don't know if you noticed that I did add an educause podcast. I'm not sure if that is sufficient, but it is from a elearning instructional designer who is not at all affiliated with our company.</dd>

<p>Hi AbsolutDan,</p>
<p>I appreciate your efforts here to make articles better. I see you posted some tags on the article I created about DJ Lynnwood. Just to clarify, I am NOT DJ Lynnwood. I am a big fan of DJ Culture and underground music. As to relevance, to my knowledge (SoundScan) DJ Lynnwood has sold hundreds and thousands of records in the US and abroad and is a nominating member of the Grammys. He is on the radio every week for 4 hours in many markets, and appears as a guest on many radio stations and satellite radio.</p>
<p>i see many similar DJ's in Wikipedia and intend to add more. But they are not tagged irrelevant, and their articles are so much less information and short. Can you help me make article better and verify so these demeaning tags are not neccessary?</p>
<p>Today I want to add article on Swedish Egil, very similar history as DJ Lynnwood, Richard Humpt Vission, Bad Boy Bill.</p>

<p>I added my link because I believe that my article adds relevant content and tips to the topic.</p>
<p>I don't understand how my link is different from Gina Hiatt's link about "The Three P's" which is an article within her web site about her academic coaching services.</p>
<p>Do I need to read further about the types of information and links you are looking for? I believe that if my link is removed, then you may also want to remove the link to Dr. Hiatt and Dr. Kuther's articles because all three are articles on procrastination specifically targeted for academics.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">eLearning 2.0</span></h2>
<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>You recently removed links to two articles that I've written on eLearning 2.0 from that page citing them as commercial. While certainly I'm commercial in that I run a business dedicated to web and eLearning development, I've created a personal blog that is separate from my business and it is not commercial. Instead I put content there that I write about (for publication in places like ASTD's publications) and speak about.</p>
<p>I would be curious why you find the articles that I linked to as being commercial? I have a completely different mindset when I writing, speaking, etc. I'm really trying to help folks in corporate learning functions understand what is going on. I truly think those articles are helpful and they've been cited a fair amount (as has my blog as a whole) espcially in the small corporate eLearning circles. Am I missing something here?</p>
<p>I'm really not trying to be a pain or something here. I find Wikipedia itself to be extremely valuable and understand some of the challenge (but not that well). At the same time, I feel I have something to contribute. Heck, I created the original article based on what Steve Downes (who is primarily in academia) and I (primarily in corporate world) and a few others have written about the subject.</p>
<p>Take Care,</p>
<p>Tony</p>
<p>P.S. As a follow-up thought - since it appears that this is a common discussion with you, maybe you could include some of your responses to the above "talk" so that I wouldn't be asking you the same stuff. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.115.126.182 (<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.115.126.182.html" title="User talk:65.115.126.182">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.115.126.182_076b.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.115.126.182">contribs</a>) 01:14, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Can you please take a look at this article? An anonymous user,58.69.210.239, decided to redirect the article without any discussion or consultation. The redirect to the Invader disambiguation page is of no help whatsoever, and makes little sense. I am not certain about how to revert it, though I attempted editing to an earlier version of the article, and it did not work. Your help would be greatly appreciated.

<p>In addition to the article, I also added a reference to a book from a time management expert in the 'Further Reading' section of the Wikipedia entry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management</a>.</p>
<p>I entered the book in a fashion identical to the others found here, and am also curious as to the reason of its deletion.</p>
<p>I would like to make a contribution which is valuable to the readership of this open source of information, so I appreciate any assistance which you can provide me with in understanding these issues!</p>

<p>I created a new page for Mark Barry the football hooligan, rather than change the page for Mark Barry the musician. Yet it has been deleted. Has anyone who is doing the deleting actually researched football culture and seen the references to Mark Barry? As I posted on the discussion page (though it has since been deleted, for some reason), yes, there is some nonsense there, not added by anyone who I know of who has worked on the page, but the person is very real and the facts are correct. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by PipeDown (<a href="../../../p/i/p/User_talk%7EPipeDown_10db.html" title="User talk:PipeDown">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PipeDown_f9b4.html" title="Special:Contributions/PipeDown">contribs</a>) 19:42, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>I'd say: no, there is no evidence that the edits have any merit.
