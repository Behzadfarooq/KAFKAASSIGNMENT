As Volume 1 opens, she has just been rejected by the person she had a <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infatuation.html" title="Infatuation">crush</a> on. While she is out ranting about the recent rejection, she finds a cell phone and soon receives a call from its owner. Upon meeting him to return the phone, Riiko assumes the man is a <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosplay.html" title="Cosplay">cosplayer</a> because of his odd style of clothing. Instead, he claims to be a salesman and directs her to a website where she can order a <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boyfriend.html" title="Boyfriend">boyfriend</a>. Initially skeptical, Riiko accepts after finding that there is a free three-day trial offer, which she intends to cancel after the trial expires.</p>
<p>The next day, a large package is delivered to Riiko's home. It contains what Riiko at first thinks is a naked <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadaver.html" title="Cadaver">cadaver</a>, but she soon finds out it is a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanoid_robot.html" title="Humanoid robot">robot</a>, indistinguishable from a human except for a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcode.html" title="Barcode">barcode</a> hidden on the back of its ear. After a kiss which registers her as its “lover,” she names the figure "Night."</p>
<p>After her three-day trial is over, Riiko finds that she cannot return him and is stuck with a bill for 100,000,000 <a href="../../../y/e/n/Yen.html" title="Yen">yen</a> (approximately 1 million <a href="../../../u/s/d/USD_3518.html" title="USD">USD</a>). The mysterious salesman from Kronos Heaven, Namikiri Gaku, tells her the company will waive the bill if she will help them collect data about women's <a href="../../../m/o/o/Mood_%28psychology%29.html" title="Mood (psychology)">moods</a> and feelings in order to perfect future “Nightly Lover” models.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Riiko, her next-door neighbor and childhood friend, Soushi Asamoto, has a crush on her which he strives to hide by frequently teasing her. He has promised her mother that he will watch over Riiko while her parents are away, and when he sees Riiko with her new "boyfriend," his <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jealousy.html" title="Jealousy">jealousy</a> creates the central <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_triangle.html" title="Love triangle">love triangle</a> of the series.</p>
<p>In order to help Riiko, Night finds a job at a local escort service. One customer kisses Night after he takes her home, and his program resets to make him the customer's lover. Riiko finds out that Night will reset whenever a new person kisses him, and that he will become the permanent lover of the first person who has <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sex</a> with him. Riiko realizes that Night is important to her, and realizes she could lose him forever, so she tries everything she can to get him back before he becomes the other woman's permanent lover. She later finds out that Night doesn't know about this aspect of his programming.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolute_Boyfriend_f718.html" title="Edit section: Volumes 3-6">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Volumes 3-6</span></h3>
<p>In order to retrieve Night, Riiko attempts to sneak inside the building where he is staying with his new lover. As she is sneaking around, she slips and almost falls off the building, but Night ventures outside just in time. After saving Riiko, Night kisses her and again recognizes her as his <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girlfriend.html" title="Girlfriend">girlfriend</a>.</p>
<p>Gaku Namikiri declares that Night and Riiko must have sex to ensure that she will not lose him again. In order to facilitate this, Mr. Gaku invites the couple to an island <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacation.html" title="Vacation">vacation</a>. Night finds it only fair to invite Soshi, who has previously declared his intention to win Riiko in open war. The entire love triangle is therefore transported to the island.</p>
<p>Once there, Riiko doesn't have a chance to be alone with Night because Soshi keeps continuous watch over them. Riiko is unable to sleep that night. When she goes for a walk in the morning, she gets lost in an underground cave. Soshi eventually finds her when he falls into the cave and falls asleep. Riiko falls asleep as well, but when Night finds the two together, he becomes jealous and carries Riiko to a nearly inaccessible part of the island and leaves Soshi asleep in the cave.</p>
<p>When Riiko wakes up, she realizes the room is not the one they were staying in before, but she can’t get out. Later, Night attempts to have sex with her again, but she pushes him away. Once he understands her feelings, he backs off.</p>
<p>Eventually Soshi returns to their previous lodging, but he has contracted a fever. Night and Riiko return as well, but their vacation ends without sexual consummation.</p>
<p>Mr. Gaku again expresses how important it is for Riiko to have sex with Night before he is accidentally reset again, but Riiko has mixed feelings. While Night is out, he walks past a business which is promoting its opening and receives a <a href="../../../v/o/u/Voucher.html" title="Voucher">voucher</a> for a free <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spa.html" title="Spa">spa</a> visit. Riiko agrees to go with Night to the spa, which is run by Kronos Haven, because she believes that she will be under little sexual pressure.</p>
<p>Once Riiko and Night arrive at the spa, the manager tells them to strip, which somewhat worries Riiko. The two are then attached by strings tied to their wrists; Night assumes that if the string snaps, it is a sign that they can’t stay together. Along with other couples, Riiko and Night enter a game which comprises several different levels. Riiko and Night are on the final level when another man tries to kiss Riiko because his girlfriend has run off to pursue Night. When Riiko tries to run away, the string snaps and she falls down a waterfall along with the other girl. Night catches Riiko, but the other man falls when reaching out for his girlfriend. Although Riiko and Night won the race, they are disqualified because their string broke. However, the other couple gives them the prize, a voucher for a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_%28classification%29.html" title="Star (classification)">5-star hotel</a> room, because Riiko and Night have helped them to renew their love.</p>
<p>Riiko finally resolves to have sex with Night and she agrees to go on a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtship.html" title="Courtship">date</a> that the two plan. Before they can leave, however, Riiko's parents return and discover them together. Believing Night is Riiko’s boyfriend, her father is displeased and tells him to go home. Night has nowhere to go, so he waits for Riiko out in the street. Mr. Gaku passes by and encourages Night back to return and try to make a better impression on Riiko’s parents. Meanwhile, Riiko has persuaded her parents to let her use the voucher to take them to dinner at the hotel.</p>
<p>They invite Soshi along, but he declines, leaving Riiko feeling a little guilty for making him wait for her to make up her mind about him. At the hotel, Night approaches Riiko’s parents wearing a <a href="../../../t/u/x/Tuxedo_%28clothing%29.html" title="Tuxedo (clothing)">tuxedo</a> and explains that he works there to earn money for his and Riiko’s future. After drinking too much at dinner, Riiko’s father must be taken to the <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospital</a>. Mr. Gaku arrives and introduces Night as “the director’s son.” Riiko’s parents are impressed, so they agree to allow Riiko to date him; unfortunately, Night accidentally mentions their plan to use the hotel voucher to get a room together, and Riiko’s father becomes enraged.</p>
<p>Unable to use the voucher, Night instead earns enough money to rent a hotel room another night. He and Riiko plan to spend the day together and go to the hotel that night.</p>
<p>At the <a href="../../../a/m/u/Amusement_park.html" title="Amusement park">amusement park</a>, Riiko encounters her childhood love, Toshiki, who helps her after she hurts her ankle. In order to repay him for helping Riiko, Night takes Toshiki’s little brother, Yuki, to the restroom. While he is gone, Riiko and Toshiki kiss and then ride the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferris_wheel.html" title="Ferris wheel">Ferris wheel</a> together.</p>
<p>Riiko later leaves with Night without telling him about the kiss. Once they arrive at the hotel, Riiko is shocked to see Toshiki is there as well. He visits their room while Night is in the shower; when he kisses Riiko again, he passes her a pill which causes her to faint. When Night is returns to the room and finds Riiko gone, he runs all over the hotel looking for her wearing nothing but a towel. He eventually returns to the room, but he falls unconscious when Yuki arrives and drugs him by whispering in his ear.</p>
<p>When Riiko finally wakes, it is morning, and she is naked in bed with Toshiki. He tells her what a great time he had, and she runs away, believing they had sex. She returns to her room, only to find Night unconscious. She revives him, but doesn’t tell him about what happened. Night apologizes for not finding her, making her feel even guiltier. They return home.</p>
<p>Later that night, Riiko reveals what happened. Angry, Night leaves. Riiko doesn’t try to stop him. Toshiki arrives and, pushing her down, tries to kiss her again. Mr. Gaku discovers Night walking through the streets, and Night confesses that he can’t have sex with Riiko because he won’t do it unless she wants him to.</p>
<p>Mr. Gaku calls his manager to return Night to Kronos Heaven, but Night realizes he doesn't want to lose Riiko and runs back home, jumping up the few stories. He crashes through the balcony door and attacks Toshiki. The two fight. Toshiki initially betters Night, but is defeated when Night unexpectedly twists Toshiki’s arm out of the socket, revealing him as a robot. Yuki enters and calls Toshiki off. He reveals himself to be the <a href="../../../c/e/o/CEO_8589.html" title="CEO">CEO</a> of Kronos Heaven and he and Mr. Gaku take Toshiki away. Toshiki was not Riiku’s childhood love, but was actually a New series model masquerading as the real Toshiki.</p>
<p>Night seems to have escaped the fight unscathed; however, when he greets Riiko the next morning, she realizes something is wrong when he begins to speak in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Mandarin (linguistics)">Mandarin</a>, then <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a>. After she finds out his cooking skills have also diminished, smoke comes out of Night’s ears and he collapses.</p>
<p>Riiko takes Night home, where his condition gradually deteriorates until he shuts down altogether. Riiko is in a state of panic as Mr. Gaku arrives and takes him away. Soshi arrives and finds Riiko in her room where he finds Night’s <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_guide.html" title="User guide">operating manual</a>. He lectures her about how Night is not a real person, then tries to kiss her. However, a miniature Night returns and kicks him, whereupon Soshi declares all-out war on Night for Riiko’s love.</p>
<p>Night must now exist in a doll-sized body while the damage to his original body is being repaired. Despite his size, he stays with Riiko, even attending school with her. One day after school, Night accidentally knocks Riiko’s glasses to the floor while staying in her pocket, prompting Soshi to take him to an empty classroom and lecture him about how he is only causing Riiko trouble. A passing student, Miyabe, overhears them and asks to borrow Night in order to examine him, pretending that she still believes he is only a <a href="../../../d/o/l/Doll.html" title="Doll">doll</a>. Riiko, desperate to recover Night, later visits Miyabe’s house with Soshi and reveals that the doll is really Night.</p>
<p>Mr. Gaku soon reveals to Riiko that Night’s original body cannot be returned to her because of the prohibitive cost of repairing it while the company is in the process of making the New model series*_*. Riiko also will not be allowed to keep the miniature Night; instead, he will be replaced by another model from the same series. Upset, Riiko demands to see the old Night. Mr. Gaku agrees, and they are driven through a “secret passage” which is supposedly a portal to the future. They find Night lying on what looks like a hospital bed, and Riiko is faced with a difficult choice: leave him in his damaged condition, or restart him and reset all his <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memories.html" title="Memories">memories</a>. If left in his current state, the company will dispose of him; he has previously been deemed a failure, as he did not collect much data on women and even failed to have sex with Riiko. Night refuses to have his memory erased, but Riiko ultimately decides that is the best course; at least he will be able to be happy with a new lover. Mr. Gaku agrees, and Riiko and Soshi leave.</p>
<p>Afterward, Riiko feels uncomfortable, moody, and <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression_%28mood%29.html" title="Depression (mood)">depressed</a>. Living without Night doesn't feel right to her. Riiko finally concludes that she needs him whether he is human or not, and she goes to sit in the park, feeling depressed. Just as she realizes that she will never see Night again, she hears his voice calling her. She turns to see Night standing behind her. In tears, she passionately hugs him, and he explains that he has recovered, though it is obvious that he is still damaged from the fight. They go home.</p>
<p>When Mr. Gaku and Yuki discover Night is missing, they are outraged. They worry that he has become rebellious and that they have no control over him. Mr. Gaku and Yuki are assigned to bring Night back lest they lose their jobs. In order to accomplish this, they send a female robot dressed as a <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurse.html" title="Nurse">nurse</a> to kiss him and reset him to be her lover. The nurse visits Riiko’s school where she finds Night and tries to force him to kiss her. Night, refusing to be reset and forget Riiko, jumps out the window. The nurse chases him and accidentally falls on him, causing him further injury. She carries him to a room, but just as she is about to kiss him, Riiko interrupts and attempts to start a fight with her. Before this can occur, Soshi enters, distracting Riiko and giving the nurse the opportunity to kiss Night. She fails, however, when she accidentally kisses Soshi, thereby becoming Soshi’s lover.</p>
<p>Soshi finally realizes that Riiko cares more for Night than for him, so he gives up trying to win her. Riiko, even more confused, starts home with Soshi, Night, and the nurse. On their way, they encounter Mr. Gaku, Yuki, and several robots who attempt to destroy Night. Night destroys each robot in turn, convincing Mr. Gaku and Yuki that this plan has failed. They instead decide to send Riiko a different model from the Nightly Series to become her lover.</p>
<p>Once home, Soshi demands that Riiko declare who she really likes, him or Night. Her recent experience has convinced her that Night is the one whom she loves, and she regretfully tells Soshi. He is somewhat upset, but he tells her he understands, then goes home.</p>
<p>Mr. Gaku and Yuki arrive at Riiko’s house where they try to force Night to come back with them to Kronos Heaven. They explain that he will eventually break down if he doesn’t wear his <a href="../../../m/o/o/Mood_ring.html" title="Mood ring">mood ring</a>, but Night reveals that he has been carrying the ring all the time. Realizing they are lying, he smashes it and declares that real humans don’t need such things. Mr. Gaku and Yuki leave, convincing him they no longer want him back. However, they still plan to send another robot to take his place.</p>
<p>The next day, Riiko notices that Night’s condition is worsening. After checking his temperature, she goes to the store to buy ice to help cool him. While she is away, Mr. Gaku and Yuki replace Night with the new Nightly model robot. When Riiko returns, the robot greets her, kisses her, and attempts to have sex with her. When she rebuffs him, he tries to convince her, and Riiko realizes he isn’t Night because Night had always backed off when she said she wasn’t ready. She pushes the robot away, exclaiming that he’s not Night, and the real Night rushes in, surprising Riiko. The new model declares a fight, refusing to give up Riiko.</p>
<p>During the fight, the new model has the initial advantage. Soshi hears the ruckus and enters, and when he finds out what is happening, he encourages Night just enough for him to gain the advantage and knock the new model out.</p>
<p>Just as it seems that Riiko and Night are safe, the new model revives and captures Riiko. Night pursues them all over the city, causing general chaos and a major scene. Night eventually catches up and defeats the new model, thereby recovering Riiko. Unfortunately, agents of Kronos Heaven surround him and demand his surrender. He refuses, explaining that he renounces all ties to the company. He then pulls Riiko closer and tells her he will never let her go. Surprised, Mr. Gaku realizes that Night is becoming much more than a mere robot.</p>
<p>Night and Riiko return home. Riiko finally feels as though she truly loves Night, and decides that she is ready for the next step. Riiko and Night for the first time, make love. This is a major point in the story because it is then that Night becomes Riiko's true lover, and completes his mission as a Nightly model series. Moreover, it is also apparent that Night has fully recovered from previous injuries.</p>
<p>The next day, while taking a walk, Night's eye turns to a street stand - inwhich some man is selling some rings. He buys one for Riiko, and a matching pair for himself as well.</p>
<p>The day after, it is revealed by Soshi, that he would be moving in a weeks time to Spain. Riiko somewhat upset, disapproves. Although, this will not stop Soshi, for the only reason why he stayed was for Riiko - who apparently is in love with Night. Before he leaves however, they have a goodbye party. Riiko is dead asleep on the couch while Soshi and Night are chatting on the balcony. Night at once tells him to make sure to always take care of Riiko if anything happens to him( which is somewhat a hint to what will happen in the future). Soshi agrees, and gives Riiko his last kiss, and is gone the next day.</p>
<p>A few months pass, and Night and Riiko are still maintaining a healthy relationship. It happens that one day Riiko has to leave for something, but tells Night to stay. Before Riiko leaves, Night calls her over and says "I love you". After returning his love, she then leaves.</p>
<p>When she comes back she finds Gaku in her apartment putting Night away. She quickly tries to stop him, although it happens that Night will never wake up again. Gaku explains that, just like humans, model series only live a certain amount of time. It is possible that Night may wake up in the future, but not any time soon - and by that time, Riiko may be too old. Riiko is now crying, and tries to kiss him. Nothing works.</p>
<p>In the end, Soshi returns. Riiko has finally accepted that Night will not wake up anytime soon, so it is unrealistic to hold on to him. Although, she keeps the ring close to her, placing it in a little box.</p>
<p>When Soshi returns Riiko is somewhat surprised, and questions Soshi on why he returned. He then tells Riiko that Night had sent him a letter, and ring, telling him that he needs to take care of Riiko because he will not be around much longer. After this, there is an impression that Riiko and Soushi are planning to date. The story ultimately ends with Riiko saying "Even though Night may never wake up, he will always be my first man".</p>

<dt>Riiko Izawa</dt>
<dd>Riiko doesn't seem to have any luck with boys until she meets a strange salesman and ends up accidentally ordering a <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boyfriend.html" title="Boyfriend">boyfriend</a>: Night Tenjo. Riiko is rather naïve, clumsy, and simple-minded, but kindhearted and hardworking. She seems to have feelings for Soshi and Night, which becomes the primary conflict of the story.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Night Tenjo</dt>
<dd>Night is the perfect boyfriend: charming, dependable, intelligent, athletic, good-looking, sensitive, devoted, and completely loyal. Because he is unaware of certain <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_conventions.html" title="Social conventions">social conventions</a>, he often seems over-the-top and attracts a lot of attention. Although he is a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanoid_robot.html" title="Humanoid robot">robot</a>, albeit of a high-caliber design, he seems to have genuine emotions and to want to become more human and be a better boyfriend to Riiko. He wears a <a href="../../../m/o/o/Mood_ring.html" title="Mood ring">mood ring</a> that indicates Riiko's emotions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Soshi Asamoto</dt>
<dd>Soshi has had a crush on Riiko since they were both children, though he has never found the nerve to confess his real feelings and instead teases her.
