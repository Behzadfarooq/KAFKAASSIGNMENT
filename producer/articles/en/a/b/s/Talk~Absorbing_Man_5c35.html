<p>OK, found a good reason why a cover is the best way to go here:</p>
<hr />
<p>"The WikiProject suggests the following factors be followed when choosing an appropriate image for the info box. It is felt that using the most universally recognisable appearance of a character, for example Spider-Man in the red and blue rather than some other costume, and using a noteworthy image, either well discussed or used in many other sources, or a promotional piece of artwork the copyright holders have released for promotional purposes fits this purpose best.</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the fair use criteria, especially <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_copyright_ae12.html#Images_which_cannot_be_.22fair_use.22" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics/copyright">the Images that cannot be fair use guidelines</a>. These supersede all the following criteria. Also, source your images fully (including <b>all</b> applicable from issue/page/panel, scan source, web source) and give a fair use rationale.</li>
<li>Ensure that the picture clearly shows as much of the character as possible:
<ul>
<li>The ideal image is a full-body, three-quarter picture of the character standing straight with no background, with a facing-the-camera or profile picture as the next-best.</li>
<li>If a full-body shot is unavailable, the picture <b>must</b> show the whole of the head and torso (or the equivalent for non-humanoid characters).</li>
<li>Visibly contorted poses should <b>not</b> be used under any circumstances.</li>
<li>Pictures which hide significant areas of the character in shadow should be avoided (exceptions apply only where the shadow is <i>itself</i> part of the character's look - e.g. <a href="../../../r/a/v/Raven_%28comics%29.html" title="Raven (comics)">Raven</a>.), as should pictures where blur or distortion effects are applied.</li>
<li>Colouring should be neutral - pictures which have a heavy colour cast, or otherwise depict the character with false colours should <b>not</b> be uploaded unless the cast has been removed first.</li>
<li>Heavily stylised art should only be considered for use when the character is closely associated with the style to the exclusion of less extreme styles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pictures which have more characters and/or objects than the subject of the article should only be used if the subject is the most prominent object - editing the picture, by cropping, obscuring and/or painting out the other characters may help to ensure this.</li>
<li>If the character has a clearly-defined primary costume (e.g. <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>), a picture of this should be used. Otherwise, the most recent ongoing costume of the character should be used."</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Actually, this does not in any way give preference towards using a cover image for the SHB. In fact, it indicates a preference for the image not to be cluttered by objects other than the subject. I have reverted it back to the previous image for this reason. --GentlemanGhost 09:05, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is this a mature response? Did you listen to what the moderator said? Why is this such a bone of contention? The list - with <b>references</b> no less - tells readers about the many properties that the character can absorb! This is what a new reader will want to know. Can he absorb water? Or what happens if he touches Mjolnir? The new passages are also much more succinct and less "tell the story", which is a major weakness of many comic entries. This can only help others. Please be reasonable.</p>

<dd>This list is nothing more than fancruft. Like your "Significant appearances" lists, it attempts to create a checklist for "new readers." Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. Any references you provide can and should be worked into the text of the article.</dd>
<dd>But let's look at what else you are doing when you insert this stuff. You've removed the caption to the main pic. You've removed creator information from the lead section. You remove any mention of his trademark ball-and-chain from the Powers and abilities section. You change the headers away from Comics Project guidelines. You insert your own POV into descriptions of fights.</dd>
<dd>It is for all those reasons that I have, once again, reverted your edits. Why don't you address these shortcomings instead? <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> 18:25, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
The edits getting much better, but the fact remains the text is much tighter and informative. The information is invaluble for new readers. Please, do not be so territorial.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/s/g/User%7EAsgardian_37db.html" title="User:Asgardian">Asgardian</a> 10:19, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS - the removal of the caption was an accident, and I wrote it in the first place. The ball and chain were always mentioned in Powers and Abilities, and I've mentioned them again to make it even clearer. It reads quite well, and the text is objective.</p>

<dd>It is good that you reference your edits, Asgardian. That is an excellent practice which more editors (myself included) should follow. However, I feel that the information which you have referenced would be better presented as a single sentence, not as a list. Presenting this as a list gives it more weight than it duly deserves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I'm not sure if you've looked at the instructions for the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Template%7ESuperherobox_3637.html" title="Template:Superherobox">Template:Superherobox</a>, but the recommended maximum size for images is 250px.</dd>

<dd>Creel's ability is to absorb the properties of whatever material he touches, even of the material he touches has powers of it's own. However, Creel doesn't have the ability to absorb the superhuman powers of other beings. For instance, if Creel were to touch Thor's enchanted hammer Mjolnir, and will his body to, his bodily tissues would take on the appearance, strength, and durability of the the uru metal that it's composed of. Also, since the hammer is filled with magical energies, Creel would absorb those energies and use them as Thor would so long as he maintained contact with the hammer itself. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a> 00:56, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not a clue. If it has a source, I don't care if it's included or not. If someone else wants it here, fine. The source is the big issue. If the source in a Marvel Universe handbook, then we can't use it for two big reasons: (1) Wikipedia just flat says don't. One encyclopedia can't just lift information from another for copyright reasons. (2) Marvel and DC keep changing the information that's in those handbooks. Until something is mentioned in a story, it's not appropriate for inclusion here. If the source is a story, people can include or leave it out. I don't care where he's from. One can argue that its relevance to character history is questionable. Someone else can certainly argue that encyclopedia entries for real people will mention where they were born. New Yorkers might say it matters whether or not someone's a New Yorker. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 09:20, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
