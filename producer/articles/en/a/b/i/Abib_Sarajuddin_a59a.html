<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>Before the Tribunal's President proceeded, he addressed a promise made to Sarajuddin by one of his interrogators. Sarajuddin's interrogator had, apparently, promised him that <i>"if he swore an</i> oath on the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koran.html" title="Koran">Koran</a>, and provided a statement, he'd be set free."</p>
<p>The Tribunal's President explained the Tribunal had nothing to do with previous promises; he hoped that Sarajuddin would choose to swear an oath, but that doing so wouldn't guarantee release.</p>

<p>Most detainees had the allegations against them read out, one at a time, and responnded to each in turn. But when Sarajuddin had finished his initial statement his Personal Representative suggested that his statement had addressed all but one of the issued in the allegations against him, so it would save time to skip reading out each allegation in turn. His transcript does not record the allegations against him.</p>

<p>Sarajuddin described agreeing to a request by a tribal elder, Nazim, to speak to people in four neighboring village, asking them to rally in opposition to the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a>, at the time the USA was about to attack. The tribal elder, named Nasim, made the request on behalf of <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacha_Khan_8703.html" title="Pacha Khan">Pacha Khan</a>. The Taliban fell so quickly there was no local fighting. The new <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamid_Karzai_9fff.html" title="Hamid Karzai">Hamid Karzai</a> government subsequently appointed Khan the local governor of Sarajuddin's district.</p>
<p>Sarajuddin said a few days later Americans bombarded his house, killing his wife, and a number of other family members.</p>
<p>About a month later American forces came and captured himself, his brother, son, and a neighbor. There was no resistance. He didn't see or hear any sign of gunshots. He had no radio.</p>
<p>Sarajuddin said he still doesn't understand why the Americans killed his family and took him captive.</p>

<p>At this point the Tribunal President wanted to give Sarajuddin an opportunity to answer each allegation one at a time. But Sarajuddin's Personal Representative convinced him that Sarajuddin's statement had answered all the allegations but one -- whether Pacha Khan was a renegade. Sarajuddin responded that Khan was working with the Americans at the time of his capture, and that he didn't feel responsible for what he might have done after his capture. According to the <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2.html" title="February 2">February 2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> New York Times article Pacha Khan was one of the two politicians competing for American support over the city of <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khost.html" title="Khost">Khost</a>.</p>
<p>Sarajuddin was asked what training he had in electronics. He replied that he had none, and that he didn't even know how to read and write. He said his son and brother also had no training in electronics and that they too were illiterate.</p>
<p>Sarajuddin said he didn't know who might have denounced him.</p>

<p>Sarajuddin called his brother <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khan_Zaman_bc37.html" title="Khan Zaman">Khan Zaman</a> as a witness.</p>
<p>The first questions were posed by Sarajuddin's Personal Representative. In answer to those questions Zaman said he was not present when their household was bombed. He was in <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardez.html" title="Gardez">Gardez</a>. They didn't have any kind of radio. He didn't know why the Americans bombed their house.</p>
<p>Zaman confirmed that Sarajuddin had tried to rally opposition to the Taliban. He confirmed that Pacha Khan had asked Nasim, the tribal elder.</p>
<p>Zaman confirmed that none of them had any training in electronics, and that none of them could read or write.</p>
<p>Zaman confirmed that there was no opposition to the American.</p>

<p>Sarajuddin acknowledged going to Saudi Arabia, once, for <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajj.html" title="Hajj">Hajj</a>.</p>
<p>Sarajuddin denied any involvement with Tabligh Jamaat. He did once worship at a mosque named Jamaat.</p>
<p>Sarajuddin denied that any of his family members ever said that he gave shelter to Jalaluddin Haqqani. He denied that his son stated that Jalaluddin and his bodyguards came to his house and requested to stay. Rather he had a letter from his son that said the complete opposite. The Presiding Officer acknowledged that this letter had been filed into evidence. Sarajuddin asked him if the petition from everyone in his village had been entered into evidence. It hadn't. No one could explain why.</p>
<p>Sarajuddin said he and his relatives and neighbors were not captured in the open, near a Taliban site. They were all captured in their homes. And there were no Taliban installations anywhere in their area.</p>
<p>Sarajuddin said he had never denied that his house was bombed. He had told the whole world his house was bombed.</p>
<p>Sarajuddin said that the allegation that he was denying his house being bombed seemed to contradict the allegation that he went to the governor to request compensation for his house being bombed. However he did not approach the governor himself. His tribal elder Nazim approached him on his behalf.</p>
<p>Sarajuddin denied that there was any firing when he was captured.</p>
<p>Sarajuddin denied that he possessed a transceiver, or that anyone he knew possesses a transceiver.</p>
<p>His Board's Presiding Officer returned to the question of whether there had been any firing during the capture, and said: <i><b>"I want you to be very clear about this allegation. This particular allegation is one of the</b></i> (sic) <b><i>only reasons you were made an Enemy Combatant."</i></b></p>
