<dd>Actually, I have modified my position. I think it should probably be left as a separate page, since it is a slightly more general concept and has a history of its own. I have taken the liberty to move most of the "modern abiogenesis" stuff which is almost exclusively about the origin of life and merge it with the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_life.html" title="Origin of life">origin of life</a> article, but have left a summary and a <i>Main article:</i> pointer here.</dd>

OTOH, abiogenesis has connotations of spontaneous generation, and it currently bears the weight of two different definitions, thus leading to ambiguity. I am therefore suggesting that abiogenesis should refer to spontaneous generation while biogenesis should be used to refer to its current definition regarding the origin of life.. IMO, I doubt that a google hit ranking will reflect this difference in any way, as most of the journals, articles, and textbooks that use these definitions are not online. When I have some more time I will try to present some further evidence for the proposed merge. In my proposal, the article for abiogenesis would still exist but it would not refer to the more modern implication of biopoiesis, just spontaneous generation.

<dd>Abiogenesis is by far the most common term for this, so I think biopoiesis should be merged here instead. (It's not our job to push new terminology.) — <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_D._Bryant_80d2.html" title="User:Bobby D. Bryant">B.Bryant</a> 14:16, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that aiopoiesis may belong here. However, spontaneous generation is sort of different and might belong in a separate article; abiogenesis is related to origin of life, but spontaneous generation usually (especially historically) means the continual emergence of life from non-life, rather than a one-time or few-times event in the distant past.--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 23:38, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it is better to keep some distinctions between a general view (abiogenesis) and have references to other theories that are more specific within the general view (like biopoiesis/biopoesis ... which is right?)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to see the article on biopoiesis/biopoesis expanded to discuss the several (successful) experiments on self-replicating molecules that have been done, rather than using the Miller\Urey experiment (that was only amino acids after all), and to include the finding of amino acids on meteors and in space.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That way biopoiesis/biopoesis can focus on the science and abiogenesis can contend with the creationist/ID crowd paul 01:46, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Im a guest, but these are two completely different things. One from inorganic molecules, and one is an ancient idea explaining decay etc... Dont merge them, it is FAR to innacurate</p>
<p>This is contradicted by the introductory paragraph. Abiogenesis is the name for the idea that life came from non-organic material, and so it also applies to the scientific hypothesis by the same name.</p>

<p><b>Oppose</b> The fact that abiogenesis wins the Google test by a landslide should speak for itself. Biopoesis, as I gather, is a different term.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>oppose</b> Abiogenesis and biogeneis were originally used to describe the division that existed in the Spontaneous Generation era. Biogeneis held that life would arise from life or materials derived from life, independent of parents e.g. internal parasites (how else did they get there?). Life was thought to contain a life force and this magical force could make more of itself e.g. the electricity used to boot-up Frankenstein’s Monster. Whereas, abiogenesis was opposed to biogeneis and offered a mechanistic view of life. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) was one of the first to propose abiogenesis. Biopoiesis began with Oparin and Haldane in the early 20th century, it is modern study of life’s origin <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDiamonddavej_1d7f.html" title="User:Diamonddavej">Diamond Dave</a> 23/02/2006 19:14</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>oppose</b> The two are close but not identical. Biopoiesis has an emphasis on theories of self-organization that are either merely implicit or unexplored in <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abiogenesis.html" title="Abiogenesis">Abiogenesis</a> work. We have no diskspace shortage here and it hurts nothing to include separate writeups on closely allied terms. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Tour_c380.html" title="User:Jim Tour">Jim Tour</a> 00:00, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>more or less</b> I was not even aware of the article "<a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_evolution.html" title="Chemical evolution">chemical evolution</a>". I think that a series of articles on the topic of origin of life need some sort of management and better planning. I think that part of that would include the merging of biopoiesis in something about chemical evolution, but I think that it could be in the "<a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_life.html" title="Origin of life">origin of life</a>" article, and the chem evo article would focus more on the other sense of the term, and have something in the sense of a disambiguation linking to "origin of life". I think that biopoiesis still fits on abiogenesis well, even if it refers more specificaly to self-organization, since abiogenesis means origin of life, and thus whatever is under the label of biopoiesis meaning origin of life by means of self organization, is still under the abiogenesis umbrella. However, I think that still could be a larger biopoesis article making clarifications on its specifics; the same way that there is a "origin of life" article, and various articles for different theories of origin of life (RNA world, iron sulfid world, Oparin hypotheis, etc). But the last time I checked, biopoiesis was nearly a stub that made it look like a synonym with abiogenesis. (Semantically, I guess it is, despite of some difference that may exist to what actually is referred by the term). --<a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtremophile_092c.html" title="User:Extremophile">Extremophile</a> 00:13, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Keep the primary discussion under abiogenesis as almost all people search for that term. Only a few specialists would know to distinguish the other terms.

I merged (as requested by someon else, don't know whom but this can be checked) biopoesis (and biopoiesis) <b>into</b> abiogenesis on June 6th, 2006. Currently, <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biopoesis.html" title="Biopoesis">biopoesis</a> is a redirect to abiogenesis. How are we supposed to merge an article into its redirect? Basically, there is nothing to merge: either we switch (abiogenesis redirects to biopoesis instead of the current reverse), or we split the articles again (which I oppose, as there is no clear difference). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I really do not mean to be rude, and I have to admit I find the above debate rather interesting; but would it be possible to move this debate to some other forum? I will admit I am new to Wikipedia in general, but it seems to me this particular page acts as an area to discuss what should and should not be included in the article it is attached to (<a href="../../../a/b/i/Abiogenesis.html" title="Abiogenesis">abiogenesis</a>). Any debate held here would revolve around content that should be added or removed, or possibly to discuss whether or not a neutral point of view is maintained. In short, it is an area to discuss the reasoning behind revisions or reverts.</p>

<dd>In that case I propose that we add something about the fact that all living organisms consist of homochiralic proteins, while nature has yet to produce any yet (so far as we have observed, of course). We also probably should add something about the fact that Miller's little experiment only produced 13 of the 20 basic amino acids, and that scientists since then have not done any better.

You get your own page where you can put a bit of stuff about you and an additional page where people can leave you messages. It is much easier for colaboration. My page is <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnoma_Tsujmai_26a7.html" title="User:Knoma Tsujmai">here</a>. And my talk page is <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnoma_Tsujmai_05ea.html" title="User talk:Knoma Tsujmai">here</a>. After you are registered, anytime you leave comments on a Talk page like this one, you can add three of these ~ symbols or four of these ~ symbols in a row. That will automaticly sign the doc with a link to your page and the current time. Just like this: <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnoma_Tsujmai_26a7.html" title="User:Knoma Tsujmai">Knoma Tsujmai</a> 03:45, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Beyond that, there really isn't any voting per se. The Wikipedia works very different than a lot of other things in life. To be involved in Wikipedia is to agree to be edited mercilessly. People don't really vote on articles as much as they discuss them and constantly change them. Opinions vary widely, but more often than not some level of agreement is met and a <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">neutral point of view</a> is maintained. Once you get an account and sign in, feel free to drop me a line on my talk page if you want help creating a section in here proposing changes. Again, you can just go ahead and make any changes you want anywhere in Wikipedia at any time, but finding some way to work through and represent the opposing opinions will likely help your revisions to stick. <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnoma_Tsujmai_26a7.html" title="User:Knoma Tsujmai">Knoma Tsujmai</a> 03:45, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I look forward to hearing about the additional information you think would be relevant for this document, as well as at what point you think it makes sense to link to other documents or data. But you really do not need to wait for me or anyone else to authorize changes, just be cognizant that anything you contribute here can be edited by another at any time. I think that is what fascinates me the most about all this. The Wikipedia started in my lifetime, but will likely survive on this Earth much longer than I. At the same time, "The Wikipedia" does not really exist at all as it is edited multiple times every minute and is never the same. Here's to hoping that both you and I write an article or two that is useful, interesting and unbiased enough to survive long after we are gone!

<p>Do the panspermia advocates really fit as critics here. They simply <i>pass the buck</i> to elsewhere and don't really say much about abiogenesis. Hoyle's specific arguements against chemical evolution and abiogenesis perhaps, but not the panspermia bit. I reorganized the section to put the panspermians together, but really think they should be cut. <a href="../../../v/s/m/User%7EVsmith_d492.html" title="User:Vsmith">Vsmith</a> 22:11, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for grouping the panspermites together. As the article now clearly reflects, panspermia itself doesn't offer anything on abiogenesis, except in locating it far away, so it's less a criticism than a fairly uninterested hypothesis. We know that some of the basic organic chemicals can form in space, but there's little support for the process getting much further than that. We also know that, in principle, it's possible for single-celled life to be transferred to another planet by catastrophic events, but have no reason to think this happened. In short, it's boring. However, Hoyle's version is different. It's basically the same broken idea as Steady State, only applied to life. As such, it's an alternative to abiogenesis, but a really dumb one. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 00:45, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I was thinking of expanding the panspermia section to include some of the recent findings of organic molecules in space -- so the seeding may not be from life but from the building blocks of life. Thus the "Primodial Soup" doesn't need to generate amino acids so much as assemble them.</p>
<p>Meteors may also have played an important role in making rare atoms available on the surface, and the ices may have helped form the first protocell structures.</p>
<p>The other alternative is to put this information in the biopoesis article and expand on the specific scientific discoveries there.</p>

<li><b>oppose</b> Abiogenesis and biogeneis were originally used to describe the division that existed in the Spontaneous Generation era. Biogeneis held that life would arise from life or materials derived from life, independent of parents e.g. internal parasites (how else did they get there?). Life was thought to contain a life force and this magical force could make more of itself e.g. the electricity used to boot-up Frankenstein’s Monster. Whereas, abiogenesis was opposed to biogeneis and offered a mechanistic view of life. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) was one of the first to propose abiogenesis. Biopoiesis began with Oparin and Haldane in the early 20th century, it is modern study of life’s origin <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDiamonddavej_1d7f.html" title="User:Diamonddavej">Diamond Dave</a> 23/02/2006 19:14</li>

I think that a series of articles on the topic of origin of life need some sort of management and better planning. I think that part of that would include the merging of biopoiesis in something about chemical evolution, but I think that it could be in the "<a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_life.html" title="Origin of life">origin of life</a>" article, and the chem evo article would focus more on the other sense of the term, and have something in the sense of a disambiguation linking to "origin of life". I think that biopoiesis still fits on abiogenesis well, even if it refers more specificaly to self-organization, since abiogenesis means origin of life, and thus whatever is under the label of biopoiesis meaning origin of life by means of self organization, is still under the abiogenesis umbrella. However, I think that still could be a larger biopoesis article making clarifications on its specifics; the same way that there is a "origin of life" article, and various articles for different theories of origin of life (RNA world, iron sulfid world, Oparin hypotheis, etc). But the last time I checked, biopoiesis was nearly a stub that made it look like a synonym with abiogenesis. (Semantically, I guess it is, despite of some difference that may exist to what actually is referred by the term). --<a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtremophile_092c.html" title="User:Extremophile">Extremophile</a> 00:13, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article frequently uses the word "proved" with respect to the history of the abiogenesis/spontaneous generation issue; this is somewhat problematic. For example, while Pasteur's arguments did indeed carry the day and convince the majority of the scientific community (and won him the prize set for the issue), there were some scientists who didn't consider it settled. In general, saying "proved" with regard to science is basically always somewhat of an exageration.

<dd><s>What about linking the word "proved" to an article that explain what is (and how it was, in earlier times) considered a scientific proof? I think that totally avoiding (except in math) this word wouldn't be NPOV, but a "extremely relativistic" POV. I think that a neutral point of view shouldn't try to make appear that the dispute is matched, by omission or extreme care in the expositon of facts, to not make seem that any side is the "loser". Other possibility (not mutually exclusive) is, in this case, add that there were some scientists who didn't consider it settled, along with their reasonings.--<a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtremophile_092c.html" title="User:Extremophile">Extremophile</a> 14:41, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>

I've improving the version of the article in portuguese, and, during the research, I'm founding very interesting points that I think that should be in this article. I'm describing much more detailed the history of the debate about spontaneous generation, and to my surprise, the version I knew, which I think is the "classic", stereotypic version, is very simplistic, painting all in black and white whilst in the true history there was shades of grey.

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/i/Talk%7EAbiogenesis_2208.html" title="Edit section: Schrödinger">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Schrödinger</span></h4>
<p>In 1944, physicist <a href="../../../e/r/w/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger_d068.html" title="Erwin Schrödinger">Erwin Schrödinger</a>, in his book <a href="../../../w/h/a/What_is_life__8d2e.html" title="What is life?">What is life?</a>, asserted that the mechanism of genetics defies the laws of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermodynamics.html" title="Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>, since a relatively small number of molecules, which form the genetic material, have such a huge influence on so many other molecules. Although not direct criticism of abiogenesis, Schrödinger's book asserts that life can't be explained by the laws of physics, thus implying that it can't be created from lifeless matter.</p>
<p>Today, scientists believe that the distinction between large numbers and small numbers is eminently important to understand biological systems, because they are small number systems rather than the convenient large number systems that physicists prefer. What thermodynamics (which Schrödinger based his book on) describes as a random fluctuation is a signaling process to cell biology. Hormonal signals depend on the behavior of small systems, where fluctuations can push a system beyond a threshold level where a chemical reaction suddenly becomes spontaneous; as opposed to, say, a balloon filled with gas, where a fluctuation (for example, a change of speed) of a few hundreds of molecules will not change the state of the gas in the balloon as a whole (for example, it will not change its temperature). <a href="http://www.whatislife.com/about.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whatislife.com/about.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

Where does this come from "The principles of Yockey's argument seem to be effective for a variety of creative disciplines, such as the writing of computer software, where FOSS seems to play the social role of an Intelligent Designer while traditional computer programming methods seem to take the role of traditional chemical evolution." (last in the Yockey section). I find it really wierd to write that. The only source I know of that refers to ID and evolution re FOSS is Linus Torvalds: "Linux is evolution, not intelligent design", a quote that has stuck. While some people disagree with this I don't. Either way I don't think that a comparison to FOSS should be done at all in this article.

I don't find your sketch. I agree that this article has huge problems. The biggest is deciding what it's trying to be. I'm inclined at the moment to think it should be about the philosophical side of the question of abiogenesis - Aristotle said it was a self-evident truth, then Pasteur showed it wasn't, but he simultaneously showed that Darwin must be be wrong on theoretical grounds. Kelvin drew attention to a second theoretical obstacle to Darwin, the 2nd law. Miller and Urey (drawing on Oparin and Haldane) then demonstrated that the 2nd law is not an obstacle to the spontaneous emergence of complex from less complex systems. But I'm not sure where to go from there. Some mention should be made of information theory, which is simply a restatement of the 2nd law. I agree that the critics section should go - it's peurile. Not go to any other article, just go. Panspermia in this article I'm not sure about - it's an argument about the details of <i>where</i> life mayn have originated, not <i>whether</i> it could originate spontaneously from non-living matter, which is what I currently see this article as being about. Interesting that Kelvin believed in panspermia, as a possibility. Funny man, Kelvin - no great scientist has ever been so wrong so often. About Pasteur, I think we need to keep this article simple; the nuances of Pouchet et al should be kept for some other article. (Or am I oversimplifying this article?) I'm leaving Wiki now, won't be back, so up to you to do as you wish. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 10:30, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Humm... sad that wiki losts collaborators... my sketch was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Extremophile/Abiogenesis" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Extremophile/Abiogenesis" rel="nofollow">here (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Extremophile/Abiogenesis)</a>, anyway. I´m not so assured of my english writing abilities, so I will still just let it there as a reference or source for anyone who would be interested in doing that.</p>
<p>About what the article could be, I think that would be better to this one to be mainly hystorical, with the phylosophical/scientific details being dealt in more specific articles, with the hystorical part, if needed, in a more summarized way; I think that something in the way you´re saying could be in the history section of "origin of life", though. Then the Pasteur vs. Pouchet part of the history would be mentioned here in some extent, but I think it doesn´t even need to be mentioned somewhere else, for example, in the "<a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_life.html" title="Origin of life">origin of life</a>" article. I also can´t think of somewhere else it would fit, nor where else it would be more appropriate, since I think it paints a less simplistic version of the history, without distortions such as Pasteur being the ultimate debunker of the idea of spontaneous generation, "the clear won of the hero, the platonically perfect icon of the scientific method against the pseudo-scientific crackpots with tendentious experiments".</p>
<p>I think that panspermia could be mentioned, but very briefly. In my sketch it is mentioned just twice, first at the "british debate" section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>William Thomson (later, Lord Kelvin), around 1871 theorized that the Earth was only about 100 000 000 years old (what later was shown to be wrong), and believed that it didn't left time enough for natural selection guided evolution. To avoid the problem of the origin of life, he suggested one theory of panspermia - the ida that the life was originally from space. Wilhelm Preyer, professor of University of Jena, also defended panspermia. To him, there was no logical problem with spontaneous generation happening in the present day, supposing it had happened once in the distant past; he thought that if that ever happened, would abound evidences of its occurrence, since it would still occur in the present day. He objected the idea that life could have arisen only under a highly different environment in the remote past, reasoning that life wouldn't survive such radical changes from the environment that originated it. He supposed then that the universe and life were eternal.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And later, when is stated that nowadays is known that the some of the chemistry needed for life somehow forms in space, then it increases the likelyhood of extraterrestrial life, and of panspermia, to Hoyle and others. For while this is on the last paragraph, and I don´t think it´s a very good ending of the article, but as I said, it´s just a sketch/second hand source.</p>
<p>I think that it´s interesting in the hystorical point of view, since it shows that various ideas were being presented, rather than the overtly simplified version of "spontaneous generation; spontaneous generation refuted; Oparin-Haldane abiogenesis stabilished". In fact there were some sort degree of overlap between the acception of the hypotheses, the changing of ideas were more gradual than how it´s usually depicted. And the hypotheses themselves were not always clear-cut distinguishable from each other. For example, without the present knowledge of microbiology, was not so easy to see how the primordial chemical origin of life could be so different than spontaneous generation happening in the present day. If the first ever happened, the latter probably could happen even today. Haeckel, and/or others, thought cells were just simple "protoplasm" inside a cellular wall, without something much complex within it, that took long to evolve. Also there were lesser known distinctions such as from life originating from organic matter and inorganic matter.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting example of the oversimplification of the history as generally presented is that, second the historian John Farley, Pasteur believed that parasitical worms originated spontaneously, and also, that microbial life itself could be spontaneously generated, but he engaged against the defenses of that for political reasons and scientifical bias - his patrons were "pro-biogenesis", and he thought that only he was in the right track of discovering how life originated because of clues in his works with crystals.</p>

I think the current Origins of Life article <i>should</i> be rehashed here. The Origins of Life article deals with the "current scientific thought," which is, as of now, abiogenesis. That could (theoretically) change, though; and if it does, the Origins of Life article would change to follow it. This page wouldn't change, though; being that it's not tied to "current scientific thought" -- and therin lies the difference between the articles. --DominionSeraph 01:10, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It makes some sense. However, "abiogenesis" is not a "absolute" synonym of how the origin of life is seen today, but the distinction with spontaneous generation was a blurred in the past. And etymologically, spontaneous generation <i>is</i> abiogenesis. I´m not arguing against it, anyway, as long as each article has some short introduction with links or even a real disambiguation, that should be okay in either way. --<a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtremophile_092c.html" title="User:Extremophile">Extremophile</a> 17:56, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess it all has to do with creationist sources on the reccent additions to this text. Aristotle was no longer the point, as there were more "recent" proponents of spontaneous generation; if Pasteur did demonstrated that Darwin was wrong, he did it in a very specific way, since it refers just to spontaneous generation, not to common ancestry or natural selection.

<p>Also, we have a categorical assertion that Kelvin was right; followed by a qualification; followed by another that puts it in the realm of mere perception.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, as far as I´ve read, Kelvin did not opposed a primordial abiogenesis per se, but rather that it occurred on Earth. He was an early proponent of a form of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panspermia.html" title="Panspermia">panspermia</a>, in which life does not necessarily existed since forever ago. I do not know if that was his opinion, however, but as he asserted that there was no time for life arising on Earth, seems that he thought that it would be possible to happen in different conditions. I also think it had not much to do with the 2nd law of thermodynamics in the sense that creationists (mis)use it today, but by reasoning that the planet was supposedly too hot nearby its formation, and that life appeared short after, or something in these lines. --<a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtremophile_092c.html" title="User:Extremophile">Extremophile</a> 14:44, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found two places in the "primordial soup" hypothesis where the wording made it look like "racemized" somehow meant that a racemic mix is somehow not really a precursor of life. A completely racemized mixture can definitely be said to have an abiotic origin. The experiment was designed with abiotic origin, so this is expected. However, the racemic character has no bearing on what the mixture could become. "Racemic" means only that both L and R isomers are present in the mixture. Most known proteins are L isomers, thus, the necessary precursors were present.<a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/MSR/Bada/BadaAbs.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/MSR/Bada/BadaAbs.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Therefore, the "but racemized" doesn't really illuminate anything. So I worded it in a way that made it not sound like a contradictory outcome.</p>

<p>One of the changes I made while cleaning this section up I'm not entirely sure about the consistency from before and after the chances.</p>
<p>I changed: <i>"These droplets could then "grow" by fusion with other droplets, "reproduce" through fission into daughter droplets, and so have a primitive metabolism in which those factors which promote "cell integrity" survive, and those that don't become extinct."</i></p>
<p>To the current text: <i>"These droplets could then fuse with other droplets and break apart into two replicas of the original. This could be viewed as a primitive form of reproduction and metabolism. Favorable attributes such as increased durability in the structure would survive more often than nonfavorable attributes."</i></p>
<p>Is the modification at least as accurate as the original? I think it is, but can't say for sure. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGromXXVII_e791.html" title="User:GromXXVII">GromXXVII</a> 01:14, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see that there has been discussion before about just why this article needs to exist, but discussion seems to have died out without reaching a conclusion. Whatever the philosophical justification for this article existing, in practice it looks to me like every part of it duplicates some other Wikipedia article except the part about spontaneous generation. I suggest we rename this article "spontaneous generation" (which already redirects to here), and remove all the other parts of the article. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 02:03, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Origin of life is a broader term: I'd think it a bad idea to load that article with the task of throughly handling abiogenesis as well. Spontaneous generation is even more specific. This article is small enough right now that it can have an entire section on Spontaneous generation. I'd say the pieces about the actual theories of it; as well as an intro piece about what it is conceptually should be expanded: but not removing the article completely. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGromXXVII_e791.html" title="User:GromXXVII">GromXXVII</a> 10:35, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But exactly how is "origin of life" broader? It seems to me that "origin of life" potentially encompasses three areas: religious explanations, abiogenesis, and scientific hypotheses involving life having always existed. The <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_life.html" title="Origin of life">origin of life</a> article specifically excludes religious explanations (per the disambig line at the top), and I'm not aware of any scientific hypotheses involving life having always existed. So what is the task of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_life.html" title="Origin of life">origin of life</a>, if not to thoroughly handle abiogenesis? --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 18:08, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section states "Pasteur's experiments were limited to a closed sterile system." Is the pre-biotic earth also defined to be <i>sterile</i>? <a href="../../../w/d/a/User%7EWdanwatts_84e2.html" title="User:Wdanwatts">Dan Watts</a> 20:01, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Does sterile also mean free from materials needed? Perhaps <i>sterile</i> might not be the best word choice since it usually means free from microbes, but <i>limited</i> may be better defined since it's such a small system and pre-biotic earth would have the whole planet or resources even if it just needs the right conditions. If life needed just the right settings,</p>
<p>I'm finding the sentence as inaccurate:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Pasteur had demonstrated that Spontaneous Generation was wrong, and he also seemed to have demonstrated that any concept involving the generation of living matter from non-living matter was also wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Pasteur showed that in a contained material not even microbes, they could detect at the time were undetected. This isn't conclusive that any form of spontaneous generation.

<p>How can we expect non-scientists to understand what the word 'theory' means, if we misuse it in an encyclopedia article?</p>
