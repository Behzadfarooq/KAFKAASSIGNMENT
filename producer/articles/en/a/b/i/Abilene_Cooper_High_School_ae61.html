<p>With the exception of a few periods, the Cougars have been a team which contended for the district title. The teams of the mid 90s to the early 2000s were consistently in the playoffs, and the 1996 team featuring Dominic Rhodes made it to the state championship game. Randy Allen, Head Coach at Cooper from the 1991 season through the 1998 season <a href="http://www.fridaynighthistory.com/abc90.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fridaynighthistory.com/abc90.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, was named to the Texas Football Hall of Honor in 2006. <a href="http://coach.thsca.com/documents/HOHList.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://coach.thsca.com/documents/HOHList.pdf" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> History came full circle, as Coach Allen was on the 1967 team, the only other Cooper team to advance to the state finals to date. The 1967 game was a thriller. The Cougars lost by one point to then powerhouse Austin Reagan (Reagan went on to defeat Odessa Permian in the 1968 and 1970 state championship games) when the officials declined to rule a possible touchdown in favor of Cooper in the closing minutes of the game. <a href="http://www.texnews.com/news/cooper122296.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.texnews.com/news/cooper122296.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>

<p>Football facilities have always been top-notch. In the years 1979 to 1982, the team had a large, two story tall workout barn that housed a weight room, coaches office, and an open Astro turf area large enough for the team to run plays when the weather was too bad or to prevent scouting by opposing teams. Next to the barn was a field house containing the Trainers room, a common bathroom, and three locker rooms. As you entered the field house, a huge, red state of Texas was painted on one wall. A big blue star showed Abilenes location and above the state was painted, "Think State." The entry to the varsity locker room was just past that mural. The locker room had red and blue deep pile carpet, central a/c and heating, quad stereo, and its own showers and equipment room. The lockers were made of metal, painted blue, had doors with combination locks, and were about 5 feet tall by close to 3 feet wide.</p>

<p>The program during the years 1979 to 1982 was ahead of its time, probably on the level of many colleges. Each week during the season, the coaches studied scout games films intensely and then showed the players what formations to look for and tell-tale idiosyncrasies of the opposing players they would be keying on. Players were required to report to the locker room at 8 am on Saturdays for a review, and critique, of the film from the prior evening.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> Non-varsity players ran the offenses and defenses of upcoming opponents at full speed into the No. 1 varsity offenses and defenses. Thursday nights during the season were all you could eat steak cook-outs and game film watching parties. On days of away games, varsity players met at the field house, gathered their equipment, and loaded on to chartered buses. Old Yellow buses would not have been sufficient for trips ranging from 90 miles to San Angelo to 180 miles to Odessa. On arrival, the team was treated to a meal of pancakes, orange juice, and ice tea. After a quiet time to digest, players got taped up and put on game paints and undershirts and went over assignments with the coaches. Mental preparedness was stressed as much as physical. After games, the buses would stop at a cafe near the stadium (such as Zentner's, in San Angelo) and the players would chow down on chicken-fried steak dinners. Many of these things which contributed to the success of the Cooper program would not have been possible without the Cooper Booster Club, including the Steak Nights, the pre and post game food, and the safe buses.</p>

<p>During the seasons mentioned under this topic, only one team from each district, the district champions, went to the play-offs. Also, Class 5A was not broken into Divisions, so only one school could claim the state championship in any given year.</p>

<p>Ray Overton was head football coach for Cooper in 1979. Coach O was inducted into the Texas High School coaches Hall of Honor in 1978 <a href="http://coach.thsca.com/documents/HOHList.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://coach.thsca.com/documents/HOHList.pdf" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> and received of the Tom Landry Award in 1994.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> In 2003, Coach O was honored by the Texas House of Representatives with a resolution HR 1934 that reads as follows:</p>
<p>WHEREAS, When Ray Overton accepted his first teaching and coaching position in 1948, he gained more than a job, having found his life's calling; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, Today, at 79 years of age, this remarkable man is still at it, teaching and inspiring kids and serving as a positive role model to students and peers alike in his job as a science teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, A graduate of Texas A&amp;M University, he served with distinction in the U.S. Air Force during World War II and had intended to return to the family farm to make his career after college, but fate intervened in the form of a posting for a football coach at a school in nearby Paint Creek; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, After 15 years in Paint Creek, "Coach O" accepted a job at Abilene Cooper before moving to MacArthur in the early 1980s; he is widely respected for his ability to motivate and engage students in the learning process and instill in them a love for education that continues long after they leave his classroom; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, Several generations of Lone Star students are better educated and better prepared for their future because of Ray Overton, and it is a great pleasure to honor this esteemed gentleman, for whom teaching and helping teens remains the greatest reward; now, therefore, be it</p>
<p>RESOLVED, That the House of Representatives of the 78th Texas Legislature hereby commend Ray Overton for his exceptional career as an educator and extend to him best wishes for continued success and fulfillment in his vital work; and, be it further</p>
<p>RESOLVED, That an official copy of this resolution be prepared for Mr. Overton as an expression of highest regard by the Texas House of Representatives.</p>

<p>He was an excellent coach and quite a character, sometimes affectionately referred to as Shady Ray. In media interviews, he referred to his players as Kiddos and, when telling them what he thought they would do for a fun evening, would say they would probably be going home to "eat ice-cream and watch Spanky."

<p>The 1979 Cougars were ranked #1 in Texas in Class 4A, the largest classification at the time, in all polls in all weeks of the season. Also, they received a higher Power Rating than the 1978 Houston Stratford High School Texas State championship team that featured Craig James, who went on to excellent careers in college and the pros and is now a network Sports Announcer. During the season, when performing the practice-ending spell-out jumping jacks, the team would shout, "C - O - U - G -A - R - S, Cougars, State, Champs!" While gathering for those jumping jacks during the last practices before game day, defensive players would raise their arms over their heads to each make a circle / zero and shout to each other, "GOOSE EGG", announcing their intent to pitch another shut-out.</p>
<p>Cooper plays in the district known around Texas as "The Little Southwest Conference". <a href="http://www.fridaynighthistory.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fridaynighthistory.com/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> Member schools in 1979 were Abilene High, Big Spring High, Cooper, Midland High, Robert E. Lee High in Midland, Odessa High, Permian High in Odessa, and Central High in San Angelo. Of the largest classification State Championship games since 1920, teams from this district (not including the former teams from Pampa, Borger, Lubbock and Amarillo) have played in 31 games and won 16. <a href="http://www.thelittleswc.com/champs.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thelittleswc.com/champs.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></p>
<p>The 1979 team scored 374 points and allowed only 44 points in regular play (384/57 or 14.84% for the year), shuting out Haltom City 52-0, San Angelo 35-0, Odessa 21-0, Big Spring 56-0, and Midland 35-0. They defeated an Odessa Permian team with 2 players who were named to the first team All-State defense by the score of 14 to 3, won the District Championship, and brought the Distrit Bell back to Cooper. <a href="http://www.fridaynighthistory.com/abc70.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fridaynighthistory.com/abc70.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> <a href="http://www.cougar-country.com/distbell.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cougar-country.com/distbell.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> Unfortunately, they fell 13-10 to Lewisville in the Bi-District game at Texas Stadium that involved several controversial calls. Interestingly, in one final statewide poll of the season, taken after that game, the Cougars merely dropped to #2 and Lewisville was #8. Lewisville went on to miss going to the championship game by a field goal, losing to the eventual champion Temple, their Center and Tailback were first team All-State offense, and they placed 2 players on the second team All-State defense. &lt;Dave Campbell's Texas Football 1980, Summer Edition, page 206&gt;</p>
<p>From the 1961 season, Cooper's first, through the 2006 season, only one team in the district, the San Angelo Central Bobcats (1966, 315/26, 8.25%), beat, or even matched, the 1979 Coogs' points allowed to points scored percentage. Also, in the same time period, only Odessa Permian (1979, 51 points allowed) and the 1966 Bobcats have allowed fewer points in a season. <a href="http://www.fridaynighthistory.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fridaynighthistory.com" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></p>
<p>Terry Orr, Fullback and Linebacker, was a Parade Magazine All-American and second team All-State offense, scored the winning touchdown for the University of Texas in the 1982 Cotton Bowl, played eight seasons with the Washington Redskins <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/OrrxTe00.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/OrrxTe00.htm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, and was named to the all-decade Texas high school football team (1970s).<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> Alvin Jenkins, Tight End. also played at the University of Texas and in the NFL. Greg Berry, Linebacker, was first team All-State defense, started at Texas A&amp;M as a true freshman, and was made key stops in a game that season against a University of Georgia team featuring Herschel Walker.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> Paul Mergenhagen (aka "Gooch"), Lineman, was second team All-state offense.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eleven players were named to the All-District Team: Orr, Jenkins, Berry, Mergenhagen, Kyle Stuard, Jay Zumwalt, Mike Howle, Kyle Ford, Ronny Houston, Steve Malpass, and John Slaughter.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> Two seniors received scholarships to Baylor University, Mergenhagen (Defensive Tackle) and Malpass (Linebacker), two seniors received scholarships to the University of Texas, Orr and Jenkins, and two seniors received scholarships to Texas A&amp;M, Berry (Linebacker) and Stuard (Punter). Other notable seniors were Keith Pantalion, Tailback, and Dennis Robinson aka "Herc", Fullback.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jim Cook, Center, a junior letterman in 1979, received a scholarship to TCU after his senior season in 1980. Lanny Dycus (deceased), also a junior letterman in 1979, was a Texas Football pre-season blue-chip player for the 1980 season and received a scholarhip to Abilene Christian University. Ray Berry, Linebacker, a sophomore squadman in 1979 and younger brother of Greg Berry, was a Parade All-American after his senior season in 1981. Ray received a scholarship to Baylor University, where Grant Teaff once described Ray as the second best Linebacker he ever coached (Mike Singletary being the first), was Sports Illustrated's College Defensive Player of the week for his performance in Baylor's 1985 win over USC in California, and played seven seasons for the Minnesota Vikings. Ray was inducted into the Baylor Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005 and honored as a Legend of Baylor Football during the 2006 season. Sophomores Mike Stills, Rodney Jones, Oscar Riggins, and Scott Reedy contributed sufficiently to letter in 1979.</p>
<p>Before the 1979 season, the Cougars were known as the "Big Blue Crew" due to their blue uniforms. In warm-ups for the first game of the 1979 season against the Brownwood Lions, the team wore the traditional blue jerseys. However, when they returned to the field to begin the game, they burst through the banner in shiny red jerseys.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> Soon after Coach O left in the 1980s, Cooper returned to the blue. You can see these blue uniforms, and scenes at Shotwell Stadium, in the film about Odessa Permian football, Friday Night Lights.</p>

<p>The 1970s were the peak years of high school graduation for members of the post-war baby boom, and Cooper football was consistently a top program in Texas during those peak, and last, years of the baby boom. Dave Campbell, in his Texas Football Magazine for the 1981 season (Class of 1982), wrote in his introduction to the District 5-5A team outlook and prediction section, "Over the last 10 years, Odessa Permian and Abilene Cooper have staged one of the most intense rivalries in Texas High School Football. Last year, Permian's district title was the first step toward a state championship, but this year, an improved Cooper team plans on turning the tables."<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Looking back at the 1979 team and its supporting classes, Cooper had the rare opportunity to put together a string of playoff teams and carry forward an Abilene legacy by reaching and winning the state game 3 years in a row like the teams from Abilene High in 1954, 1955, and 1956. <a href="http://www.thelittleswc.com/champs.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thelittleswc.com/champs.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> Regardless, the 1979 team and its supporting classes put together an impressive 3 year record of 24 wins, 5 loses, and 2 ties (16 - 3 - 2 in district play)<a href="http://www.thelittleswc.com/1970s.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thelittleswc.com/1970s.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> <a href="http://www.thelittleswc.com/1980s.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thelittleswc.com/1980s.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> Since the 1982 season, the opportunity to carry forward this legacy no longer exists, as more than one team from each district have gone to the playoffs and Class 5A has been split into divisions.</p>
