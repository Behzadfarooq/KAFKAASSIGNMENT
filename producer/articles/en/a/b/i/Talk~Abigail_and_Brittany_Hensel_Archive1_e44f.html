<p>I was just browsing the page and noticed at the very bottom of their page the following error. Vandalism, perhaps? I'm not sure, but when I tried to edit the page and remove the word (see below), it was not visible on the edit page.

<p>Following the article's post on VfD (which is currently 3-0 in favour of Keep), I tried to make the article a bit more encyclopaedic. I went through several edits before being happy with it, but in the end I deleted the quotes from the twins as unencyclopaedic, though if someone can figure out how to include them in the context of an encyclopaedia they are quite cute. I deleted the section on their personal tastes for the same reason, then changed my mind and put it back in. I still don't know whether it belongs in an encyclopaedia or not, but I've erred on the side of caution and left it there. I deleted the sentence about how "rumours of the twins appearing in a sitcom are unfounded", since it's unsubstantiated by definition and frankly sounds like patent nonsense. Still needs the name of the documentary they apparently appeared in. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:00, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That rumor of them being *in* a television series remains uncorroborated by any reliable industry source that *I* can locate, after some diligent search. I left the "unfounded" quote in very specifically to counteract the presence (and re-addition, in which I was clearly also unsuccessful) of that rumor in the article. "juiceenews daily" doesn't strike *me* as a good source, and I think we need to rip the damn rumoer out again until the Reporter or Variety or some other industry source cites it. Or ask their parents directly.<br />

<dd>"Legally"? &#160;:-) We can strike anything we like; it's Wikipedia. And this, incidentally, was why I left in the comment about "unsubstantiated rumor" that someone else saw fit to pull, as I noted above, and has pulled again. Let's not get into a revert war about this, shall we? I see no reasonable justification for putting it in until we can get an authoritative industry citation for it.<br />

<dd>I removed the rumor both because I thought it was vandalism. I ran a Lexis-Nexis search for information about the rumored television pilot and came up with absolutely nothing from any entertainment publication. So the rumor/vandalism should stay out, as juiceenews isn't a credible source. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstronot_28bd.html" title="User:Astronot">Astronot</a> 09:39, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Closing of "Friends of Brittany and Abigail Hensel" group.</span></h2>
<p>The moderator of the group wrote in with the following message today:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have received a request from the producers of the programme Joined For Life asking us to delete all photos of the Hensel family. They have also told us that the Hensel family do not want any photos of the girls to be published without the family's permission. I have sent them a rather desperate reply to see if we can get permission from the Hensel family to use any photos, but if the answer is no, then there is little point in us continuing and I will just close the group. I will continue with our public blog and Abby's and Brittany's guestbook instead.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now to me, this sounds almost like legal thuggery on the part of the producers. They're not exactly without a vested interest in controlling who has media representation of the twins, being that they publish a documentary on them. That said, there's the usual legal question of who owns the pictures in question, particularly if the images have been taken from newspaper or magazine sources, especially if they're taken from this documentary. Still, these producers are not exactly neutral arbiters IMO, unless they really are the public face of the Hensels and actually representing the view of the family here. I thought it noteworthy enough to pass on here. -<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanDuggan_af73.html" title="User:SeanDuggan">Fuzzy</a> 20:16, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From the owner of the Former Friends of Abigail Hensel and Brittany Hensel group.</p>
<p>Ultimately we closed because the Hensel family told me (through a mediator) that they didn't want any of our websites about them to continue and that no photos of Abby &amp; Brittany were to be used. To be honest I feel vilified over the whole thing. Members of the group will testify that we had the utmost respect for the girls and their family in everything that was said on the group. Not a bad or insensitive word about Abby &amp; Brittany was ever posted. As for the photos the vast majority of them were already in the public domain and and used on other sites. We took care to credit all photos to their original source where possible and we would never have used any photos or images of the girls that had not been released to the general public. The only reason we hosted photos at all was because there was no official website about the Hensel twins and photos of them were scattered all over the internet, making searching for them all extremely time consuming. We also took great care to protect the Hensel families privacy and we had a strict policy not to allow the girls whereabouts to be posted or allow unauthorized news about them to be posted to the site. I think it's a sad loss especially when as a group we were about to celebrate Abby's and Brittany's 16th birthday. But whilst the Hensel family were happy to share their story with the whole world, it appears from my experience that anyone who discusses their daughters in public no matter how respectfully, falls on the wrong side of them - which is a great shame.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.2.103.69 (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.2.103.69.html" title="User talk:86.2.103.69">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.2.103.69_9800.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.2.103.69">contribs</a>) 19:56, March 8, 2006.</small></p>

<p>This strikes me as completely trivial and unencyclopedic, and irrelevant to anyone except the girls, their family and their friends.</p>
<p>If the idea behind the first sentence is to show that, despite the neurological connundrum of two-brains-one-body, they are active in several sports, than it should perhaps be rephrased to reflect that fact. Otherwise, it's just a list of things any teenager enjoys at one time or another.</p>
