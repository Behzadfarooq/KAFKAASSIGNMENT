<p>The Hensel twins are very interesting from a legal aspect as well. They only have a single womb, so if they have children, who is registered as the mother? It is (was) a cornerstone of ancient roman law based family law that the identitiy of the mother is always known for certain.</p>
<p>If they want to marry, can they have a single husband (bigamy on part of the guy if you count per capita, but not if you count per womb) or two husbands (but what if the heads dislike each other's choice)? Maybe they should convert to islam, that allows for up to four wives legally for a wealthy enough guy. They are now 16 years old, so it is not that remote.</p>
<dl>
<dd>FWIW, the legal area of marriage has been contested for Siamese twins as far back as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chang_and_Eng_d750.html" title="Chang and Eng">Chang and Eng</a>, although they had a somewhat more distinct seperation. (And eventually, a marital seperation of sorts because the two wives came to not be able to stand each other) -<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanDuggan_af73.html" title="User:SeanDuggan">Fuzzy</a> 14:20, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even if they converted to Islam, they wouldn't be able to marry because no man in Islam may marry two sisters. I believe there's a case in the middle east of conjoined sisters who faced this problem. 70.166.82.199 00:52, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I assume a marriage contract - like any other legal contract - exists between consenting individuals, not their reproductive organs. So one twin marrying would not affect the marital status of the other in the slightest. However, Roe v Wade does raise some fascinating questions about what one twin's rights would be if the other wanted to become pregnant without her consent. <a href="../../../r/i/b/User%7ERibonucleic_19a2.html" title="User:Ribonucleic">Ribonucleic</a> 01:40, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even more imminent issue is what about driving a car? Could they (or she and she) get a licence? It is very hard to live in USA without driving.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The most recent documentary about the girls covered this, actually. Both girls received their own license, both had to be tested. They aren't sure what will happen the first time they are pulled over, but there is no precedent for it so it'll certainly be interesting. The documentary indicated they were the first coinjoined twins to receive driver's licenses, at least in the state of Minnesota.65.112.195.162 20:40, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Probably Abigail would be required to have a driver's license, because she as she controls the right hand and right foot, she would be the one in charge of the pedals and the transmission lever. Now, as for the use of the carpool lane, it may depend on the individual interpretation of a cop. 68.126.214.155 07:14, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's hard to imagine a carpool law that doesn't speak of the number of "persons" in the car - rather than the number of seats occupied.

<dd>Since both twins would occupy the driver's seat and have equal access to the steering wheel, I imagine they would both need to be licensed. Since they have separate brains, it would seem theoretically possible for one twin to sleep while the other continued driving with one hand. However, with a shared circulatory system, both could be charged with DUI in the event of an elevated blood alcohol level - even if only one had been drinking. <a href="../../../r/i/b/User%7ERibonucleic_19a2.html" title="User:Ribonucleic">Ribonucleic</a> 01:50, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone know what would happen if one twin committed a crime such as murder? They're both seperate people from the waste up and each has control of their corresponding arm. As such, it's technically possible for one to go against the other's wishes and someone kill a person. If the twin was convicted, how would it be handled? Would both twins have to sit in jail when only one of them committed the crime? Ibm2431 18:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wow these are all fascinating questions. What happens if an accident were to befall on only one of the twins, and hence dies, and the other is left alive? I was reading up on the conjoined twins article, how one twin can be parasitic. My guess is that either the dead twin would rot and die off, or they would have to remove it somehow, if possible. If not, then the other twin would probably die as well.</p>
<p>When they go to the movies, do they only pay for one ticket? Same for riding airplanes?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Interesting questions. I suspect it's up to the individual vendor. In the case of the movie theater, they are only occupying a single seat, and they are sold by seats. On the other hand, they are two different people viewing the movie. The documentary showed the family flying, so I'd imagine they've already dealt with this question. I suspect the family choose to purchase two airline tickets in keeping with their family policy of encouraging the world to see Abby and Brittany as two individuals. Hopefully the airline personal gave the family upgrades to first class to afford them more space and privacy. I'd hate to imagine them crammed into the typical 17" wide steerage-class US airline seat. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/8/_/User%7EK8_fan_d4f7.html" title="User:K8 fan">K8 fan</a> (<a href="../../../k/8/_/User_talk%7EK8_fan_1492.html" title="User talk:K8 fan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_K8_fan_fb9e.html" title="Special:Contributions/K8 fan">contribs</a>) 17:57, 15 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>You know Ibm2431, if one twin were 'evil' per se, and the other was a good twin, and both acted in manners as such, they really cannot be split up. I'm having an image in my mind where the one that committed murder is on trial, and the other twin that witnessed the murder would have to testify against her! LOL. --72.202.129.98 15:14, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The legal side is very intresting i wish the article was better written to explore all of these things. I think Islamic law is flexible enought for a fatwa to be passed to allow marrying of sisters in this case, after all they deserve to be happy, so something must give. i bet many men want to marry them. I am most instrested in them being able to walk in sync, the nerves systems seem to reject this being possible, hence they must have a deeper connection.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሀላካሕ)</a> 23:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article states as a fact that the twins are able to coordinate their movements because of a connection between their nervous systems. However, the Science article in the reference list mentions this conenction as speculation, not fact.

<p>When the twins were born, the parents "chose" not to have them separated. As they share many bodily functions, the operation would have been "risky" and would have left the twins in "wheelchairs". They do not regret their decision. The twins themselves have stated that they do not wish to be separated.</p>
<p>I was reading this and felt it needed some re-wording. I don't see how the parents could have chosen to seperate them. There was obviously no choice in the matter. They wouldn't have been able to seperate them and if they did they would have died. Point blank. They would die. They share too many of the same vital organs to count of like one vagina, one bladder, one rib cage, whatever else i can't think of.

<p>Somebody replaced the list item "1 female reproductive system" with:<br />
1 uterus<br />
1 vagina<br />
1 pair of ovaries<br />
1 pair of buttocks<br />
2 legs</p>
<p>I think this is just a little excessive, if not disrespectful, given that the original one-line item (which I put there months ago) says everything necessary about two teenage girls who are aware that their classmates will read it, particularly since their reproductive system is completely normal.

<p>Also, it's obvious that they have just two legs, two feet, etc...</p>

<dd>On the other hand, the fact that each girl has one of the pair of ovaries is important. If they choose to have children, one or the other will have provided the egg and, legally, would be the mother. If they each marry, the issue of who is the mother will become important - especially to the father. Imagine if each married a different man, bore a child, then one got divorced while one remained married. Does the divorced father pay child support? As they are identical, each has the same DNA. Obviously the DNA test will prove the identity of the father, but could he claim that the egg involved was not from the woman he married?

Basically, it's nobody else's business until such time as it becomes public, i.e. if a marriage occurs. I think Chang and Eng married twin sisters, and if these two marry, they might well end up with twin brothers, which could make the intimacy issues a little less hard to take.

<p>After seeing Abigail and Brittany on TLC, I began to think what if they had a medical emergency. I am a paramedic and can only imagine what I would do to take care of them correctly. For those involved in medicine: what are your thoughts? I know getting them to a hospital fast is probably the best idea, but certian things need to be treated in the field. How will a patient with two hearts show on an EKG? If they have a lethal dysrhythmia how should it be treated without disrupting the other heart etc. etc. Any ideas are appreciated! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Narcan911 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Narcan911_e9f1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Narcan911">contribs</a>) 06:36, 8 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>A lot of squeamishness about the handicapped is over the issue of communication. With autism, retardation, muteness, etc., the biggest hurdle is getting through to them, and they to you. Thankfully, that's not the case with these kids. While they have a freakish <i>situation</i>, they are not "freaks" themselves, they're normal kids. And as with other special kids, like the Fisher quintuplets, the parents have done a terrific job of raising them, to have confidence and self-esteem, to see themselves as special, but "not <i>too</i> special". <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:34, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I think that since the video in question is the only sanctioned interview with the twins, it's clearly relevant to an article about them. Time Magazine is a commercial publication, but no one would complain about referencing Time Magazine, even if Time stood to make money from reprints of a referenced article. In my opinion, the video link should absolutely be included, especially since it's the original reference material for many of the facts in the article. <a href="../../../n/a/i/User%7ENairebis_1623.html" title="User:Nairebis">Nairebis</a> 05:32, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are many sources that have a cost in order to view the material. Would you object to linking to a medical journal whose <b>sole purpose</b> is to sell reprints? Or how about an entry with a notable politician having a link to the BBC that might have had a (or the only) interview, and they sold copies or transcripts of it? Do you object to the entry on Carl Sagan having a link to *his own* web site, and specifically says that web site sells copies of his most famous series, Cosmos? I certainly don't.</dd>

<dd>If Wikipedia is only going to reference zero-cost sources of information, we're not going to have very many references. The link in question is a legitimate, informational, biographical documentary. It certainly meets the standard of being useful to people who are interested in learning more, and that should be the primary standard for inclusion of a link, not whether someone makes money from it (which, when you get down to it, is totally and completely irrelevant to the value of the information). <a href="../../../n/a/i/User%7ENairebis_1623.html" title="User:Nairebis">Nairebis</a> 18:00, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the <i><b>video</b></i> is a valid reference. The <i>page which sells the video</i> is <b>something else entirely</b>. You reference the video, but you don't need to link to a page which sells it. The website does not equal the video.

<dd>So Wikipedia should never link to any periodical web site, including news magazines, medical journals, news web sites, etc, if a referenced resource requires payment? I don't think you can find this prohibition in Wikipedia's guidelines. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/a/i/User%7ENairebis_1623.html" title="User:Nairebis">Nairebis</a> (<a href="../../../n/a/i/User_talk%7ENairebis_b677.html" title="User talk:Nairebis">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nairebis_230c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nairebis">contribs</a>) 18:42, 27 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd><i>Nobody</i> is saying that at all, Nairebis. The website selling the video is not a "periodical website." It is not the video itself, it is a site selling the video. It's no different than linking to Amazon.com when mentioning a book (which is sometimes done, but shouldn't be). The website is <i>not</i> the source of the references--the video it sells is the source. If you were to link <i>to</i> the video (that is, if the video were freely available on the internet), then that would be fine. It is also fine to link to, say, an article on a website that you have to have a subscription to read, since when you sign up, you read the article. If, however, the article was not available online and you were just linking to a website where you can sign up to get a paper subsription and nothing else, then that would be a futile link. It is not okay to reference a book and then point someone to Amazon.com to buy the book. That's just advertising for the book (and Amazon.com), not a legitimate use of the reference section. The proper thing is to list the <i>book</i>, and people can go get it however they want to (buy, borrow, or steal). <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 19:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ozlawyer, The reason I linked to the page at all is the (free) video clip from the video which is on that page. Before I linked to the whole page, I spent a great deal of time trying to extract a link to just the video clip. My goal wasn;t to avoid a commercial link, but to provide a better link for WP visitors. It can't be done; it is javascript.</dd>

<dd>First, someone removed the recent picture of the Hensel twins from this article. Then "Abu" removed the fair-use medical illustration from a no-longer published magazine because theoretically, someone somewhere could copy it by hand and donate it to WP. This guy has many complaints against him and admits he does it just to feel powerful.</dd>

<dd>Now, the LAST remaining helpful recent information on the twins, a clip on their video site, is being removed. Why? Because the site also happens to sell the video as well as provide a clip from it. Presumably, if the site just showed the clip without offering the whole thing, that would pass the strict censorship of the Bowdlerizing Luddites here. Remove the Life magazine cover too, and the process of obfuscation and uselessness will be complete.</dd>

<dd>I used to be excited about WP, but not any more; I have all but quit editing. You say WP is not a democracy. Right. It is a dictatorship of the few, and something I choose not to participate in anymore. Only when people aim their attention at providing informational content for wikipedia instead of erasing and destroying it because it gives them a rush, will wikipedia be truly generally useful. As it is now, WP is being destroyed from within.<br /></dd>

<dd>Ozlawyer, you say that it's like "amazon.com", which if it were, I would agree with you. My impression was that this site is the original source and producer of the video, more like the BBC or a medical journal, than like Amazon.com. Doing a bit more research, according to <a href="http://www.figure8films.tv/content/aboutus.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.figure8films.tv/content/aboutus.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, they do appear to be the producers of the video. I agree with you that a random link to a video store would not be appropriate, but my point is more that a link to the original source *is* appropriate. Does that make more sense? <a href="../../../n/a/i/User%7ENairebis_1623.html" title="User:Nairebis">Nairebis</a> 21:44, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nairebis is correct, that is the site of the producer of the video in question. Not only that, but that is the ONLY site that has any video clips of the Hensel twins, as Bill Haynes, who owns the company, has aggressively shut down other venues. So if WP researchers want to watch the Hensel Twins, that page is the only place on the internet they can go.</dd>

<dd>When I pointed out the marketing value of viral video to him, Bill "found religion" and is has decided to release a clip to YouTube. He is currently asking Abby and Britt for their permission because, though he is a greedy businessman, he is also a decent person who puts the little girls in first position, even before money. If that goes through, then there will be a Hensel-sanctioned video clip on YouTube and I will personally remove the link to the sales page. But until then, the link to the sales page should stay because it is the only place on the entire internet to watch a video of the twins.</dd>
