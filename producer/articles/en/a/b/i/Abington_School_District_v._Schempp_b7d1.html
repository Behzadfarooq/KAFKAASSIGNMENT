<p>The <i>Abington</i> case began when Edward Schempp, a <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitarian.html" title="Unitarian">Unitarian</a> and a resident of <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abington_Township%2C_Montgomery_County%2C_Pennsylvania_b120.html" title="Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania">Abington Township, Pennsylvania</a>, filed suit against the Abington Township School District in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to prohibit the enforcement of a Pennsylvania state law that required his children, specifically <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellery_Schempp_6ebc.html" title="Ellery Schempp">Ellery Schempp</a>, to hear and sometimes read portions of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> as part of their <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_school.html" title="Public school">public school</a> <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education.html" title="Education">education</a>. That law (24 Pa. Stat. 15-1516, as amended, Pub. Law 1928) required that "[a]t least ten verses from the Holy Bible [be] read, without comment, at the opening of each public school on each school day." Schempp specifically contended that the statute violated his and his family's rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>When it was brought, this case illustrated for Americans the metamorphosis their society was undergoing. Although many must have disagreed with local school districts conducting organized prayers and Bible readings, only a small minority vocally expressed objection to the statutes mandating those activities. Most U.S. citizens held the belief that the United States was a nation founded on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> principles. Yet, in spite of their widely held beliefs, as early as <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a>, many states were rolling back mandates of state sponsored devotional exercises in the classroom (Boston, 1993, p. 105).</p>
<p>Like four other states, Pennsylvania law included a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute.html" title="Statute">statute</a> compelling school districts to perform Bible readings in the mornings before class. Twenty-five states had laws allowing "optional" Bible reading, with the remainder having no laws supporting or rejecting Bible reading. In eleven of those states with laws supportive of Bible reading or state-sponsored prayer, courts had declared them unconstitutional (Boston, 1993, p. 101).</p>
<p>More famous than Schempp was the plaintiff in Murray v. Curlett, the son of the notorious, outspoken atheist <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madalyn_Murray_O%27Hair_b35f.html" title="Madalyn Murray O'Hair">Madalyn Murray O'Hair</a>, who founded the group American Atheists in 1963.</p>

<p>At the first District Court trial, Edward Schempp and his children testified as to specific religious doctrines purveyed by a literal reading of the Bible "which were contrary to the religious beliefs which they held and to their familial teaching" (177 F. Supp. 398, 400). The children testified that all of the doctrines to which they referred were read to them at various times as part of the exercises. Edward Schempp testified at the second trial that he had considered having his children excused from attendance at the exercises but decided against it for several reasons, including his belief that the children's relationships with their teachers and classmates would be adversely affected.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/i/Abington_School_District_v._Schempp_b7d1.html" title="Edit section: The district court ruling">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The district court ruling</span></h3>
<p>The district court ruled in Schempp's favor, and struck down the Pennsylvania statute. The school district appealed the ruling, and while that appeal was pending, the Pennsylvania legislature amended the statute to allow children to be excused from the exercises upon the written request of their parents. This change did not satisfy Schempp, however, and he continued his action against the school district, charging that the amendment of the law did not change its nature as an unconstitutional establishment of religion. (Due to the change in the law, the Supreme Court had responded to the school district's appeal by vacating the first ruling and remanding the case back to the district court.) The district court again found for Schempp. The school district <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal.html" title="Appeal">appealed</a> to the Supreme Court again, and, on appeal, the case was consolidated with a similar <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> case launched by <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madalyn_Murray_O%27Hair_b35f.html" title="Madalyn Murray O'Hair">Madalyn Murray</a> (Boston, 1993, p. 106).</p>
<p>The district court ruling in the second trial, in striking down the practices and the statute requiring them, made specific findings of fact that the children's attendance at Abington Senior High School was compulsory and that the practice of reading 10 verses from the Bible was also compelled by law. It also found that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reading of the verses, even without comment, possesses a devotional and religious character and constitutes in effect a religious observance. The devotional and religious nature of the morning exercises is made all the more apparent by the fact that the Bible reading is followed immediately by a recital in unison by the pupils of the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord%27s_Prayer_8f51.html" title="Lord's Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a>. The fact that some pupils, or theoretically all pupils, might be excused from attendance at the exercises does not mitigate the obligatory nature of the ceremony for . . . Section 1516 . . . unequivocally requires the exercises to be held every school day in every school in the Commonwealth. The exercises are held in the school buildings and perforce are conducted by and under the authority of the local school authorities and during school sessions. Since the statute requires the reading of the 'Holy Bible,' a Christian document, the practice . . . prefers the Christian religion. The record demonstrates that it was the intention of . . . the Commonwealth . . . to introduce a religious ceremony into the public schools of the Commonwealth. (201 F. Supp., at 819; quoted in <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=374&amp;page=203" class="external text" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=374&amp;page=203" rel="nofollow">374 U.S. 203</a> (1963)</span>)</p>

<p>Clark continued that the Court was of the feeling that no matter the religious nature of the citizenry, the government at all levels, as required by the Constitution, must remain neutral in matters of religion "while protecting all, prefer[ring] none, and disparag[ing] none". The Court had clearly rejected the contention by many that the <a href="../../../e/s/t/Establishment_Clause_ff25.html" title="Establishment Clause">Establishment Clause</a> forbade only governmental preference of one faith over another (Eastland, 1993, p. 59).</p>
<p>Citing Justice <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Black_d420.html" title="Hugo Black">Hugo Black</a> in <i>Torcaso v. Watkins,</i> Justice Clark added, "We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person 'to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion'". Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against non-believers, and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs". Such prohibited behavior was that self-evident in the Pennsylvania law requiring Bible reading (and allowing recitation of the Lord's Prayer) in its public schools. The Court recognized the value of such ideal neutrality from lessons of history when government and religion were either fully fused or cooperative with one another and religious liberty was nonexistent or seriously curtailed.</p>

The Justice took seventy-three pages to elaborate his ideas about what the Framers intended in the formation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, gauging the value of religion in our culture, reviewing past <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precedents.html" title="Precedents">precedents</a>, and suggesting a course for <a href="../../../f/u/t/Future.html" title="Future">future</a> church-state cases. Brennan felt the need to focus on the history of the Establishment Clause to counter numerous critics of the Court's Engel decision, who pointed out that prayer in public schools, as well as in many other areas of public life, was a longstanding practice going back to the framing of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. He professed to be aware of the "ambiguities in the historical record" and felt a modern-day interpretation of the First Amendment was warranted (Davis, 1991, p. 77). In defense of that approach, Brennan stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Jefferson</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Madison_5b50.html" title="James Madison">Madison</a> would have thought of Bible reading or the recital of the Lord's Prayer in ... public schools ..., our use of the history ... must limit itself to broad purposes, not specific practices. ... [T]he Baltimore and Abington schools offend the First Amendment because they sufficiently threaten in our day those substantive evils the fear of which called forth the <a href="../../../e/s/t/Establishment_Clause_ff25.html" title="Establishment Clause">Establishment Clause</a>. ... [O]ur interpretation of the First Amendment must necessarily be responsive to the much more highly charged nature of religious questions in contemporary society. A too literal quest for the advice of the Founding Fathers upon the issues of these cases seems to me futile and misdirected</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In answer to critics of a broad interpretation of the prohibitions against government in the realm of religion, Brennan said, "nothing in the text of the Establishment Clause supports the view that the prevention of the setting up of an official church was meant to be the full extent of the prohibitions against official involvements in religion".</p>
<p>In the third section of his exhaustive concurrence, Justice Brennan charted the course that led to the incorporation of the First Amendment's religion clauses by way of answering the charge of Abington Township's counsel that Pennsylvania's Bible reading statute was a state issue, outside the purview of the federal court system, including that of the Supreme Court. He labeled the daily recitals of the Lord's Prayer and reading of the Bible as "quite [clear] breaches of the command of the Establishment Clause". He noted the long history of such practices, even before the "founding of our <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">Republic</a>". Additionally, he did not neglect to mention that most of those who demanded reading of the Bible and prayer in schools were hoping to serve "broader goals than compelling formal worship of <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> or fostering church attendance". He cited the 1858 words of the Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Instruction, who saw the Bible as aptly suited to "teaching the noblest principles of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtue.html" title="Virtue">virtue</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality.html" title="Morality">morality</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotism.html" title="Patriotism">patriotism</a>, and good order".</p>
<p>Justice Brennan took great pains to also show that many states, such as <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Dakota_9b0f.html" title="South Dakota">South Dakota</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_86db.html" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, had already enacted and revoked laws similar to Pennsylvania's by the first half of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">twentieth century</a>. In addition, many political leaders including attorneys general and <a href="../../../p/r/e/President.html" title="President">presidents</a> like <a href="../../../u/l/y/Ulysses_S._Grant_1b52.html" title="Ulysses S. Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> insisted that "matters of religion be left to family altars, churches and private schools" and "[It] is not our business to have the Protestant Bible or the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Vulgate_2364.html" title="Catholic Vulgate">Catholic Vulgate</a> or the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a> read in [public] schools" (though such statements on the part of Grant must be viewed on the backdrop of Grant's virulent anti-Catholicism, a spirit which drove many of the anti-Catholic 19th century Republican Party to champion laws sharply curbing public financing of religious practices out of fear of state financing of Catholic schools).</p>
<p>Brennan's concurrence also recognized the plurality of religious thought in the nation as basis enough for restriction of church and state relations. He cited this lack of appreciation of that <a href="../../../p/l/u/Pluralism.html" title="Pluralism">pluralism</a> as the "basic flaw" of Pennsylvania's Bible reading statute and Abington Township's defense of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are persons in every community—often deeply devout—to whom any version of the Judaeo-Christian Bible is offensive. There are others whose reverence for the Holy Scriptures demands private study or reflection and to whom public reading or recitation is sacrilegious.... To such persons it is not the fact of using the Bible in the public schools, nor the content of any particular version, that is offensive, but the manner in which it is used.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/i/Abington_School_District_v._Schempp_b7d1.html" title="Edit section: Potter Stewart's dissent">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Potter Stewart's dissent</span></h3>
<p>Justice Potter Stewart filed the only dissent in the case. In it, he was critical of both the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lower_court.html" title="Lower court">lower court</a> opinions and the decision the Supreme Court had reached regarding them. He wished to remand the case to lower courts for further proceedings.</p>
<p>Stewart had dissented in <i>Engel v. Vitale</i> and viewed the doctrine relied on in that case as implausible, given the long history of government religious practice in the United States, including the fact that the Supreme Court opens its own sessions with the declaration, "God Save this Honorable Court" and that Congress opens its sessions with prayers, among many other examples. Stewart believed that such practice fit with the nation's long history of permitting free exercise of religious practices, even in the public sphere.</p>
<p>He declared the cases consolidated with Schempp as "so fundamentally deficient as to make impossible an informed or responsible determination of the constitutional issues presented"—specifically, of whether the Establishment Clause was violated. As to the intent and scope of the religion clauses of the First Amendment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is, I think, a fallacious oversimplification to regard the [religion clauses] as establishing a single constitutional standard of "separation of church and state", which can be applied in every case to delineate the required boundaries between government and religion.... As a matter of history, the First Amendment was adopted solely as a limitation upon the newly created National Government. The events leading to its adoption strongly suggest that the Establishment Clause was primarily an attempt to insure that Congress not only would be powerless to establish a national church, but would also be unable to interfere with existing state establishments. ... So matters stood until the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, or more accurately, until this Court's decision in <i>Cantwell</i>....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He stated his agreement with the doctrine of the Fourteenth Amendment's embrace and application of the Bill of Rights, but pointed out the irony of such an amendment "designed to leave the States free to go their own way should now have become a restriction upon their autonomy" (Eastland, 1993, pp. 165).</p>
<p>Other critics of the Court's findings in <i>Abington v. Schempp</i> often quote the following excerpt from Justice Stewart's opinion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If religious exercises are held to be an impermissible activity in schools, religion is placed in an artificial and state-created disadvantage.... And a refusal to permit religious exercises thus is seen, not as the realization of state neutrality, but rather as the establishment of a religion of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secularism.html" title="Secularism">secularism</a>, or at least, as governmental support of the beliefs of those who think that religious exercises should be conducted only in private (Eastland, 1993, pp. 165).</p>

<p>The public was divided in reaction to the Court's decision; the decision has sparked persistent and ongoing criticism from proponents of prayer in school. In 1964, Life magazine declared <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madalyn_Murray_O%27Hair_b35f.html" title="Madalyn Murray O'Hair">Madalyn Murray O'Hair</a>, the mother of the plaintiff in one of the cases, "the most hated woman in America." <a href="http://www.who2.com/madalynmurrayohair.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.who2.com/madalynmurrayohair.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">Newspapers</a> were no exception. The <i><a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Evening_Star_038f.html" title="Washington Evening Star">Washington Evening Star</a></i> was indeed rather critical of the decision, declaring that "God and religion have all but been driven from the public schools. What remains? Will the baccalaureate service and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_carol.html" title="Christmas carol">Christmas carols</a> be the next to go? Don't bet against it." (Eastland, 1993, pp. 165). In contrast, the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> was more accepting of the Court's ruling. The paper printed significant portions of the opinions with no significant comments, either supportive or critical (Lewis, 1963, p. 16).</p>
<p>The views of various religious entities on the decision split between mainline Protestants and Jews, who in general strongly supported the decision, and evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics, who strongly opposed the decision. Speaking from the conservative <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> perspective, the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverend.html" title="Reverend">Reverend</a> Dr. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Graham_526a.html" title="Billy Graham">Billy Graham</a> said, "[i]n my opinion ... the Supreme Court ... is wrong. ... Eighty percent of the American people want Bible reading and prayer in the schools. Why should a majority be so severely penalized ...?" (<i>New York Times,</i> 1963, p. 17). The mainline denominations, with the exception of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, registered less critical opinions of the verdict, in fact seeing it as a boon to religious freedom by its very limiting of governmental authority in the sphere of public schools (Dugan, 1963, p. 18). However, a majority of fundamentalist <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christians</a> today regard this decision as the one which "kicked <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prayer.html" title="Prayer">prayer</a> out of the schools" (McWilliams, 1993, p. 170).</p>

<p>The United States Congress reacted swiftly; by April <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, over 150 resolutions to overturn the decision by amending the Constitution had been proposed (O'Hair, 1974, p. 55). Calls continue today, mostly from conservative Republican and Religious Right activists, for an amendment to the Constitution to allow students to pray or read the Bible. This springs from the belief, on the part of school districts, parents, and concerned religious groups, that <i>Abington v. Schempp</i> prohibited such activity, when it actually restrained the government from interfering either to promote or prohibit such activity (Boston, 1993, p. 227).</p>
<p><i>Abington v. Schempp</i> was used as precedent for similar cases like <i>Board of Education v. Allen</i> and <i><a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemon_v._Kurtzman_3ecd.html" title="Lemon v. Kurtzman">Lemon v. Kurtzman</a></i> in the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decade.html" title="Decade">decades</a> that followed. The three part Lemon test had its basis in the jurisprudence of <i>Abington v. Schempp.</i> Under the test, a given church-state law is subjected to three criteria: sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the government in religious activity. Failure in any one of those realms allow the measure to be declared un<a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">constitutional</a></p>
