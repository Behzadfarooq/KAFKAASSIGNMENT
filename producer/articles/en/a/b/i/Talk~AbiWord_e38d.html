<p>I merged the salient bits of information from the languages section and the version history into a Features section. The grammar checking screenshot is gone, that sort of thing belongs on a project page. Also gone is a link to a Slashdot news article about Abiword beating OpenOffice to a grammar checker. All said, I think I made it more <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Pickett_d019.html" title="User:Chris Pickett">Chris Pickett</a> 03:43, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it is cleaner after your edits. The languages it supports are numerous enough that it isn't worth mentioning. I think the version history could potentially be useful &amp; would propose a table, as in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Openoffice.org.html#History" title="Openoffice.org">Openoffice.org#History</a>. I think that the grammar checking is quite relevant &amp; warrants more than a mere bullet point, though. Was AbiWord the first F/OSS word processor with a grammar checker? --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 03:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think version history isn't really relevant, even on the OpenOffice site. Can you imagine if every wikipedia page about a piece of software tried to summarize the version history for that software? I guess you could copy and paste the open office version table here, but I think a link to the project version history would be better for those interested (it will be more accurate). As for grammar checking, that screenshot was kind of weak (no offense to anybody---I mean, it has some silly sentences and words underlined in green), what I do think might be useful though is a grammar checking column in the bottom <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_word_processors.html" title="Comparison of word processors">comparison of word processors</a> table. That it was the first to have grammar checking... well, I don't know if that's important or not; either it has it or it doesn't. If OpenOffice doesn't have it, it will show up as a red square in the table, or you could mention the lack of grammar checking on the OO.o page, and say that Abiword does have it. Well, just my thoughts. Cheers, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Pickett_d019.html" title="User:Chris Pickett">Chris Pickett</a> 04:03, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I believe that some amount of notable history is "encyclopedic." I don't feel strongly on version history--just throwing it out there that MS Office, WordPerfect, and OO.o all have history in their articles. Talk of history is good. If more software articles had them, this would read less like a SourceForge dump. If more history was included in the text, I'd be happier. I agree that the screenshot of a grammar checker isn't really needed, but I think that the date it was addded would be notable. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 04:33, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, fair enough, so why not add a copy of the table from one of the other pages? The old version history that was here can be seen in the pages log. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Pickett_d019.html" title="User:Chris Pickett">Chris Pickett</a> 04:44, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/i/Talk%7EAbiWord_e38d.html" title="Edit section: Mac OS X Display issues">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mac OS X Display issues</span></h2>
<p>This message is written as a form of reply to the revert performed by Karnesky of my comment that "this version shows severe graphical corruption" on the basis that "(revert: isolated problems aren't encyclopedic &amp; these reports are further for 2.4.1, rather than 2.4.2 and don't present a coherent depiction of "screen corruption.)".</p>
<p>I consider that Karnesky's comment raises three issues. The first is that the problems are isolated. The second is that the issues raised relate only to an older version of the software. The third is that the comment "severe graphical corruption" does not present a coherent depiction of the problem.</p>
<p>First, concerning the question about whether the problems are isolated. Apple computers are a closed platform and so variation in drivers and hardware is much smaller than in the UNIX/Windows worlds. This massively decreases the probability that any problems seen are isolated. As to the degree they have been reported, I refer to the two URLs I posted in the comment to my edit.</p>
<p>At MacUpdate, of the 5 comments about version 2.4.1, 3 mention font display issues. That represents 60%.</p>
<p>At Version Tracker, 3 out of 4 comments left about version 2.4.1 talk about font display issues. That represents 75%.</p>
<p>Although not a comprehensive survey, that has to make it a presumption that the issues are not isolated unless better evidence can be found.</p>
<p>Second, concerning the question of an older version of the software, Karnesky is acting under a serious misaprehension. Whether version 2.4.1 is "out" or not, the latest Mac version is 2.4.1. Check out the official download site - <a href="http://www.abisource.com/download/" class="external free" title="http://www.abisource.com/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.abisource.com/download/</a> - which only offers OS X links to the files <a href="http://www.abisource.com/downloads/abiword/2.4.1/MacOSX/AbiWord-2.4.1.dmg" class="external free" title="http://www.abisource.com/downloads/abiword/2.4.1/MacOSX/AbiWord-2.4.1.dmg" rel="nofollow">http://www.abisource.com/downloads/abiword/2.4.1/MacOSX/AbiWord-2.4.1.dmg</a> and <a href="http://www.abisource.com/downloads/abiword/2.4.1/MacOSX/AbiWord-2.4.1-10.2.dmg" class="external free" title="http://www.abisource.com/downloads/abiword/2.4.1/MacOSX/AbiWord-2.4.1-10.2.dmg" rel="nofollow">http://www.abisource.com/downloads/abiword/2.4.1/MacOSX/AbiWord-2.4.1-10.2.dmg</a>. My comment therefore does represent a fact relating to the software as it exists today.</p>
<p>Finally, concerning the level of information required for an encyclopedic article, my original comment was flawed. To remedy this, unless this conversation results in a clear consensus that this information is not relevant to the article I shall write a new section of text on the various OS X display problems with screenshots such as:</p>

<dd>I agree that a new section for criticism would be more appropriate than the inline edit that was previously made. I don't know whether screenshots are really needed in that section--most other programs which have critical statements don't have this &amp; wikipedia isn't bugzilla (nor should it include comments on every bug in every program).
<ul>
<li>6 comments (many of which were anonymously made) does not justify a note. However, versiontracker has 102 comments &amp; MacUpdate has 66. If you want to defend your opinion that this is a common and significant issue, it would be appropriate to review all of the comments you haven't on those pages &amp; see if they describe the same problems of "font display," which is both more precise &amp; more accurate than "screen corruption." I also think abiword's bugzilla and possibly forums would be appropriate sources. In particular, see this bug<a href="http://bugzilla.abisource.com/show_bug.cgi?id=8384" class="external autonumber" title="http://bugzilla.abisource.com/show_bug.cgi?id=8384" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</li>
<li>Re. versions, <b>if</b> it is fair to describe the bug in this article, we should attempt to specify version numbers for the bug, as it appears some intermediate versions don't suffer this problem.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I still think the bug doesn't warrant a mention any more than any other software bug. If others do, that's fine &amp; it sounds like it will be added in a more appropriate context. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 22:32, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The current version available is 2.4.4. Since I am not a Mac user, I only hope that the bugs have been fixed by now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>@<b>ThomasHarte:</b> Please remember that major releases of software are bound to have some bugs, even if the first patched version (such as 2.4.1) has been released. The first patched version probably fixes the most hurting bugs (crashes, hangs, etc.), so minor bugs and possible regressions are fixed later.</dd>

<dd>I disagree with the continuing removal of the section regarding Abiword's uselessness on Mac OS X. The version removed on July 4 was well-researched, containing three references all pointing to sites where the vast consensus of comments was that Abiword is not usable on the Mac platform in its current version. Since the first sentence of the article claims that it runs on Mac OS X, I think this information is highly relevant. How is this information either not non-notable or poorly verified? --67.177.28.209 20:48, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To put things in perspective, VersionTracker lists MS Word X 11.2.3 rating as a lowly 2.2 (AbiWord is a comparatively healthy 3.7), yet the Word article lacks criticism of performance on OS X. This helps frame a few points:
<ul>
<li>WP is not bugzilla. I don't know that this bug really warrants a mention.</li>
<li>These sources are worse than those that have been on this comments page and in the article in the past--the bugzilla link is good, but:</li>
<li>The whole comments feeds for versiontracker and macupdate are not good sources, as they contain many comments which aren't at all relevant to font rendering &amp; MANY positive reviews</li>
<li>"virtually unusable" is not NPOV and is inaccurate, as there are people who use AbiWord on OS X.</li>
</ul>

<dd>"AbiWord is virtually unusable for Mac OSX in any of 2.4.x releases." "As many others have pointed out, the current text rendering problems render AbiWord useless for actual word processing on the mac." "I'm amazed it's still being offered in the shape it's in. Totally erratic, illogical font behavior, uncontrollable. It's a joke." "The type-setting makes AbiWord completely unusable for me." "What a disappointment. In its current state, AbiWord is unusable as even a simple text editor." --- Five random quotes from VersionTracker (<a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/14743&amp;mode=feedback" class="external free" title="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/14743&amp;mode=feedback" rel="nofollow">http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/14743&amp;mode=feedback</a>) and MacUpdate.com (<a href="http://www.macupdate.com/reviews.php?id=11511" class="external free" title="http://www.macupdate.com/reviews.php?id=11511" rel="nofollow">http://www.macupdate.com/reviews.php?id=11511</a>). If this bug "doesn't warrant a mention," I don't know what does, and if "there are people who use AbiWord on OS X," I haven't found them. With all due respect to Karnesky, I feel it is inaccurate and misleading for this article to keep saying that AbiWord is a functioning Mac word processor. I would also argue that being a Mac user who has actually tried to use the program, and done a lot of research on this, I'm in a better position that him/her to adjudicate, but... he/she's got the Wikipedia cred, so I rest my case. 67.177.28.209 00:46, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"How is it accurate to call a word processor where "font rendering is a work-in-progress" a functioning program?" A Word Processor does not necessarily need to have the same level of typesetting as Desktop Publishing software. A note stating the font rendering is a work in progress seems a lot fairer than entirely removing any claims of supporting Mac OS. Horkana</dd>
