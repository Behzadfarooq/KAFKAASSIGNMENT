<p>Abingdon School is believed to have been founded prior to <a href="../../../1/1/0/1100.html" title="1100">1100</a> by the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictine.html" title="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monks of <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abingdon_Abbey_3397.html" title="Abingdon Abbey">Abingdon Abbey</a>. It may date from as early as the <a href="../../../9/5/0/950s.html" title="950s">950s</a> when <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_of_England_d118.html" title="Edgar of England">King Edgar</a> is recorded as having been educated at the abbey. From its early years, the school used a room in <a href="http://www.berkshirehistory.com/churches/abingdon_stnics.html" class="external text" title="http://www.berkshirehistory.com/churches/abingdon_stnics.html" rel="nofollow">St Nicholas' Church</a>, which itself was built between <a href="../../../1/1/2/1121.html" title="1121">1121</a> and <a href="../../../1/1/8/1184.html" title="1184">1184</a>.</p>
<p>The school now takes its anniversary from the earliest surviving reference to the school - <a href="../../../1/2/5/1256.html" title="1256">1256</a> - a charter of Abingdon Abbey recording an endowment by Abbot John de Blosneville for the support of thirteen poor scholars. In the past though, the school considered itself as having been founded by John Roysse in <a href="../../../1/5/6/1563.html" title="1563">1563</a>. This led to the unusual circumstance whereby the school celebrated its 400th anniversary in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> (at which HRH <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Margaret_a62e.html" title="Princess Margaret">Princess Margaret</a> was guest of honour), and then its 750th in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. The focus on 1256 facilitated extensive anniversarial fundraising in 2006.</p>
<p>By the time of de Blosneville's endowment in 1256, the school had moved to a couple of rooms in Stert Street with a house for boarders at 3 Stert Street under the charge of a Dionysia Mundy. With John Roysse's re-endowment of 1563, the school moved to a site south of the Abbey gateway. Roysse was a prosperous mercer in the City of London, and through this association the school has received substantial benefactions from the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worshipful_Company_of_Mercers_7ea1.html" title="Worshipful Company of Mercers">Worshipful Company of Mercers</a>. The name <i>Roysse's School</i> was used until the 1960s and many older Abingdon residents still use the term.</p>
<p>After the dissolution of Abingdon Abbey in <a href="../../../1/5/3/1538.html" title="1538">1538</a> the school passed through a difficult phase: the sixteenth century endowments by Old Abingdonians attempted to overcome the loss of monastic support. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Tesdale_43c1.html" title="Thomas Tesdale">Thomas Tesdale</a>, who had been a pupil in 1563, made provision for an Usher to teach six poor scholars from the Borough of Abingdon and offered support for thirteen Abingdon students to study at <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford</a>. This benefaction eventually developed into <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pembroke_College%2C_Oxford_1608.html" title="Pembroke College, Oxford">Pembroke College</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/2/1624.html" title="1624">1624</a> by the re-foundation of Broadgates Hall.</p>

<p>The six poor scholars, known as Bennett Boys, or colloquially as the Gown Boys due to their dress, were financed by another Old Abingdonian, William Bennett. Between <a href="../../../1/6/0/1609.html" title="1609">1609</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a> the school maintained a dual management: the Headmaster, appointed by the Mayor and Corporation, and the Tesdale Usher and Bennett Scholars appointed by the Master and Governors of Christ's Hospital, Abingdon. The Old Abingdonian Club was inaugurated in <a href="../../../1/7/4/1743.html" title="1743">1743</a> during the Headship of Thomas Woods, and is consequently one of the oldest such organisations in the country.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/5/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a> Pembroke College distanced itself from the school.</p>
<p>The current school site in the Victorian quarter of Abingdon adjacent to Albert Park was designed by Edwin Dolby and was developed from <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>. Extensions to the 1870 buildings were added in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880.html" title="1880">1880</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a> a chapel and gymnasium were built. The adjacent Waste Court property was acquired in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>. The Science School came in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, to mark the Quatercentenary of the school's re-foundation, the big schoolroom was re-ordered as the Grundy Library (opened by HRH <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Margaret_a62e.html" title="Princess Margaret">Princess Margaret</a>), together with erection of further buildings east of the Science Wing, the whole becoming known as Big School. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> the Amey Theatre and Arts' Centre was opened and the Sports' Centre opened in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>. Mercers' Court was opened in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> by the Chancellor of <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a> and Visitor of <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pembroke_College_ad47.html" title="Pembroke College">Pembroke College</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Jenkins_of_Hillhead_79fc.html" title="Baron Jenkins of Hillhead">Baron Jenkins of Hillhead</a>.</p>

<p>The school currently has 812 pupils aged 11-18 of whom 126 are boarders. The school is split into 10 houses, 3 of which are for boarders and dayboys, 7 for day boys only. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>School - 57 boys (9 dayboys, 48 boarders)</li>
<li>Crescent - 60 boys (7 dayboys, 53 boarders)
<ul>
<li>These two houses have all the middle school boarders (aged 13-16) and the majority of the sixth form boarders (aged 16-18).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Waste Court - 25 boarders (16 6th form (with 3 in Boyd's) and 9 lower school)
<ul>
<li>This house has the remainder of the sixth form boarders and all of the lower school boarders (aged 11-13).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Boyd's - 79 boys (2 boarders in Waste Court and 77 dayboys)</li>
<li>Elliott's - 83 dayboys</li>
<li>Franklin's - 80 dayboys</li>
<li>Gooding's - 82 dayboys</li>
<li>Olders' - 81 dayboys</li>
<li>Phelps' (Situated on the same site as Waste Court) - 84 boys (72 dayboys, 13 boarders, (11 lower school boarders and 2 from Boyd's house)</li>
<li>Webb's - 81 dayboys</li>
</ul>
<p>Day boys from 11-13 belong to the Lower School which has 123 boys (114 dayboys and 9 boarders).</p>
<p>The day houses (with the exception of Lower School) take their names from their current Housemasters, and are thus prone to change.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, the school owned another upper school boarding house, Larkhill, to the north of the Faringdon Road. Various smaller buildings have also been used for boarders at various times, with the pupils being <i>part</i> of one of the larger houses. The Bath Street house, Lacies Court (rare) and Glyndowr come into this category, see <a href="http://www.abingdon.org.uk/downloads/image_schoolreliefmap.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.abingdon.org.uk/downloads/image_schoolreliefmap.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.abingdon.org.uk/downloads/image_schoolreliefmap.jpg</a> school map].</p>
<p>There are many Inter-House competitions at Abingdon, both sporting and academic. These include <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">Cricket</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_football.html" title="Rugby football">Rugby</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Speaking_ae17.html" title="Public Speaking">Public Speaking</a>. The competitions themselves are held every year, and each house has its traditional strengths. Elliot's (which holds the record of most 'tag-rugby' titles held at once, 4 of 5)School House and Crescent House (most of the 1st Eight rowers are in Crescent House), for example, are known to be particularly strong in the sports competitions, while Phelp's (which holds the record of the most public speaking titles held at one time, 3 of 5) Boyd's (Mr Boyd, Housemaster is Head of Debating) and Franklin's are better known for debating. There is also an annual inter-house singing competition, usually judged by a music department head from another school and by the Headmaster of Abingdon School.</p>
