<p>I'm sure is not what it claims to be. I have a picture of Ibn Saud who became ruler of Saudi Arabia in 1902. The picture was taken in 1911 and the man standing on the left of the picture on this page I'm sure is Ibn Saud.Benforman 11:59, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The men in the photo all wear <a href="../../../p/e/27/Pe%27ot.html" title="Pe'ot">pe'ot</a> in the Habbani style (i.e., braided). None of them is ibn Saud. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 23:09, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Have a look at this image below it is a picture of Ibn Saud the 1st ruler of Saudi Arabia taken in 1911 and compare it to the man on the far left of the picture <a href="http://www.toursaudiarabia.com/images/ibn-saud-2-large.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.toursaudiarabia.com/images/ibn-saud-2-large.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>he also appears to have his hair in a braided style but the cannot be pe'ot. Maybe I am wrong but I thought at first that they do look a little similar. The link doesn't work, will need to copy and paste it into your browser address window.</p>

<dd>read this article about Yehoshua Sofer from 2000 - his martial arts skills are excellent, but I'm not sure about Abir: <a href="http://www.kuksoolwon.co.il/jerusalemreport.html" class="external free" title="http://www.kuksoolwon.co.il/jerusalemreport.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kuksoolwon.co.il/jerusalemreport.html</a>130.88.132.175 14:23, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Greetings. I looked at the picture that you provided of ibn Saud and they don't look like the same person. The picture that is in the article actually came from a photo from the Sofer family in Israel. In terms of the picture you provided of ibn Saud I edited the first link and it should work now. I could not make the second one work. His hair is not in the style of Simonim i.e. Pe'ot (Pe'ot in Yemen were called Simonim). The picture of ibn Saud shows his hair in what looks like several braids. Simonim, as Yemenites braided them, are only two and are curled in a certain way. Also, his eyes look different. Do you have some specific evidence that the picture in the Abir article is a fake and acually of ibn Saud?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In terms of whether Abir is authentic. I recently received two letters from two Rabbis in Israel (one Yemenite and one Ashkenazi) who say Abir is authentic. I will have to translate them into English since they are in Hebrew. I need to check into how these can be presented in the article. Yehoshua Sofer mentioned that there are some articles out there that do not represent Abir correctly. The Abir web-site is being updated and it will include the letters from the Rabbis soon. Based on the evidence that the Habbani and the Jews of Daghestan had fighting techniques and soldiers, Abir isn't an impossible concept. As I get more information that can be verified with sources I will add it. The Abir web-site does explain why he learned the other martial arts styles such as Kuk Sool Won.</dd>

<dd>By the way Benforman I looked into it the picture you provided. It is not what you think it is. It is actually a photograph of Sa'ad Ibn Abdul(r) Rahman Al-Saud, brother of Ibn Saud, with his hair in ringlets which were called 'Dalik'.--<a href="../../../e/h/a/User%7EEhavEliyahu_3f26.html" title="User:EhavEliyahu">EhavEliyahu</a> 16:41, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Ehav, you may have a point, I certainly have no proof that the picture isn't what it claims to be, although I would point out that the link I posted to the image of Ibn Saud comes from the Royal Geographic Society, it says it was taken by Captain W.I. Shakespeare in 1911 so I would be surprised if that wasn't who it said it was. That said your point about the Abir photo being him or not is totally valid, it was just my opinion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the Abir style, it is certainly impressive, and I am not doubting Sofer's skill, the youtube videos prove that. In fact I have been interested in Abir since I read about it on the shoferinstitute Yemenite list many months ago. I am just not convinced yet by the story, as I know you aren't given your posts on other websites. I have been trying to research the story and have found interviews from several years ago online with Yehoshua Sofer where big parts of his story are missed out. Using google you can look for Yehoshua Sofer Jamaica and Nigel haAdmor for more information. Again I stress I am not questioning his skill or indeed his knowledge of Torah, but if the Abir story isn't true I don't see why he should need to embelish his story which is fascinating and note worthy in itself, and of course his martial skills which speak for themselves. At the end of the day I suppose I am an internet cynic, and this is only my opinion.</dd>

<dd>For more information on Jeiwsh warriors I would also recomend: The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, Travels in the Middles Ages. I can't find the quote at the moment but there is a section on Jewish Warriors. It is briefly described here: <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1793&amp;letter=A" class="external free" title="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1793&amp;letter=A" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1793&amp;letter=A</a></dd>

<dd>Greetings Benforman. I understand about being skeptical about Abir, I was also based on the same articles. I was very skeptical when I first heard about it, because the web-sites and the articles weren't clear. It wasn't until I actually contacted some Teimanim in Israel about it and I also contacted Grandmaster Sofer concerning proof that I changed my mind about it. As mentioned before I received letters from a Yemenite Rabbi and an Ashkenazi Rabbi who state that Abir is ancient and authentic. In terms of the article, it only reflects what is on the web-site which Grandmaster Sofer states is not completely accurate. Grandmaster Sofer mentioned to me that he is working on getting his webstie corrected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In terms of the picture I looked on the site you provided and it said that the picture was of Sa'ad Ibn Abdul(r) Rahman Al-Saud, brother of Ibn Saud, with his hair in ringlets which were called 'Dalik' (Those were the exact words from the <a href="http://www.toursaudiarabia.com/ibn-saud.html" class="external free" title="http://www.toursaudiarabia.com/ibn-saud.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.toursaudiarabia.com/ibn-saud.html</a> under the 1911 title). The 1910 photo has a picture of Ibn-Saud sitting on the left side. As you can see he doens't look anything like the photo on the Abir article. Also, another way to tell is that for Ibn Saud to be in a photo standing behind King Abdullah would imply that he is the servant of Abdullah. In the fashion of the Middle Eastern culture since Ibn-Saud comes from a royal family, he would be sitting next to Abdullah if he were posing with him for a picture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There were some people I know in Israel who said Abir was not authentic because Aluf Abir, Mori Yehoshua Sofer was into Reggea and he did Reggea. Yet, I found out not long ago that Shaolin Fighting Monk Shi Yan-Ming (best known the the Shaolin <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Body_671a.html" title="Iron Body">Iron Body</a> or <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Shirt_d3ff.html" title="Iron Shirt">Iron Shirt</a> techniques) who teaches Shaolin Kung-Fu in downtonw NY is into rap music (specifically he has been working with Wu-Tang Clan on one of their records).--<a href="../../../e/h/a/User%7EEhavEliyahu_3f26.html" title="User:EhavEliyahu">EhavEliyahu</a> 01:38, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Ehav, for what it's worth (non-Jewish) Yemenis I know have heard the stories of a Jewish fighting style and Jewish warriors also. I knew that Wu-Tang were into Shaolin, I didn't know that Shaolin were into Wu-Tang - great post.87.113.25.165 07:21, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Greetings. Yes, I was checking out a forum from 2005 where a number of martial artist were criticizing Abir, but there was an Arab man who posted a number of times that Abir was authentic and that a number of Arabs knew of it and it was well respected by them. He specifically knew of the Sofer/Abir family and talked highly of them and their techniques. He mentioned that he hoped that no Jews would ever take it since he prefered them not to know it (for political and stratigic reasons).</dd>

<dl>

<dd>

<dd>Also, on the subject of Shaolin Monk Shi Yan-Ming and his interest in rap. There was a program I was watching where the <a href="../../../r/z/a/RZA_5347.html" title="RZA">RZA</a> from the <a href="../../../w/u/-/Wu-Tang_Clan_788c.html" title="Wu-Tang Clan">Wu-Tang Clan</a> went to the Shaolin Kung Fu school here in New York and he met Monk Shi Yan-Ming. They became friends, and there was a segment in the program where they showed the RZA with Monk Shi Yan-Ming in the recording studio working on a Wu-Tang Clan album. Monk Shi Yan-Ming mentioned that there were people who criticized him for his interest in hip-hop and he stated that he did not see any contradiction in it. It was interesting.--<a href="../../../e/h/a/User%7EEhavEliyahu_3f26.html" title="User:EhavEliyahu">EhavEliyahu</a> 11:05, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
