<p>The nation had just suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of the Philistines, in which both king and crown prince had perished. The wise king knew the only answer was to train the army in the foundation of Hebrew warriorship, Qesheth--the tradition of the Avoth (forefathers).</p>
<p>This fighting tradition was the very distinguishing mark of a Hebrew from an Egyptian. When Yoseph, whose identity was unknown to his brothers, orders that Shim`on be incarcerated (Bareshith 42:18-24) and his guards attempt to seize him, Shim`on lets out a roar that utterly confounds and frightens them. Finally, Yoseph orders his own son Manashe to arrest Shim`on: Manashe deals him a blow that humbles Shim`on instantly. As he is being taken away before his astonished brothers, Shim`on calls out to them (Sepher HaYashar, parasha Miqetz):</p>

Another commander, Abishai, killed 300 men in a fight (2 Sam. 23:18), and Jashobeam, another "mighty man" of David, killed 300 in one battle (1 Chron. 11:11).</p>

<p>In 1912 Zionist emissary Shmuel Yavnieli came into contact with Habbani Jews who ransomed him when he was captured and robbed by eight Bedouin in southern Yemen. Yavnieli wrote about the Jews of Habban describing them in the following way.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Jews in these parts are held in high esteem by everyone in Yemen and Aden.

<p>There are a number of legends about the origins of the Jews of Habban. The most prominent is that they descend from Judean soldiers who were stationed in southern Arabia by King Herod of Jersualem during the Second Temple Period. Herod dispatched a unit of Jews in the region to assist the Romans with fighting wars in the area. Unlike the Jews of northern Yemen the Habbani Jews wore: Jambiyya (curved knife), Matznaph (turban) and Avne`t (sash). It was also common for the Sultans of Arabia to use Habbani Jews as soldiers in their armies or as personal guards.</p>
<p>Benjamin of Tudela (twelfth century) found an independent Jewish warrior tribe living in the highlands of Khorasan near Nisapur, numbering many thousand families, regarding themselves as descendants of Dan, Zebulun, Asher, and Naphtali, under a Jewish prince of the name of Joseph Amarkala ha-Levi.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Another independent Jewish tribe bent upon warlike expeditions is mentioned by Benjamin as living in the district of Tehama in Yemen.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1793&amp;letter=A" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1793&amp;letter=A" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

<p>The Jews of Daghestan lived isolated and in one of the most remote, impenetrable areas in the world for many centuries. They have been historically known for their feirce and war-like nature. In dress and custom they were hardly distinguishable from other Caussian fighting people in the region. Though they are considered <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">dhimmi</a> by they surrounding Muslim population, the Mountain Jews owned land were known to be fierce, not hesitating to defend, by sword or the rifle, their family, religion, or personal dignity.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Jews of Daghestan greatly resemble the other warlike inhabitants of this mountainous region; and they have acquired the virtues as well as the faults of the latter. There is a tradition among the Jews of Daghestan that they are the descendants of the Lost Ten Tribes; but the history of their wanderings is now forgotten, the written documents which they once possessed having in the course of time been either lost or destroyed. They differ from their Christian and Mohammedan neighbors in speech, using the Tat language, which is a combination of Persian and Hebrew. Their writing is a mixture of square characters and Rashi. They wear the Circassian dress, and always go heavily armed, even sleeping without having removed their weapons.</i><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></dd>

<p>It is possible that the Mountain Jews are descendants of Persian-Jewish soldiers who were stationed in the Caucasus by the Sasanian kings in the fifth or sixth century to protect the area from the onslaughts of the Huns and other nomadic invaders from the east. Under the impact of the invading Turkic hordes, later generations of Jewish inhabitants of the Caucasian lowlands were forced to migrate even further north to Daghestan.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>According to a West African Arabic record called the Tarikh el-Fetash, in 1402 in Tiridirma near the Niger river lived a community of Jews known as the Bani Israeel who were said to have seven rulers, 333 wells, and a well trained army.

<p>Jewish soldiers assisted Childeric in his war against Wamba. The Moors are said to have entrusted to Jews the guardianship of the conquered cities of Spain. Under King Alfonso VI of Castile, in 1068, 40,000 Jews fought against Yusuf ibn Teshufin in the battle of Zalaka, with such heroism that the battle-field was covered with their bodies. Under Alfonso VIII. (1166-1214) there were many warriors among the wealthy and cultured Jews of Toledo that fought bravely against the Moors.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> Alfonso X., called "the Wise," while infante, had many Jews in his army; and in the capture of Seville (1298) the Jewish warriors distinguished themselves so highly that, in compensation for their services, Alfonso allotted to them certain lands for the formation of a Jewish village.

<p>Poet and warrior; lived in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabia.html" title="Arabia">Arabia</a> in the first half of the 6th century CE. His mother was of the royal tribe of Ghassan, while his father, according to some, was descended from Aaron, or, according to others, from Kahin, son of Harun and progenitor of the Jewish tribes of Kuraitza and Nathir. Samuel owned a castle near Taima (eight hours north of Medina), built by his grandfather 'Adiya and called, from its mixed color, Al-Ablak. It was situated on a high hill and was a halting-place for travelers to and from Syria.</p>
<p>More than for his poetic talents <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_ibn_%27Adiya_52f7.html" title="Samuel ibn 'Adiya">Samuel ibn 'Adiya</a> is famous for his connection with the warrior-poet and prince Amru al-Kais, which won for him the epithet "faithful," and gave rise to the saying, still common among the Arabs, "more faithful than Samuel." Samuel ibn 'Adiya's reputation as a poet rests upon one of the first poems in the collection called the "Hamasa." It is full of warlike vigor and courage, and manifests a high ideal of honor. Another poem attributed to him has been published in Arabic and Hebrew, with an English translation, by H. Hirschfeld ("J. Q. R." xvii. 431-440).<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

Abir Grandmaster Yehoshua Sofer.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Aluf Abir <i>(Hebrew for Grandmaster of Abir)</i>, Yehoshua Sofer, is known and discussed in higher circles of the martial arts, military, law enforcement, and intelligence communities in Israel and elsewhere in the world with much respect. He holds 7th Degree black belts in Korean Kuk Sool Won, <a href="../../../h/a/p/Hapkido.html" title="Hapkido">Hapkido</a> and a 6th Degree black belt in TukGong Musool (designed for elite military and intelligence agents in S.Korea) and has a very wide range of diverse expertise in various aspects of "cold" combat that few come close to matching.</p>

<p>He has several world leaders' personal protection/security personnel under his instruction and guidance from the President of Moldova to the Prime-Minister of Israel. He often oversees high profile events from behind the scenes. Sofer is a Hasidic Jew which is another factor that makes him totally unique in his field. He simply does not look like a martial artist capable of neutralizing people twice his size instantly with pain compliance techniques.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>His training in Abir began when he was a child and he has had more than 45 years of training in physical and combat arts training. He is also well known for his unique ability to take people with little or no combat background and transform them into formidable fighting proponents in a very short time frame.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most unique aspect of the Grandmaster Sofer's background is his knowledge of Native Israelite Warrior Arts secretly kept alive in bits and pieces by some of the world's most hidden ancient Jewish communities. These techniques were those used by his Israelite ancestors, to which there are direct references in the Bible, Talmud, and the Midrash, particularly Sepher HaYashar (Book of Jasher).</p>
<p>According to an authorized spokesman for Abir Warrior Arts®</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Claims that the</i> Aluph Abir<i>("Grandmaster" in Hebrew) Yehoshua must have grafted his own art onto a Korean base because he mastered Korean arts are fraudulent. The young Sofer only trained in foreign combat by command of his father, against his desire. At home, he was groomed and trained in the art of his ancestors from the age of three, and he longed to practice Abir only and make it known.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>His grandfather, the previous Aluf Abir Nachman Sofer (personal bodyguard to Lawrence of Arabia and the British brass in Hadramawt), played with the young scion of the Sofer dynasty from the age of three, indoctrinating him through games based on the Sofer family tradition of Hevron and Hejaz Abir. This training included the use of Shootnah, Karkour, Paziza, Heavkuth, Kunfoon, Keshet, Herev Rahav (Middle Eastern Broad Sword), slingshot, javelin, Nabuta, Maagal and the Maaraf. Yet his father and grandfather forbade him to reveal the art until he would become at least Dan 7 in one other fighting form, become recognized as expert in several other diverse forms, and reach the age of forty.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>They did so, despite the fact they considered foreign martial arts to be forbidden to Jews (and in many cases to non-Jews as well). As immigrants to the United States, theirs was the first generation ever to see centuries-old national fighting traditions of different peoples available to the masses to choose from and learn. For the Abir tradition to survive, it would need to contend with these competitors. They therefore ensured that the next torch bearer would be able to adapt the art to the modern world, much like the Hebrew language was adapted to fit the needs of the modern era.</i> <a href="http://www.keshertalk.com/archives/2007/01/abir_ancient_je.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.keshertalk.com/archives/2007/01/abir_ancient_je.php" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></dd>

<p>According to Grandmaster Yehoshua Sofer:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>My family lived in Israel for 100 generations, since the time of Saraya Sofer—a royal scribe and warrior who served the kingdom of Israel. Both ancient Israelite writing and martial arts traditions, were handed down in my family from generation to generation.</i><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Sofer family has a tradition that, following the wars of Bar Kokhba, their ancestors lived in Piq'in near <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tiberias.html" title="Tiberias">Tiberias</a> for one thousand years, and at the time of the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusades.html" title="Crusades">Crusades</a>, moved to Hevron, where they lived for another one thousand years, some of them moving back and forth between Israel and <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemen.html" title="Yemen">Yemen</a> all the while. This is substantiated by two photographs the Abir has: one is that of his uncles in the 1920s, who lived in Hevron, in service of the Khalif of Jordan. The other, from only a few years earlier, is of his grandfather's brother, was in Oman, in service of the son of the Sultan.</p>
<p>Members of the Sofer family moved between Jerusalem and Habban in eastern Aden to cities such as Baidha. "Baidha" means "white" in Yemeni arabic. While in Israel, Nachman Sofer and his youngest son, Ya`aqov Mosha, Grandmaster Yehoshua Sofer's father, left the region for <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamaica.html" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> following the Hevron massacres of 1929, in which two of his uncles were murdered. From there they would move to the United States and later back to Israel.</p>

<p>Grandmaster Yehoshua Sofer's Abir martial art form is based on fighting techniques that he learned from his grandfather and father. The history of these techniques is the idea that at one time ancient Israel had a martial art form, which was both hand to hand and also weaponized in nature. As with any other fighting style these techniques were both borrowed and learned from the various cultures that the ancient Israelites came into contact with as well as created using their own religious and cultural symbols. It is believed that while most Jewish communities did not continue to train in this group of fightning techniques that some exotic Jewish communities in Arabia and in parts of Asia were able to maintain elements of the techniques, which for some became elements of ethnic Jewish dance.</p>

<p>The Hebrew Alphabet consists of 22 consonants and five word ending letters bringing them to a total of 27 letters in all that are assigned 7 special categories.</p>
<p>They are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Choking</li>
<li>Locking</li>
<li>Throwing</li>
<li>Take downs</li>
<li>Primary initiated attacks or</li>
<li>Secondary responsive attacks and</li>
<li>a natural flowing blend consisting of any two of these six categories or any one or more combined with another letter</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives a unique and familiar way to quickly assimilate complex dynamic martial arts combat techniques using these most familiar visual memory tools that give us 189 techniques. These 189 techniques are then learnt in conjunction with an additional 176 techniques that are designed to solve the most commonly encountered types of attacks with effective counters to various applications of those same seven categories performed.</p>

Conversely, this attack which was executed with the right arm directed right to left could have equally been initiated at point zero with the elbow at the opponent’s kidney or liver culminating with the fingers in a left to right motion. Limbs stick to the never-lock principle to avoid joint damage due to hyperextension. The Arrow when launched as a frontal attack is actually vertical or horizontal and travels in a broad or narrow circle as opposed to the classical front kick which snaps between two stopping motions and moves in a short half circle if we look at it from the side view. The classical front kick and the side kick, whether snapping or thrusting, come to two full stops along the way to their completion and endanger the knee joint by exposing it to hyperextension when the leg is locked straight at the end of its trajectory. Another danger is encountered when such techniques are aimed at higher target zones as the body is placed in a very compromising balancing act that exposes the groin to counterattack, and the lower back to severe injury when and if impact is made. When contact with its target is missed there is even more danger of tearing the muscles ligaments or tendons.</p>

<p>With The Arrow, the leg never fully extends or hyper extends since it is never theoretically straightened. From the very initiation of each wipping circular motion, The Arrow never stops. On the contrary, it continues to build momentum and speed and can strike its target with virtually any part of the leg from the knee down to the toes depending only on the distance from the opponent and whether contact is made on the more vertical, horizontal or lateral phase of its circular axis. The ball of the foot, instep, inner or outer blades of the feet, ankle, shins or knee are all satisfactory striking surfaces as are the back, sides, and bottom of the heel when striking at various angles, to the sides or to the rear. The leg need not be <i>stretched out</i> since care is taken not to straighten the leg and full power is only achieved when the Arrow is launched with total relaxation. In fact, the act of releasing this deadly weapon tends to relax the limbs while strengthening them and gaining flexibility and mobility of the muscles, ligaments, tendons and joints with each additional execution. Ruakh Khayuth or Life -spirit pumped into the limb directed by Rahtson (guiding will) is all that is needed to launch this deadly weapon in an instant with maximum power.</p>

<p>These are the 18 choreographed fighting dances that tie together the 12 tribes movement and fighting attributes (12 weaponless and 6 weapons forms) necessary to master Abir's 613 techniques. These 613 can be built upon to incorporate thousands more and are a mere guide to the keys behind achieving a balanced harmonious life steeped in holiness and purity with an integrated mastery of ones spiritual and physical matter (or khomer) embodying the virtues that make up the initials of an Abir.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
