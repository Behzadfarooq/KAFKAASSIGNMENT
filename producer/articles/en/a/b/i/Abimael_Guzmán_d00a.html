<p>Guzmán was born in <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mollendo.html" title="Mollendo">Mollendo</a>, a port town in the province of Islay, in the region of <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arequipa_region.html" title="Arequipa region">Arequipa</a>, about 1000 km south of Lima. He was the illegitimate son of a well-off merchant, the winner of the national <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lottery.html" title="Lottery">lottery</a> who had six children by three different women. Guzmán's mother, Berenice Reynoso, died when her son was only five years old.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> Guzmán lived with his mother's family. After <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> he lived with his father and his father's wife in the city of <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arequipa.html" title="Arequipa">Arequipa</a>, where he studied at a private <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a> secondary school. At the age of 19 he became a student at the Social Studies department of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universidad_Nacional_de_San_Agust%C3%ADn_de_Arequipa_d45c.html" title="Universidad Nacional de San Agustín de Arequipa">San Agustín National University</a>, in Arequipa. His classmates at the university later described him as shy, disciplined, obsessive, and ascetic. Increasingly attracted by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>, his political thinking was influenced by the book <i>Seven Essays on the Interpretation of the Peruvian Reality</i> of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Carlos_Mari%C3%A1tegui_d8dd.html" title="José Carlos Mariátegui">José Carlos Mariátegui</a>, the founder of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Peru_50f7.html" title="Communist Party of Peru">Communist Party of Peru</a>.</p>
<p>At Arequipa, Guzmán completed bachelor degrees in philosophy and <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a>. His dissertations were entitled "The Kantian Theory of Space" and "The Bourgeois Democratic State." In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, Guzmán was recruited as a professor of philosophy by the rector of <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Crist%C3%B3bal_of_Huamanga_University_e9a1.html" title="San Cristóbal of Huamanga University">San Cristóbal of Huamanga University</a> in <a href="../../../a/y/a/Ayacucho.html" title="Ayacucho">Ayacucho</a>, a city in the central Peruvian <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andes.html" title="Andes">Andes</a>. The rector was Dr. <a href="../../../e/f/r/Efra%C3%ADn_Morote_d818.html" title="Efraín Morote">Efraín Morote Best</a>, an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropology.html" title="Anthropology">anthropologist</a> who some believe later became the true intellectual leader of the "Shining Path movement." Encouraged by Morote, Guzmán studied <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quechua.html" title="Quechua">Quechua</a>, the language spoken by Peru's indigenous population, and became increasingly active in <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing.html" title="Left-wing">left-wing</a> political circles. He attracted several like-minded young academics committed to bringing about revolution in Peru. He visited the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> for the first time in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>. After serving as the head of personnel for San Cristóbal of Huamanga University, Guzmán left the institution in the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> and went underground.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, the Peruvian Communist Party splintered over ideological and personal disputes. Guzmán, who had taken a pro-Chinese rather than pro-<a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> line, emerged as the leader of the faction which came to be known as the "Shining Path" (Mariátegui's wrote once: "Marxism-Leninism is the shining path of the future"). He adopted the <i><a href="../../../n/o/m/Nom_de_guerre.html" title="Nom de guerre">nom de guerre</a></i> President Gonzalo and began advocating a peasant-led revolution on the Maoist model. His followers declared Guzmán, who cultivated anonymity, to be the "Fourth Sword of Communism" (after <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Marx</a>, <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Lenin_a39d.html" title="Vladimir Lenin">Lenin</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_Zedong_ee10.html" title="Mao Zedong">Mao</a>). In his political declarations, Guzmán praised Mao's development of Lenin's theses regarding the role of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a> in propping up the bourgeois <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalist.html" title="Capitalist">capitalist</a> system. He claimed that imperialism ultimately "creates disruption and is unsuccessful, and it will end up in ruins in the next 50 to 100 years". Guzmán applied this criticism not only to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> imperialism, but also to what he termed the "social-imperialism" of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> he married Augusta la Torre, who later died.</p>

<p>The Shining Path movement was at first largely circumscribed to academic circles in Peruvian universities. In the late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, however, the movement developed into a <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerrilla_warfare.html" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrilla</a> group centered around Ayacucho. In May <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, the group launched its war against the government of Perú by burning the ballot boxes in Chuschi, a village near Ayacucho, in an effort to disrupt the first democratic elections in the country since <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>. Shining Path eventually grew to control vast rural territories in central and southern Peru and achieved a presence even in the outskirts of <a href="../../../l/i/m/Lima.html" title="Lima">Lima</a>, where it staged numerous attacks. The purpose of Shining Path's campaign was to demoralize and undermine the government of Perú in order to create a situation conducive to a violent coup which would put its leaders in power. The Shining Path targeted not only the army and police, but also government employees at all levels, other leftist militants such as members of the <a href="../../../t/%C3%BA/p/T%C3%BApac_Amaru_Revolutionary_Movement_f26e.html" title="Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement">Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement</a> (MRTA), workers who did not participate in the strikes organized by the group, peasants who cooperated with the government in any way (including by voting in democratic elections), and ordinary middle-class inhabitants of Perú's main cities. The <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_%28Peru%29_2998.html" title="Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> later estimated that the resulting <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_war.html" title="Civil war">civil war</a> led to the deaths of some seventy thousand people, approximately half of them at the hands of the Shining Path and a third at the hands of the state. <a href="http://peru.com/noticias/idocs/2003/8/29/DetalleDocumento_97139.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://peru.com/noticias/idocs/2003/8/29/DetalleDocumento_97139.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>The movement promoted the writings of Guzmán, called <i>Gonzalo Thought</i>, a new theoretical understanding that built upon <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/n/Leninism.html" title="Leninism">Leninism</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/o/Maoism.html" title="Maoism">Maoism</a> whereby he declared Maoism as a "third and higher stage of Marxism," having defined Maoism as "people's war." In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, Guzmán declared that the Shining Path (which he referred to as the "Communist Party of Peru") had progressed from waging a people's war to waging a "war of movements." He further argued that this was a step towards achieving "strategic equilibrium" in the near future, based on Maoist theories of waging people's war. Guzmán claimed that such an equilibrium would manifest itself by ungovernability under the "old order." When that moment arrived, Guzmán believed that Shining Path would be ready to move on to its "strategic offensive".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/i/Abimael_Guzm%C3%A1n_d00a.html" title="Edit section: Capture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Capture</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, during the first administration of democratically elected President <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fujimori_b38a.html" title="Alberto Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a>, the National Directorate Against Terrorism (DINCOTE) began casing several residences in <a href="../../../l/i/m/Lima.html" title="Lima">Lima</a> because agents suspected that terrorists were using them as safehouses. One of those residences, in the middle-class neighborhood of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santiago_de_Surco_6a6c.html" title="Santiago de Surco">Surco</a>, had been operating as a ballet studio. The DINCOTE operatives routinely searched the garbage taken out from the house. The house was supposedly inhabited by only one person, the dance teacher Maritza Garrido Lecca, but it was soon noticed that the household produced more garbage than one person could account for. Furthermore, agents found discarded tubes of cream for the treatment of <a href="../../../p/s/o/Psoriasis.html" title="Psoriasis">psoriasis</a>, an ailment that Guzmán was known to have. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">12 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, an elite unit of the DINCOTE raided the Surco residence. On the second floor of the house, they found and arrested Guzmán and eight others, including Laura Zambrano and Elena Iparraguirre, Guzmán's female companion. (This episode inspired <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Shakespeare_f044.html" title="Nicholas Shakespeare">Nicholas Shakespeare</a>'s novel <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dancer_Upstairs_a1cf.html" title="The Dancer Upstairs">The Dancer Upstairs</a></i>).</p>
<p>At the time of capture, the police seized Guzmán's computer, in which they found a very detailed register of his armed forces and the weapons each regiment, militia and support base had in each region of the country. Guzmán had recorded that, in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, the Shining Path had 23,430 members armed with approximately 235 <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolvers.html" title="Revolvers">revolvers</a>, 500 <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifles.html" title="Rifles">rifles</a> and 300 other items of military hardware such as <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenade.html" title="Grenade">grenades</a>. The government tried to portray Guzmán as a crazed psychopath and common criminal, publicizing photos of him in striped prison garb, and promised that "Sendero Luminoso's" rank and file who turned themselves in would get lenient treatment. Guzmán remained defiant in front of the hostile press, while the latter sang patriotic songs to drown out Guzmán's revolutionary slogans and speech.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/i/Abimael_Guzm%C3%A1n_d00a.html" title="Edit section: Trial and imprisonment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trial and imprisonment</span></h2>
<p>Guzmán was tried by a court of hooded military judges under provisions of the anti-terrorism laws adopted by Fujimori's government. After a three-day trial, Guzmán was sentenced to life imprisonment and incarcerated at the San Lorenzo Island naval base, in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Callao.html" title="Callao">Callao</a>, the port of Lima, where he remains currently. Subsequently, he is said to have negotiated with presidential advisor at the time, <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimiro_Montesinos_939e.html" title="Vladimiro Montesinos">Vladimiro Montesinos</a>, in order to receive some benefits in exchange for helping the Peruvian government put an end to the Shining Path's militant activities. Guzmán appeared several times on Peruvian television and in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> he publicly declared "peace" with the Peruvian government. This declaration split the Shining Path and raised questions about the organization's future. Some within the party accepted it as a sign of defeat. Others held that it was either a forgery or an insincere statement made under duress.</p>
<p>Although there is little doubt that Guzmán was indeed the leader of the Shining Path, more than 5,000 individuals presented an appeal to Peru's Constitutional Court in 2003 asking that the verdicts against more than other 1800 prisoners convicted of terrorism, including Guzmán, be voided. The court agreed, declaring that the military trials had been unconstitutional and ordering new trials before civilian courts. The new trials began in 2003. Since then, more than 400 prisoners who had been found guilty by military courts have been freed.</p>
<p>Guzmán's re-trial was scheduled to begin on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_5.html" title="November 5">5 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. The international press was held in a sound proof chamber and all media was banned from observing the trial after Shining Path cadre turned their backs on the judges and delivered a revolutionary salute to the media gallery. The only words he spoke in the presence of the international press were "Long live the Communist Party of Peru! Glory to Marxism-Leninism-Maoism! Glory to the Peruvian people! Long live the heroes of the people’s war!" After Guzmán made this statement the courtroom microphones were silenced and the press was unable to hear any of the proceedings that followed. The trial resumed on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">12 November</a>. No reporters were allowed to observe the new proceedings but two more of the judges subsequently recused themselves.
