<p>Folger was born in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>. Her parents were <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Folger_7234.html" title="Peter Folger">Peter Folger</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairman.html" title="Chairman">Chairman</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/e/President.html" title="President">President</a> of the Folger Coffee Company, and Inez Mejia, the daughter of a prestigious <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> land grant family. Her <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> parents divorced in 1952 when Abigail was still young, after her mother ended the marriage on the grounds of extreme cruelty. In 1960, her father married again, this time to his 24-year-old private secretary, Beverly Mater.</p>
<p>Growing up in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, Abigail was raised in the closed tradition of San Francisco society. As a young girl she was interested in art, books, and poetry. She spent much of her time painting and writing poetry when she had the time. Besides her interests in painting and poetry, Abigail was very talented in playing the piano. Close friends and family called her 'Gibby'.</p>
<p>Abigail Folger attended the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Catalina_School_for_Girls_f315.html" title="Santa Catalina School for Girls">Santa Catalina School for Girls</a> in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monterey%2C_California_8065.html" title="Monterey, California">Monterey, California</a>, near <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmel-by-the-Sea%2C_California_2754.html" title="Carmel-by-the-Sea, California">Carmel</a>. There, she was well known and well liked as a model student who graduated with honors in June of 1961. She then matriculated at <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radcliffe_College_572f.html" title="Radcliffe College">Radcliffe College</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge%2C_Massachusetts_da41.html" title="Cambridge, Massachusetts">Cambridge</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> in the fall of 1961. During her stay at Radcliffe she became an active member of the college's <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_and_Sullivan_23b8.html" title="Gilbert and Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> Players, a musical theatre group. Abigail starred in two of its productions, starting with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sorcerer_0b7a.html" title="The Sorcerer">The Sorcerer</a></i> in April 1963 where she played the part of one of the town's villagers. In December 1963 she starred in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gondoliers_7d8a.html" title="The Gondoliers">The Gondoliers</a></i> as the pretty Contadine. Abigail graduated with honors from <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radcliffe_College_572f.html" title="Radcliffe College">Radcliffe College</a> in 1964.</p>
<p>While a freshman in college, she became a <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debutante.html" title="Debutante">debutante</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_21.html" title="December 21">December 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, where she made her official debut into San Francisco's high society. Her debutante ball was one of the highlights of the social season, with Folger wearing a bright yellow <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Dior_58a1.html" title="Christian Dior">Christian Dior</a> gown that she had purchased in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> the previous summer.</p>
<p>After graduating from Radcliffe, she enrolled in the fall of 1964 at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>, also in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge%2C_Massachusetts_da41.html" title="Cambridge, Massachusetts">Cambridge</a>, where she did graduate work and received a degree in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_art.html" title="History of art">Art History</a>. After graduating in the spring of 1967, she took a job at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California_04ab.html" title="University of California">University of California</a> Art Museum in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley%2C_California_6eb4.html" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> as a publicity director.

<p>In September 1967, Folger decided to move away from <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> in order to find herself and to probe the other side of life. She didn't stay in Berkeley for long; she soon made the move to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, where she got a job working for a magazine publisher. She eventually left for a job at the Gotham Book Mart on 47th Street. While living in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, she chose to live well beneath her means. As the daughter of the name which meant coffee millions, Folger's annual income from her inheritances, after taxes, was $130,000 a year.</p>
<p>It was at a bookstore party in December 1967 where she met <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Polish</a> author <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerzy_Kosinski_d579.html" title="Jerzy Kosinski">Jerzy Kosinski</a>, who was married to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> steel heiress <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Hayward_Weir_af97.html" title="Mary Hayward Weir">Mary Hayward Weir</a>. Hayward Weir ran in the same wealthy circle as Folger, and it was she who introduced Kosinski to Abigail. In early January 1968, Kosinski introduced Abigail to his friend, aspiring writer <a href="../../../w/o/j/Wojciech_Frykowski_b363.html" title="Wojciech Frykowski">Wojciech Frykowski</a>, at a party and the two hit it off. Frykowski had been living in the United States for one month at the time.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/i/Abigail_Folger_53b8.html" title="Edit section: Folger and Frykowski">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Folger and Frykowski</span></h2>
<p>Wojciech was not then fluent in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_%28language%29.html" title="English (language)">English</a>, but, like Abigail, he was fluent in <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>. Abigail gave him a tour of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, began to teach him English, and a romance soon blossomed. He moved into her <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> apartment and she soon found herself supporting him financially.</p>
<p>In August 1968, both Folger and Frykowski decided to move to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>. Wojciech wanted to pursue his writing career while Abigail wanted to get involved with a new <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welfare.html" title="Welfare">welfare</a> project that was currently under way. Abigail rented a car, and she and Wojciech drove across the country.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, Abigail found a two-storey hilltop home to rent at 2774 Woodstock Road for her and Wojciech in <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurel_Canyon_e696.html" title="Laurel Canyon">Laurel Canyon</a>, and bought herself a 1968 yellow <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontiac_Firebird_5732.html" title="Pontiac Firebird">Firebird</a>. Their neighbor across the road was singer <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cass_Elliot_07d5.html" title="Cass Elliot">Cass Elliot</a> of the rock group <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mamas_%26_the_Papas_ea19.html" title="The Mamas &amp; the Papas">The Mamas &amp; the Papas</a>, whom the couple quickly befriended. Through Wojciech, Abigail met the Polanskis, Roman and Sharon. Through the Polanskis, Abigail and Wojciech were introduced to <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Sebring_f6ff.html" title="Jay Sebring">Jay Sebring</a>. The five quickly began to hang out together and were known to be a part of 'the beautiful people crowd' in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. In a <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> interview for the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_Channel_2ce1.html" title="History Channel">History Channel</a> show <i>Our Generation: Death of the Counterculture</i>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Phillips_3205.html" title="Michelle Phillips">Michelle Phillips</a>, also of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mamas_%26_the_Papas_ea19.html" title="The Mamas &amp; the Papas">The Mamas &amp; the Papas</a>, said that she was very good friends with all of the Tate murder victims (presumably excluding <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Parent_1b21.html" title="Steven Parent">Steven Parent</a>) and that it was still hard to talk about the murders.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/i/Abigail_Folger_53b8.html" title="Edit section: Social work">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Social work</span></h2>
<p>Like her mother, Inez, who was active doing charity work with the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic in San Francisco, Abigail continued to be involved with volunteer work. She registered as a volunteer <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_worker.html" title="Social worker">social worker</a> for the Los Angeles County Welfare Department in September 1968. Earlier, in the <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_%28season%29.html" title="Spring (season)">spring</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer.html" title="Summer">summer</a> of 1968, Abigail attended fundraisers set up by her mother to aid the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic. It was around the same time many of the Manson family women were being treated there. Back in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, Abigail spent long days in the ghettos doing her job as a volunteer <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_worker.html" title="Social worker">social worker</a> with children, waking up at dawn each day.</p>
<p>In December <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> Folger invested $3,500 in <a href="../../../s/e/b/Sebring_International_7e02.html" title="Sebring International">Sebring International</a>, Jay Sebring's hair care products for men.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">March 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, Abigail, Sebring, and Wojciech attended the catered housewarming party of the Polanskis at <a href="../../../1/0/0/10050_Cielo_Drive_063f.html" title="10050 Cielo Drive">10050 Cielo Drive</a>. Over one hundred guests, such as <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Fonda_5ebb.html" title="Jane Fonda">Jane Fonda</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Vadim_7ee0.html" title="Roger Vadim">Roger Vadim</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Fonda_af12.html" title="Peter Fonda">Peter Fonda</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Curtis_67e1.html" title="Tony Curtis">Tony Curtis</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Beatty_c7a4.html" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Sinatra_0b21.html" title="Nancy Sinatra">Nancy Sinatra</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Sarne_4a66.html" title="Michael Sarne">Michael Sarne</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Phillips_3205.html" title="Michelle Phillips">Michelle Phillips</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Phillips_%28musician%29_0469.html" title="John Phillips (musician)">John Phillips</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cass_Elliot_07d5.html" title="Cass Elliot">Cass Elliot</a>, attended. The next day, Polanski left for <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> to begin work on a new film.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Folger's work as a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_worker.html" title="Social worker">social worker</a> soon began to take a toll on her and she became depressed. Adding to her depression was the knowledge that the children that she worked with in the poor areas of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, such as <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watts%2C_Los_Angeles%2C_California_8eb3.html" title="Watts, Los Angeles, California">Watts</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacoima%2C_Los_Angeles%2C_California_352d.html" title="Pacoima, Los Angeles, California">Pacoima</a>, were deprived. She would later admit that the suffering affected her deeply. Around this time, Abigail bought herself a <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalmatian_%28dog%29.html" title="Dalmatian (dog)">Dalmatian</a> puppy, which she named Tom.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_23.html" title="March 23">March 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, an odd incident occurred at <a href="../../../1/0/0/10050_Cielo_Drive_063f.html" title="10050 Cielo Drive">10050 Cielo Drive</a>. That afternoon, Abigail and Wojciech went over to the Polanskis home for a going away dinner party for Tate, who was leaving for <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> the next day. Sebring was there, as well as Tate's friend, Shahrokh Hatami, an <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iranian</a> <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photographer.html" title="Photographer">photographer</a>. Rudi Altobelli, the owner of the Cielo home, had attended the party briefly, but soon returned to his guest house to pack for his upcoming trip to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The incident involved a strange looking man who had appeared on the property as the occupants of the house sat in the dining room, which faced the front of the residence. Hatami felt uneasy about this stranger roaming the Polanski estate, looking at people he did not know, so he left the house to confront the man. From the front porch, the party inside could be seen through the large dining room windows. Hatami asked the stranger if he could help him. The stranger said he was looking for someone by the name of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Melcher_e541.html" title="Terry Melcher">Terry Melcher</a>, a name Hatami did not recognize. Hatami made it clear to the stranger that this was the Polanski residence, and suggested that perhaps the person he was looking for lived in the guest house. Later, this stranger was identified as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Manson_8fd5.html" title="Charles Manson">Charles Manson</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/i/Abigail_Folger_53b8.html" title="Edit section: Politics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>
<p>From April to May 1968, Abigail became a political volunteer for the ill-fated presidential campaign of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senator.html" title="Senator">Senator</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_F._Kennedy_5b34.html" title="Robert F. Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a>. Folger donated both time and money to the Kennedy campaign. Abigail believed strongly and shared in Kennedy's political views, so she naturally supported him. Sadly, the dream soon came to an end when Kennedy was <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_F._Kennedy_assassination_ca6b.html" title="Robert F. Kennedy assassination">assassinated</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> in early June.</p>
<p>The next year during the month of April and continuing through most of May, Abigail was a political volunteer for the campaign of <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Bradley_%28politician%29_fe60.html" title="Tom Bradley (politician)">Tom Bradley</a>, a black councilman running for mayor of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>. She contributed both her time and a large amount of her own money to the Bradley campaign. The defeat of Bradley by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Yorty_076e.html" title="Sam Yorty">Sam Yorty</a> in late May was due to a racial smear campaign, and it left Abigail feeling both bitter and disillusioned. This led her to become very involved with the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> movement that summer.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, while <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Polanski_c270.html" title="Roman Polanski">Roman Polanski</a> was away in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> filming movies, Abigail and Wojciech moved into the Polanskis' Cielo Drive home in <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedict_Canyon_f817.html" title="Benedict Canyon">Benedict Canyon</a>, at Polanski's request to take care of his wife, Sharon Tate. At the same time, their Woodstock Road home was being occupied by Wojciech's friend, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Polish</a> artist <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witold-K_0bf0.html" title="Witold-K">Witold-K</a>, who had arrived in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> the previous December. A day earlier, Abigail had quit her job as a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_worker.html" title="Social worker">social worker</a>. It was at this time that Abigail's relationship with Wojciech began to crumble. Constantly fighting, the pair began to sink lower into their world of experimental drug use.</p>
<p>In May 1969, Abigail and her mother attended the San Francisco opening of Jay Sebring's newest shop at 629 Commercial Street. Abigail enjoyed the champagne reception and found herself mingling with such guests as <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Newman_7c26.html" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanne_Woodward_0efb.html" title="Joanne Woodward">Joanne Woodward</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/r/Doris_Tate_4cae.html" title="Doris Tate">Doris Tate</a>, and her husband Paul Tate (Sharon's parents).</p>
<p>In June 1969, Abigail and her mother took a vacation together in New York.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_8.html" title="July 8">July 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, Folger and Frykowski learned that <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon_Tate_b2e9.html" title="Sharon Tate">Sharon Tate</a> would be returning to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> later that month. The couple then began to move most of their clothing from Cielo Drive back to their own home on Woodstock Road. They informed Wojciech's friend, <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witold-K_0bf0.html" title="Witold-K">Witold-K</a>, that they would be soon returning to live in their home after Tate's arrival.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_20.html" title="July 20">July 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, Tate returned to <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> from <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and asked Abigail and Wojciech to remain at <a href="../../../1/0/0/10050_Cielo_Drive_063f.html" title="10050 Cielo Drive">10050 Cielo Drive</a> with her until her husband <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Polanski_c270.html" title="Roman Polanski">Roman Polanski</a> arrived on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_12.html" title="August 12">August 12</a>. Abigail, Wojciech, Sharon and Jay, along with Tate's parents and two younger sisters, all watched the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">moon</a> landing on <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> film director <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Sarne_4a66.html" title="Michael Sarne">Michael Sarne</a> invited Folger, Frykowski and Tate over for a dinner party at his rented <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malibu%2C_California_1c5a.html" title="Malibu, California">Malibu</a> beach house. After dessert had been served, Tate began to feel unwell, so it was decided that Folger and Frykowski would drive her home.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/i/Abigail_Folger_53b8.html" title="Edit section: Death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
<p>On Friday morning, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">August 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, Abigail and Wojciech ran some errands together. Folger purchased a yellow, lightweight bicycle around 2 p.m. from a shop on <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Monica_Boulevard_886f.html" title="Santa Monica Boulevard">Santa Monica Boulevard</a> and arranged for it to be delivered to Cielo Drive later that afternoon. She and Wojciech then drove back to the Polanskis home and had a late lunch with Tate and her friends, <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanna_Pettet_ccb5.html" title="Joanna Pettet">Joanna Pettet</a> and Barbara Lewis, on the front lawn patio. The late lunch was served to the party of five by Winifred Chapman, the Polanskis housekeeper. Shortly after, at around 3:45 p.m., Abigail left Cielo Drive in her 1968 yellow <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontiac_Firebird_5732.html" title="Pontiac Firebird">Pontiac Firebird</a> in order to keep an appointment she had later that afternoon. Frykowski left minutes later, in Tate's rented 1969 red <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevrolet_Camaro_6be0.html" title="Chevrolet Camaro">Camaro</a>, to unload a box at the couple's Woodstock Road home.</p>
<p>That evening, just after 9 p.m., Abigail, Wojciech, <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Sebring_f6ff.html" title="Jay Sebring">Jay Sebring</a>, and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon_Tate_b2e9.html" title="Sharon Tate">Sharon Tate</a> went out to a <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_cuisine.html" title="Mexican cuisine">Mexican</a> restaurant called El Coyote. Returning home, Wojciech fell asleep on the couch while Abigail was in her room reading. Abigail's mother called her at 10 p.m. that night to verify their weekend plans. Abigail was scheduled to fly to San Francisco at 10 a.m. Saturday morning on <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Airlines_e78f.html" title="United Airlines">United Airlines</a> in order to celebrate her birthday on the <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_11.html" title="August 11">11th</a>. Her mother Inez would join her later, as she was coming in from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> after spending time with some of her friends.</p>
<p>Followers of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Manson_8fd5.html" title="Charles Manson">Charles Manson</a> broke into the house in the early morning hours of Saturday, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_9.html" title="August 9">August 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>. When one of them (<a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Atkins_c4fc.html" title="Susan Atkins">Susan Atkins</a>) passed her bedroom door, Abigail, believing the woman was a friend of the Polanskis, waved and smiled to the intruder. When the occupants of the house were assembled in the living room, their captors asked if any of them had any money. Abigail responded that she did and was led to her bedroom to empty her purse. On returning to the living room, the four friends were tied together. After being stabbed and struggling with the murderers, she managed to escape the house only to be overcome on the lawn outside by <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patricia_Krenwinkel_7661.html" title="Patricia Krenwinkel">Patricia Krenwinkel</a>. She was stabbed twenty-eight times and died from a stab wound to the <a href="../../../a/o/r/Aorta.html" title="Aorta">aorta</a>. Allegedly, Folger's dying words were, "You can stop now; I'm already dead." Although coroners found a large amount of the drug <a href="../../../3/%2C/4/3%2C4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine_fd9a.html" title="3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine">MDA</a> in her system, they reached the conclusion that she was fully aware of what was happening when the attack occurred.</p>
<p>Abigail Folger's body was returned to <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a> and taken to Crippen and Flynn Mortuary in <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redwood_City%2C_California_0d09.html" title="Redwood City, California">Redwood City</a>. Her funeral was held on the morning of Wednesday, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">August 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, at Our Lady of the Wayside Church in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portola_Valley%2C_California_fb93.html" title="Portola Valley, California">Portola Valley</a>, a church that had been built by her grandparents, the Mejias, in 1912. Following a Catholic requiem mass, Abigail Folger was entombed inside the Main Mausoleum at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Cross_Cemetery%2C_Colma_e1b0.html" title="Holy Cross Cemetery, Colma">Holy Cross Cemetery</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colma%2C_California_d907.html" title="Colma, California">Colma, California</a>.</p>
<p>After her death, investigators reported that Folger's estate was worth $530,000. She left no <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_%28law%29.html" title="Will (law)">will</a>.</p>
