<p>Further reference/paragraphs needed to explain detailed history and development of Daylight Saving Time - <i>especially</i> "Double Summertime" as used in Spain, France and the Canary Islands in Summer - <i>unique</i> to most countries in its magnitude; there, also, the Winter clocktime arrangement is more than the usual "summertime" for <i>most</i> of Spain and Western France!.</p>

</pre>
<p>Another set of very relevant information concerns Spain, in that the <b>"Comision Nacional"</b> mentioned at the foot of the current page here, is concerned with working hour conditions for both schoolchildren and workers, which <i>should be</i> strongly influenced by the powerful Sun there. See my <i>/DRAFT5</i>.</p>

          <i><b>FURTHER NATIONAL CONTROL OF CLOCKTIMES within International Time Zones.</b></i>
</pre>
<p><br />
The <i><b>clocktime</b></i> in many countries became a matter for legal definition when the old sundials and sunclocks became too inaccurate compared to the clockmakers craft. It also became very obvious with the advent of the electric telegraph and the telephone that those sunclock times varied too much over the extent of a given country and its neighbouring countries at any given time. Indeed, problems would have been apparent for the early railways encountering various sunclock times, not only concerning inconvenience for passengers missing trains, but also for safety concerns. Much later came the problems of formulating international agreements concerning neighbouring clocktimes, firstly with regard to railway timetables and safety across borders.</p>
<p><br />
1.1 Who has the Right Time?</p>
<p><br />
Fortunately for the astronomers who came to the rescue, they already had experience with concerns much earlier on the general subject. Prime movers here appeared to be Great Britain (Greenwich Observatory), France (the French Paris Academy) and Spain (Capitan Jorge JuanÂ´s Marines Observatory at Cadiz and San Fernando). Because of its extensive efforts, its success in promoting its work via a worldwide Empire, and its encouragement (although grudgingly) to clockmakers to design chronometers to work accurately at sea, Greenwich Observatory finally manipulated the baton. <i>However, France (and similarly Spain) maintained a view of their own for an appreciable period.</i></p>
<p>Initially, of course, each country had tended to centre its legal time somewhere in relation to its own territory. Paris maintained that its time was supreme, and had the prestige to help uphold that claim. Spain would obviously have paid attention to the <i>Marines Observatory in San Fernando.</i> Meanwhile, Greenwich would be boastful of its nautical success worldwide. However, until electrical communications became widespread, especially assisted by the boom in the growing railway systems (as emphasised with the occurrence of the famous "Railway Shares", Ref.: slightly satirised by Lewis Carroll in "The Walrus &amp; The Carpenter"), it was difficult for rural areas anywhere to be much concerned about time other than that of the sunclock! Visiting stage coaches and post chaises would arrive with a differing time, but that is not likely to have influenced the local farming communities very much! International conferences would later produce strict agreements between countries - Belgium claims to have honoured the agreement before other nations.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Spain</i>, in particular, has appeared to have gone through a particularly heavy schedule of changes compared to some in the arrangements for its clocktime over perhaps some 200 years. Initially it was likely that the first "battle" with the widespread, variable sunclock came as time observed as <i>centred on San Fernando</i> itself, at just more than 6 degrees West of Greenwich. That has a navigational longitude time difference of about + 25 minutes later compared to the Greenwich Meridian Time (based on the longitude passing through Castellon on the East Coast of Spain). But, <i>since France</i> finally adopted as its Winter time standard Greenwich Meridian Time PLUS ONE HOUR ( That is the meridian location at 15 degrees East of Greenwich - near Naples and the current German/Polish Border - Frankfurt am Oder) <i><b>and Spain followed</b></i> with exactly that too, an extreme mean difference between San Fernando and Naples then became ONE HOUR and 25 minutes! (That was corresponding to a mean difference between Greenwich and Naples of ONE HOUR plus the 25 minutes previously mentioned above for San Fernando).</p>
<p><br />
With that choice, both France and Spain automatically came into the sphere of the usually defined <i>"Summertime"</i> national time setting on their clocks <i>throughout the year</i>.(That "summertime" being continuous in operation meant that the time was introduced as a "one off" imposition on the public - <i>not the yearly time changes</i> experienced these days!). The result of that setting in other countries in Europe and elsewhere does not produce a "summertime" effect because they are in the appropriate geographical setting for that adopted "Solar Time" approximation. (i.e. Germany, Austria, Italy, etc. have that time in Winter, being not far from the "Naples" Meridian Longitude of 15 Degrees East of Greenwich, whereas mid-Spain is about 5 Degrees West and N-W Spain is 9 degrees West of Greenwich).</p>
<p><br />
Not content with this situation, France, followed by Spain in '<b>1918'</b>, adopted an EXTRA summertime criterion for its clocktime during the Summer only. While for France this <i>"Double Summertime"</i> imposition of TWO HOURS in advance put its time meridian at 30 degrees East of Greenwich, at the meridian longitude of Istanbul, Turkey , Spain was pushed into a mean difference of of TWO HOURS and 25 minutes (between San Fernando and that meridian) - thus to <i><b>more than</b></i> "<i>Double Summertime</i>" conditions for <i>most</i> of Spain!</p>
<p><br />
1.2 == <i>The Equation of Time</i> ==</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>During <i>Summer</i>, the "<i>Equation of Time</i>" ensures an even greater difference between the official Time Zone based on atomic clocks and the true, local, Solar Time at any given place. Thus in Galicia, extreme NW Spain, "Triple Summertime" can result, depending on the value of the Equation of Time, since Vigo is about 9 degrees West of Greenwich, or 39 degrees West of the "Solar Time" meridian of Istanbul, and so in some years must be added the effect of about 16 minutes of the Equation of Time! That means another 4 degrees West effectively, to a total of effectively 43 degrees West of Istanbul!</p>
<p>It has to be concluded that Spain can only show the approximate True Solar Time on its clocks that is <i>relevant to</i>:-</p>
<p>a) in Winter, the longitude of Naples and the German / Polish Border, ONE HOUR from Castellon</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>b) in Summer, the longitude of Kiev and Istanbul, Turkey, TWO HOURS from Castellon.</p>
<p><br />
These requirements not only produce late, light evenings (and late noon times, or <i>culmination</i>), but also VERY late morning sunrise times at all times of the year, compared to all areas in the Mediterranean and PORTUGAL, other than nearby France. Note that Portugal does not share the "<i>Hora Oficial Peninsular</i>" as the Spanish clocktime is sometimes defined, using clocktimes at one hour less.</p>
<p><br />
2.0 <i>== What are the Likely Consequences of "DOUBLE SUMMERTIME</i> ==</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The massive imposition of a number of time additions in Spain, all single ( each in separate years, <i>until 1918</i>), can only have cause for some effect on a largely rural society, still awaiting any significant growth in commerce and industry. It is true that a relatively few affected workers were induced to awaken and start work earlier on the <i>same former clocktimes</i> when the changes were made, but the major population was to undergo strange procedures because of the following factors:</p>
<p><br />
a) At the time of the <i>Equinoxes</i>, for which the facts are well known, the time of sunrise in, say, CADIZ had to change from about 6:00 am on the sunclocks (1840), to a clocktime of <i>8:20 am by September, 1918</i>! This caused an artificially induced later darkness in the mornings <i>greater than</i> two hours for most of Spain and the West of France.</p>
<p><br />
b) The mid-Winter sunrise time in CADIZ (1840), had to be fixed at about 7:14 am because of the latitude dependency of Solar Time around the World. The mid-Winter time in Cadiz nowadays is <i>much later</i> than elsewhere in the Mediterranean and PORTUGAL at about 8:39 am on the clocks. (Note that in the "Toe of Italy" the clocks then show a Solar Time approx. of 7:14 am!).</p>
<p><br />
c) In CADIZ in mid-Summer (1840), the sunrise similarly was fixed at about 4:50 am, seemingly being <i>far too early</i> for the farm workers to be awakened. However, in these days that same sunrise must be about 7:10 am on the workersÂ´ alarm clocks, and not in fact changed in any real sense!</p>
<p><br />
2.1 <i>What were the Consequences to the Living Style</i> (Spain in particular)?</p>
<p><br />
Perhaps surprisingly, very little could have been observed to happen at each major clock change that we have been discussing up to the end of 1918, although there was an overall effect. <i>According to the clocks</i>, the evenings apparently became longer. From the known result today, it has to be concluded that in the period after a change, the population largely regarded the new Church Bell chimes as <i><b>nonsense</b></i>.</p>
<p><br />
What they responded to was <i>the SUN</i>; since they would break for <i>Siesta</i> when the Sun was at culmination, or <i>later than</i> the previous 12:00 oÂ´clock (necessarily the midday for the Sunclock); they would awaken preferably later than the traditional, rural, Spring/Autumn time of 6:00 am by the Sun, since it now <i>rose later</i> in the morning; they would have their <i>evening meal</i> just as originally, AFTER sunset, which meant <i>much later</i> on the new clock times. Gradually they would "accept" the new clock times as convenient, but only until the <i>next new time change</i> was imposed some years later!</p>
<p><br />
It is salutory to note that even <i>OFFICIALS</i> disregarded the requirement, if such was intended, to continue to have their evening meals at the customary time (that can only have been about after sunset at 7:30 pm in Cadiz on the "Solar Time", since in Winter that time was about 3 hours after sunset!). Instead, they waited in Summer until the new later time on the clocks, subsequently these days being about 9:30 pm, continuing to use approximately the same times during the dark Winter evenings!</p>
<p><br />
Because of the <i>antipathetic response</i> of the majority, the overall result was that just described, virtually all activities for all except early wakers (such as workers, commuters and schoolchildren), especially for the rest of the day, have nowadays been delayed by TWO HOURS in the East of Spain or by TWO HOURS and a HALF in the West! This unusual situation is <i>very noticeable to visitors</i> to Spain, who are unlikely to understand that situation, and are observed to wait spiritlessly around the restaurants for a considerable time before all mealtimes!</p>
<p><br />
It should be understood that the way in which the clock change was ignored on those "one off year" occasions, sometimes many years apart, was quite different to the way everyone now ignores the <i>seasonal one hour</i> clock adjustments. It is clear that activities occurring at particular times on each side of the clock changes, do so at the same time on the clock, although in fact the effect in Summer is as the Government wants. In the past, the population as a whole just rejected the clock indications, only those who were obliged to be at a workplace obeyed that particular time indication, the rest of the day followed the Sun as of necessity, resulting in activities occurring later on the new clock times! (As above, the evening meal occurs later, at say, 21:30, not at 19:30 - the sunset Solar Time in Summer for Spain as a whole).</p>
<p><br />
Does the imposed basic time in Spain have any good effect overall. The most likely response of an observer is '<b>"NO"'</b>, because only a moderate <i><b>summertime / "Solar Time"-wintertime</b></i> has any <i><b>Energy-Saving Daylight Hours</b></i> benefit at the latitude of Spain**. WHY? Because the <i><b>current always basic summertime</b></i> during the year on the clocktime means, that for the whole of Spain and the West of France, there is far too much darkness in the mornings, when too many people are having to be very active, require much lighting on the busy, dark roads for far too many days in the year! It should be noticed particularly that, free from the <i>Hora Oficial Peninsular</i>, at one hour difference at all times from Spain, PORTUGAL does not suffer from the problems that a "Comision Nacional" of the <i><b>Fundacion Independiente</b></i> in Madrid, "En Hora" (2002 - ), has informed us "DO OCCUR IN SPAIN!"</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Detailed references make the point clear concerning "Summertime" and Lower Latitudes, the change in daylight lengths being too small. The statement here is very applicable to higher latitudes (such as for Spain) when considering Double Summertime PLUS.</li>

                 <i><b>My activity on this subject:</b></i>
</pre>
<p><br />
A) Circulate advisory notes each month concerning the actual conditions in Cadiz on Clocktime.</p>
<p><br />
Also Sent the following:</p>
<p><br />
B) Submitted a "report" to the <i>Comision Nacional</i> in Madrid outlining the effects of the clocktime on the Spanish population (Jan 19, 2006)</p>
<p><br />
C) Information sent to <i>Social Science Faculties</i> in Spanish Universities, (Carlos III Madrid (Getafe) and Cadiz University (Jerez), SEPT. 2006:-</p>
<p><br />
An explanation, using as basis my Submission to the Spanish <i>National Commission</i> (En Hora) in January, 2006, plus main reference to the article by Sra. Isabel Ibanez, in the English-language newspaper (Malaga, Spain) âSUR in Englishâ, July, 2005, entitled âGoodbye Siestaâ. Content follows:-</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
     (<i>Subject:  Social Scientists in Spain can encounter Problems with Time</i>!).
</pre>
<p><br />
Firstly explained basic qualifications enabling me to address the problems. Stated the basic International Time Zone applicable to Spain, plus the additions of âSummertimeâ during Winter and âDouble Summertimeâ during Summer, as described above.</p>
<p><br />
Explained:</p>
<p>a) that those two impositions of the Spanish Clocktime were effective both in 1918 and repeated in 1974, the first for 16 years, and the latter to the present day.</p>
<p><br />
b) that in Summer, the effect is to <i>skew the clocktime throughout the 24 hours by two hours</i> in advance of the true, mean Solar Time.</p>
<p><br />
c) that it had to cause the activities of the population during day and night NOT to be delayed to unusually late times, as perceived in the article.</p>
<p><br />
d) that it meant that Social Scientists are obliged to state all times for any activities, day and night, <i>TWO hours earlier</i> than shown on the Spanish clocks.</p>
<p>Emphasised the role of the <i>powerful Sun</i> in Spain in conditioning the operation of daytime activities and the absence of that role in most mornings in Spain during the commuting time period (compared to Portugal, for example). Such "Solar conditioning" had been experienced in Spain for millenia.</p>
<p><br />
Also emphasised my perception that not enough personnel in Spain were familiar with the effects of the true, mean Solar Time on working conditions and other mentioned, related tasks.</p>
<p><br />
An article in the local Spanish <i>newspaper "Viva-Cadiz"</i> on the 22nd June 2006 (the <i>Solstice</i>) was criticised heavily, and copied both the article and criticism to:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
     Director, Royal Institute and Marines Observatory, San Fernando.
     The President, National Commission "En Hora" Spain, Hotel Intercontinental Castellana      
</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
   ==<b>SUBJECT:    IS  SPAIN  REALLY  CAUGHT  ON  THE  HOP ?</b>==
</pre>
<p><br />
A long, quite detailed article for its type was probably âsyndicated within Spain, and appeared in the local âVIVA-CADIZ tabloid on 22 June, 2006. It quoted details about 8 or 9 different clock times, generally for the summer in Spain, in a discussion about the celebration of the <i>Summer Solstice</i> on 22 June, 2006.</p>
<p><br />
For such a prominent page article, it surprisingly stated that the subject was not much of interest in Spain! There is a lack of finesse in the presentation and any Statistics Analyst should be greatly concerned about the status of the data shown on that page!</p>
<p><br />
The problem with the article is that its basic definitions in three places on the page lack a base datum and are too vague. A summary box near the beginning, and its associated paragraph at the end of the article are both lacking in essential detail. It is true, that in the centre of the article it is stated that the Spanish Clocktime, whether for winter or summer it is not quite clear, is on the <i>HOP (Hora Oficial Peninsular),</i> or "official peninsula time," and it will be shown that there is some relief in the situation with that. However, in the way that it is stated, this article violated the tenets required for any analysis of a formal nature, since the <i>HOP</i> was itself <i>not properly defined</i> there - and it rarely ever is! Much more detail should be provided in two sentences for both Winter and Summer.</p>
<p><br />
However, the Spanish Government mollifies this situation quite often on other occasions, with the information that the <i>HOP</i> keeps Spain, in business and commerce for instance, in step with the other countries in the âOldâ European Union (here must be excluded the British Isles and Portugal on Greenwich Meridian Time bases). Such statements reveal that throughout the year all the clocks in the Old European Union show the same time as the clocks in Spain. Thus Spain sees the time for France (always the leading example in history of the clocktime in Spain), Germany, Denmark, the Low Countries, Italy, even Switzerland and a few others. The strangest fact is that, try as I might in investigating each of these countries in this matter, all of them seem to fail to indicate that they are on the <i>HOP</i>! - and that holds for both Winter and Summer! They apparently, in common with vast numbers of other countries, prefer to state their clocktimes on the internationally agreed <i>Time Zone Standard</i> at the appropriate place in the World. That means that in language commensurate with the Standard, the named countries state that this Time Zone is that of <i>Central European Time</i> (CET), or in summer, <i>Central European Summer Time</i> (CEST = EET Solar Time). Perhaps this means that on <i>Fiesta Days</i>, Spain can deem itself to be in Central Europe - at least in spirit?</p>
<p><br />
(Central European Time is properly defined in Winter as the true mean Solar â sunclock â time at the Greenwich Meridian PLUS one hour â which base is appropriately for Spain at the location of Castellon on the East Coast, but making the actual time meridian occur in, for example, Naples in Italy, being one hour distant from Castellon. This basic fact, if stated in the article would have made a higher grade of information â but the relationship between the other two paragraphs and that of the <i>HOP</i> would also need to be clarified to improve the standard of the article).</p>
<p><br />
What is more important is that the President of a <b>Spanish National Commission</b> sitting in Madrid since 2002 (âEn Horaâ) has revealed on RTVE 1 News that Spain is indeed caught on the <i>HOP</i> in a number of ways! - Such problems, it can be shown quite easily, are absent for the major part of a year in, for example, both Portugal and Italy (the latter setting at similar latitudes to Spain!) - the clocktimes in those countries differ from each other, but Italy has the <i>same clocktime as Spain</i>! - and is in the clear, because it suits! One chief group of problems for schoolchildren, workers and particularly morning commuter drivers means that they are caught on the HOP because the <i>HOP</i> causes the sunrise to be <i>artificially VERY late</i> in the morning, virtually all the year round, so that many of them are too much in the dark <i>well before</i> sunrise. Exactly that same condition in the mornings means that <i>Daylight âEnergy Savingâ</i> is also on the <i>HOP</i>, because of the great activity all over Spain in the dark hours of the morning - even for most of the year! It is found necessary to illuminate the roads especially to aid driving in the wee hours (and the <i>HOP</i> really does make them the wee hours!).</p>
<p><br />
I found the article to be itself caught on the <i>HOP</i>. The paragraph detailling the longest day of the year in Madrid, although supposedly derived from the Madrid byeline, falls short, because the sunset time quoted for Madrid that day was impossible â simply because <i>21.48</i> on the clocks was the sunset time for CADIZ! Only somewhat nearer the Equinoxes can those times be the same! My own estimate, assuming that the quoted <i>06.44</i> was the correct sunrise time (probably right) is that the sunset time in Madrid must have been about <i>22.07</i>!</p>
<p><br />
<i>Why this article?</i> - detailling so much that the population is deemed not to be very interested in â compared to the Equinoxes? I think the newspapers publish such filler to bolster the impression that the Spanish Clocktime is thriving and well! The article falls into the category of statements in newspapers made at the time of the Equinoxes, in which it is stated that Spain was first <i>HOP-conscious</i> in <i>1974</i>! That is not so â Spain first started with a change to summertime of one hour on the clocktime all the year round, with no special wintertime â I have to estimate it was in 1880 +/- 20, since I haven't seen the date on the official website of the Marines Royal Observatory, San Fernando! Later, Spain followed France (again) in 1918, by introducing the âDouble Summertimeâ of 2 hours on the clocktime in Summer, with a âSummertimeâ of an extra hour in Winter.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Didn't the Spanish population just love that?</i> No! - they chose to keep to the old <i>Sun-driven</i> times â just as they do in a fantastic, mysterious way today â they appear to use the clock just two hours later during the day and evening than usual for other nationalities â in that way they maintain the old traditional <i>Sun-operated timing</i> going back for thousands of years!</p>
<p><br />
Incidentally, readers can easily verify the â<i>HOP deviation</i>â daily from the Weather Maps in the local Spanish newspapers by looking at the top of the map for the sunrise and sunset times <b>*</b>. It could be a secret that midway between those two times is the middle of the day â a time which the Director of the Marines Royal Observatory, in common with other astronomers, calls the â<i>Culmination of the Sun</i>â - which to most people means âHigh Noonâ. A final example of the shambles in the article is the reference to the Observatorio Nacional - because, for 250 years it has been the responsibility of the Royal Institute &amp; Marines Observatory to administer the Government policy of the <i>HOP</i> to the nation!</p>
<p><br />
William E. G. Plumtree, July 3, 2006.</p>
<p><br />
<b>*</b> On January 20, 2007, the local Cadiz, Spain newspapers showed the dawn clock time as 8:35 am (just less than the more constant 8:38am since Christmas!) plus a sunset time of 18:35, giving a daylight length of 10 hours 0 minutes and a midday time of 13:35 (HOP hours!) on the Spanish clocks! The â<i>HOP-deviation</i>â for Cadiz was thus one hour 35 minutes added to the true mean Solar Time in Castellon in Winter time! In addition, that â<i>Hop-deviation</i>â, or similarly, the â<i>Equation of Time</i>â had been increasing rapidly during the same period.( One hour and 37 minutes on the 29th Jan). That data leads me to forecast the time for the First Day of Spring in the Mediterranean as 17th/18th March, 2007 with sunrise/sunset times in <i>Cadiz</i> around 07:33 and 19:33 (CET). The correct day will become more apparent closer to the time. ( For London, I would have to estimate the <i>15th to 16th March</i>, 2007 with times around 06:10 and 18:09 (UTC) - the two times cannot necessarily always be exactly the same on the clocks!)</p>
<p><br />
<i>Solely preparation for the First Day of Spring 2007!:</i></p>
<p>The following are merely <i>ESTIMATES</i>, they are not based on any official records! The dates are conjectural!</p>
