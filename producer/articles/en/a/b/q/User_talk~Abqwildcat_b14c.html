<p>I was surprised by your addition to HGH quackery. I have been expanding the <a href="../../../g/r/o/Growth_hormone_treatment.html" title="Growth hormone treatment">growth hormone treatment</a> article for the last couple of weeks. It was getting too big and I put the HGH quackery article up in preparation for moving stuff there and filling it out. I didn't expect anyone to notice or mess with it. Nothing wrong with what's there. I'll be adding more in. I think it's a perfectly NPOV title myself.<a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">Alteripse</a> 19:47, 16 May 2004 (UTC) At long last, I filled out the article.

<p>I'm sorry if my editing comment offended you, as it was just meant to be a brief, shorthand comment. I did not intend to put down anyone in any way. Thank you for notifying me about it, however, and i will try to fix my way of editing in the future. --Thirteen 13 22:57, 17 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>You seem to have some wicked timing. I just put the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serializing_tokens.html" title="Serializing tokens">Serializing tokens</a> page up and was just posting quite a bit more when your stub msg completeely borked it! I guess that the wikipedia needs to work on it's own serialization methods wouldn't you say?</p>

<p>Not like it matters apparently! Another user has done a fantastic job of providing information that I'd have fumbled for a week to find the words for! Once pages get noticed, things seem to get fixed up pretty quickly around here. Thanks alot for the pointers BTW. I am still fairly new to this.</p>

<p>I put <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_O%27Reilly_Factor_e2b2.html" title="The O'Reilly Factor">The O'Reilly Factor</a></i> in the category for two reasons. The first and more important one was practical -- to try to get any O'Reilly partisans involved in the debate at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category_talk%7EPropaganda_a3a6.html" title="Category talk:Propaganda">Category talk:Propaganda</a>, because the discussion there might result in the tag being legitimzed for this article, so they should participate. The second was that, <i>if</i> Michael Moore is considered to be a propagandist, then so is O'Reilly. To answer your question, however, my preference is that the inflammatory category Propaganda should not include Moore, should not include O' Reilly, should not include their works, and should not include similar subjects (Rush Limbaugh, Al Franken, Ann Coulter, etc.). One can make a colorable case for including all these people, and many more, in the category, but I think it would be better to exclude them all. Nevertheless, I would certainly oppose a "solution" in which polemicists of the left are included in Propaganda while polemicists of the right are not. If there's a reason to identify such people, maybe Category:Polemics should be established. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 06:25, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Abqwildcat you need to stop revrting the page, all other University on Wikipedia has the Notable Alumni as a list, See University of California(s), The Ivy Leagues. Infact it would be hard to find a handful that doesn't do it. It's obviously the standards. I know you put a lot of hard work into this page, but you have to yeal to standards. If you feel your way should be the standards, please bring it up in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Universities_a389.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Universities">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Universities</a>. Regarding Orginization, that is standardized based on the link i mention above. U of A is a university first and formost, the orginization information is more important than the mesuem and future plans. If anything those two topic should come at the end of the artical. When people look for the U of A they want to know about the university not the mesuem. If the mesuem has such importance it should have it's sperate page. Please understand that these are standards preset and inplace at almost all university pages. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsiananimal_11a9.html" title="User:Asiananimal">Asian Animal</a> 18:57, Nov 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Show me the standards in writing. Do they say alumni should be only listed. No. Do they describe EXACTLY how to lay out a page? No. Are they even standards? NO. They're guidelines. Democracy gets better results than reversions and arbitrary deletion of organization. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 22:10, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nice way of rewording the Kodak part. I did not even think about re-wording it. I was just recently out there for the Fiesta because I am a balloon pilot. I was my first time and I think it's wonderful place. BTW, since you are from ABQ have you been to or heard of Sky City, New Mexico. It's an Acoma Indian Res. about 60 miles out from the city. I was wondering because I noticed that there wasn't anything on Wikipedia yet about it or the Acoma people.

<dd>We CAN talk, but there are limits on good behavior and ettiquette here on Wikipedia. You know that, and must have had some qualms about messenging 2000 members of the community. This would have been well suited for a discussion page rather than 2000 individual comments. I would have objected less to a short comment + link to the page where you discuss it. The length is an issue separate from my disagreement with multiple licenses. It's annoying and bad form to do what you have - which is not exactly winning over converts if it's your desire to multiply-license wikipedia material. I'd say I'm diametrically opposed to such a plan - the problems far outweigh any benefit you perceive. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 01:02, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>In the interests of peace, I should probably mention that my previous bad mood was at least partially due to lack of sleep, excess caffeine, and a final exam schedule from hell. I'm opposed to dual licensing unless Jimbo and the foundation move the whole kit 'n' kaboodle over (which sounds problematic, also). Hopefully this raises awareness and can actually lead to a definitive policy rather than this divisive and problematic initiative. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 23:56, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The initiative is not meant to be devisive, although some people find it to be so. I personally discussed the issue with Jimbo at the WikiMeet in NYC in order to clarify his stance on the issue. It is quite clear that he is working hard to get a GFDL 2.0 that is "more free" and closer in spirit to the CC-by-sa, which he would have probably used had it been around when Wikipedia was founded. Since we are stuck with GFDL, the best step is to try to reform it. This is not incompatible with my initiative, as my goal has always been to hope for an improved GFDL 2.0. He supports my drive to have users give permission under the CC-by-sa so our articles can be freely shared and acknowledges an inherent contradiction: copyleft is supposed to allow for free sharing for everyone, but in the end it only allows free sharing to those who use the GFDL, not all open/free licenses. In any respect, we won't be relicensing Wikipedia. Try to separate (1) the issues with Wikipedia and the GFDL from (2) the fact that other projects don't use the GFDL. Please let me know on my talk page if you have any other questions. Sorry about the spam. I have been taking in the advice and don't plan on continuing the spamming process as I was. If I do start asking people, I will probably give them a single paragraph that asks them to look at a separate page with information and explanation. Hopefully that will work better. Amazingly, converts have been won anyway. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man"></a> – <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> <sup>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">comment</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk</a>)</sup>[[]] 01:39, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, AW, the issue of the Pima names for Tucson and Mesa (and where in the article they would go) was discussed at length on their talk pages, and the consensus was clear. The anon editor who now keeps trying to put the Pima back in up top is <a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">User:Node_ue</a>, a home-schooled pre-teen in Paradise Valley who was part of those discussions, but is now having a little trouble accepting that the decision went against his position.

<p>ABQCat,</p>
<p>Thanks for informing me about that. I had had trouble finding the copyright information page before. Also though, considering this new information you have given me, it would probably be best for you look at the other images I have uploaded to this site and consider taking some of if not all of them out, as I obtained them about the same way not knowing of how this rule works. However, I can assure you I will be more careful from now on and only post pictures that I personally have taken! As for whether or not I could post a similar picture that I take, I don't think it will be possible in this situation, as I am not LDS and thus do not have a copy of the Book of Mormon or a Mormon edition of the Bible. However, if you want me to post some pictures of Southern Baptist images I'm sure I could come up with plenty of those! I just enjoy talking and learning about different religions and thus was adding the little bit that I could to the Mormon pages. Anyway, if you need any help with the pictures I have posted that I shouldn't have, I will try to help you locate them for deletion. Thanks for the information!</p>

<p>You said: <i>Yeah, I noticed Acoma was pointing to the wrong place too, but forgot to change it. I'm curious - were most pages which referred to Acoma referring to the Pueblo itself, or were nearby villages included in the link context? I ask because according to what I have read, about 50 people live in the Pueblo proper, but nearly 3000 people live on the federal trust land surrounding the pueblo. I'm considering creating the article for Acoma Pueblo, but if you feel strongly and would like to, I found quite good information from Encyclopedia Britannica (subscription only), New Mexico Magazine (www.nmmagazine.com/NMGUIDE/acoma.html), and the US Census Bureau (<a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/AdvGeoSearchByPlacenameServlet?_command=getResults&amp;_keyword=Acoma&amp;_programYear=50&amp;_geoAreaType=ALL&amp;_treeId=420&amp;_currentGeoAreaType=ALL&amp;_geoIdsHierarchy=&amp;_geos=&amp;_placename=25100US0010999&amp;_geoBucketId=50&amp;_lang=en" class="external text" title="http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/AdvGeoSearchByPlacenameServlet?_command=getResults&amp;_keyword=Acoma&amp;_programYear=50&amp;_geoAreaType=ALL&amp;_treeId=420&amp;_currentGeoAreaType=ALL&amp;_geoIdsHierarchy=&amp;_geos=&amp;_placename=25100US0010999&amp;_geoBucketId=50&amp;_lang=en" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</i></p>

<dd>I noticed the problem because I was going to put a satellite photo of the mesa on the Acoma Pueblo page (which doesn't exist). It looked like most or all of the links were talking about the pueblo, not about the surrounding land (and <i><b>definitely not</b></i> about the city in MN). You can start a page if you want to; I'm not particularly good at encyclopedic writing.

<p>Thank you for your note on yesterday's addition to the <a href="../../../h/o/h/Hohokam.html" title="Hohokam">Hohokam</a> article -- yes, I put the same material on the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anasazi.html" title="Anasazi">Anasazi</a> and the <a href="../../../m/o/g/Mogollon.html" title="Mogollon">Mogollon</a> pages as well. I have considered a Southwestern Peoples page, but that would be a really big project. I suppose a page linked to archaeology called "Cultural divisions" would also be a possibility. The paragraphs are based on the source I placed at the base of the article, but only the last paragraph contains some verbatim material (see reference note). I intend to boil this down a little more (in each article) for general consumption and then beef it up for a Southwestern archaeology/peoples project (if and when).

<p>I should have been clearer. I changed the text written by the author of the section for NPOV reasons ("One of the most loathsome things for him about Soviet communism was its atheism and denial of its people's chances to know Christ" with no qualifier like "Reagan thought that..."); I shortened the quote because I didn't think the first half was very relevant.

<p>Have you ever been to Los Dos Molinos? I think they only have locations in the Phoenix Metro, but if you get a chance, definitely drop by. The location I've been to is just south of Baseline on Central, but I believe there is another location in Mesa, too. I haven't experienced better New Mexican food anywhere else (so far), even in New Mexico.</p>

<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>I just added some stuff to <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albuquerque%2C_New_Mexico_7a09.html" title="Albuquerque, New Mexico">Albuquerque,_New_Mexico</a>. I added a bunch of new <i>"notables"</i>, websites, and a nice table (w/seal, flag, map, etc.).</p>
<p>I will be adding more history and other items, but I wanted you to double check it for me.</p>
<p>I also feel like taking out the "Professional Schools" section, no other cities have that section, there is no information (page created) about them to link to. Are those schools important in the big picture?</p>

<dd>Howdy! Well, what if every city put in these schools, doesn't every city have them? Is there something special about these? What is next, beauty schools, truck driver training, driver's ed, New Horizon's? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDon_41bb.html" title="User:WikiDon">WikiDon</a></dd>

<p>I trimmed up the History on the Kirtland AFB. Please let me know if of it looks less disorganized.

<p>Howdy!</p>
<p>RE: "consistancy amongst other city articles"</p>
<p>I went and looked at 40 cities with "sister cities" entries in them. 8 out of 10 are in list format, not in paragraph form like <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">User:Derek.cashman</a> is trying to make me believe. Most of those in paragraph form have been converted by one person, <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">User:Derek.cashman</a>.</p>
<p>Read what I have put here:</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">User:Derek.cashman</a> wants to change, and thinks, that all “Sister cities” lists in articles should be converted/changed to “paragraph” form. I don’t want to. Can you imagine a lists of 26 sister cities, like for <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, and trying to read it in paragraph form?
