It was created as a result of a directive from the <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff_22e2.html" title="Joint Chiefs of Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> in early <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1999.html" title="October 1999">October 1999</a> by the chairman of the <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff_22e2.html" title="Joint Chiefs of Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Shelton_a4ad.html" title="Hugh Shelton">Hugh Shelton</a>, to develop an Information Operations Campaign Plan against transnational <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>, "specifically <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a>."</p>
<p>In one instance, the program used <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_mining.html" title="Data mining">data mining</a> techniques to associate open source information with classified information in an attempt to make associations between individual members of terrorist groups. The objective of this particular project was to ascertain whether the data mining techniques and open source material were effective tools in determining terrorist activities, and if the resultant data could be used to create operational plans that could be executed in a timely fashion to interrupt, capture and/or destroy terrorists or their cells.</p>
<p>An example of a chart produced as output by the project's data mining and visualization suite is called the <a href="http://www.peterlance.com/Peter%20Lance/3.21.00%20Link%20Chart_files/3.21.png" class="external text" title="http://www.peterlance.com/Peter%20Lance/3.21.00%20Link%20Chart_files/3.21.png" rel="nofollow">3.21.00 Chart</a> (DIAC Link Chart declassified 3.21.00, produced on March 21, 2000 and reproduced on author Peter Lance's website for his book Triple Cross). Another barely readable sample chart was published by the Defense Department's Inspector General's Office on page 14 of the <a href="http://www.milnet.com/archives/DOD-IG-Able-Danger.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.milnet.com/archives/DOD-IG-Able-Danger.pdf" rel="nofollow">Able Danger Investigation Report</a>. Patience Wait has reported that a follow-on project appears to have been funded and implemented by the Intelligence Community and was originally named Able Providence.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to statements by <a href="../../../l/t/2E/Lt._Col._Anthony_Shaffer_0888.html" title="Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer">Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer</a> and those of four others, Able Danger had identified the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attack.html" title="September 11, 2001 attack">September 11, 2001 attack</a> leader <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohamed_Atta_e746.html" title="Mohamed Atta">Mohamed Atta</a>, and three of the 9/11 plot's other 19 hijackers, as possible members of an <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Qaeda_48e2.html" title="Al Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> cell linked to the '93 <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Center_bombing_2256.html" title="World Trade Center bombing">World Trade Center bombing</a>. This theory was heavily promoted by Representative <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curt_Weldon_0195.html" title="Curt Weldon">Curt Weldon</a>, vice chairman of the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Armed_Services_Committee_83c8.html" title="House Armed Services Committee">House Armed Services</a> and House <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeland_Security_2d76.html" title="Homeland Security">Homeland Security</a> committees. In December 2006 after an investigation by the US Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that those assertions are unfounded, rejecting as untrue "one of the most disturbing claims about the Sept. 11 terrorist strikes."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reached this conclusion without, apparently, interviewing all witnesses under oath, without explaining why it chose to believe some witnesses and their testimony and not to believe others, without explaining why defense contractor JD Smith appeared to have changed his story from an August 23, 2005 Fox News report, and why it thinks Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer would have lied and made the whole thing up. The 8 page letter from the Committee to its members, now publicly available and dated December 22, 2006, generally takes a "trust me" approach. The testimony of the individual witnesses is not available to the American public.</p>
<p>An investigation by the Defense Department Inspector General's office in September 2006 had studied a related but very different claim, namely, whether the Department of Defense had unfairly and illegally targeted Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaffer because of his efforts to bring the Able Danger scandal into public light. Essentially, the DOD was investigating itself. Not surprisingly, the DOD IG concluded that the DOD had done nothing wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise because information has come to my attention over the past several months that is very disturbing.

I have also learned, Mr. Speaker, that when that recommendation was discussed within that Federal agency, the lawyers in the administration at that time said, you cannot pursue contact with the FBI against that cell. Mohamed Atta is in the U.S. on a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Permanent_Resident_Card_e4ec.html" title="United States Permanent Resident Card">green card</a>, and we are fearful of the fallout from the <a href="../../../w/a/c/Waco_Siege_817d.html" title="Waco Siege">Waco incident</a>.

<p><a href="../../../c/u/r/Curt_Weldon_0195.html" title="Curt Weldon">Curt Weldon</a>'s assertion that Able Danger identified the 9/11 hijackers was picked up by the national media in August 2005, after it was reported in the bimonthly <i>Government Security News</i>.<sup id="_ref-GSN1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GSN1" title="">[6]</a></sup> In addition to asserting that Able Danger identified the 9/11 hijackers and was prevented from passing that information onto the FBI, Weldon also alleged the intelligence concerning Able Danger was provided to the 9/11 Commission and ignored.<sup id="_ref-H5250_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H5250" title="">[7]</a></sup> Two 9/11 Commission members, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_J._Roemer_e759.html" title="Timothy J.

<p>That claim avoids the issue, however. Information on the Able Danger program had been provided to the Commission staff, not to individual Commission members.</p>
<p>Following the <i>GSN</i> report, members of the 9/11 Commission began commenting on the information they had on Able Danger and Atta. <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_H._Hamilton_f27d.html" title="Lee H. Hamilton">Lee H. Hamilton</a>, former Vice Chair of the 9/11 Commission, and Al Felzenberg, a former spokesman for the 9/11 Commission,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[8]</a></sup> both denied that the 9/11 Commission had any information on the identification of Mohammed Atta prior to the attacks.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[9]</a></sup> Hamilton told the media, "The Sept. 11 commission did not learn of any U.S. government knowledge prior to 9/11 of surveillance of Mohammed Atta or of his cell.... Had we learned of it obviously it would've been a major focus of our investigation."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_12.html" title="August 12">August 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Hamilton and former 9/11 Commission chairman <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Kean_7134.html" title="Thomas Kean">Thomas Kean</a> issued a <span class="PDFlink"><a href="http://www.9-11pdp.org/press/2005-08-12_pr.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.9-11pdp.org/press/2005-08-12_pr.pdf" rel="nofollow">statement</a></span><small><a href="../../../p/o/r/Portable_Document_Format_95a8.html" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</a>&#160;(32.1&#160;<a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibibyte.html" title="Kibibyte">KiB</a>)</small> in response to media inquiries about the Commission's investigation of the Able Danger program. They stated the Commission had been aware of the Able Danger program, and requested and obtained information about it from the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> (DoD), but none of the information provided had indicated the program had identified Atta or other 9/11 hijackers. They further stated that a claim about Atta having been identified prior to the attacks had been made to the 9/11 Commission on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_12.html" title="July 12">July 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> (just days before the Commission's report was released), by a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> officer employed at DOD, but that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interviewee had no documentary evidence and said he had only seen the document briefly some years earlier. He could not describe what information had led to this supposed Atta identification. Nor could the interviewee recall, when questioned, any details about how he thought a link to Atta could have been made by this DOD program in 2000 or any time before 9/11. The Department of Defense documents had mentioned nothing about Atta, nor had anyone come forward between September 2001 and July 2004 with any similar information. Weighing this with the information about Atta's actual activities, the negligible information available about Atta to other U.S. government agencies and the German government before 9/11, and the interviewer's assessment of the interviewee's knowledge and credibility, the Commission staff concluded that the officer's account was not sufficiently reliable to warrant revision of the report or further investigation.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was an interesting response by the Commission. Rather than take the claim seriously, they invented a phony defense that the Navy Captain needed to have documentary evidence to back up his claim. This is foolish in light of the fact that the Able Danger program was surveillance, its information was classified, and individual employees of the team were not allowed to keep classified documents for personal use. The Commission insinuates that the interviewee lacked credibility without telling us why. The Commission also demands from the witness a full explanation of how Able Danger identified Atta, and drops his claim entirely when he cannot provide it. However, the Commission should not have demanded such a complete picture at the start. In fact, the Commission's job was to fully investigate questions such as that and come up with an explanation consistent with the evidence. Given that the 911 Commission's stated purpose was to provide "the fullest possible account of the events surrounding the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001", this refusal to even pursue such a significant claim is surprising at best.</p>
<p>Congressman <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curt_Weldon_0195.html" title="Curt Weldon">Curt Weldon</a> issued a response to the 9/11 Commission <a href="http://curtweldon.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=32271" class="external text" title="http://curtweldon.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=32271" rel="nofollow">statement</a> clarifying the mission of Able Danger, expressing concern over the statements made by various members of the 9/11 Commission, and promising to push forward until it is understood why the DoD was unable to pass the information uncovered by Able Danger to the FBI, and why the 9/11 Commission failed to follow up on the information they were given on Able Danger.</p>
<p>Please note that Congressman Curt Weldon was defeated in the November, 2006 election and that as a result his website was taken down and all links to his Congressional website are now dead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 9/11 Commission has released multiple statements over the past week, each of which has significantly changed – from initially denying ever being briefed to acknowledging being briefed on both operation ABLE DANGER and Mohammed Atta. The information was omitted primarily because they found it to be suspect despite having been briefed on it two times by two different military officers on active duty. Additionally, the 9/11 Commission also received documents from the Department of Defense on ABLE DANGER.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

Shaffer, who at the time worked for the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_Intelligence_Agency_09e1.html" title="Defense Intelligence Agency">Defense Intelligence Agency</a>, claims he communicated to members of the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_Commission_ffe5.html" title="9/11 Commission">9/11 Commission</a> that Able Danger had identified two of the three cells responsible for 9/11 prior to the attacks, but the Commission did not include this information in their final report.<a href="http://www.wpherald.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20050908-112911-4218r" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wpherald.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20050908-112911-4218r" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>

<p>Congressman Weldon has asked for a new probe into the activities undertaken to silence Lt.

<p>However, Shaffer clarified that.

A fourth 9/11 terrorist came from the second cell. <a href="http://www.wpherald.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20050908-112911-4218r" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wpherald.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20050908-112911-4218r" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> Eric Umansky states the problem this way: "In fact, the two-Atta theory only leaves one major issue unexplained: What about the three other 9/11 hijackers that Able Danger purportedly fingered?

<p>When we reviewed INS records, they appeared to reflect two entries by Atta into the United States on January 10, 2001, which initially raised a question as to whether Atta had entered twice on the same day or whether a second person posing as Atta also entered on January 10, 2001. The NIIS printout for the first entry reflects that Atta entered with an admission period of January 10, 2001, to September 8, 2001 (admission number 68653985708).

<p>It should be noted that IG report is disputed by Lt. Col. Shaffer and other Able Danger team members, some of whom were never interviewed by the IG's office nor the 9/11 commission.

People who remember a meeting with a chart showing Atta are remembering the Heritage Foundation meeting or other <i>post</i> 9/11 meetings in which Weldon <i>did</i> display a chart showing Atta. <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1093694,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1093694,00.html" rel="nofollow">[28]</a></p>

<p>Kevin Drum, writing for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Washington_Monthly_8b6e.html" title="The Washington Monthly">The Washington Monthly</a></i> notes that reports of the precise date at which the information was allegedly passed to the FBI vary considerably. It is most unlikely that Able Danger would have identified a terrorist called "Mohamed Atta" before May, 2000.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 9/11, of course, we have retrieved every scrap of information ever known about Mohamed Atta, so we know what information would have been available to the Able Danger data mining operation. And what we know is that Mohamed Atta sent his first email to friends in the U.S. in March 2000 and received his first U.S. visa on May 18, 2000. Moreover, that was the first time he had ever gone by the name "Mohamed Atta." His full name is "Mohamed Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta," and prior to 2000 he went by "Mohamed el-Amir."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/l/Able_Danger_033e.html" title="Edit section: Documentation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Documentation</span></h3>
<p>To date no electronic or paper document has showed that any connection was made to Atta <i>before</i> 9/11. No emails to and from the Able Danger team make any references to Atta, nor do any paper documents between the team and any other DoD teams or offices. No notes taken at any pre 9/11 meetings between the DoD and FBI, or interoffice DoD meetings, show any mention of Atta or a terrorist cell in New York.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Able Danger documentation was destroyed and any that might have passed along to follow up programs may also have been destroyed. Thus it is impossible to state whether the data existed and most important, the absence of any notes or documentation is not evidence they did not exist before being destroyed. The rationale for destruction is also surrounded by controversy as well.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate_Judiciary_Committee_1d40.html" title="Senate Judiciary Committee">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> Chairman <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlen_Specter_bb4f.html" title="Arlen Specter">Arlen Specter</a> held a hearing on September 21, 2005, looking into the facts about Able Danger. However, Lt. Col Shaffer and the other four members of Able Danger were ordered not to testify by the Department of Defense. Senator Specter decided to go forward with the hearings hoping "to produce a change of heart by the Department of Defense."</p>
<p>Senator Specter wondered if the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Posse_Comitatus_Act_18a1.html" title="Posse Comitatus Act">Posse Comitatus Act</a> may have been the reason Defense Department attorneys would not allow Able Danger to turn over information to the FBI. The Posse Comitatus Act prevents the military from being engaged in law enforcement activities, including gathering information on U.S. persons, despite the aliens were not specifically United States citizens. Speaking on behalf of Lt. Col Shaffer, attorney Mark Zaid testified "Those within Able Danger were confident they weren't compiling information on US persons. They were potentially people connected to US persons." <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/terrorism/july-dec05/abledanger-9-21.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/terrorism/july-dec05/abledanger-9-21.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a></p>
<p>Former Army Major Erik Kleinsmith, former head of the Pentagon's Land Warfare Analysis Department, testified that he was instructed to destroy data and documents related to Able Danger in May and June of 2000. The instruction came from a top Pentagon lawyer. He testified, "I go to bed every night and other members of our team do as well [thinking] that if [Able Danger] had not been shut down that we would have at least been able to prevent something or assist the United States in some way. Could we have prevented 9/11? I could never speculate to that extent."</p>

<p>On February 14, 2006, Congressmen <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curt_Weldon_0195.html" title="Curt Weldon">Curt Weldon</a> charged that contrary to testimony, not all the data on Able Danger had been destroyed. Weldon claimed to be in contact with people in the government still able to do data-mining who got 13 hits on Mohamed Atta. Weldon also claimed that Able Danger information was found in Pentagon files as recently as two weeks ago and that a general was present when the files were taken from the cabinet. Able Danger will be the subject of hearings by the Armed Services Committee on February 15, 2006. <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=\Nation\archive\200602\NAT20060215d.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=\Nation\archive\200602\NAT20060215d.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_21.html" title="September 21">September 21</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, <i>The Washington Post</i> reported that a Defense Department investigation into Able Danger found that Able Danger did not identify Mohamed Atta or any other hijacker before the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11_attacks.html" title="September 11 attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, and that a widely discussed chart was "a sample document passed to the military as an example of how to organize large amounts of data," and was created after 9/11. Congressman Weldon disputed the inspectors claims, stating "I am appalled that the DoD IG would expect the American people to actually consider this a full and thorough investigation," Weldon said in an e-mailed statement. "I question their motives and the content of the report, and I reject the conclusions they have drawn." <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/21/AR2006092101831.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/21/AR2006092101831.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a></p>
<p>In December of 2006, a sixteen-month investigation by the US Senate Intelligence Committee concluded "Able Danger did not identify Mohammed Atta or any other 9/11 hijacker at any time prior to Sept. 11, 2001," and dismissed other assertions that have fueled <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>. The Senate panel of investigators said there was no evidence DoD lawyers stopped analysts from sharing findings with the FBI before the attacks. No Able Danger information was improperly destroyed by Pentagon lawyers. Analysts had created charts that included pictures of then-known Al Qaeda operatives, but none including Atta. A follow-up chart made after the attacks did show Atta. The Senate Committee said its findings were consistent with those of the DoD inspector general, released in September 2006.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
