<p><b>The date Able Danger was officially terminated by DoD?</b> -- Sadly, the article is missing this information.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Is Conspiracy debunked or not?</b></p>
<hr />
<p>Boy reading this is more fun than listening to Chris Matthews or Sean Hannity. Anwyway, POV aside, are we going to get someone brave enough now to add current events? Last current event I see is the December 2006, is that it?</p>
<p>And does Tom get to assert that the Senate and DoD agreeing ends the controversy? Some believe Wheldon lost his seat over this...can that not be added as well -- the effects of pursuing a story the government MIGHT want to go away (avoiding POV)? I admit my POV, it only takes a look at my website -- I state it clearly.</p>
<p>I'd like to know how all the coincidences like DoD lettering up the potential witnesses and then backing down later? And if the DoD wanted to get the story straight, why didn't they just grant Philpot the right to draft a statement of what he saw and knew? Maybe with a warning about what was classified he couldn't talk about or perhaps (if it is true), state HE did not want to participate in a circus and the DoD respects that right to privacy in the workplace.<br />
<br />
Adding some more...hope I am not breaking some protocol...Later in this long (too long?) tirade, is mention of the prosecutors not being allowed to pass information to the FBI or other intelligence agencies. Isn't it the other way around?</p>
<p>The idea is to keep domestic criminal affairs off the scope for the CIA who is not allowed to (notice the bold please) spy domestically on <b>criminal cases</b> (i.e. U.S. Citizens. In the past, and more or less now (after the Patriot Act), the CIA, when finding a "bad guy" in the U.S. was required to turn it over to the FBI who had ultimate responsibility for domestic counterintelligence (yes it is one word according to the FBI manual on writing style). Adding counterterrorism (also one word) to the FBI's mandate plus FISA makes it doubly important for the CIA to handoff. With Homeland Security supposedly providing the pass-through mechanism at the replacement for TTIC (NTIC???). Did I get all that right?</p>
<p>Point is...isn't the prohibited direction from <b>CIA</b> to <b>Prosecutors</b>? You don't want prosecutors (and I guess the FBI) going after U.S. criminals in domestic situations because the CIA is only supposed to look at foreign operators unless they get on a plane or cross the border and enter the U.S.</p>
<p>For instance, if the Klamath County D.A. wants to refer to the FBI he has every right and in fact is legally bound to do so when he notes a federal crime may be in process or has occurred and needs federal investigation.</p>
<p>Now...am I being too picky and everyone else understood G...what's his name meant when he got the direction wrong?</p>
<p>And yes this has to do with Able Danger, simply because that was the point of the destruction of data...they couldn't have intelligence agency data available on U.S. citizens cuz that is not legal for anyone but the FBI to have in their hands! Or so goes the excuse.</p>
<p>As if. According to both Shaffer and the fellow who did the actual deleting, the data on U.S. people came from public sources...public as in open-source and you can collect open source data on anyone you want, can't you? If it's public, it's public, you can't make it not so.</p>
<p>Anyway, lot's of fun.</p>

<p><b>Follow on to Able Danger has been removed</b></p>
<hr />
<p>Oh, I left a note to Tom about his removal of the Able Providence article...now we have a circular link? Ooops! What was wrong with Able Providence...can't talk to that discussion page, cuz it vanished over the holidays without warning and with no talkie to Mikee, no talkie to article cuz it's like gone, dude! An explanation of what happened would be nice...it had pretty good references including some great pages (graphics) on a link to a blogger with inside scoop. All gone now, sigh.</p>

<p>In digging deeper (looking at the "diff" on the removed page in history), I see that Tom stated that the reason the page was removed was that a single source is not enough to enter an article...so the fact that four different people, Wheldon, Shaffer, the GCN writer Patience Wait, and the blogger all pointed to Able Providence (with actual slides in the case of the blogger) did not seem to be credible enough for Tom. Oh well.</p>
<p>I will fix the link to point to the MILNET page on Able Providence as an outside source, whether you "buy" the source or not, it is more information that proves valuable to the overall story.</p>

<p>How is the truth about your BAD FAITH LIES an attack? If you don't like being caught in LIES, stop lying! I can't image Wikipedia would rather keep a known and proven compulsive liar as a poster than someone who honestly exposes the lies. Perhaps you should watch out. But if Wikipedia would rather keep liars as contributors they are welcome to you. I wouldn't want to be associated with such a cesspool. - Honest Abe</p>
<p>____</p>
<p>Abe, First off, I think it's well established Gorgonzilla has told a series of lies and those lies can only be in bad faith given all the warings he's already received about them. But your posts bother me for several reasons.</p>
<p>1) Although you called Gorgonzilla a liar only in the oblique above, you stooped to actual name-calling earlier. That makes even the oblique off limits to you.</p>
<p>2) Your diagnosis of Gorgonzilla as a compulsive liar is done (presumably) out of field. Only a psychiatrist should be making such a diagnosis. It's entirely possible Gorgonzilla lies as a result of political zealotry rather than pathology. You should refrain from playing doctor.</p>
<p>3) Wikipedia is not a "cesspool." It's clear contributors like Gorgonzilla are an embarrassment and a tax on Wikipedia's reputation, but by and large the articles here are well done and those that aren't can usually be improved. The fact that this article can't be improved at the moment is probably due to Gorgonzilla's duping admin, as he was undoubtedly duped others, rather than a systemic problem with Wikipedia itself.</p>
<p>Gorgonzilla should be banned and Wikipedia should think seriously about banning you as well.</p>
<p>-- Swamp Foxx <a href="../../../1/3/8/User%7E138.162.0.46.html" title="User:138.162.0.46">138.162.0.46</a> 14:55, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>1) Can't un-ring a bell, I suppose. 2) You're right. I have no idea why Gorgonzolla lies as often as he does. I probably shouldn't have said he was compulsive. But I do know he has trouble facing reality and is at the same time politically motivated. 3) Perhaps "cesspool" was hyperbole. Either way I did not intend to imply Wikipedia was currently a cesspool. I tried to convey that if liars and partisans are encouraged to post here Wikipedia would suffer and I wouldn't want to post in that kind of environment, so being banned wouldn't matter. - Honest Abe</p>

<p>This article appears quite old for a "current event" and reads like the 9/11 committee's initial denials. There have been quite a few developments since, including 3 witnesses that have now come forward and the announcement of hearings in the Senate under Arlen Specter as well separate hearings in the House. This really should be updated to reflect a more neutral tone.</p>

<p>Two of the witnesses are in the article. The problem with adding the third was the anon poster's insistence on describing them as 'credible' and inserting numerous other POV references leading to the article being locked. At this point it is very clear that <i>someone</i> is lying but there is no documentary evidence to prove <i>who</i> that is. Describing one side as 'credible' in this situation is unacceptably POV. It is not an adjective I would apply to either side, it is certainly unnecessary. I happen to think that O.J. Simpson is a double-murderer, the evidence against him is absolutely overwhelming in my view. But I do not think that the Wikipedia article should start 'In 1993 O.J.

<p>If you didn't like the word "credible," you should have explained why 3 military officers saying the same thing aren't credible on the discussion page and deleted the term in the article instead of your wholsale deletion of relevant facts. The anon poster appears justified in claiming this article does not have a neutral POV because of the action you took. -- Swamp Foxx 138.162.0.43 17:11, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The anon poster has not posted one word of justification for his edits. He has on the other hand made repeated personal attacks. His entire edit was intended to promote a particular point of view as fact and exclude all other views. Shaffer was put on leave for alleged dishonesty 18 months ago, long before his public statements. The edit was also confused and barely comprehensible, just like his posts to talk. If you think that the article should be changed then please join in the discussion attempting to arrive at a compromise. Also as a matter of fact there are only 2 military officers, Smith was a contractor. Their account is denied by their chain of command so it is 2 military officers against 20 or so. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 17:23, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You know, when I saw his posts below calling you a "liar" I was on your side. Name calling is difficult to tolerate. I assumed you were just grossly mistaken when you incorrectly said there were only 2 witnesses and also claimed he had not justified adding an NPOV warning on this discussion page. Yet when you claimed above <i>"The anon poster has not posted one word of justification for his edits"</i> that belief became very difficult for me to maintain. I don't know how such a "blunder" can be a simple mistake. The anonymous poster obviously justified his version with several links including one from the US Department of Justice, while one of yours came from a clearly liberal semi-blog called "Media Matters." If you had contradictory links they should have been placed in an edit of his version. You should not have deleted the relevant facts he included in his re-write of your version. I found his edit understandable yet needing more work. It's unfortunate you lacked the capacity for either comprehending or providing that work in an unbiased manner. If you think his article should have been edited, you should have edited it from his baseline and justified your edits here. Your original POV can't be taken in any way as neutral. -- Swamp Foxx <a href="../../../1/3/8/User%7E138.162.0.37.html" title="User:138.162.0.37">138.162.0.37</a> 19:09, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Your claim/lie that there were only two witnesses despite my neutral revision clearly naming the 3 witnesses and linking articles describing IS clear evidence you are acting in the bad faith of your LW extremism as was your deletion without explanation of my NPOV warning a few days ago. Had you read the my neutral POV article before whining you would not have looked so foolish. If the choice is for this article to be worded so it is half way between a version with a neutral POV and your version with a LW extreme POV, this article should be deleted completely. Your attack on another poster as a "sockpuppet" was not only irresponsible and wrong, it was down-right stupid.

<p>They were in my neutral revision along with links. If you had read it instead of acting out of LW knee-jerk extremism you would have seen them. Can you count to 3? From the revision:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Army Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer</dd>
</dl>
<p>After Weldon's assertions were disputed by the media Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, a member of the Able Danger team identified himself as Weldon's source. Shaffer claimed that he alerted the FBI in September 2000 about the information uncovered by the secret military unit "Able Danger," but he alleges three meetings he set up with bureau officials were blocked by military lawyers. Shaffer, who currently works for the Defense Intelligence Agency, claims that the information was communicated to members of the 9/11 Commission, who chose not to include it in their final report.</p>
<p>Shaffer's lawyer, Mark Zaid, has revealed that Shaffer had been placed on administrative leave and had his security clearance suspended in March 2004 following a dispute over expenses. [7]</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Navy Captain Scott Philpott</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Associated Press has reported that a member of the Able Danger team, Capt. Scott Philpott, an expert in futuristic naval warfare has also confirmed Shaffer's claims.</p>
<p>The group appears to be leaking additional information on Able Danger through the blog 'Voice of the taciturn' [8]</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Mr. JD Smith</dd>
</dl>
<p>FoxNews has reported JD Smith, a contractor working for the Able Danger team, helped gather open-source information, reported on government spending and helped generate charts associated with the unit's work. [9]</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to Smith:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"I am absolutely positive that he [Atta] was on our chart among other pictures and ties that we were doing mainly based upon [terror] cells in New York City."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Smith also said data was gathered from a variety of sources, including about 30 or 40 individuals. He said they all had strong Middle Eastern connections and were paid for their information and said Able Danger's photo of Atta was obtained from overseas.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well here is the problem I am having with the claims made by Smith. 'Able Danger' was originally purported to have been a data mining project, and a research project rather than a 'production' one at that. Now we have Smith popping up claiming that he was responsible for a HUMINT component of the project with 30-40 agents active. And this is all meant to be taking place under SOCOM without the participation of army intelligence or the CIA? And a project funded to that extent does not have procedures in place for handing over the information gathered? --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 02:16, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Smith is also continuing to claim that Atta was identified <i>by that name</i> in 1999.

<p>You have no proof of this beside your BuzzFlash Cut &amp; Paste.</p>
<p>Direct quotes don't need to be neutral but balanced. I have made no such statement about the Clinton Administration "responsibility" as you claim. The terrorists are responsible for their terrorism. The Clinton Administration's actions were irresponsible - not responsible. Your claim is not only yet another lie but a betrayal of Wikipedia's NPOV requirement. The fact that I left the Republican Gorton's statement in my neutral version is a clear indication of my neutrality and balance. I am a Libertarian not a Republican, BTW.

<dd>I think that it is premature based on reports limited to Fox News, the Washington Times and NewsMax to start hyperventilating here.

<dd>AnonIP, If you think that describing a guy accused of THEFT as 'Credible' in the opening paragraph is NPOV then you are likely a sockpupet for honest Abe. I reverted because the editorial slant was clearly endorsing Shaffer/Philpott/Smith as telling the truth and by implication describing the Pentagon and the Bush Administration as liars. The story is currently being spun by a number of partisan news sources that do too have their Jayson Blair scandals, starting with Ailes giving political advice to Jeb Bush during the 2000 count. Reputable news organizations are not run by partisan political advisers. I don't care if the POV you are inserting is Republican or Libertarian. At this point nobody has produced documentary evidence that of the identification claim let alone evidence that it was suppressed by any party whatsoever. It is premature to integrate this into the unified right wing Clinton conspiracy theory. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 03:47, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gorgonzilla, I do not object to your removing the word "credible" from the opening paragraph. I do object to your removing factual information regarding Smith's claims as reported by major media. There is no justification for that. It appears to be your POV that the allegations concerning Able Danger are simply part of a "unified right wing Clinton conspiracy theory". You are entitled to your opinion, of course. You are not entitled to impose it on this Wikipedia article, as you have attempted to do from the beginning.

The vandal has since accused me of being a liar and an extreemist which are accusations that further demonstrate an intent to impose a particular POV. At this point the allegations are just that, allegations. The article has the Clinton-is-to-blame POV, that is far from the only POV likely to be asserted if it does turn out that it is possible to prove something here. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 04:20, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can you cite FoxNews' Jayson Blair or Operation Tailwind-like scandal?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure Ailes giving partisan political advice, numerous silly statements by O'Reilly. Of course they are not major journalism scandals because Fox News is not held to that standard.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ailes did no such thing through the network and you know it. As much as you National Socialists hate the idea even FoxNews people have freedom to believe and vote as they wish. As for O'Reilly are you referring to his support for Clinton's war on Kosovo or O'Reilly's opposition to the death penalty? Te fact is O'Reilly is opinionated but he has as many liberal positions as conservative ones. As a commentator rather than a Journalist he has as much riht to offer his offsetting opinions as Larry King has to advocate the LW ticket.</p>
<p><br />
FoxNews has proven more credible than either the NYT or CNN who hosted those scandals, respectively. I haven't linked anything to NewsMax or the Washington Times. Your claim I did gives a clear view toward your lunatic LW partisan extremism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>More personal attacks noted.</dd>
</dl>
<p>No one and nothing identified Condi Rice as a "terrorist." Able Danger did identify her contacts with the Chinese through Stanford University, where she was Dean, as suspicious. Nothing surprising there Stanford had an academic agreement with China.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Look at what I wrote, what is interesting here is that someone is interested enough in Smith to slime them.</dd>
</dl>
<p>But it's an indication why the FBI needed to be the man in the loop. The man in the loop not only on Rice but on Muhammed Atta as well. It was a section of the loop the Clinton Administration denied the American public with the wall against passing data on terrorism the Jamie Gorlick fortified. - Honest Abe</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yet another repeat of a wingnut conspiracy. The partition of FBI data goes back to Chuch, the same rules were re-confirmed by Ashcroft himself when <i>he</i> took office. Stop obsessing about a cheap stunt that Ashcroft pulled when he was about to face a series of tough questions from the 9/11 commission. Ashcroft knew he was likely to be criticized by the commission report so he got his people to dredg up some dirt to throw.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well first off you have accused me of being a left wing extreemist repeatedly and of telling lies. Those are personal attacks and actionable ones to boot.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You clearly did tell a lie claiming there were 2 witnesses when my linked post made t clear there were 3. I was a demonstrated, proved and obvious lie. If you don't like that label - Stop lying.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, is the Jayson Blair you refer to the one sacked by the NY Times for making up stories? I was not aware that Fox News employed him, I would not regard him as a reliable source regardless of where he works.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Right. Your trying to discredit FoxNews when they've experienced no such sJayson Blair scandal as has many of your favority LW sources was a crystal ball into your LW extremism.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Thirdly, what I was saying was that the information that has so far come to light on Smith comes from three partisan right wing sources and what appears to be a Pentagon source alleging that Smith screwed up big on another project. At this point I think it is too soon to form any opinion on whether the allegations against Smith are even reliably sourced let alone interpret them.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Nothing ties FoxNews to the right wing. Your claim, however, ties you to the extreme left wing.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Fourthly, there is a big difference between the facts that have been established and the spin that Weldon and other have been trying to place on it. Shaffer's original statements appear to suggest that the SOCOM lawyers were concerned that if they handed over the info that the result would be another WACO style FBI screw-up. Having dealt with Freeh myself I can sympathize with that view. At the time the Freeh's direct involvement in the scapegoating of Richard Jewel for the Olympic park bombing had many people in the federal government thinking he was an incompetent grandstander.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Where's your link on the Waco thing?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The stories of Shaffer and co are incompatible with the Pentagon story, at least one group is lying.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You missed the Pentagon's latest statement saying they no longer doubt the story. Tune into FoxNews to get the latest. CNN wont cover it till later. It runs counter to their editorial policy.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If the pentagon is putting out a smear campaign against Smith that is rather interesting, it certainly suggests that the <i>Pentagon</i> has something to hide.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
I won't argue but I haven't heard the Pentagon try to smear him. To the contrary tonite they admitted his credibility.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If there is a coverup it beggars beleif that the Bush administration would be attempting to protect Clinton, or for that matter the 9/11 Commission.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not surprising. That was done before when the Bush Administration refused to release Clinton Administration documents.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The inconsistency in the timeline has yet to be explained.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The inconsistancy in the 9/11 commissions claim they were never briefed on Able Danger and then their reversal saying they were briefed but didn't find the witness needs to be explained as well. Both inconsistancies were left in my neutral version.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your accusations about the denial of Able Danger being LW extreemism are entirely off base. At this point the one thing we are sure about is that Bill Clinton is never going to run for President of the United States again. If Able Danger could be substantiated then it would argue for convening a second 9/11 commission with a wider scope, the LW is hardly opposed to that. It would mean that there was a coverup in the Pentagon under the Bush admin, hardly something the LW is opposed to discovering.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not saying the denials represent LW extremism. I'm saying your supression of relevant facts represents LW extremism. I left the assertion and counter assertions to the Able Danger intelligence in place in my version. You deleted relevant facts. If Able Danger were substantiated it would lead to the questions:</p>
<p>1) Why did Clinton officials use "the Wall" to keep Able Danger staff from warning the FBI about intelligence on Mohammed Atta's intentions, despite the unit's charter to prevent terrorism? Why did Gorlick's interpretation of the wall go far beyond constitutional and legislative requirements?</p>
<p>2) Why was the 9/11 Commission *staff* briefed on the Able Danger intelligence yet the 9/11 commission members were either not briefed by the staff or the information was severely downplayed?</p>
<p>3) Why did Jamie Gorlick increase the effect of "the Wall" against sharing intelligence data on terrorists yet refuse to recuse herself from that portion of the 9/11 investigation?</p>
<p><br />
Say!! This looks alot like the elements of scandal I cited.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>The fact is that at the moment there really is not enough substance to the allegations being made to make this anything more than a conspiracy theory. Inserting POV edits such as describing the three project members as credible when one is on enforced leave for alleged dishonesty and another is allegedly incompetent does not improve the article or make it in any way 'Neutral'.--<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 03:30, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
The fact is there are 3 corroberting witnesses. That's more than what is required as legal proof in any court in the US. The fact that those facts are inconvenient to your POV is obvious and immaterial. The facts in my neutral version should not be suppressed.

<p>This left wing spin of this article is a disgrace. It's present form is a complete whitewash of 3 brewing scandals obviously for political spin. Example, 2nd paragraph a denial is presented without source or link before the charge is presented. WTF? Even the far left leaning New York Times has given the charges credence in todays paper yet Michael Savage is given top billing. Again WTF? This is why it has earned a NPOV warning. Honest Abe - 17 Aug 05</p>
<p>This article is a disgrace, first off the 9/11 commission flat out denies that it was told about Able Danger, the only information that there is on the Top Secret project is that it existed.</p>
<p>Weldon has a partisan motive here. The remainder of the article consits of exceptionaly POV speculation from the fringe wing-nut blogosphere. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 12:43, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it's a good idea to leave the false claims in with the information that refutes them. It is pertinent that such claims have been made but they have been refuted. However, I must also add that the 9/11 Commission has since acknowledged that they recieved information regarding Able Danger and didn't include it in the final report because it conflicted with other info they had concerning the timeline of Atta. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilemma_3c64.html" title="User:Trilemma">Trilemma</a> 15:44, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Gorgonzilla's pro-left revision was a disgrace and a violation of NPOV. Clear facts such as direct 9/11 testimony was deleted along with the 9/11 commission's confirmation staff was briefed on the Able Danger intelligence. Reverted to the previous and correct version. - Honest Abe</p>

<p>The facts contained in this article were balanced in an NPOV by Gorlick's verbatim full exlanation of why she erected the "wall" protecting terrorists from US agencies sharing intelligence on them. Just as you wouldn't attack Jews as you were describing the Holocaust to present a neutral POV on Hitler, you don't suppress and disguise facts wrt the Clinton Administration's response on terror, or lack thereof, to present a NPOV on past action/inaction. Facts must be aired nomatter how inconvenient for one side or other. Opinions should be balanced by critical opinion as long as there is a critical mass who share the opposing opinion. The article does with Ashcroft's opinion countering Gorlick's - point/counterpoint. - Honest Abe 17:38 13 Aug 2005(UTC)</p>

<p>The Gorelick issue is a claim that the 9/11 commission was biased. It has not yet been established that the 9/11 commission even saw the material from Able Danger. The 9/11 commission has issued a denial (I will post is soon).</p>

If the Ashcroft accusation is relevant it should be paraphrased here, not given verbatim. Posting four paragraphs before you get to the point is known as burying the lede. The reader should first be told the allegation then the evidence, it sounds as if the actual allegation here is that the FBI and intel did not exchange information. But the presentation makes it look like it is a bias/coverup allegation.

<p><i>Again Gorgonzilla demonstrates he has "trouble" counting in single digit numbers. There was 1 very relevant paragraph in Honest Abe's version, not 4 as claimed. Maybe Abe needs to add a 9th element to his list. Here is that paragraph:</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>"In 1995, the Justice Department embraced flawed legal reasoning, imposing a series of restrictions on the FBI that went beyond what the law required," he said. "The 1995 Guidelines and the procedures developed around them imposed draconian barriers to communications between the law enforcement and intelligence communities. The wall left intelligence agents afraid to talk with criminal prosecutors or agents. In 1995, the Justice Department designed a system destined to fail. Somebody built this wall." Ashcroft added: "The basic architecture for the wall . . . was contained in a classified memorandum entitled 'Instructions on Separation of Certain Foreign Counterintelligence and Criminal Investigations. Full disclosure compels me to inform you that its author is a member of this Commission."</dd>

<dd>Jamie Gorelick's firm has agreed to represent Prince Mohammed al Faisal in the suit by the 9/11 families. The families contend that al Faisal has legal responsibility for the 9/11 attacks. According to Attorney General John Ashcroft in his testimony before the commission, Gorelick wrote a procedural memo that would have prevented communication between various government agencies (the wall memo[2]). Ashcroft later recanted this claim when it was pointed out that 'the wall' predated Gorelick's tenure by many years and his own Justice department had reaffirmed and strengthened the positions taken in her memo.</dd>

Whoa!! That video was filmed in 2002. The chart in the video is no reconstruction. The reconstruction was done recently. Why are you attempting to pettifog this?

Read this before editing further. The source for the claim is clearly Weldon's book. And Weldon himself does not remember if he mentioned Atta any more.

<p>This is not the place to rehash the Gorelick argument, that should be considered in the separate 9/11 intel failures article, particularly since Ashcroft himself has withdrawn the claim and admitted that Gorelick was not the author of the policy as he had asserted but the policy actually dates back to the first Bush admin and before.

<dd>It was started in 1999 which is one of the reasons why the claim that they identified Atta in 2000 is a teensy weensy bit unbelievable.

<dd>[Shaffer] recalled carrying documents to the offices of Able Danger, which was being run by the Special Operations Command, headquartered in Tampa, FL.

<dl>
<dd>Shaffer said Atta's name didn't ring a bell when he learned the hijackers' names after 9/11.

<p>You've made the assertion Ashcroft recanted his claim about Gorlick many times, yet you've failed to link this "recant" even once. The Anon poster linked a Department of Justice memo signed by Gorlick strengthening "the Wall." Pardon me for doubting you but your credibility has taken a severe beating on this page due to no one's fault but your own.

<p>Why don't you exercise some of your apparently endless powers of skepticism to consider the assertions being made by the protagonists in the article rather than try to endlessly dispute matters already settled?

<dd>Gorgonzilla, I don't see your logic on that. The Bush admin only officially entered office in January 2001 (followed by a few months of handing over time), and as such would have been in office only after the Able Danger information was allegedly quashed. In fact, so far as I can tell the criticism over the Able Danger story is being directed at those, specifically Gorelick, who essentially helped create the "wall" and therefore contributed to groups like Able Danger being unable to share their data with the FBI. Whether all this is true or not is the question, but the issue in essence has nothing to do with the Bush admin. Furthermore, if the Able Danger allegations are found to be true it doesn't incriminate the Bush admin in any wrongdoing at all. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 21:42, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Bush Administration would have 100% responsibility for the coverup. At this point the denials out of the Pentagon are categorical. The attempt to spin the story into a uniquely anti-Clinton issue is an entirely partisan view. Moreover Ashcroft himself has admitted that the 'Wall' was actually created under Bush mkI and was not introduced by Gorelick as he claimed when he was trying to cover his own butt in front of the 9/11 commission. Bush appointed all the members of the commission in any case. If there is a scandal there it is a bipartisan one. It is just somewhat amusing to see conspiracy theorists out on planet wingnut who are so blinded by their ideology they cannot see that their accusations if true affect both sides. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 22:42, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a matter of fact Shaffer is on 'administrative leave' for allegedly fiddling expenses for over 18 months. This is hardly a source that can be described as being 'credible' without qualification.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Already addressed. Two eye-witnesses are accepted as legal proof in any court in the country. The fact that there are three here all saying the same thing makes them credible. - Honest Abe</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that one is on a charge for dishonesty, one refuses to say more than that he was involved except to repeat the claim that 'Atta' was identified before he is known to have used the name and the other one was only a contractor means that there are serious reasons to doubt the story. Three members of the 9/11 commission have confirmed their story. Should we label the commission 'credible' as well? If not why not? Perhaps because it is clear that someone must be lying here?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>How oddly hypocritically ironic you would argue dishonesty makes someone less credible given the string of lies you've been caught telling right here on this page. Yet you couldn't resist doing it again. Lt. Col Shaffer has not been charged with any crime. - Honest Abe</p>

<ul>
<li>yet Clinton Administration officials refused to allow the intelligence data to be passed to the FBI for further investigation</li>

<dd>Cite a source for this, there is absolutely no evidence that the material was handed over to any Clinton administration appointee. The pentagon has denied that Able Danger produced any data to hand over. This is at best an unsupported claim.</dd>

<ul>
<li>The existence of Able Danger and its identification of the 9/11 terrorists one year prior to 9/11 is confirmed by 3 credible witnesses</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Again, a blatant POV edit, first there is only actually one witness since Shaffer says he got the info from Philpott and Weldon says he got it from first Shaffer then Philpott. so there is only actually one first hand witness. Second the claims made by the witness are disputed by the Bush administration. So your phrase is a blatant POV</dd>
</dl>
<p>Shaffer says nothing of the kind about Philpott. What is your source? He quite clearly says he was the go between in operations in Texas and Tampa while serving in Washington and he brought Philpott the information.</p>

<p>"Shaffer No. This was simply a chart showing up with potentialities or clusters of information. That’s what it showed.

<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that Ashcroft has recanted his accusation and has accepted the fact that the Wall predates Gorelick has been deleted in another deliberate POV edit.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no such fact established. Your cryptic reference appears to indicate a claim by the 9/11 Committee. However their credibility is in jeopardy with their conflicting statements on whether they were given Able Danger intelligence. For this to be an established fact you'd need to provide it as a direct quote attributed to Ashcroft from a credible source. As it statnd, the best you have offered is a characterization from a source whose credibility is in doubt. - Honest Abe</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Able Danger had identified the 9/11 terrorist one year prior to 9/11 was picked up by national media in August 2005 because of three elements of scandal.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>First it is alleged, secondly GSN is hardly the national media. The treatment of Able Danger in the real national media is considerably more skeptical. Time in particular were very dismissive but no major newspaper has yet called Able Danger a 'scandal'. This is a POV edit.</dd>
</dl>
<p>GSN? Able Danger identified this per 3 credible sources reported by several media sources in direct quote and video. Several were linked in my revision. As stated above only 2 eye-witness sources are required as legal proof in any court in the country. - Honest Abe</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>The 9/11 Commission staff was briefed on the Able Danger intelligence yet the 9/11 commission members were either not briefed by the staff or the information was severely downplayed.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Actually the 9/11 commission has stated that they saw the Able Danger claim and dismissed it because 1) Atta did not apply for his visa to come to the states until <i>after</i> the alleged identification, 2) Atta did not begin using that name until <i>after</i> the alleged identification.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
The commission also said they were never briefed per your own version of the article. Their inconsistancy is part of the problem with their credibility and makes my statement accurate. Nobody knows whether staff passed them the data or not. Nobody knows who incorrectly assessed Shaffer's credibility per the commission's revised statement. - Honest Abe</p>

<dl>
<dd>The Church Committee recommended a series of safeguards, including charter legislation to set standards and procedures for FBI domestic security and counterintelligence investigations and to restrict the collection of information about Americans by the CIA, the National Security Agency, and other U.S. intelligence agencies. Although charter legislation was not enacted, the Attorney General issued guidelines for FBI investigations and Presidents issued Executive Orders requiring procedures approved by the Attorney General for the collection and retention of information about Americans by U.S. intelligence agencies. These guidelines and procedures have served for the past 25 years as a stable framework that, with rare exceptions, has not allowed previous abuses to recur.</dd>
<dd>...The Congress has been cautious in the decades following the revelations of the Church Committee about allowing use of criminal justice information for other purposes and, specifically, on sharing such information with intelligence agencies. In 1979 Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti testified before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights that the guidelines for "any dissemination outside the Bureau...will have to be very, very specific. We will have to be very certain the dissemination is lawful, meets the same standards of certainty, of intent, which is the basic reason for the collection of the information and the investigation...." On the issue of FBI sharing with the CIA, Attorney General Civiletti said "you have to be extremely careful in working out, pursuant to the law, the information which is being exchanged, what its purpose is, how it was obtained and collected, so that you are not inadvertently, out of a sense of cooperation or efficiency, perverting or corrupting the fact that the CIA’s main duty is foreign intelligence, and they have no charter, no responsibility, and not duty performance, no mission to investigate criminal acts in the United States."</dd>

<p>Once again, the quote you provide makes no mention of the Ford administration. Benjamin Civiletti was Attorney General in the CARTER administration. Carter was a DEMOCRAT.

<dd>The Church commission was bipartisan and took place under Ford. That is how Mondale became Vice President, he was prominent on Church. The Ford admin accepted and endorsed the Church commission findings. So the policy does go back to Ford. Since Carter there were three Republican administrations that all endorsed the same policy, as did Ashcroft at the start of Bush-II. If you want to blame the real culprit for Church you should complain about Hoover and Nixon whose criminal abuses of the intelligence services and the FBI were the reason that <i>both parties</i> endorsed Church.--<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 12:37, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There is no doubt an extensive article on Gorelick and the Wall, there is no need to repeat that claim here, it does not enhance the story at all. If the issue is raised in the detail you appear to demand then the fact that the controls dat back to Church has to also be mentioned.

<p>The Church committee investigation took place during the Ford presidency, but it wasn't under Ford or part of his administration. It was created by the Democrat-controlled Senate and run by a liberal Democrat senator with presidential ambitions. You have offered no substantiation whatever of your claims that the Ford administration accepted and endorsed and implemented policies or practices recommended in Church committee report concerning intelligence sharing. And as the procedures set forth in the Gorelick memo were in specific reference to the FISA Act of 1978, it is difficult to imagine how they could have originated in the Ford administration, which left office in 1977. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonip_6eed.html" title="User:Anonip">Anonip</a> 20:41, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thats pure sophistry. The real cause of the Church commission was one Richard Milhouse Nixon and the criminal gang he employed. The Ford administration was in no position to object to any proposals put forward by Church. Church was subsequently endorsed by REAGAN and Bush mk I. The point I made is that it is deceitful to describe the wall as having its origins under Clinton as some people have wanted to do. As you just admit the origin is Carter at the least and endorsed by subsequent GOP administrations. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 23:35, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that what your game is here is to endlessly prattle and dispute minutiae oh and endlessly accuse others of being partisan as a way of pretending that you are not peddling a POV. The wall dates back to 1978 by your own admission and was an implementation of Church which was a bipartisan committee that reported under Ford. FISA was a partial enactment of reforms proposed by Church, the bulk of the Church reforms were implemented as executive orders and administrative orders. Church was bipartisan, Ford endorsed the major recomendations. He was hardly in a position to refuse. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 01:34, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to the CRS, Pres. Ford's executive order setting guidelines for the intelligence community (E.O.11905) was actually issued prior to the Church committee findings and undertook to implement some of the more limited recommendations of the earlier Rockefeller and Murphy commissions. Your claim that Ford was involved in implementing the Church report is simply not accurate. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonip_6eed.html" title="User:Anonip">Anonip</a> 14:55, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not think that it is likely that Able Danger would have been shut down for identifying Condi Rice as a potential terrorist. The group probably would have been shut down if they were reporting a long list of people like Rice as potential terrorists but we don't at this point have a statement to that effect. I don't think it is very likely that a group would be shut down because their computer program spat out some apparently anomalous results. Politicians end up meeting a lot of unsavory charaters, it goes with the job. The purpose of something like Able Danger would be to identify possible leads.</p>
<p>At this point the Condi Story has not been widely reported enough to be notable reporting and it does not appear to be sufficiently credible by itself.

<p>I come to this discussion as a neutral reader, since I have no prior knowledge of the material at all.</p>
<p>The article as written reads with clarity - when I say clarity I am not assessing validity - until I get to the Media Comment section and: "Fox News pundit Bill O'Reilly and others have asserted.... " I am guessing that this in particular identifies where the editorial dispute begins in the article. I cannot really grasp in content to follow just what Bill O'Reilly's trying to instruct us so I would appreciate the Bill O'Reilly "faction" to bring me up to speed with content <i><b>from his point of view</b></i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>just what would he/this faction tell me in an interview? "Able Danger was a project that ...., The Clinton Administration directed that ...., The result of the Clinton administration action was that...., The Kean Hamilton report on the Navy officer ....</dd>
</dl>
<p>Could you just write that out and let me read it without putting in any debate stuff that keeps me from getting the message.</p>
<p>I do caution that utilizing Bill O'Reilly as a news source can be a treacherous ride. Sorta the same with Larry King: altho when he has the interviewee sitting across from him he does do what journalist's do. O'Reilly may very well speak in facts, he certainly has the direct line to the West Wing. He certainly is passionate and when he is on target he gets us very quickly where he wants us to go. He certainly can validate what I want to believe, but that validation does not seem to come packaged up with reportable facts. As a journalist I just don't think he spends a great deal of time working the phones ferreting out the unknown, the unreported.</p>
<p>It's ok it you do not share my thoughts in the preceding paragraph about O'Reilly and King. Just say you do or don't - no need to put energy into it at this point.</p>
<p>But do give me the heads up on what I ask for in the first paragraph. And please, the other faction just let me read it without comment for a day maybe.<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKyle_Andrew_Brown_5908.html" title="User:Kyle Andrew Brown">Kyle Andrew Brown</a> 04:31, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Kyle, I think O'Reilly is not being cited here as a source of facts, but rather as a source of the political controversy surrounding the Able Danger allegations. O'Reilly and others have suggested that Clinton administration policies concerning the sharing of intelligence data may have been responsible for the Able Danger information not being passed on to possibly prevent the 9/11 attack. Obviously this is a controversial position. That's why the Able Baker allegations are politically controversial. Unfortunately, it is impossible to describe the controversy in the article in any detail because of partisan editors. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonip_6eed.html" title="User:Anonip">Anonip</a> 05:21, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for clearing that up, so I'd be looking for the source of facts on the allegations I guess. O'Reilly is good at bringing controversys he is interested in to attention, yet I fear that he is too much used as a "source" when he often shields his sources (what all pundits of each party do when they hang up the White House phone) and the sources are not sources he indicates he double checks for accuracy and context.</dd>

<p>The Gorelick memo issue is only one of the reasons that has been alleged for the alleged blocking of the alleged identification. It is extreme conjecture that is not supported by any documentation. Shaffer himself originally stated that SOCOM lawyers blocked the memo fearing that the FBI would do another of their WAKO style screw ups. documentary evidence would be a contemporary memo from the SOCOM lawyers or another party stating the reasons for blocking the communication of the alleged identification. The Pentagton has not produced a memo of that type despite a clear partisan interest in producing the memo if it did exist. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 12:27, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Kyle, There are three basic issues concerning Able Danger:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are the claims that by mid-2000 Able Danger had identified Atta and other 9/11 hijackers as possible members of an al Qaeda cell operating in the United States true?</li>
<li>If true, why wasn't this information provided to the FBI for investigation and possible action against these terrorists, which might have averted the 9/11 attack?</li>
<li>If true, why wasn't the failure to provide the Able Danger information to the FBI thoroughly investigated and reported by the 9/11 commission?</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point we don't have definitive answers to any of these questions.</p>
<p>With respect to question #2, O'Reilly and others have questioned whether the failure to provide the Able Danger information to the FBI was due to Clinton administration policies which restricted sharing of intelligence information. Cited as an example of such policies is a memorandum from Clinton's Assistant Attorney General Jamie Gorelick "clarifying" restrictions on and procedures for information sharing within the DOJ in the context of the criminal prosecutions for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. During the 9/11 commission hearings, critics claimed that these policies had the effect of discouraging legal intelligence sharing which might have led to discovery of the terrorists and averted the 9/11 attack. The Able Danger allegations have been portrayed as supporting these claims.</p>
<p>No one has suggested that Ashcroft suppressed the Able Danger intelligence. Rather, it was Ashcroft who called attenion to the Gorelick memo during the 9/11 hearings.</p>

<dd>What part of what you have just written do you feel is not already said in the paragraph I suggested? I do not think that selecting quotations from the memo without providing the context in which it was written is NPOV. We could add a third paragraph to give some more in depth coverage of the Gorelick memo but as you just pointed out it is an application of an existing policy to a particular situation. There is a longstanding principle that material obtained by the FBI under court order cannot be shared for any other purpose. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 14:44, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There are also restrictions in the intelligence world but these tend to be more focused on protecting sources. The value of intelligence is lost if the other side know too much about how it is being gathered. This is why there are still (disproved) claims that Churchill allowed the Coventry bombing to protect the secrecy of ULTRA (the Enigma decrypts), the real reason is that Bletchly Park did not break the codes that day. Same with FDR and PURPLE, the Japanese trafic that was decrypted only said there was a fleet at sea, the target for the fleet was only mentioned in the diplomatic traffic and that was only broken after Pearl harbor. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 14:44, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I wrote above was addressed to Kyle. It was intended to correct his misunderstanding of the issue being raised by O'Reilly. I do not underdatnd your concern about NPOV in what I wrote.

<dd>OK lets loose O'Reilly. However I don't think that we have any statement by Ashcroft on Able Danger, only the 9/11 commission testimony. Your wording conflates the two. Rep Weldon is the most credible source and also the primary. I would also be careful attributing the comment about the interpetation of the wall to Weldon, I think he left that to the echo chamber. Also you have missed out the claim that the 9/11 commission was partisan and the fact that the 9/11 commission responded:</dd>

<dd>Alternatively the first paragraph could start with the Aschcroft assertion and then continue with the application to Able Danger.

<dd>Abe attributed the statements to Weldon and Ashcroft. I removed Ashcroft because I was pretty certain he didn't make those claims. I left in Weldon because he seemed to be sure about it and Weldon has certainly put a lot of effort into promoting the theory even if he leaves others to do the dirt. I am happy to return to attributing it to O'Reilly et. al.

<p>Wow, that sure captures alot of info for me.</p>
<p>Your second paragraph appears to provide the viewpoint of that side, and the first paragraph - especially when a citation is given for Gorlick - remains ready for that viewpoint to punch up -- <i><b>which should be done in discussion format in TALK</b></i>. The article was locked to encourage TALK on issues to avoid reverting.</p>
<p>So far, no one has stepped up to the plate to add citations to what O'Reilly is saying. I'm intrigued that there is no depth added in TALK to this position. I'm really very interested in that exploration. So at this point he reamins a stand alone punter. I remain intrigued that such a punch delievered by O'Reily remains from the vantage point of this article without additional investigation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this discussion has remained open in TALK for 24 hours so far. The purpose of TALK is to explore issues BEFORE they make thier way into the article. Once this content is explored in TALK it would be unfortunate to see it picked apart in the article.

<dd>The part that seems to cause objection is precisely the concise statement of the claims about Gorelick.

<p>The other issue that really needs some cleanup is mention of Smith's claims.

But all make the point that if Able Danger were proved to be true that it would be further proof of 1) Bush administration failure to listen to warnings before 9/11 and 2) a Bush administration cover-up. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 01:54, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Should add a paragraph on Smith.</li>
<li>Should mention the fact that Specter is also planning hearings.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Smith issue I am still waiting for some sort of transcript of the press call. Does anyone know of one? All I have is second hand reports, some of which say Smith endorsed everything said by Shaffer, others say that he was unable to explain whether the group picked up the right Mohammed Atta, apparently there are now three separate individuals who used that name. Two of whom are known terrorists, another was associated with Sheik Rathman.</p>
<p>On the Spectre hearings, has anyone got a statement by Spectre's office on the hearings? It is interesting that Spectre would hold hearings since the affair would appear to be a military issue and Spectre chairs the Judiciary committee. But Spectre might be arguing that the controversy over Gorelick gives his committee authority, or he might have some other argument. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 17:06, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
You're "waiting." Go ahead and wait in a personal sense. If you find the transcript and see relevant fact there add it to a revision. In the meantime, the fact is Smith has supported both Shaffer and Philpott and that fact should not be suppressed. The Smith story was linked. That's clearly good enough. You also demand the fact that Arlen **Specter** (the James Bond reference is yet another insight into your shameful POV) is holding a hearing on the debacle created by the wall be suppressed. Nor should the Clinton Administration position on "the wall," which was the operative position when these events were occurring, be suppressed. Your disregard for and suppression of fact is shameful and clearly POV.</p>

<p>This article should probably be added to the conspiracies category. It appears that the whispering campaign to discredit Smith has had an unexpected effect of starting a left wing Able Danger conspiracy story. I have not seen this mentioned by any of the big blogs yet but it is spreading through the comments. I don't think it rates a mention unless it is taken up by one of the big blogs.</p>
<p>This conspiracy theory goes that the <i>Bush</i> admin shut down Able Danger after discovering that the group had identified Condi as a 'terrorist'.

<p>I never said or implied you are a liar over that claim. Although your now claiming I had is yet another bit of duplicity from you. Just so it's clear, here is a list of your lies (I reserve the right to add to the list in the future):</p>
<p>1) Your claim that there were only 2 witnesses to Atta's being on the chart when in fact there were 3.</p>
<p>2) Your claim you asked me to address crtain points 4 days before when in fact it was 2.</p>
<p>3) Your claim Shaffer received his information from Philpott and implictaion this was recent when, in fact, Philpott received information from Shaffer during the course of their investigation.</p>
<p>4) Your claim I used NewsMax as a source.</p>
<p>5) Your claim Gorlick did not fortify "the wall" even after I produced her memo from the Depatment of Justice.</p>
<p>6) Your claim Gorlick had nothing to do with Pentagon policy even after it was demonstrated to you she was the Pentagon's General Counsel.</p>
<p>7) Your claim I had not described my reasons for adding an NPOV warning to your biased version of this article on this page when quite clearly I had.</p>
<p>8) Your claim I had said your statement about Shaffer's travel claim was a lie when in fact I said your claim he had been charged was a lie. There are no criminal charges against Shaffer.</p>
<p>9) Your claim the John Ashcroft statement on Gorlick's conflict of interest was 4 paragraphs long in my unbiased version when, in fact, it was only 1. (thanks to Swamp Foxx)</p>

<dd>Shaffer's lawyer said the dispute involved "trivial matters" such as reimbursements for mileage and telephone charges. This would not necessarily involve a charge of dishonesty, but could be a disagreement over what expenses were authorized for reimbursement.

<dd>Shaffer's lawyer also admitted that his client had been on 'administrative leave', i.e. suspended pending a hearing for 18 months. That does not happen over trivial accusations, to to a Lt. Col. Claiming expenses you are not entitled to is also a dishonesty charge. One could reasonably suspect that Shaffer might pursue the Able Danger claims in the hope of making it politically impossible to fire him, or that he his accusations are motivated by revenge. Regardless, inserting the adjective 'credible' in front of a protagonist in this affair is POV regardless of his military rank.

<dd>Simple, when Shaffer's attorney confirmed that he has been on a disciplinary charge for 18 months he was credible because as his attorney he is most unlikely to make a statement of that type unless it is true. When he claimed that a Lt. Col. had been on admin leave for 18 months over a trivial issue he had no credibility, he is a paid advocate, Johnnie Cochran repeatedly said OJ was innocent.

<p>So where is your link to support your claim Shaffer's lawyer used that language - "dishonesty charges?" Or is this another of your embellishments?

<p>According to an interview to appear in <i>Government Security News</i>, Shaffer says his security clearance was suspended over $67 worth of disputed cell-phone charges, which he offered to pay just to get rid of the nuisance. Eventually the Army cleared him, but while his clearance was suspended his collection of information on Able Danger apparently disappeared. Also, Pentagon officials have announced that their investigation found three more people, in addition to Philpott and Shaffer, who recalled an intelligence chart that identified Atta as a terrorist a year before the 9/11 attacks. The officials said they consider the five people to be <b>credible</b>. But none of this information can be included in the Wikipedia article on Able Danger because <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a>, with the assistance of <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxbeak_c86a.html" title="User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a>, has blocked editing of the page.

<p>The two Attas theory has one glaring problem the article needs to address: Able Danger identified terror cells and not just individual terrorists. AB identified two of the three terror cells involved in 9/11. Atta and two others in the Brooklyn cell and one other terrorist associated with a second cell. If there was some kind of mistake made by Able Danger, how did Able Danger tie the wrong man to the right terror cell? That makes no sense. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 01:43, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The big problem I have with Able Danger is that there is no real hard evidence that the 'right' terror cell was identified, except to the extent that the cell was associated with Rahman who is associated with Al Qaeda, but that is not exactly a suprise given that Rahman was the starting point for the analysis. At the time that the data that the Able Danger team were working on was gathered the 9/11 Atta was living in Germany and had not even begun using the name 'Atta'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Having used the same type of analysis tools for criminal investigations (bank fraud) the identification of a 'cell' does not suprise me - that is what the software does. And you should see the charts that the printer spews out, they are really impressive. It is hard enough to interpret the charts when the only links there are overtly criminal acts. If you include the social network data as well you will find lots of 'cells' but only a few of those are the criminal cells you are looking for. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 02:06, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>OK I read the article, it appears that Shaffer is finaly starting to open up to the point where we have some testable hypotheses. I reworded the statement so that it is clear this is based on a statement by Shaffer, the earlier wording could be mistaken for random blogofiction. I also removed the conclusion that the identification of the NYC cell must mean that the right Atta was identified as the conclusion is not made by Shaffer and does not follow from the facts. Able Danger could have identified 2 out of three 9/11 attackers correctly and been mistaken just on Atta. That would be entirely consistent with the established time line, Atta was not using his name at that time and was not known to be in the US, but other hijackers were.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is important to realize here that this is a story that involves a claim of falsified information. If the pentagon is hiding something it may not be what Weldon, Shaffer and co think it is. A standard technique used to discredit someone who is 90% right in a claim is to focus on the remaining 10% and disprove that. The important claim here is that the pentagon had information that might have led to the 9/11 plot being detected in advance. Identification of Atta is not an essential component of that claim. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 02:34, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The hard evidence is that Atta and friends are dead as of 9/11. Prior to 9/11, I would expect all Able Danger could do is turn it over to the FBI... which is what they tried to do.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I noticed you removed my entry, calling it "personal research" or something. Fair enough. I found a writer who sees the same problem, Eric Umansky, and posted it. Umansky is also a skeptic on Able Danger. His explanation is that all four of the terrorists are cases of mistaken identity. In my mind that is stretching the point, especially since three of these people with mistaken identities knew each other as members of the same terrorist cell. If someone can find a writer with better thinking skills, I would be happy to change the source. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 02:18, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually I reworded the first sentence and only removed the conclusion. I would like to reword the Umansky part as well to retain the sense but drop the quote. I don't have much of a problem with bloggers as sources on this particular story, I think that the average blogger is more credible than either Air America or Fox News. But as you point out the wording is confused. I am happy for the conclusion I removed to return if it is from Umansky, but it looked like it was from the first article and I couldn't find it there. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 02:33, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added this guy to the main timeline, JimmyCrackedCorn added as a witness. At this point I am dubious about adding predictions as to what a person will say at a hearing before it happens. This is an encyclopedia, not a horoscope. Assuming the witness does appear and testify then I assume there will be more data here. The press reports give the volume of documents at 2.5 Tb so this is a RAID drive array, at that time it would take 16 disks or more for that quantity of data. The paper copies would already be shredded, the disks would be destroyed separately. The guy who destroyed them is thus not going to be in a position to know about any charts unless he was also a member of the AD team. Basically the guy is going to degauss the disk platters and then put them into a disk shredder. The important piece of information here is that he is claiming he got the order 3 days before 9/11. I wonder when he carried it out? --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 05:15, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is clear is that in 1976, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Ford_de6d.html" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald Ford</a> issued <a href="http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/speeches/760110e.htm#SEC.%205." class="external text" title="http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/speeches/760110e.htm#SEC.%205." rel="nofollow">Executive Order 11905</a>, perhaps best known for banning assasinations of foreign leaders, but which also restricted the US intelligence community's ability to conduct domestic surveillance (notably, it prohibited the CIA from doing any wiretapping). As in the case of the 1947 Act, the restrictions included in Ford's 1976 Order applied to surveillance of citizens and resident aliens.</p>
<p>Thus, "the wall" was clearly established before <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>. I believe Carter signed the Foreign Intelligence Surviellance Act of 1978--perhaps this is what Gorton was referring to on TV? But it was well after the Church Committee.</p>
<p>For what it's worth Gorton reiterated (in both cites above) that the Gorelick memo did not apply to DoD and thus is irrelevant to the Able Danger story. He used rather stronger language in the Washington Times rebuttal, calling the assertion "ridiculous...she had nothing to do with any wall between law enforcement and our intelligence agencies". He also claimed that prior to 9/11, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ashcroft_7e52.html" title="John Ashcroft">John Ashcroft</a> "reaffirmed" the Gorelick guidelines; "Ashcroft...went along completely with what Jamie Gorelick said". During August 2001, Ashcroft's deputy issued a memo which stated that that<a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/FISA/08_2002_mem.html" class="external text" title="http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/FISA/08_2002_mem.html" rel="nofollow">"The 1995 procedures remain in effect today"</a>.</p>
<p>Final points: As far as I know, Atta was neither citizen nor resident alien. It seems to me that "the wall" would not have applied to him. Similarly, Ashcroft indicated that "the wall" did not truly apply to Moussaoui, either, testifying that the FBI erred in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9088-2004Apr13.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9088-2004Apr13.html" rel="nofollow">"mistakenly believing that you had to choose one way or the other because of the wall"</a>. For suspects who are not citizens, and who have no green card, what wall is there? --<a href="../../../m/u/n/User%7EMunge_7800.html" title="User:Munge">Munge</a> 09:46, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yep, and when Ashcroft introduced the wall into the 9/11 commission hearings it was to deflect expected criticism of his own incompetence and that of Freeh who reported to him. It was a particularly dishonest piece of grandstanding. The reason these people are wittering on about the wall is to try and blame Clinton for 9/11. Of course even if every Able Danger clue was true the evidence from a data mining operation could never have been as useful as say, looking at the laptop of the suspected terrorist already arrested after asking to practice flying but not take offs or landings - as the FBI field office had asked repeatedly. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 12:25, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(From the wiki) <i>Gorton also asserted that 'the wall' was a longstanding policy that had resulted from the Church committee in the 1970s and that the policy only prohibits transfer of certain information from prosecutors to the intelligence services and never prohibited information flowing in the opposite direction</i></p>
<p>That statement is somewhat different from Gorton's rebuttal to the Washington Times. Instead, let's consider saying something like:</p>
<p>(proposed) <i>Gorton also rebutted that 'the wall' was erected by legislation enacted more than 50 years ago [Washington Times cite here], or in another rebuttal, dating back to the 1975-1976 <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_Committee_d793.html" title="Church Committee">Church Committee</a> [Fox News cite here]. In both rebuttals, Gorton mentioned that the Gorelick policy [link to Gorelick memo] refers only to information gathered by Department of Justice, rather than organizations within the Department of Defense (such as Able Danger); and moreover that during August 2001 the Department of Justice reaffirmed the Gorelick policy [link to the Larry Thompson memo]—a point Gorton had previously made during the hearings into the the events of 9/11 [link to transcript].</i></p>
<p>Generally, IMO the encylopedist needs to treat "the wall" as a fuzzy term that people have used in referring to laws, policies, procedures, and perhaps even to departmental cultures and individual errors in judgement. Furthermore, the wall bears many fingerprints of both Democrats (e.g. Truman) and Republicans (e.g. Ford). The Able Danger timeline spans two administrations and could implicate one side, both sides, rogue factions, overall incompetence, or (if the story is bogus) conspiracy theorists themselves. --<a href="../../../m/u/n/User%7EMunge_7800.html" title="User:Munge">Munge</a> 20:51, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, the whole partisan premise to the Able Danger sitory is that 'the wall' was a new policy invented by Gorelick under Clinton. That is utterly untrue. The Wall was a direct result of the absuses of Richard Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover. In this particular instance the concern of the pentagon lawyers appears to have been that if they handed information over to the FBI they would go do another Richard Jewel or a Ruby Ridge or a Waco. There may be something here, the Atta claim is not very credible but the team could certainly have tracked other AQ members down. I doubt it is anywhere near the smoking gun that the bloggers seem to think. The proper position for Wikipedia should be detached skepticism until something interesting is demonstrated. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 00:17, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bloggers are being cited as sources in the articles.

<dd>In general, I'd say blogs are poor sources. There's a big difference between reputable news websites (cnn.com) and some random person's website. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:08, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think it depends on the blog. If we are talking about a major blog with a hundred thousand daily readers run by professional journalists such as Instapundit or Talking Points memo then it is probably a better source than the East Bogsworth Picayne, circulation 500 copies. If we are talking wingnut.blogspot.com then not. It also depends on the type of information and the story. If we are talking about hurricane Katrina then only comment from major news sources is likely to be acceptable. Here the story has not been picked up by the mainstream media and all the commentary is highly partisan. If we exclude blogs, partisan 'news' stations and politicians from this story there is not going to be anything left. If commentary from Fox news is going to be included then comment from opposing partisan sources should be included. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 19:20, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Anyway, I just wanted to clarify something about the two bloggers you mentioned as "professional journalists." <a href="http://instapundit.com/about.php" class="external text" title="http://instapundit.com/about.php" rel="nofollow">Instapundit</a>, aka Glenn Reynolds, is a professor of law. <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/bio.php" class="external text" title="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/bio.php" rel="nofollow">Joshua Marshall</a> of TPM describes himself as a contributing writer and columnist for newspapers. I don't think either are traditional "professional journalists" - that is, like uhm, Clark Kent - especially Reynolds.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, that is just a nitpick. I don't disagree with your support of citing good bloggers; I wholeheartedly agree, especially with those two your mentioned as good ones. I think the criteria for citing bloggers should simply include whether or not the post is an original, useful and well-thought source or idea whether or not if it comes from someone somehow attached to traditional big media.</dd>

<dd>I would have to disagree with your example of Hurricane Katrina being an example of when to only comment from MSM (if there is, in fact, any time to restrict yourself that way.) During Katrina, MSM was presented a wildly exagerrated impression of the destruction and the aftermath. They repeated, without skepticism, claims of over 10,000 dead and people committing murder, rape and even cannibalism at rescue centers - claims that were completely unsubstantiated. And, at the time it was only the blogs that were questioning it. This reminds me of a smaller, more local version of press exagerration of disaster. In Wayne, NJ, a large depression near a complicated intersection of state and interstate highways often floods a few inches. Shortly after Katrina, it flooded - as per usual - and an NBC Today Show (from NYC) team showed up.

<p>No time to look into this but there seems to be a bit of confusion as to the time the files were destroyed:</p>
<p>Mark Zaid - Shaffer's lawyer - testifies:</p>
<p><a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1606&amp;wit_id=4668" class="external free" title="http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1606&amp;wit_id=4668" rel="nofollow">http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1606&amp;wit_id=4668</a></p>
<p>"Eventually during the period December 2000 and March 2001, all records, both electronic and hard copy, were destroyed under orders of the Army. Additionally, we just recently learned that duplicate documentation that was maintained by Lt Col Shaffer at his civilian DIA office was apparently destroyed – for reasons unknown – by DIA in Spring 2004."</p>
<p><br />
It would be probably quite interesting to trace the exact source of the time frame you use in the article. It seems the time the pro-Bush crowd at NR prefers too, but who started the mid-2000 hoax?</p>

<p>In mid-2000, the Department of Defense (DoD) intentionally purged a gargantuan amount of intelligence about al Qaeda — the enemy that had just blown up our embassies in east Africa and was even then scheming to bomb a navy destroyer in Yemen. The materials were generated by the "Able Danger" program, which attempted to map al Qaeda by sophisticated data mining. Although that program was itself highly classified, it drew mostly on open-source (i.e., non-classified) information. According to participants, the effort yielded leads that might have uncovered the 9/11 plot if diligently followed.</p>

Afterthought, there might be another testimony by Kleinsmith? Yes there is. Is this a deliberate vagueness about the date, but quite astonishing that all neo-conservative media deduces ***the same date***.</p>

<p>"In approximately April of 2000 our support to Able Danger became severely restricted and ultimately shut down due to intelligence oversight concerns. Supported vigorously by the LIWA and INSCOM chains of command, ***we actively worked to overcome this shut down for the next several months. In the midst of this shut down***, I along with CW3 Terri Stephens were forced to destroy all the data, charts, and other analytical products that we had not already passed on to SOCOM related to Able Danger. This destruction was dictated by, and conducted in accordance with intelligence oversight procedures."</p>

<p>I just made an entry under the Shafer statements section about CIA oppostion to Able Danger prior to 9/11. The 9/11 Commission and Senate Report have talked about problems sharing information between intelligence agencies, but I don't know that I ever understood the problem well prior to reading this comment from Shafer. If Shafer is right, the CIA refused to share information because of a turf battle.
