<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/v/ABVD_12ba.html" title="Edit section: Indications">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Indications</span></h2>
<p>As of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, ABVD is widely used as the initial chemotherapy treatment for newly diagnosed Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other chemotherapy regimen that is widely used in this setting is the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_V_bb98.html" title="Stanford V">Stanford V</a> regimen.</p>

<p>Prior to the mid-1960's, advanced-stage Hodgkin disease was treated with single-agent <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemotherapy.html" title="Chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>, with fairly dismal long-term survival and cure rates. With advances in the understanding of chemotherapy resistance and the development of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_cancer_chemotherapy.html#Combination_chemotherapy" title="History of cancer chemotherapy">combination chemotherapy</a>, Vincent DeVita and George Canellos at the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Cancer_Institute_eeb0.html" title="National Cancer Institute">National Cancer Institute</a> (United States) developed the <a href="../../../m/o/p/MOPP_%28medicine%29_07ad.html" title="MOPP (medicine)">MOPP</a> regimen. This combination of <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechlorethamine.html" title="Mechlorethamine">mechlorethamine</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincristine.html" title="Vincristine">vincristine</a> (Oncovin), <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procarbazine.html" title="Procarbazine">procarbazine</a>, and <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prednisone.html" title="Prednisone">prednisone</a> proved capable of curing almost 70% of patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>While MOPP was remarkably successful in curing advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma, its <a href="../../../t/o/x/Toxicity.html" title="Toxicity">toxicity</a> remained significant. Aside from <a href="../../../m/y/e/Myelosuppression.html" title="Myelosuppression">bone marrow suppression</a>, frequent side effects included <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurotoxicity.html" title="Neurotoxicity">nerve injury</a> caused by vincristine and <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allergic_reaction.html" title="Allergic reaction">allergic reactions</a> to procarbazine. Long-term effects were also a concern, as patients were often cured and could expect long survival after chemotherapy. <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infertility.html" title="Infertility">Infertility</a> was a major long-term side effect, and even more seriously, the risk of developing treatment-related <a href="../../../m/y/e/Myelodysplasia.html" title="Myelodysplasia">myelodysplasia</a> or <a href="../../../a/c/u/Acute_leukemia.html" title="Acute leukemia">acute leukemia</a> was increased up to 14-fold in patients who received MOPP.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> These treatment-related <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hematological_malignancies.html" title="Hematological malignancies">hematological malignancies</a> peaked at 5 to 9 years after treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and were associated with a dismally poor prognosis.</p>

<p>Therefore, alternate regimens were tested in an attempt to avoid <a href="../../../a/l/k/Alkylating_agent.html" title="Alkylating agent">alkylating agents</a> (such as mechlorethamine), which were thought to be responsible for many of the long-term side effects of MOPP. ABVD was developed as a potentially less toxic and more effective alternative to MOPP; initial results with ABVD were published in 1975 by an <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> group led by Bonadonna.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>A number of trials then compared ABVD to previous regimens for Hodgkin's lymphoma. A large trial by <a href="../../../c/a/l/CALGB_2f57.html" title="CALGB">CALGB</a> suggested that ABVD was superior to MOPP, with a higher rate of overall response, less hematologic toxicity, better relapse-free survival, and better outcomes after relapse in the patients treated with ABVD.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Later studies confirmed the superiority of ABVD in terms of effectiveness, and also demonstrated that late side effects, such as treatment-related acute leukemia, were less common with ABVD as compared to MOPP.<sup id="_ref-santoro_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-santoro" title="">[6]</a></sup> Taken together, these results led ABVD to the replacement of MOPP with ABVD in the first-line treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/v/ABVD_12ba.html" title="Edit section: Administration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Administration</span></h2>
<p>One cycle of ABVD chemotherapy is typically given over 4 weeks, with two doses in each cycle (on day 1 and day 15). All four of the chemotherapy drugs are given <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intravenous.html" title="Intravenous">intravenously</a>. ABVD chemotherapy is usually given in the <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outpatient.html" title="Outpatient">outpatient</a> setting — that is, it does not require <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospitalization.html" title="Hospitalization">hospitalization</a>.</p>
<p>Typical dosages for one 28-day cycle of ABVD are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriamycin.html" title="Adriamycin">Adriamycin</a> 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 1 and 15</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleomycin.html" title="Bleomycin">Bleomycin</a> 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 1 and 15</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinblastine.html" title="Vinblastine">Vinblastine</a> 6 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 1 and 15</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/a/c/Dacarbazine.html" title="Dacarbazine">Dacarbazine</a> 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 1 and 15</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of cycles given depends upon the stage of the disease and how well the patient tolerates chemotherapy. Doses may be delayed because of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutropenia.html" title="Neutropenia">neutropenia</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrombocytopenia.html" title="Thrombocytopenia">thrombocytopenia</a>, or other side effects.</p>

<p>In the relative spectrum of cancer chemotherapy, ABVD is not a particularly toxic regimen. Side effects of ABVD can be divided into acute (those occurring while receiving chemotherapy) and delayed (those occurring months to years after completion of chemotherapy). Delayed side effects have assumed particular importance because many patients treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma are cured and can expect long lives after completion of chemotherapy.</p>
<p><a name="Acute_side_effects" id="Acute_side_effects"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/v/ABVD_12ba.html" title="Edit section: Acute side effects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Acute side effects</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Hair loss</b>, or <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alopecia.html" title="Alopecia">alopecia</a>, is a fairly common but not universal side effect of ABVD. Hair that is lost returns in the months after completion of chemotherapy.</li>
<li><b>Nausea and vomiting</b> can occur with ABVD, although treatments for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemotherapy.html#Nausea_and_vomiting" title="Chemotherapy">chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting</a> have improved substantially (see <i>Supportive care</i> below).</li>
<li><b>Low blood counts</b>, or <a href="../../../m/y/e/Myelosuppression.html" title="Myelosuppression">myelosuppression</a>, occur about 50% of the time with ABVD. Blood cell <a href="../../../g/-/c/G-CSF_179f.html" title="G-CSF">growth factors</a> are sometimes used to prevent this (see <i>Supportive care</i> below). Blood counts are checked frequently while receiving chemotherapy. Any fever or sign of infection that develops needs to be promptly evaluated; severe infections can develop rapidly in a person with a low <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_blood_cell.html" title="White blood cell">white blood cell</a> count due to chemotherapy.</li>
<li><b>Allergic reactions</b> to bleomycin can occur. A small test dose of bleomycin is often given prior to the first round of ABVD to screen for patients who may be allergic.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/v/ABVD_12ba.html" title="Edit section: Delayed side effects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Delayed side effects</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Infertility</b> is probably infrequent with ABVD. Several studies have suggested that, while <a href="../../../s/p/e/Sperm_count.html" title="Sperm count">sperm counts</a> in men decrease during chemotherapy, they return to normal after completion of ABVD.<sup id="_ref-santoro_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-santoro" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup> In women, <a href="../../../f/o/l/Follicle-stimulating_hormone.html" title="Follicle-stimulating hormone">follicle-stimulating hormone</a> levels remained normal while receiving ABVD, suggesting preserved ovarian function. Regardless of these data, fertility options (eg <a href="../../../s/p/e/Sperm_bank.html" title="Sperm bank">sperm banking</a>) should be discussed with an <a href="../../../o/n/c/Oncologist.html" title="Oncologist">oncologist</a> before beginning ABVD therapy.</li>
<li><b>Pulmonary toxicity</b>, or <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung.html" title="Lung">lung</a> damage, can occur with the use of <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleomycin.html" title="Bleomycin">bleomycin</a> in ABVD, especially when <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiation_therapy.html" title="Radiation therapy">radiation therapy</a> to the chest is also given as part of the treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma. This toxicity develops months to years after completing chemotherapy, and usually manifests as <a href="../../../c/o/u/Cough.html" title="Cough">cough</a> and <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dyspnea.html" title="Dyspnea">shortness of breath</a>. <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulmonary_function_test.html" title="Pulmonary function test">Pulmonary function tests</a> are often used to assess for bleomycin-related damage to the lungs. One study found bleomycin lung damage in 18% of patients receiving ABVD for Hodgkin's disease.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup> Retrospective analyses have questioned whether bleomycin is necessary at all;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup> however, at this point it remains a standard part of ABVD.</li>
<li><b>Cardiac toxicity</b>, or <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiomyopathy.html" title="Cardiomyopathy">cardiomyopathy</a>, can be a late side effect of <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriamycin.html" title="Adriamycin">adriamycin</a>. The occurrence of adriamycin-related cardiac toxicity is related to the total lifetime dose of adriamycin, and increases sharply in people who receive a cumulative dose of more than 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. Almost all patients treated with ABVD receive less than this dose (for 6 cycles of ABVD, the cumulative adriamycin dose is 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup>); therefore, adriamycin-related cardiac toxicity is very uncommon with ABVD.</li>
<li><b>Secondary malignancies</b>. Patients cured of Hodgkin's lymphoma remain at increased risk of developing other (secondary) cancers. Treatment-related <a href="../../../l/e/u/Leukemia.html" title="Leukemia">leukemias</a> are uncommon with ABVD, especially as compared with MOPP.<sup id="_ref-santoro_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-santoro" title="">[6]</a></sup> However, one study found a risk of second cancers as high as 28% at 25 years after treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma, although most of the patients in this study were treated with <a href="../../../m/o/p/MOPP_c55c.html" title="MOPP">MOPP</a> chemotherapy rather than ABVD.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[11]</a></sup> Many of these second cancers were <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung_cancer.html" title="Lung cancer">lung cancers</a> or, in women, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_cancer.html" title="Breast cancer">breast cancers</a>, emphasizing the importance of <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoking_cessation.html" title="Smoking cessation">smoking cessation</a> and regular <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preventive_care.html" title="Preventive care">preventive care</a> after completion of treatment. Radiation and chemotherapy probably both play a role in the development of these secondary malignancies; the exact contribution of chemotherapy such as ABVD can be difficult to tease out.</li>

<p>Significant advances in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiemetic.html" title="Antiemetic">antiemetic</a>, or anti-nausea, medications have been made in the beginning of the 21st century.
