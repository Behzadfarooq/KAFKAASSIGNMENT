<dd><tt>I would dispute whether in this instance a legal name (even for someone using a nom d'Ã©tape) qualifies as "very personal information".

I'd also note comparable information is also given for some <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Capelli_fc33.html" title="Jesse Capelli">similar stars</a>; the only reason I didn't list it as her birth name (as that example does) was because quick research is unable to determine if she is married... which detail might also better qualify as VPI.

<dd><tt>Mildly. The policy sounded sensible overall. In this particular case, she would fall under <b>"Pseudonymous individuals who have themselves deliberately disclosed their true name at some point, such as in a press release or interview with a member of the press"</b> (avoiding <b>"Wikipedia's policy of no original research prohibits us from being the first publisher of such information"</b>), but also under <b>"Articles about living individuals of marginal notability"</b> (since porn stars are mostly of interest only to porn stars, porn fans, and porn foes), <b>"Situations where the true name is not already well known by the public"</b> (hardly possible, as the stage name isn't either), and <b>"Cases where a safety concern is plausible"</b>, since she works "in the sex industry, which considers disclosure of a model or actor's true identity to be a safety problem".

<p>Hi. I see that you self-identified as an "SP". Are you an actual declared SP or did you just figure that you should be (laff). I need to know so that, as a Scientology in good standing, I will know how to treat you (grin). Also, if declared, are you famous or just a garden-variety SP? --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 07:09, 11 February 2007 (UTC), J&amp;D</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was called an SP back on alt.religion.scientology some years back, before the CoS heirarchy effectively banned their members from posting. As near as I can tell, I don't actually fit the profile listed on Wikipedia; I've just decided to accept the label. (Similarly, I've been called an asshole; without admitting it, I also no longer argue about that.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that Hubbard was a mediocre science fiction writer and an unindicted criminal con artist, but that this does not irredemably impeach the creed he (or anyone similar) has put forth. I suspect that the bulk of CoS membership exhibit a moral spectrum much the same as the membership of any other church (Catholic, Mormon, Jewish Reform, what have you), and the belief system not that much more deluded. I believe Tom Cruise is definitely whacko, but I think that tracing cause-and-effect with his membership in the CoS is doubtful.</dd>
<dd>I believe that a dominant contingent in the current CoS heirarchy are possibly self-deluded but definitely money-and-power motivated con artists. I believe this faction in the CoS leadership exhibit a collective tendency to vexatious litigation; that their use of Trade Secret and Copyright law to try and prevent disemination and discussion of their primary religious texts is intrinsically immoral; that many of the practices of the church amount to less-than-subtle brainwashing; and that the morality of this faction is unaltered from that which allegedly led to and attempted to cover up the deaths of several members of the CoS. I believe that the CoS is in dire need of a major internal Protestant Reformation, to "audit" the financial and organizational records and drive those currently running the show out. I believe that Henson's trial was a travesty of justice, possibly subverted by aid of CoS litigants, that the man is as threatening as a microwaved Marshmellow Peep, and that anyone with more brainpower than said Peep should be able to figure that out in about thirty seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I attended the University of Virginia; I thus quote Thomas Jefferson: "<i>I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.</i>" Based on present evidence, I judge that while the CoS may perhaps not be inherently so, in its present form it presently is one. This is why I have been called an SP, and the primary reason why I signed that way: because the sociopaths at the top of the CoS heirarchy would never label themselves so (howsovermuch they deserve it) and I do not wish anyone to possibly confuse me with one of them. <tt><a href="../../../a/b/b/User%7EAbb3w_fbee.html" title="User:Abb3w">Abb3w</a> 15:51, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</tt>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Speaking of the Peep, I think we see a bit of the same thing. I had seen reference to him over the years on the net but never bothered to find out what his story was. Now that I see a bit of it, I have to admit that he looks like a bit of a "dupe" to me. Egged on and applauded. Then gets in a spot of trouble and just has to serve a few months to put paid to it instead he flees his own country and wastes years over fears implanted in him by whom? Scientologists? I don't think so. At least not solely. But that is just a feeling that I am getting. Things are not always as they seem and anyone can make an anonymous "death threat". --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 22:09, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. Re Hubbard, as I said elsewhere, I have a viewpoint that I have never heard expressed by another Scientologist (due, no doubt, to the mostly self-inflicted social control that permeates the CoS) that Hubbard, like most "prophets" I imagine, is an imperfect tool in the hands of the divine (call it what you will). And, like most religions, Scientology has a hard time with the imperfections of its "prophet" and Hubbard's flaws, unlike others, are recent and documented. But Scientologists are, by and large, intelligent people and they see the imperfections but understand that concentrating on imperfections in your leader is as potentially disasterous as concentrating on imperfections in your spouse. What is really important in the CoS (or in a marriage) is agreement on what you are seeking to accomplish. Personally, I have studied enough Scientology, other religions, science, and philosophy to consider Hubbard's work an incredible creation that overarches and encompasses them all. It may have flaws (and it may have traded its possible <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protoscience.html" title="Protoscience">protoscience</a> status for <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogma.html" title="Dogma">dogma</a> as I mention on my user page) but it is an incredible effort. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 16:18, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wish you good fortune. Having been raised Catholic, I can see the value of a Reformation, and people such as yourself within the CoS are the best hope for such. Unfortunately, I believe the CoS has stamped heavily on the various groups that tried and failed at reform-from-within and schismed over this; beware of being branded a heretic. <tt><a href="../../../a/b/b/User%7EAbb3w_fbee.html" title="User:Abb3w">Abb3w</a> 16:24, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</tt>
