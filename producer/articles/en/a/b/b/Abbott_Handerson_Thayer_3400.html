As a painter of portraits, figures, animals and landscapes, he enjoyed a certain prominence during his lifetime, as shown by the fact that his paintings are in the most important U.S. art collections. In the last third of his life, he worked together with his son, Gerald Handerson Thayer, on a major book about <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protective_coloration.html" title="Protective coloration">protective coloration</a> in nature, titled <i>Concealing Coloration in the Animal Kingdom: An Exposition of the Laws of Disguise Through Color and Pattern; Being a Summary of Abbott H.

First published by Macmillan in 1909, then reissued in 1918, it had a widespread impact on the use of military <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camouflage.html" title="Camouflage">camouflage</a> during World War I. He also influenced American art through his efforts as a teacher, taking on apprentices in his <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_86db.html" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> studio.</p>

<p>Thayer was born in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. The son of a country doctor, his childhood was spent in rural New Hampshire, near <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keene%2C_New_Hampshire_4507.html" title="Keene, New Hampshire">Keene</a>, at the foot of <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Monadnock_0ac0.html" title="Mount Monadnock">Mount Monadnock</a>. In that rural setting, he became an amateur <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_history.html" title="Natural history">naturalist</a> (in his own words, he was “bird crazy”), a hunter and a trapper. He also experimented with <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxidermy.html" title="Taxidermy">taxidermy</a> and developed a life-long interest in art by making watercolor paintings of animals.</p>
<p>At age 18, he moved to <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, to study painting at the Brooklyn Art School and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Academy_of_Design_3847.html" title="National Academy of Design">National Academy of Design</a>. In 1875, having married Kate Bloede, he moved to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, where he studied for four years at the <a href="../../../%C3%A9/c/o/%C3%89cole_des_Beaux-Arts_180b.html" title="École des Beaux-Arts">École des Beaux-Arts</a>, with <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Lehmann_f2bc.html" title="Henri Lehmann">Henri Lehmann</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-L%C3%A9on_G%C3%A9rome_e6f9.html" title="Jean-Léon Gérome">Jean-Léon Gérome</a>, and where his closest friend became the American artist <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_de_Forest_Brush_cadf.html" title="George de Forest Brush">George de Forest Brush</a>.

<p>Life became all but unbearable for Thayer and his wife in the early 1880s, when two of their small children died unexpectedly, just one year apart. Emotionally devastated, they gradually left New York. In 1898, Thayer visited <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Ives%2C_Cornwall_d8d7.html" title="St Ives, Cornwall">St Ives, Cornwall</a> and, carrying an introductory letter from C. Hart Merrian, the Chief of the US Biological Survey in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, applied to the lord of the Manor of St Ives and Treloyhan, Henry Arthur Mornington Wellesley, the 3rd Earl Cowley, for permission to collect specimens of birds from the cliffs at St Ives. In 1901, he and his wife settled permanently in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin%2C_New_Hampshire_7b1a.html" title="Dublin, New Hampshire">Dublin, New Hampshire</a>, where they had often vacationed and where Thayer had grown up. Soon after, when her father died, Thayer’s wife lapsed into an irreversible depression, which led to her confinement in an asylum, the decline of her health, and eventual death.</p>

<p>Soon after, Thayer married their long-time friend, Emma Beach, whose father owned <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Sun_acfc.html" title="The New York Sun">The New York Sun</a>. He and his second wife spent their remaining years in rural New Hampshire, living and working productively with the three remaining Thayer children, Mary, Gerald and Gladys. Throughout this latter part of his life, among Thayer’s Dublin neighbors was George de Forest Brush, with whom (when they were not quarreling) he collaborated on matters pertaining to camouflage.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbott_Handerson_Thayer_3400.html" title="Edit section: Artistic achievements">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Artistic achievements</span></h3>
<p>It is difficult to speak simply and conclusively about Thayer as an artist. He was often described in first person accounts as eccentric and mercurial, and there is a parallel contradictory mix of academic tradition, spontaneity and improvisation in his artistic methods. For example, he is largely known as a painter of “ideal figures,” in which he portrayed women as embodiments of virtue, adorned in flowing white tunics and equipped with feathered angel’s wings. At the same time, he did this using methods that were surprisingly unorthodox, unfettered and surprising, such as purposely mixing dirt into the paint, or (in one instance at least) using a broom instead of a brush to lessen the sense of rigidity in a newly finished, still wet painting. He survived with the help of his patrons, among them the industrialist <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lang_Freer_005c.html" title="Charles Lang Freer">Charles Lang Freer</a>. Some of his finest works are in the collections of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freer_Gallery_of_Art_42f9.html" title="Freer Gallery of Art">Freer Gallery of Art</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_e36a.html" title="Metropolitan Museum of Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Academy_of_Design_3847.html" title="National Academy of Design">National Academy of Design</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Museum_of_American_Art_c779.html" title="National Museum of American Art">National Museum of American Art</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Institute_of_Chicago_39a8.html" title="Art Institute of Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a>.</p>

<p>Thayer was also resourceful in his teaching, which he saw as a useful, inseparable part of his own studio work. Among his devoted apprentices were <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockwell_Kent_677a.html" title="Rockwell Kent">Rockwell Kent</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Agassiz_Fuertes_81a2.html" title="Louis Agassiz Fuertes">Louis Agassiz Fuertes</a>, Richard Meryman, Barry Faulkner (Thayer’s cousin), Alexander and William James (the sons of Harvard philosopher <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_James_2cca.html" title="William James">William James</a>), and Thayer’s own son and daughter, Gerald and Gladys.</p>
<p>In a letter to Thomas W. Dewing (c.1917, in the collection of the Archives of American Art, <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smithsonian_Institution_925c.html" title="Smithsonian Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>), Thayer reveals that his method was to work on a new painting for only three days. If he worked longer on it, he said, he would either accomplish nothing or would ruin it. So on the fourth day, he would instead take a break, getting as far from the work as possible, but meanwhile instruct each student to make an exact copy of that three-day painting. Then, when he did return to his studio, he would (in his words) “pounce on a copy and give it a three-day shove again.” As a result, he would of course end up with alternate versions of the same painting, in substantially different finished states.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbott_Handerson_Thayer_3400.html" title="Edit section: Camouflage contributions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Camouflage contributions</span></h3>
<p>Thayer is sometimes referred to as the “father of camouflage.” This is not entirely unreasonable, because, while he did not invent camouflage, he was undoubtedly one of the first to conduct extensive research on and to write about certain aspects of protective coloration in nature. In particular, beginning in 1892, he wrote about the function of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Countershading.html" title="Countershading">countershading</a> in nature, by which forms appear less round and less solid through inverted shading, by which he accounted for the white undersides of animals. This finding is widely accepted today, and is sometimes now called <i>Thayer’s Law</i>.</p>
<p>He first became involved in military camouflage in 1898, during the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish-American_War_1510.html" title="Spanish-American War">Spanish-American War</a>, when he and his friend Brush proposed the use of protective coloration on American ships, using countershading. While the war did not last long enough for anything to come of this, the two artists did obtain a patent for their idea in 1902, titled “Process of Treating the Outsides of Ships, etc., for Making Them Less Visible” (<i>U.S. Patent No. 715,013</i>), in which their method is described as having been modeled on the coloration of a <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gull.html" title="Gull">seagull</a>.</p>
<p>Thayer and Brush’s experiments in camouflage continued into <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, sometimes working in tandem, sometimes not. Early in that war, for example, Brush developed a transparent airplane, while Thayer continued his interest in disruptive or high difference camouflage, which was not unlike what British ship camouflage designer <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Wilkinson_%28artist%29_1872.html" title="Norman Wilkinson (artist)">Norman Wilkinson</a> would call <a href="../../../d/a/z/Dazzle_camouflage.html" title="Dazzle camouflage">dazzle camouflage</a> (a term that may have been inspired by Thayer’s writings, since he had earlier referred to disruptive patterns in nature as “razzle dazzle.”)</p>
<p>Gradually, Thayer and Brush increasingly entrusted their camouflage work to the responsibility of their sons. <i>Concealing Coloration in the Animal Kingdom</i> (1909), which had taken seven years to prepare, was listed as having been written by Thayer’s son, Gerald. At about the same time, Thayer once again proposed ship camouflage to the U.S. Navy (and was again unsuccessful), this time working not with Brush, but with his son, Gerome (named in honor of his father's teacher).</p>
<p>A few years later, with the start of World War I, Thayer ineptly made proposals to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_War_Office_abbf.html" title="British War Office">British War Office</a>, trying to persuade them to adopt a disruptively patterned field service uniform, in place of monochrome <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khaki.html" title="Khaki">khaki</a>. Meanwhile, Thayer and Gerome Brush’s proposal for the use of countershading in ship camouflage was approved for use on American ships, and a handful of Thayer enthusiasts (among them Barry Faulkner and other Thayer students) recruited hundreds of artists to join the American Camouflage Corps.</p>

<p>By his own admission, Thayer often suffered from a condition that today is called <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipolar_disorder.html" title="Bipolar disorder">bipolar disorder</a>. In his letters, he described it as “the Abbott pendulum,” by which his emotions precariously swung back and forth between the two extremes of (in his words) “all-wellity” and “sick disgust.” This condition apparently worsened as the controversy grew about his camouflage findings (most notably when they were denounced by former U.S. President <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>). As he aged, he increasingly suffered from <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panic_attacks.html" title="Panic attacks">panic attacks</a> (which he called “fright-fits”), nervous exhaustion, and suicidal thoughts, so much so that he was no longer allowed to go out in his boat alone on <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin_Pond_2847.html" title="Dublin Pond">Dublin Pond</a>.</p>
<p>At age 72, Thayer was disabled by a series of strokes, and died quietly at home on May 29, 1921.</p>
