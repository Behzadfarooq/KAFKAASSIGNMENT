<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/b/Talk%7EABBA_2419.html" title="Edit section: ABBA musical genres">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">ABBA musical genres</span></h2>
<p>I have added 'Rock and Roll' to the musical genre list as ABBA are a 'Rock and Roll' group whether they are 'Popular' or not. This is not just an odd bout of madness as ABBA have been referred to as a Rock and Roll band many times up until recently. 'Pop' is actually a group rather than a genre hence Eminem is Pop, yet he is nothing like the Beatles and ABBA.</p>
<p>ABBA have even done a few heavier Rock songs ('Watch Out' being the most notable) and the drums beats on 'Hey, Hey Helen' are stereotypically Rock drum beats....I am a drummer in a Folk Heavy/Medium Rock group. I think the guitar solos in songs like the album version of 'I'm a Marionette' are very stereotypically Rocking. It is also worth noting that a lot of the Disco songs are much more 'Rocking' live. The full version of the disco song 'Eagle' also has a very Rock and Roll section...though that is a Disco song undeniably.</p>
<p>They do Disco songs but they are not really a Disco group (neither are the Bee Gees really...though there is nothing wrong with Disco or Disco bands), they only do one really Disco Album and a few disco songs that appear on albums from round about the same time. I don't think we should remove 'Disco' from musical styles part however 'Rock and Roll' has a right to be included on this page as they did more Rock and Roll songs than disco songs (I own all the albums apart from some combilation albums, ABBA Live and 'Gracias Por La Música' which is a Spanish language combilation album').</p>
<p>I would hardly call ABBA a pop group during the eighties as they were far from popular!</p>
<p>- <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctor_Hesselius_cc91.html" title="User:Doctor Hesselius">User:Doctor_Hesselius</a></p>
<p>I think that ABBA mostly is a Pop group. As said in the [pop music|pop music] article, ABBA initiated a new revolution of pop. But think about it, ABBA's biggest hits: 'Dancing Queen' and 'Fernando'. Are they even close to being Rock'n'roll?</p>
<p>You talk about 'Watch out' and 'Hey, Hey Helen', but these were hits from their early years. Most of their hits in the latest 70's, when they were pretty well known, were Pop. Rock'n'roll was present in some of their songs yes, so I think we should leave it there in the Genre section.</p>
<p>But in the main page, we should keep it pop. ABBA has far more pop songs than rock'n'roll ones.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/e/t/User%7EDetlefaus_c375.html" title="User:Detlefaus">From Detlef to Faus</a> 18:26, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Even if they did have 'far more' pop songs than Rock and Roll songs it still should say 'Rock and Roll' in the genre section as you have pointed out. The genre section did include 'Rock and Roll' until very recently. Also 'Pop' is really what is popular at the time...a lot of people do not think of it as a proper genre. I am happy with leaving 'Pop Group' in the main section as they are indeed a 'Pop Group' (as they are indeed popular!).</p>
<p>'Pop' used to stand for Popular music (I know this as a musician) however in the era of musical elitist I don't really know. 'Pop' is a group rather than a genre, Wikipedia even acknowledges that it is made out of different genres though it still classifies it as a genre.</p>
<p>Are ABBA rappers or Hip hoppers? Hip Hop and Rap is THE Pop music of today. It you go throw the albums from 'Ring, Ring' onwards you will find that most of the songs use Rock techniques and thus fall into the Rock category.</p>
<p>ABBA's style is very much like sixties Rock and Roll, maybe because my music is mostly sixties Rock and Roll I can notivce this. Some ABBA songs are heavier than a lot of sixties Rock and Roll songs but some are not. They did Disco, Rock and Roll and many other styles.........I will not count 'Europop' as that is the studidest 'genre' I have ever heard of!</p>
<p>Fernando is an odd song and is hardly like a 'Pop song' at all (if what most Wikipedians define as a pop song is true). 'Dancing Queen' is a disco song (Disco like Rock and Roll is it's own genre though in the 70s it was put into the Pop group due to it's popularity). On 'Ring Ring' all songs are Rock and Roll songs like the Rock and Roll songs from the sixties Including the song 'Rock &amp; Roll Band'. On 'Waterloo' even the title track is a Rock and Roll song as is 'Watch Out' and 'King Kong Song' and 'Ring Ring' (also on Ring Ring, it is light Rock and Roll like a lot of sixties songs....though the drumbeat is fairly heavy). On 'ABBA' there was 'Mamma Mia' (Yes it is Rock and Roll, again more like sixties Rock and Roll than seventies....guitars solos, heavy-ish drumbeat what more could you ask for?). SOS (Rock and Roll ballad), Hey Hey Helen (really Rocking!), Man in The Middle, Rock Me (obviously!!!), So Long and the US. Folk Song Medley though this would technically be 'Folk Rock' (though the 'On Top of Old Smokey' part is done in a similar style to Fernando I suppose).......my band is a Folk Rock band so I give two thumbs up. On Arrival there is 'Knowing Me, Knowing You', 'Tiger' and 'Why Did It have To Be Me?'. Skip Voulez-Vous as that is all disco apart from 'Chiquitita' and possibly 'The King Has Lost His Crown'. On 'Super Trouper' there was 'Elaine', 'Me and I', 'On and On and On' and looking back at some sixties songs 'Super Trouper' does classify also.</p>
<p>Before you say that a lot of the songs I have mentioned are catchy I would like to point out that 1) Almost all the songs by Queen are catchy 2) Most Who songs are 3) most Beatles songs are 4) Most The Sweet songs are...........these are again Rock and Roll bands, ones I also happe to like. Also:</p>
<p>1) ABBA were nominated for entry to 'The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame'.....though unlike unimportant rubbish like 'The Sex Pistols' they didn't get in this time round.</p>
<p>2) Agnetha and Frida are both at #70 on 'VH1's 100 Greatest Women of Rock N Roll'...........why they are not higher is beyond me!</p>
<p>I don't really care about the main section but taking away 'Rock and Roll' from the genre section would make the article one sided as many do think of ABBA as a Rock and Roll band and they did do Rock and Roll songs. Taking it away would make the article somewhat incorrect and bias against the people who consider them a Rock and Roll band (which includes celebrities, music experts, my friends, me and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominators and VH1!).</p>
<p>- Hesselius.</p>
<p>Sure, you have a good point. Let's just remember that 'Ring Ring' was an album that didn't leave Sweden at that time, so it isn't usually classified as an ABBA album; and in addition, the name of the band wasn't ABBA by that time. It was "Agnetha, Björn, Benny and Frida". <a href="../../../d/e/t/User%7EDetlefaus_c375.html" title="User:Detlefaus">Detlef</a> 16:40, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah true though it should be counted as an ABBA album due to the officially re-release.&#160;;)</p>
<p>-Hesselius.</p>
<p>Ring Ring *was* released outside Sweden at the time - in Australia, South Africa, Japan and Mexico (if not other countries as well) in 1973/74, in West Germany in 1974 or 75 (repackaged as Honey, Honey), and reissued in Australia in 1975 under the ABBA banner.</p>

<p>Why add "Like The Beatles, they are considered to be..." in the introduction? Why mention Beatles at all? ABBA is ABBA and they don't need The Beatles comparison as a sort of validation. Also, as much as I like ABBA they are not in the same league as The Beatles. Probably, ABBA are comparable with The Beatles sales-wise worldwide, except the United States, but The Beatles were not only bestselling group and music innovators, they were also a social phenomenon. ABBA is just a very popular group, no more than that, and ABBA members themseves always stressed that.</p>
<p>User:Scholar91</p>
<p>No. The Beatles were not a social phenomenon. Pop music groups are not social phenomena. That's twaddle. They made good music but the Beatles mystique is hype and "jumping on the bandwagonism'. I like the way ABBA was unpretentious. They considered themselves entertainers. That's what they were. That's what the Beatles were.</p>
<p><br />
I agree. I think we should only compare them if we are talking about the albums sold. If we want to say that only The Beatles and Elvis sold more than ABBA.</p>
<p>But if we don't say that, there is no need.</p>
<p>Detlef.</p>
<p>Since this is the English-language Wikipedia ABBA article, and there are Wikipedia articles about ABBA available in other languages, I believe it is important to keep in mind the audience reading this particular article. In the US, the biggest and most influential English language pop music market in the world, general comparison of ABBA with The Beatles would seem laughable. ABBA were and still are very successful here, but not only their American sales are no match to The Beatles', as musicians and personalities ABBA are quite anonymous and faceless. Also, unlike The Beatles and quite a few other acts, ABBA don't exert any substantial cultural significance and/or influence in America. For example, there's only one small-format book about ABBA written by the US author, but even this author was born and raised outside the US.</p>
<p>I am convinced that for a Wikipedia ABBA article to be credible it is crucial for the contributors to keep their "fan emotions" (if they are ABBA fans) under control, keep the FACTS straight and think about those who will be reading this article. It's not a place to vent an unabashed enthusiasm for the favorite artist. It's an encyclopedia entry, not a hagiography.</p>
<p>User:Scholar91</p>
<p>Yes, Scholar91, I do agree with you. This encyclopedia should and must be impartial, and in my opinion it's not acceptable to compare The Beatles with ABBA.</p>

<p>Detlefaus, Can you remove that Beatles reference form the Introduction and perhaps leave only that "they are one the most popular bands of all time" or "in the history of popular music"? For some reason I can't do it, because in order to edit the Introduction I have to go for an option "edit this page" (there's no separate "edit" for Introduction) and when I try to save the page, part of the article goes missing.</p>

<p>ABBA are internationally big, as any American would find out by reading the page. Whether or not ABBA are as big in the US is not really important. It is a fact that both ABBA and the Beatles are the biggest bands ever. Adding something saying that the Beatles and ABBA are both considered 'big bands' is not 'fan emotions' and it certainly isn't trying to compare the two bands or say that one is better than the other, it is about facts, it is an impartial comment however saying that they are one of the biggest bands of all time is acceptable aslong as it does say "ONE of the biggest....". The part about Popular music is not needed as they are bigger than most non-popular musicians anyway.&#160;;-)</p>
<p>- Hesselius.</p>
<p>- Hesselius.</p>
<p>Hesselius, I still don't understand why you want this Beatles comparison in the article. It does not add any REAL information about ABBA as a group. "Internationally big" means many things and not only sales, but, really, ABBA can only be compared with Beatles sales-wise. At least, at this point in history. You can't seriously compare their cultural and social impact. If you really want that Beatles comparison to be included, I think you should say that "commercially" ABBA is one of the biggest bands of all time. Like Billboard wrote (September 6, 1979), "Abba's record sales have equalled most of the achievements of the Beatles in the 1960s". There are some later references to that effect, but again it's about sales not overall impact.</p>
<p>Scholar91 22:46, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Re-read what I have said. I am not comparing them however both are very big bands, I am happy with it saying ABBA are "one of the biggest bands..". ABBA are not only commercially big hence they are icons of the seventies, yes the Beatles are (now) bigger but that doesn't matter, that is not the point. The point is that ABBA are the Beatles are the biggest bands due to record sales and musical impact. Adding something saying that "like the Beatles, ABBA are considered to be one of the biggest bands ever" isn't anti-Beatle or anti-ABBA. I really do not understand you objection to having a mention of the Beatles in this article (which it had for a long time until it was removed recently), is it an anti-ABBA thing or an anti-Beatle thing? It does seem a bit strange getting uptight because the Beatles were mentioned in a fact!</p>
<p>We shall just have "ABBA are considered to be one of the biggest bands ever" as that would be factual and would stop all the "Beatles should not get any mention despite they were the biggest band until ABBA arrived in the seventies" stuff. We should also remove any mention of Elvis out of the Beatles article.</p>

<p>When reading the most recent revisions of Introduction to ABBA article, it struck me how useless and unproductive it is to try to make it a *normal* encyclopedia entry . There will always be additions making this article look like a joke.</p>
<p>1. "ABBA (1972–1982) was a Swedish pop music group characterised by an uplifting but melancholic sound."</p>
<p>"uplifting but melancholic sound"?? What is it, some kind of an <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxymoron.html" title="Oxymoron">oxymoron</a>, or a superficial chit-chat?</p>
<p>2. "They remain a fixture of radio playlists and continue to shift many hit singles and albums."</p>
<p>ABBA continue to shift hit singles?? What was the last hit single they have "shifted"? And - "remain a fixture", "continue to shift" - that's hardly a style appropriate for an encyclopedia entry.</p>
<p>3. "They have singlehandedly placed Swedish music in the mainstream, and done much to establish pure pop as an equal among more "hip" music genres." "In early 1982 the uncharaceristically intense title track – which has been since linked to Joy Division, Giorgio Moroder and the Beatles' "Tomorrow Never Knows"</p>
<p>These are examples of what's called typical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words" rel="nofollow">Weasel Words</a></p>
<p>I'm giving up on this article...</p>
<p>Scholar91 12:54, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is wikipedia for you, Weasel words and biased views run riot. Commonsense is substituted for strange opinions (aka the <a href="../../../h/y/g/Hygelac.html" title="Hygelac">Hygelac</a> article and the <a href="../../../g/e/a/Geats.html" title="Geats">Geats</a> article!). _________</p>
<p>This is what I read in the "history comments": "Reinstated useful and atypical single-sentence ABBA info [as opposed to the over-indulgent, quotes-heavy and ABBA-buff-like nature of much of the bio's text])"</p>
<p>Since it was me who put the majority of those quotes into the bio, I need to give a brief explanation. The idea was to give the scope of how the pop music establshment as represented by the critics at the time viewed ABBA. Not some "useful and atypical single-sentence ABBA info" coming from nobody but direct quotes from some very prominent cultural commentators, like <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Frith_9361.html" title="Simon Frith">Simon Frith</a>, for example. It may be "quotes-heavy" but it gives a factually accurate and competent analysis of ABBA legacy coming from professional critics not shunning the critical views of the group. As it often happens with articles written by fans, the "analysis" ultimately ends up as an ode to the artist. "ABBA-buff-like nature" probably means that it's written by people who try to be as factually accurate as possible and try to avoid all those well-known superficial and glossy (and wrong) cliches - "bigger than Volvo". "singlehandedly put Sweden onto music map" etc - associated with ABBA and prefer to give less known but no less important information about the band.</p>
<p>Scholar91 15:01, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But "uplifting but melancholic" is a great description of ABBA's music. Look at Mamma Mia - the happiest sounding song in the known universe, but it's the point of view of a woman who's man continually cheats on her, but she just can't leave.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anonymous,</p>
<p>But this is YOUR own subjective - basically, a weasel worded - description of ABBA music inappropriately thrown into the Introduction about the group, and such descriptions are completely unsuitable for Wikipedia that's supposed to be an encyclopedia and not an exercise of subjective opinions of contributors. Unfortunately, descriptions like yours make many Wikipedia entries a joke.</p>
<p>You can refer to the printed opinions of professional critics, musicologists, musicians - people who are more or less qualified to do it - when discussing ABBA music in the article, and that will be fine.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I looked in here. This article has always been a bit problematic, as with many Wikipedia articles that have a fairly large audience, but it is truly getting out of hand. Basically, the article is WAAAAY too long and over-detailed - obsessively so - and needs a great big editorial axe taking to it. Trouble is, any attempt is likely to be controversial, as everyone seemingly has their favourite factoid they feel precious about. I'm not saying it's all bad - there is a useful amount of North-American info added, though again perhaps over details. May I suggest that merging the whole lot into one great big timeline is making the article unwieldy? Perhaps a better idea is to have a main career overview timeline, followed by an "Abba in North America" section that condenses and separates that info into one section? That might be a start. But a bigger axe than that is still needed. Who is going to be brave enough to wield it? Contributors need to take a step back and as objectively as possible, ask themselves whether much of what is here could be scrubbed without losing the overall picture. I believe a shorter article (much like it started out) would be of much higher quality. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 09:53, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Compared with other Wikipedia entries - see Roxette, for example - ABBA article is relatively short. Still, I would cut Trivia section</p>
<p>Scholar91 18:04, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Make separate articles for various subject matters, put short summaries of these into the main article. For example, a lot of the history and discussion of various albums can be farmed out into separate articles on each album. The solo careers shouldn't be in here at all (all 4 members have their own pages). One could even have articles such as "Fashion inspired by Abba", or "Abba live" on their live performances.

<p>I agree that WP is not a directory but excising *everything* that's not "official" is swinging the pendulum too far in the other direction.

<p><i>For</i> -</p>
<ol>
<li>Few things could be considered more relevant than a link to a site specifically devoted to covering the topic of the article.</li>
<li>Many (most?) other articles about popular bands have at least one link to a fan site. (See <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blondie_%28band%29.html" title="Blondie (band)">Blondie</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixie_Chicks_777c.html" title="Dixie Chicks">Dixie Chicks</a>.) No compelling reason has been offered why this article must be an exception.</li>
<li>Listing something than the official source is just good journalism. Third-party resources about a topic are at the heart of including diverse views, and not giving the official source a monopoly.</li>
<li>The fear has been expressed that adding a single good fansite to the external links will cause a run of people trying to link other fansites to the article. I disagree. People will try to add other fansites to the article whether we list zero or one. I don't see how adding a single fansite will cause people to try to add other fansites in greater numbers. In fact, it's quite the opposite: The lack of even *one* fansite rather screams to WP editors familiar with music-related articles that an unofficial source is "missing", and they may seek to rectify that by adding one.</li>
<li>Even if adding a single fansite caused people to try to add even more fansites, that would not be a good argument for not including the one fansite. One might as well say, "We shouldn't have an article about George W. Bush, because it will be a target for vandalism and heated exchange." Our decisions about what goes into the articles should be based on what's good for the article, not on what others might do in response.</li>
<li>A con argument is essentially that "we have to open it up to everyone [all the fansites] or to no one". Such a claim is bizzarre. There's nothing stopping editors from agreeing on the best (or best handful) of external links -- the same as they do with all other articles.</li>

<li>It is only necessary to provide the link to ABBAsite and Users can select any site they want from there. This also stops everyone bickering on their site being more important than others and therefore should be added.

<li>History says a lot. Once there were 5 links to fansites, then this ballooned to 30 - 50. Pruning was constant. If the official site has the links to the others already, what is the issue then? The article is about ABBA, not to promote fansites. 60.234.242.196 07:43, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Frankly, I'm having a hard time accepting arguments from someone who puts CON arguments in the PRO section of an RfC, and whose understanding of consensus is certainly not informed by his or her ability to spell that word correctly.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is just rudeness, not discussion. 60.234.242.196 22:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for the supposed consensus, I see agreement from exactly two (count 'em) registered editors here, way back in April. When you say "Concensus [sic] is very compelling" based on the comments of two registered editors, that strikes me as kind of silly.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I count 3 who participated. Regardless of them being registered or not. I count 0 who wanted the links to stay. Before you comment that I cannot count either, again, knowledge of the original discussion allows me to know that two of the comments were from the same person.60.234.242.196 22:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Besides, WP is a living, breathing project. No decision gets to be set in stone forever. Consensus is never final.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. That is why you have raised this discussion, and that is why I am commenting on it. Just because my opinion differs does not make me wrong (or correct). You 'attack' back and did not even qualify any answers. 60.234.242.196 22:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for where the pro statements came from, please note that the heading says "Statements by editors previously involved in the dispute." It does NOT say "Previous statements by editors."</p>
<dl>
<dd>This does not explain where the comments come from. 60.234.242.196 22:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your other concerns are already covered in my Pro arguments. Also, I have not seen any compelling reason as to why the ABBA article should be different from so many other band articles, which freely list at least one good fansite. -<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbluejay_da97.html" title="User:Michaelbluejay">MichaelBluejay</a> 07:35, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Your other concerns are already covered in my Pro arguments." I do not agree. However you have answered where the comments came from (i.e. "my" Pro arguments.) As for compelling reasons, I stated several reasons, with the most important being that it was agreed to - that is why it is different to other band articles. That is the only difference. As you say consensus is never final. So remember 'why' you put this up for discussion, and allow Users to discuss it without being insulted, and respect their views also. 60.234.242.196 22:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The intro should, IMO, contain the names of the four musicians, and how they are related.</p>
<p>It should explain where the name ABBA came from.</p>
<p>It should not contain such details as who could and couldn't write music.</p>

<p>One jerk has removed ALL quotes from press reviews/features about Abba that were in the article before and noone seems to care. Does it indicate it's "better" to have a dumbed down version without any decent analysis of ABBA legacy whatsoever? Sad..</p>

<dd>We have to look it up, however I noticed that someone really removed the quotes from that part of the article. In my opinion, they should be reinstated, even if the article is too big. That's because we cannot have an article without the quotes from the legacy. Lately, I have been doing some images/minor changes to the article only.</dd>

<p>If you care about this article, put your effort where it is best used - organise the information, then clean up the writing. Once the whole article is rewritten for clarity and flow, it will be clear which information is dross and can be removed. Two points for editing: (1)Main Idea First. (2)Just because it is true, does not mean it belongs in an encyclopedia article. Encyclopedias are mot meant to be meticulously detailed. I don't know whether the article has been dumbed down or not; I just know that it is nigh unreadable. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonstew_f96e.html" title="User:Ronstew">Ronstew</a> 17:06, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>No. After reading the ABBA article at the time, I thought those quotes were getting a little bit tiresome. Every single paragraph contained at least one quote, and there were many paragraphs in this article. In fact, the <i>reviews</i> for their last two albums had their own paragraphs! Do you really think people really care about the opinion of a few music magazines? 137.205.24.50 11:22, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I started cleaning up this article since it is full of things which shouldn't be written in an Encyclopedia file. Such things as: trivia, awards, curiosities. I did this because many people have been asking the editors to make the article conciser, more objective, etc. However, I didn't delete anything. The trivia is still in the article, but where it should be (if it talked about SOS, then it's in the SOS part). The awards, and parodies are in other pages since they aren't specifically about ABBA.</p>
<p>I haven't started yet to clean/organize the texts. Help is indeed needed, because the removal of remaining weasel words, unsubstanciated claims and unnecessary information (like if ABBA could or could not write music) is a tough job.</p>
<p>Some pictures have also been added to illustrate the article more, but feel free to remove them if you think it's flooding the article (which I don't, since it's nice to illustrate). Nevertheless, the removal of trash should be the priority.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the talk page, some templates have been added (which I think will help), plus the archive has been made. If you need to re-discuss any of the archive subjects, just bring them up again here.</p>
<p>Despite all these problems, our big one is that <b>we NEED MORE REFERENCES.</b></p>
