<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/b/Abby_Lockhart_16cd.html" title="Edit section: Beginnings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beginnings</span></h2>
<p>The character of <b>Abby Lockhart</b> first appears in season 6 of <i><a href="../../../e/r/_/ER_%28TV_series%29_ba94.html" title="ER (TV series)">ER</a></i> in the episode "Great Expectations." Appearing as a recurring character of an <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obstetrics.html" title="Obstetrics">obstetrics</a> <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurse.html" title="Nurse">nurse</a>, Abby helped Carol Hathaway through the complications of labor and went on to become the heart and soul of the show after Margulies's departure. After the November episode, three months later, Abby became a regular character as a third-year medical student beginning her ER rotation. She had taken a hiatus from medical school and become a full time obstetrics nurse to provide for her then-husband Richard Lockhart's law school education, but once they divorced, she resumed her medical training. Later on, at the start of Abby's final year of medical school, <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerry_Weaver_9c29.html" title="Kerry Weaver">Kerry Weaver</a> breaks the news to her that her registration for that quarter has been denied for lack of payment. Abby confronts her ex-husband to discover that he has stopped paying her tuition because he is bankrupt. She resumes her part-time OB nursing job, and soon Weaver offers her a full-time ER nursing position. Abby agrees to take the job.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>–<a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> season, Abby is visited by her mother, Maggie (played by <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally_Field_fe83.html" title="Sally Field">Sally Field</a>), who suffers from <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipolar_disorder.html" title="Bipolar disorder">bipolar disorder</a>. Abby's childhood is revealed to be very difficult. During her childhood, she was forced to cope with her mother's erratic behavior when she was not taking her medicine. She also had to deal with her mother's long absences, and had to take care of her younger brother Eric (played by <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Everett_Scott_80ea.html" title="Tom Everett Scott">Tom Everett Scott</a>).</p>
<p>The audience later meets Eric, who has been in the Air Force but has now left. He too is showing signs of bipolar disorder, but refuses to accept this.</p>
<p>Abby's father, Eddie, left the family when Abby was a child, due at least in part to Maggie's uncontrollable behavior. Abby reunited with her father (<a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Ward_c101.html" title="Fred Ward">Fred Ward</a>) in season 13, when he initially approached her under the disguise of being a patient named Eddie Jackson before finally revealing his true identity to her.</p>
<p>Throughout her stay at County General, Abby Lockhart is humanly friendly, well-liked by most of the staff and open when it comes to talking and listening, yet she stays humble and cautious on subjects about her personal life. She has befriended many colleagues in the ER who have come and gone, particularly the female co-workers including Carol Hathaway and Susan Lewis, and later on Elizabeth Corday and Kerry Weaver. Currently she is the longest residing female doctor in the County ER and has become the head female figure on the show.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/b/Abby_Lockhart_16cd.html" title="Edit section: Personal Life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personal Life</span></h2>
<p>Soon after taking the position in the ER, Abby begins a relationship with <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Luka_Kova%C4%8D_a3cd.html" title="Dr. Luka Kovač">Dr. Luka Kovač</a>. After about a year, Luka asks Abby to move in with him. Abby has a hard time deciding what to do, and though she finally does move in, their relationship gradually fizzles to an end. Despite an initial period of awkwardness and jealousy after their romance ends, Luka and Abby become very close friends.</p>
<p>Abby's next relationship is with <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._John_Carter_f45d.html" title="Dr. John Carter">Dr. John Carter</a>. Abby discovers Carter shooting up on painkillers. She tells the attending doctors about it, and at their urging and with their help, Carter enters a rehabilitation program. Once he returns, he sees Abby at an AA meeting. She tells him that she is a recovering alcoholic and had been sober for a few years. She agrees to become his AA sponsor. Abby and Carter develop a very strong friendship. This strains her relationship with Luka.</p>
<p>Several months later, Abby has a particularly horrible birthday and starts drinking again. When Carter catches her having a beer, he confronts her, and she tells him not to worry about her. When <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Mark_Greene_3163.html" title="Dr. Mark Greene">Dr. Mark Greene</a> passes away, Carter seeks solace in Abby. She returns to her AA meetings, telling Carter she did it for him, and they become a couple. Abby continues drinking, and Carter compulsively tries to "fix" her. At one point, Carter is ready to propose to Abby at a special dinner he's arranged for her, but at the last minute, he ends up putting the ring back in his pocket and never mentions it again.</p>
<p>Their relationship is badly strained when Carter's grandmother (portrayed by Frances Sternhagen) dies, and Abby's brother, Eric, conclusively diagnosed with bipolar disorder, attends the funeral with them and falls into her grave. Soon after that, Carter flies to the Congo and joins Luka, who is volunteering with Doctors Without Borders. When Carter goes to Africa for the second time (presumably to recover the body of Luka, who, in a plot twist, has not actually died), he sends Abby a break-up letter, and their relationship finally ends. Just as with the end of Luka and Abby's relationship, Abby and Carter remain close friends.</p>
<p>Abby briefly dates an intern named Jake for awhile in season 11, but their relationship eventually fizzles. She also began to grow close to Susan Lewis and Kerry Weaver.</p>
<p>In the first half of Season 12, Abby rekindles her relationship with Luka in the episode "The Human Shield." Initially, they decide to remain friends, but later begin dating. Three weeks into their relationship it is revealed that Abby is <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnant.html" title="Pregnant">pregnant</a>. She and Luka decide to keep the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby.html" title="Baby">baby</a>. Luka proposes to Abby while she is pregnant, but Abby was not comfortable with the idea and was discouraged because of her past problems.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Abby starts her final year of medical school. Towards the end of the quarter, she is told that someone has anonymously paid off the balance on her tuition. She later discovers it was Carter. On graduation day, Abby finds out that Carter's girlfriend, Kem, has suffered a <a href="../../../s/t/i/Still_birth.html" title="Still birth">still birth</a>. Abby offers to stay with Carter. He is grateful, but tells her that it's not necessary. Abby goes on to graduate from medical school and finally becomes Dr. <b>Abby Lockhart</b>.</p>
<p>In "21 Guns," the 12th season finale, a shootout occurs in the ER between the police and several prisoners who are trying to escape custody. Abby immediately drops to the floor next to the admit desk, which is the center of the shootout, and apparently suffers a couple of minor cuts due to the glass shards. While rolling on the floor to get away from the glass, her stomach slams into a metal cart that has overturned in the small space. She leaps up and begins to tend to the more seriously injured Jerry, the admit worker. In the last scenes, it is revealed that her injuries are serious, and her pregnancy is affected. She notices blood on the bottom of her jeans and faints. She leaves a hand print of blood on the window as Luka watches helplessly in the next room. He had been incapacitated and tied to the gurney by the prisoners, who had injected him with <a href="../../../v/e/c/Vecuronium.html" title="Vecuronium">vecuronium</a>, a drug that was intended for a patient. He had to be intubated as the drug had seriously relaxed most of his body muscles, and he <a href="../../../r/e/s/Respiratory_arrest.html" title="Respiratory arrest">stopped breathing</a>.</p>
<p>In the 13th season opener, Kerry finds both Abby and Luka. As Abby is examined, it is discovered that she had begun to have minor contractions, pending a possible abruption of the placenta, which promptly follows. Dr. Coburn and the staff prep her for a <a href="../../../c/-/s/C-section.html" title="C-section">c-section</a>, for which Abby requests anesthesia on her spine, so that she may be awake during the procedure. The baby is removed from the uterus, and begins to gradually recover in the NICU. However, Abby's uterus shows massive and continuous bleeding, for which Coburn gives her two options: wait it out on the bleeding or a <a href="../../../h/y/s/Hysterectomy.html" title="Hysterectomy">hysterectomy</a>. Abby chooses to have the hysterectomy. Following the procedure, Abby and Luka decide on a name for the baby: Joseph (or Josip, after Luka's father), with Abby wanting to call him Joe. Joe is Abby's first and only child. Joe spends five weeks in the NICU before returning home.</p>
<p>Throughout Season 13 Abby is shown growing into her role as Joe's mother, first by taking time off to be with her seriously ill baby, some activities like Mommy and Baby classes, walks in the park, and then later by gradually reintroducing herself into the ER world. Abby and Luka experience some quasi-marital bliss. Before and shortly after Joe's birth, Luka raised the question of marriage, with Abby's response that she "doesn't need the white dress" to make their lives complete. As the season progresses, Joe is shown several times in the ER with his working parents. Mid-season tension develops between Abby and Luka, partly as the result of Luka's apparently paranoid behavior regarding a former patient, Curtis Ames. Ames eventually breaks into Abby and Luka's apartment, and forces Luka into his car, leaving Abby racing after them. Abby tries to bargain with Ames by telling him that she used to be an alcoholic. She tells him that she realized she had to change after she passed out one night and woke up in a bed with some guy she never met before. She said that the man and his friend were rooting through her things. Although she didn't come right out and say it, it is strongly implied that the two men raped her while she had blacked out. About a week after Kovac's traumatic attack by Ames, an emotional Abby asks Luka to propose to her again to get married. She says if they got through the shooting incident and the Curtis Ames nightmare, they could get through anything.</p>
