<p>She is the founding Abbess and architect of Redwall Abbey. Originally from Loamhedge, she and the surviving mice fled after a great sickness settled there. She was entombed in a crypt beneath the stairs leading to Great Hall from Cavern Hole. Her tomb was rediscovered in <i><a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattimeo.html" title="Mattimeo">Mattimeo</a></i> while searching for clues to the location of the ruins of <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loamhedge_Abbey_38ee.html" title="Loamhedge Abbey">Loamhedge Abbey</a>.</p>
<p>She was voiced by Angela Mounsey in <i><a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossflower.html" title="Mossflower">Mossflower</a></i>.</p>

<p>She was young mousemaid with a lot of lessons to learn. She raised up the ferret Veil from infancy, and when it became apparent he could not escape his blood ties, he was banished from Redwall. This hit Bryony hard, and she went after him. Along the way she became embroiled in the middle of a long-standing conflict between Sunflash the Mace and Swartt Sixclaw, Veil's father. Veil sacrificed his life to save Bryony from Swartt. Afterward, she returned with Sunflash to Redwall. She succeeded Meriam as Abbess in her middle seasons. She also was the great-granddaughter of Gonff the Mousethief and an ancestor of Dandin.</p>

<p>He was the Abbot of Redwall when <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariel_Gullwhacker_9585.html" title="Mariel Gullwhacker">Mariel</a>, daughter of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_the_Bellmaker_da59.html" title="Joseph the Bellmaker">Joseph the Bellmaker</a>, arrived there from the sea. He provided her and her companions with as much assistance as possible, and was left to lead the Abbey during an attack by searats. After Mariel's return, Bernard stepped down, and was replaced by Saxtus.</p>
<p>He was voiced by Gordon Hall.</p>
<p>(<i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariel_of_Redwall_ee28.html" title="Mariel of Redwall">Mariel of Redwall</a></i>, mentioned in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bellmaker_8e99.html" title="The Bellmaker">The Bellmaker</a></i> and the framing scenes of <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_the_Warrior_9648.html" title="Martin the Warrior">Martin the Warrior</a></i>)</p>
<p><a name="Saxtus" id="Saxtus"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey_Leader_%28Redwall%29_df67.html" title="Edit section: Saxtus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Saxtus</span></h3>
<p>Saxtus was a proper mouse who grew up in Redwall with his friends <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dandin_the_Sword_Carrier_feae.html" title="Dandin the Sword Carrier">Dandin</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/f/Rufe_Brush_aa85.html" title="Rufe Brush">Rufe Brush</a>, and <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durry_Quill_97da.html" title="Durry Quill">Durry Quill</a>. After Dandin left with Mariel to battle <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabool_the_Wild_e676.html" title="Gabool the Wild">Gabool the Wild</a>, Saxtus remained at Redwall and helped defend it from searats. When Abbot Bernard eventually stepped down, Saxtus was called as his successor. He also eventually took over Recorder duties from Brother Hubert.</p>
<p>Saxtus was a much-beloved Abbot of Redwall, and a close friend of Joseph the Bellmaker. While Joseph and some of the other Redwallers were gone abroad, Redwall had a visit from two searats, Slipp and Blaggut. Slipp wore out his welcome after a while, and while searching for the Redwall "treasure", he managed to kill <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Mother_6f94.html" title="Badger Mother">Mother Mellus</a>, the badger who had raised Saxtus since infancy. Both searats escaped Redwall, Blaggut killed Slipp, and he returned to Redwall, where Saxtus showed mercy on him.</p>
<p>It appears Saxtus was in old age when the mouse Aubretia arrived from Noonvale to spin her tale of Martin the Warrior and her ancestors Brome and Rose, which was depicted in the book <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_the_Warrior_9648.html" title="Martin the Warrior">Martin the Warrior</a></i>. It is the general concensus that he is not the same as Saxus, who was mentioned in <i><a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattimeo.html" title="Mattimeo">Mattimeo</a></i> regarding a recipe. However that is all speculation, since there is no proof either way.</p>
<p>He was voiced by Roy Carruthers in <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariel_of_Redwall_ee28.html" title="Mariel of Redwall">Mariel of Redwall</a></i> and by Colin Bean in the framing scenes of <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_the_Warrior_9648.html" title="Martin the Warrior">Martin the Warrior</a></i>.</p>

<p>A mouse who was the Abbot of Redwall during the time when it was menaced by <a href="../../../c/l/u/Cluny_the_Scourge_b2b3.html" title="Cluny the Scourge">Cluny the Scourge</a>. Mortimer was a kind old mouse, and rather fond of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthias_%28Redwall%29_073d.html" title="Matthias (Redwall)">Matthias</a>. Not familiar in the ways of war, he left the defense of the Abbey to the most qualified, including Constance the badger mother and Matthias. However, in the final battle for Redwall, he was fatally poisoned by the barb from the end of Cluny's long tail. Before he died, he nominated Brother Alf as his successor and made Matthias the Abbey Warrior.</p>
<p>He was voiced by Chris Wiggins on the animated TV series and in the full-cast audiobook by Geoff Lavelle.</p>

<p>Originally known simply as Brother Alf, Mordalfus was the Abbey Fishermouse, responsible for catching a fish from the pond as part of annual feasts. He was often assisted in this by young Matthias, who added his youthful energy to Mordalfus' expertise. He succeeded Mortimer as Abbot.</p>
<p>Eight seasons later, Mordalfus was still ruler of Redwall when many of the Abbey's children, including Matthias' son <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattimeo_%28Redwall%29_da7b.html" title="Mattimeo (Redwall)">Mattimeo</a>, were kidnapped by <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slagar.html" title="Slagar">Slagar</a> the Cruel. After Matthias departed in search of them, Mordalfus was forced to contend with the forces of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Ironbeak_3e2c.html" title="General Ironbeak">General Ironbeak</a>. However, thanks to the brave efforts of his Redwallers, the evil raven was defeated, and Mordalfus later welcomed Matthias and his friends home.</p>
<p>Mordalfus was voiced by John Stocker on the animated TV series; in the full-cast audiobooks he was voiced by Nick Baty (as Brother Alf) in <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Redwall_%28book%29.html" title="Redwall (book)">Redwall</a></i> and by Gordon Hall in <i><a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattimeo.html" title="Mattimeo">Mattimeo</a></i>.</p>

<p>He was Abbot of Redwall in the time of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_the_Warrior_%28Redwall%29_c5d4.html#Martin_the_Second" title="Martin the Warrior (Redwall)">Martin the Second</a>. He was very fond of baking, and would often help out in Redwall's kitchen. He was later abducted by the forces of <a href="../../../u/b/l/Ublaz_Mad-Eyes_217c.html" title="Ublaz Mad-Eyes">Ublaz Mad-Eyes</a> and taken to the island of Sampetra. He was rescued eventually by Martin and his friends, and he made it back to Redwall safe and sound. Following the incident, Durral revealed to all that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_the_Warrior_%28Redwall%29_c5d4.html" title="Martin the Warrior (Redwall)">Martin (the first)</a> had come to him in a dream and told him that the creature who tosses the Pearls in the sea would succeed him as Abbot. Tansy turned out to be the one, and Durral stepped down, becoming a Redwall Friar.</p>

<p>Tansy was a responsible hedgehog maid who was good friends with the Abbey Champion <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arven.html" title="Arven">Arven</a>. In her youth, Tansy was one of those who searched for the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tears_of_All_Oceans_eff5.html" title="Tears of All Oceans">Tears of All Oceans</a>, which they needed to pay as ransom to recover the kidnapped Abbot Durral. After Durral returned, he revealed that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_the_Warrior_%28Redwall%29_c5d4.html" title="Martin the Warrior (Redwall)">Martin the Warrior</a> had revealed to him that Abbess would be the one who threw the pearls into the sea. Tansy was the one to do so, hence she became the new Abbess. She was the first hedgehog ever to become Abbot or Abbess.</p>
<p>Tansy was still Abbess many seasons later when <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russano_the_Wise_cd40.html" title="Russano the Wise">Russano the Wise</a> came to Redwall Abbey as a babe. Tansy was quite fond of the little fellow, and also helped to investigate the cause of the Abbey's south wall collapse. After the treasure of Kotir was discovered, Tansy had it recast into medals for the brave warriors who fought against the Rapscallion army.</p>

<p>Daughter of Rillflag and Filorn and sister of <a href="../../../d/e/y/Deyna.html" title="Deyna">Deyna</a>, Mhera was a young otter who grew up in Redwall Abbey. After her father's death and Deyna's abduction by the Juska, Mhera moped for a time, but eventually realized that she needed to be strong. Mhera became sort of a protege of Mother Cregga. Fifteen seasons after her brother disappeared, she became involved in a search for various mysterious scraps of cloth with obscure messages. It was later revealed that they were pieces of advice from the late Abbess Song, and had been hidden by Cregga.</p>
<p>Mhera was overjoyed upon her brother's sudden return, but was impatient for him to return from a journey to receive treatment for an arrow wound. During this time, the dying Cregga, who had been fatally wounded in the same incident as Deyna, appointed Mhera Abbess. Mhera later welcomed her brother home, and greeted Russano the Wise and his hares after they drove off the Juska forces who were seeking the Taggerung.</p>
<p>Mhera was voiced by Rachel Murphy.</p>

<p>An old hedgehog who lived at Redwall, Phredd was Abbot of Redwall before becoming Gatekeeper and retiring.

<p>Carrul was an old mouse with a possible mischievous past who became Abbot at Redwall Abbey when Phredd retired. A childhood friend of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bragoon_and_Saro_32e7.html" title="Bragoon and Saro">Bragoon and Saro</a>, he assisted them in their efforts to travel to Loamhedge.

<p>She was a young squirrel who grew up in Redwall. Here best friends were Springald and Horty Braebuck. Before departing on a journey with Bragoon and Saro, Fenna and her friends were troublemakers.
