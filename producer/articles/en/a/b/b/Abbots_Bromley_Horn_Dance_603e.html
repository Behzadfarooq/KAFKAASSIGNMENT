<p>The Horn Dance takes place on Wakes Monday, the day following Wakes Sunday, which is the first Sunday after <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_4.html" title="September 4">September 4</a>. In practice, this means that it is the Monday dated between <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">September 6</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a> (inclusive).</p>

<p>The dance starts at 08:00 with a service of blessing in St Nicholas Church, where the horns are housed. The dance begins on the village green, then passes out of the village - but not out of the Parish - to <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blithfield_Hall_f7fe.html" title="Blithfield Hall">Blithfield Hall</a>, owned by Lady Bagot.</p>

<p>The dancers return to the village in the early afternoon, and make their way around the pubs and houses. Finally, at about 20:00, the horns are returned to the church, and the day is completed with the service of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compline.html" title="Compline">Compline</a>.</p>
<p>The route is around 14 miles, however a pedometer carried by one of the dancers is reputed to have recorded a total of 49 miles!</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbots_Bromley_Horn_Dance_603e.html" title="Edit section: The dancers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The dancers</span></h2>
<p>There are 12 dancers. Six carry the horns; they are accompanied by: the musician playing an accordion (a violin in former times), <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maid_Marian_c63f.html" title="Maid Marian">Maid Marian</a> (a man in a dress), the <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobby-horse.html" title="Hobby-horse">Hobby-horse</a>, the Fool (or Jester), a youngster with a bow and arrow, and another youngster with a triangle. Traditionally, the dancers are all male, although in recent years girls have been seen carrying the triangle and bow and arrow.</p>
<p>In times past the dancers were always members of the Bentley or Fowell families, and to this day they must be long-term residents of the village, although they have been known to graciously allow visitors to "dance in" if asked politely.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbots_Bromley_Horn_Dance_603e.html" title="Edit section: The horns">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The horns</span></h2>
<p>The horns are six sets of reindeer antlers, three white and three black. In 1976, a small splinter was <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiocarbon_dating.html" title="Radiocarbon dating">radiocarbon dated</a> to around 1065. Since there are not believed to have been any reindeer in England in the 11th Century, the horns must have been imported from <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>.</p>
<p>The antlers are mounted on small heads carved from wood.</p>
<p>Since 1981, the horns are legally the property of Abbots Bromley Parish Council. For 364 days a year, they are on display in St Nicholas Church.</p>
<p>They were once kept in the main Village Hall, which is now the Goat Inn, beside the Butter Cross.</p>
<p>An alternative set of antlers (red deer) are kept to use when the Dancers are asked, as they are, frequently, to perform outside the Parish boundaries.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbots_Bromley_Horn_Dance_603e.html" title="Edit section: The dance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The dance</span></h2>
<p>The dance itself is simple, since the Horns themselves have some weight to them and are large and bulky.</p>
<p>The dance is performed by 12 performers: 6 men carrying the horns, Maid Marian, Hobby Horse, a boy with a bow and arrow, a fool, a musician, and a boy with a triangle. As described by <a href="../../../c/e/c/Cecil_Sharp_ea17.html" title="Cecil Sharp">Cecil Sharp</a>, there are 6 figures in the dance. He describes the dance as being done with the participants in a single line; however, it is currently performed with the dancers in a double column. The "Sharp notations" are used here, but are just arbitrary names to more easily identify the discrete parts of the dance. The figures are (in the order in which they are danced): circle up, 1 leads off, all together, advance meet and retire (henceforth known as AMR), cross over (CO), and form the line. The dancers use a walking step in the dance, except in the AMR, which has a slight lifting of the foot at the horn clash.</p>
<p>The dance begins with the dancers standing in a line in the following order, which they generally follow throughout the day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dancers 1 to 6 carrying the horns, with dancer 1 carrying the Great Horns.</li>
<li>Maid Marion</li>
<li>Hobby Horse</li>
<li>Boy with Bow and Arrow</li>
<li>Fool</li>
<li>Musician</li>
<li>Boy with Triangle</li>
</ul>
<p>Following number one, the dancers walk in a procession until they reach the desired dancing location. The leader waits until the A music begins again. When it does, he leads everyone into a large circle. The direction of the circle is unimportant; according to Sharp, the dancers began the dance either clockwise or counter clockwise. The dancers circle until the B music begins, and then go into 1 leads off.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the B music, number 1 turns into the set, and leads numbers 2 and 3 inside the perimeter of the circle. They pass between positions 3 and 4, and lead off in the direction opposite to which the original circle is traveling. Immediately after number 1 turns into the circle, number 4 also turns in, leading the rest of the company into a circle.</p>
<p>As soon as number 3 passes through position 3 4, number 4 falls into place behind him, leading the rest of the company into a line again. Everyone should now be in a line going in the opposite direction from the original track. The success of this figure depends on how smoothly number 4 falls into place behind number 3. Timing is crucial to this figure; number 3 must clear position 4 just as number 4, with the other dancers following him, is ready to fall into place behind him. The dancers then form up in a circle and prepare to form the all together. The dancers that are in a circle then form up a set in two lines.</p>
<p>At this point, the dance is ready to begin again. The A music repeats and the dancers form a line to move on to the next place of dancing. Number 1 dances forward, followed by the rest of the dancers. He then leads the entourage into a line by turning over his outside shoulder.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the B music, number 1 leads the company off into 1 leads off. The dance is ready to begin again.</p>

<p>The Horn Dance attracts a large number of visitors to the village. As well as the dance itself, Wakes Monday sees a Fair on the village green; <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morris_dance.html" title="Morris dance">Morris dancing</a>; and numerous other attractions.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbots_Bromley_Horn_Dance_603e.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>It is believed that the dance was initiated to commemorate a grant of hunting rights to certain villagers.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the horns date to the mid-11th Century; of course this does not mean that the dance itself is that old. One suggestion is that the dance was performed at the three day Berthelmy Fair, which was granted to the Abbots of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burton_upon_Trent_2c48.html" title="Burton upon Trent">Burton upon Trent</a> by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_III_of_England_cd17.html" title="Henry III of England">Henry III</a> in 1226. This fair was held to celebrate St Bartholomew's day, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_24.html" title="August 24">August 24</a>, and the switch to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_Calendar_b4a3.html" title="Gregorian Calendar">Gregorian Calendar</a> in 1752 would account for the dance's present date.</p>
<p>However, other sources suggest that the dance was originally performed around <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>.</p>
<p>The earliest direct reference to the dance is in Plot's 1686 "Natural History of Staffordshire".</p>
<p>The dance was, like similar events throughout the country, temporarily discontinued during the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_England_2192.html" title="Commonwealth of England">Commonwealth</a> years.</p>
<p>However, another interpretation, which can be partially be found in <i>Folklore, Myths and Legends of Britain</i> by the Reader's Digest, is that the Bromley Horn Dance is a surviving demonstration of Britain's prehistoric past. The pretend shooting of the bow at the deer-dancers seems cognate to ritualistic practises performed by modern primitive societies, especially the Aborigines of Australia. The Bromley Horn Dance is seen to have been a dance that was used by the Stone Age Britons as hunting magic.</p>
