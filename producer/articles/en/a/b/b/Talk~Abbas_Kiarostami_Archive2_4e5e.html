<p>Khayyam was a <i>classical</i>, not ancient, Persian poet. Ancient is pre-Islamic.</p>

<dd>Yes, I agree with you. "classical" is more common, although a poet from almost 1000 years ago may be considered ancient. I replaced "ancient" with "classical".

<p>I've checked again at <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-AR_9cc2.html#Persian" title="WP:MOS-AR">WP:MOS-AR#Persian</a>, &amp; it does seem you're supposed to give the strict transliteration in the opening sentence, where the name is given in bold. "Strict" apparently means pretending the word is in Arabic: so it should be <i>Kiyār<b>u</b>stamī</i> in that sentence, even though we all know it's pronounced with an <i>o</i>, not a <i>u</i>. After that, the standard or primary version <i>Kiyar<b>o</b>stami</i> can of course be used.</p>
<p>But it's up to you: most Persian articles seem to ignore the MOS rules! OTOH, consider why you've written <i><b>`</b>Abbās</i> with an <i>`eyn</i>, even though the <i>`eyn</i> isn't pronounced in Persian. --<a href="../../../n/d/s/User%7ENdsg_9bb6.html" title="User:Ndsg">NigelG (or Ndsg)</a> | <a href="../../../n/d/s/User_talk%7ENdsg_32ac.html" title="User talk:Ndsg">Talk</a> 22:43, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As you may have noticed, I originally used what WP:MOS suggested. However other editors did not accept it. I also changed my mind afterwards. WP:MOS is Arabic not Persian and It makes no sense to use Aarabic transliteration where we can use Persian transliteration.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 11:05, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no reason to follow WP:MOS for non-Arabic words. You should also note that WP:MOS is mainly proposed for the transliteration of the historic and classic Islamic names. Although it serves this purpose very well, those who have participated in preparing it were ignorant in generalizing it for all the names which are originally written in Arabic-based scripts. In my opinion, it's not even suitable for the transliteration of modern Arabic names such as Abdel-Nasser's given name. It's good to have a guideline for the transliteration of Persian names (by considering the different standards for historical names, and modern names, and geographical names, based on the standard transliteration methods used by Iranologists for different cases). However, the lack of WP Manual of Style for Persian transliteration, can not be the reason to use an inapropriate guideline which is not directly related to our subject. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahangard_8aa4.html" title="User:Jahangard">Jahangard</a> 18:03, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is an AWESOME article, folks. I did some minor copyediting (mostly making the language all American English instead of a mixture of American and British). A few points I noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re transliteration: this is one thing that irritates me - a lot. First of all, the Arabic transliteration "policy" is <i>still</i> in the discussion stage and is not consistently used in Arabic-language-themed articles. Personally, I think Persian needs its own transliteration policy. It's completely uncalled for to use the Arabic vowel scheme. And yes, I do speak both languages.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the section entitled "Individualism", the paragraph about <b>Ten</b> should be tightened up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I was very uncomfortable with how close the text tracked the language of the critic Akrami, so I changed it still further. It makes me worry about other parts of the article. I don't think paraphrase is a very good device, especially where it tracks the language of the source so closely. You either quote or you summarize, IMHO.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I recommend tightening up the paragraph about Stephen Bransford.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll try to finish commenting and editing later. Got to go now. <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECbdorsett_98d9.html" title="User:Cbdorsett">Cbdorsett</a> 04:34, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks User:Cbdorsett for your kind helps. Unfortunately I did not notice that you are using American spelling. According to suggestions from others I started to use one spelling (just accidentally British). I guess I messed it up. Please let me know if you prefer the American one. Or you think most of the article is on the American side. Then I can revert my edits so that we have either a uniform American or a uniform British spelling. Concerning transliteration, you are right. There is no concensus. What ever I do some people will be unhappy. I prefer the persian one which is the correct one. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 09:57, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I reverted my changes. Let's go with American spellings. There were some more British that I fixed. I will also try to follow your other comments. Give me some time! I have recieved many comments today. I hope I can manage them all. Thanks.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 10:58, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have finished "Americanizing" the English. I decided on that rather than British because of the vocabulary used. It does not matter either way, really, as long as the article is consistent. However, there is something more serious: after about the halfway mark, the article starts to ramble. Topics that were mentioned before tend to crop up again and again. I think you need to decide on a format. If you take the historical approach, put the films in chronological order and talk about them one by one. Each film portrays some conflict, uses some style, evokes some images and was discussed by some critic. This might be the easier approach. The other approach involves a lot of synthesizing - collecting similar films and discussing them as a group, addressing themes or styles one by one. Here there is the additional risk of falling into long, rambling sentences full of unnecessary comparisons, images, metaphors and so on. I also noticed that many of the references are not exactly in the right format. For starters, authors of books and articles are supposed to be listed last-name-first. Keep up the good work. I'll try to help out where I can. <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECbdorsett_98d9.html" title="User:Cbdorsett">Cbdorsett</a> 06:00, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks Cbdorsett for your kind helps. We used a chronological order in Film career section. In cinematic style section we have no way other than grouping similar films. We will try to improve it gradually. Take care. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 07:34, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
