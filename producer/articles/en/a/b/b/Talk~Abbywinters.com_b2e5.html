<p>I should first declare I am a member of this website.</p>
<p>Abbywinters.com is an exception to most porn/erotica on the internet, in that it has a deep regard for human sexuality and beauty, exhibits high standards in design and photography, is run with an unusual degree of ethics and respect to both models and members, and has fostered a message board section to both inform and promote community discussion. The site warrants a page on WP due to these very unusual qualities.</p>
<p>The site is also growing very successful, and hence may indicate a new trend in porn/erotica on the internet. This could be of interest to someone researching the topic. --Smitten 12:11, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am concerned that this article is biased in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>the article states that 'abby winters is more sensative to her models' needs', but does not state who is being used for comparison, or provide any citations to support this claim.</li>
<li>This article states that abbywinters.com is distinguished by its quality but offers no evidence or citations for this claim.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other, less obvious bias may also exist.</p>
<p>In addition, this article makes several claims about what Abby has indicated, or possible future directions for the site, without stating the source of these claims.</p>
<p>Other than that, it seems like a very well written article.</p>

Quote: "This article states that abbywinters.com is distinguished by its quality but offers no evidence or citations for this claim."<br />
This site: <a href="http://www.thebestporn.com/categories_niches/amateur_sex/" class="external free" title="http://www.thebestporn.com/categories_niches/amateur_sex/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebestporn.com/categories_niches/amateur_sex/</a> gives Abbywinters top spot of over 2000 sites in the 'amateur' category, giving quality of photography as one of the main reasons. The review itself links to several other review sites that say the same. I don't know whether putting that link in the article would offend people, though, so I'm just going to put it here for the moment.</p>
<p>Quote: "the article states that 'abby winters is more sensative to her models' needs', but does not state who is being used for comparison"<br />
That's easily fixed.</p>
<p>Quote: "In addition, this article makes several claims about what Abby has indicated, or possible future directions for the site, without stating the source of these claims"<br />
The source is the site itself. Should all such statements say "according to the site itself?" If so, go ahead and put that in.<br />

<p>Quote: "See also subjective statements like 'Winters has a keen eye for staging shoots and posturing of models'"<br />
I have deleted that paragraph. It looks as though it was written when the article was about Abby the photographer, before it became an article about the website. It's probably redundant now.<br />
Is this enough for you to remove the POV tag?<br />
An Abby fan 18:05, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll take that as a yes, then. Am removing the tag. An Abby fan 18:24, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this article has to be rewritten. It sounds like an advertisement, especially if I'm comparing this entry with more objective porn sites entry such as <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_Girls_0fe8.html" title="Suicide Girls">Suicide Girls</a> or <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bang_Bus_03d0.html" title="Bang Bus">Bang Bus</a>. Stileto 11:43, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If this article is an advertisement, then any article about movie or cds on wikipedia are advertisements.</p>
<p>This article should be rewritten because it's not objective in its current format. But questioning the quality of photographs can be handled by referencing qualities one would use to compare internet porn. For example, the Abby Winters highest-quality photos are much larger in pixel resolution than most internet porn, so that could be considered one characteristic of Abby's photography being "high-quality". Other measures of quality include the fact that many of the photos are well-lit and not grainy, but perhaps those characteristics are not so rare to find on the web. However I've found that some of the photos are in need of color correction due to the natural lighting used which had resulted in tinting or a cast in said photos, which would be an indication of poor quality.</p>
<p>As for Abby Winters herself, I'd be more interested in her as a person and artist than as to promoting her financial undertaking as a successful pornographer. How to judge her sensitivity to working with models? Well there seems to be a genuine happiness when the subjects smile into the camera. She does not use obviously-stoned models like lower-quality porn sites. And the abbywinters website does not show models performing BDSM or sperm-drinking or other activities associated with sexual abuse. However, many might find the erotic content unsuitable because when you get right down to it, it's still pornography -- images created for the sole purpose of stimulating sexual desire. Compare to the erotic photography at <a href="http://www.met-art.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.met-art.com/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>Met-Art which is less titillating.</p>

<p>Fictional? What evidence is there that AW is fictional?~~</p>
<p>'Abby Winters' is a character created by the owner of the website, Garion. Garion is often referred to on the message boards as a technician or as someone who handles the 'business side' of the site, however he is, in fact, the owner and founder. This is a widely known fact amongst models and staff. Evidence can be found on the message boards, where in 'Abby' occasionally posts, but rather than leaving her customary 'a' at the end of the post, a 'g' is mistakenly left instead.

<p>Well an anonymous revert without comment to a version commonly viewed as not what I call improvement. I would hope that our anonymous friend expands the article in a positive sense, else I will bring it back to the previous version. <a href="../../../r/o/e/User%7ERoeschter_8075.html" title="User:Roeschter">Roeschter</a> 22:04, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please forgive me for my revert without comment. I meant to come back and discuss it here and then found I did not have time. My problem with the new edit is simply this: the article was <i>not</i> intended "as an example of a publishing genre rather than for its singularity of content." The purpose of an encyclopaedia article is to inform the reader about the subject of the article, not to provide a critique of something general such as contemporary pornography. There is also something of a high moral tone about the rewrite that to my mind is out of keeping with the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> policy of WP. I do indeed hope to do an edit on this in the near future, though perhaps editing down more than expanding. However I would not be in favour of bringing it back to the previous version.</dd>

<dd>I agree that my previous edit was not moving into the right direction. For citing examples of the genre I should have created a meta page on the subject. Now for future suggestions. Pages like this are interesting because they cover aspects of society that are highly subjective in their reception. If an expansion towards a critical discussion is not compatible with Wiki style (I agree on this eventually), it indeeds needs to be reduce to the bare essentials. In more general terms, how do we deal with "subjectivism" on topics that are objectively (their is obviously no wide agreement on the topic) subjective (many different conflicting views ). Other language versions of the Wiki are far more liberal in providing "views" in separate sections of an article rather fighting over facts. Avoiding "views" even when clearly marked out as such and trying to stick to "facts" even when the facts are highly debated, seems to an approach typical for the anglo american world. What do you think. <a href="../../../r/o/e/User%7ERoeschter_8075.html" title="User:Roeschter">Roeschter</a> 20:38, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
