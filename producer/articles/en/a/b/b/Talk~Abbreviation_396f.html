<p>"Use of periods (American English for "full stops")..." That's a fallacy. "Period" was originally British English, Shakespeare, for example, is known to have called full stops periods. Also, more recently, the term was used by the PM in the House of Commons (see the Wikipedia article on full stops). Though it is rarely heard in British English, "period" is acceptable, it has merely fallen out of use. Changed. -- Tom, 9.58 pm, 19th Oct. 2005</p>

<dd>No, Shakespeare called them <i>points</i>. <i><a href="../../../a/_/m/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream_9a69.html" title="A Midsummer Night's Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a></i>, Act V, Scene I: "This fellow does not stand upon points...." <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeahen_694f.html" title="User:Seahen">Seahen</a> 01:47, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Whether to add an apostrophe for a plural, e.g., kms vs km's.</i> ALSO IT IS AN ACRONAM FOR NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING</p>
<p>That's a particularly bad example. One may say "twenty kilometers" but this commonly written as "20 km", not "20 kms" nor "20 km's". This makes sense because "kms" could be interpreted as "kilometers times seconds", which is not intended.</p>
<p>The official rule can be found in the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures' <a href="http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/" class="external text" title="http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/" rel="nofollow">International System of Units</a> brochure, section 5.2 point 2 which simply says: <i>Unit symbols are unaltered in the plural.</i></p>
<p>Furthermore, km is a <i>symbol</i> and not an abbreviation. As such it does not follow the rules for abbreviations. Because the article is about abbreviations and not about symbols, I suggest that unit symbols should not be included here.</p>

<p><i>"If used to refer to a country or a group like the United States or United Nations, the period is not included, and only the first letter of the abbreviation is capitalised."</i> I'm sure I've never read Us or Un to refer to the United States or United Nations in any British publication.

<p>Agreed, this statement is incorrect, as any search on <a href="http://bbc.co.uk/news" class="external text" title="http://bbc.co.uk/news" rel="nofollow">BBC News</a> will indicate. This should be divided into two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>If used to refer to a country or a group like the United States or United Nations, the period is not included. In these examples US and UN are used.</li>
<li>Certain <i>Acronyms pronounced as words</i> (see <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym.html" title="Acronym">Acronym</a>) are referred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalised. For instance, the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization_0e71.html" title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> is abbreviated as Nato, and <a href="../../../s/e/v/Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome_910f.html" title="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</a> as Sars.</li>

<p><br />
<i>"Whether to add an apostrophe for a plural, e.g., CDs vs CD's. The apostrophe is not needed grammatically but sometimes is added to make it clear that the s is not part of the abbreviation."</i> I have doubts whether use of the apostrophe is ever 'acceptable'. The entry for <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym.html" title="Acronym">Acronym</a> explicitly contradicts (forbids) this practice. --<a href="../../../a/1/r/User%7EA1r_4bf6.html" title="User:A1r">Air</a> 14:42, 21 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The lede concludes with this sentence: <i>In a dictionary with no abbreviation section, AUTM (variation of ATM) would come right after "authorize".</i> So what? It would come after <i>authorize</i> anyway, wouldn't it? M comes after H. On the other hand, are we sure that, say, <i>authorless</i> wouldn't come right after <i>authorize</i>?</p>
<p>Furthermore, are there really dictionaries that file abbreviations separately from the rest of the words? I've never seen that. If there are, that would be worth pointing out (but probably not in the first paragraph). If the sentence meant to illustrate that abbreviations are alphabetized as though they were actually spelled out, then that would also be worth mentioning, but it should be done using an example that actually illustrates the point. For now, I'm removing the sentence pending an explanation of its significance. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob_Kennedy_d47c.html" title="User:Rob Kennedy">Rob Kennedy</a> 04:06, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a warning on the page that, being based on the 1911 encyclopedia, "this article may reflect the thinking of the turn of the last century", but the big problem here is surely that it reflects the <b>abbreviations</b> of the turn of the last century. Or, in a way, I wish it did: since paper encyclopedias have always lagged behind their times, the "Abbreviations now in use (1911)" were old-fashioned at the time, as well as being heavily weighted towards academic honors, Church of England titles and Latin phrases (reflecting the priorities of the time). As for the lists of "Classical [=Roman] abbreviations", a really long list, and "Medieval abbreviations", who's going to look for them in this article? If their existence on Wikipedia is any use to anybody - I defer to Classical and historical scholars - is it, honestly? - surely they should be moved to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_empire.html" title="Roman empire">Roman empire</a> or similar? It's not that I don't appreciate the trouble someone took to scan and upload portions of the 1911 encyclopedia, but I suppose the intention was to eventually evaluate which bits were of an any use. And I also appreciate that the big need of this article is for an updated abbreviations list, rather than for just getting rid of the useless parts of the old one. But still, wouldn't that be a start?</p>
<p>I'm pretty new at Wikipedia. There may be an ongoing general project , that I haven't heard of, for getting rid of the obsolete parts of the 1911 encyclopedia - but if there isn't, can't we make a start by deleting some of it right here? My suggestion would be that we keep the list of "Abbreviations denoting moneys, weights, and measures" - abbreviations for hogshead and farthing are cool with me - and lose the rest. What do you think, people? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 20:42, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If anything, I'd say to move them to sub-pages such as "Medieval abbreviations" &amp;c., and link to those pages from this one.

<p>Great work, Zoney, thanks a lot! It looks like a proper article now. I have always assumed abbreviation was the master category, and acronyms and initialisms subsets of it, on a common-sense basis: "abbreviation" means shortening or brief-making, and acronyms and initialisms are methods for shortening. If I'm right, then all acronyms are abbreviations (though I don't suppose anybody believes all abbreviations are acronyms). But, Anárion, if you're heavily into linguistic terminology there, I'll defer to you, because I'm not - as I say, I only make a common-sense argument.</p>
<p>Looking up the entry on abbreviation in modern Encyclopedia Britannica, I note a couple of points:</p>
<p>1. A third method for producing abbrevations is by <b>truncation</b>, e. g. Mets for Metropolitans. <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocopation.html" title="Apocopation">Apocopation</a>, linked to under See also, looks a lot like it means the exact same thing, doesn't it? Anyway, truncation has to be about fifty times more likely to be searched for than apocopation, and a Wikipedia <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truncation.html" title="Truncation">Truncation</a> article only exists for math, so if I have some time later, I'll try to create a Truncation (lingustics) stub and a disambig <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truncation.html" title="Truncation">Truncation</a> page.</p>
<p>2. Not everybody agrees with <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerbee_baa0.html" title="User:Herbee">Herbee</a> above that unit symbols like km are not abbreviations. It's OK to call them abbreviations (though it's also OK to refuse to). Anyway, thanks very much both of you for responding to my VP appeal for input.<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 12:43, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand that I'm supposed to discuss a specific article on its Talk page, but I just haven't had any success with the <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbreviation.html" title="Abbreviation">Abbreviation</a> article. I left a note on the <strong class="selflink">Talk</strong> page six days ago, with suggestions for deleting most of the 1911 Britannica material, but haven't had any response so far. (I guess nobody's watching the page. Well, it's not <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a>.) I don't feel right about deleting all that stuff without input from anybody else. Does anybody have a soft spot for abbreviations out there? Incidentally, if you do, and know more linguistics than me, which wouldn't be hard, I'd really appreciate it if you'd take a look at my <a href="../../../h/o/m/HomO_2e75.html" title="HomO">HomO</a> article. I wrote it mostly because the word (the short form for the Swedish ombudsman against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation) is a cool, and to me amusing, uh, fake abbreviation. Well, maybe you had to be there. But, anyway, I don't think I do justice to the word itself in the article about the institution, and any input would be appreciated. If you think this posting is inappropriate, please tell me so, that would also be useful. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 16:55, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well bringing it here is likely to garner the article some attention so hopefully that helps (its not my field, unfortunately). Wikipedia works on a system of massive numbers of incremental improvements. If no-one other than you is currently interested in an article, you have carte blanche to your best in improving it, doing whatever you think is right. Maybe you can't make it perfect, but it will be in a better state for the next person who comes along. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 19:59, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Untrue. According to Merriam-Webster's Online, an acronym is "<i>a word (as NATO, radar, or snafu) formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound term; also&#160;: an abbreviation (as FBI) formed from initial letters</i>". QED <i>is</i> an acronym in the second sense (and even the first, depending on how you define "word"). Wikipedia's own article on <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym.html" title="Acronym">acronyms</a> is even clearer on this point. The essential difference is that NATO is pronounced "NAY-toe", whereas "QED" is pronounced "KYOO EE DEE". — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 09:45, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What does "unequivocable" mean, exactly? It's certainly not <i>unequivocal</i>; few dictionaries even note the distinction, and those that do are quick to point out that it hasn't gained widespread acceptance—and rightly so, given its artificiality. Educated commentators are quick to disavow this "correction" right along with the prohibition against the split infinitive (mentioned above), the ending of a sentence with a preposition, the beginning of a sentence with a conjunction, and numerous other non-errors which have no place in this encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAustin_Hair_324b.html" title="User:Austin Hair">Austin Hair</a> 03:57, Aug 20, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's say we are talking about a book: a <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_rings.html" title="Lord of the rings">Lord of the rings</a> (LOTR) book. As I just said there, I said <b>"a"</b> lord of the rings book, but when you use the abbreviation LOTR, the sound changes. The first sound in "LOTR" is a hard "ell", not a soft L like in "lord". Now saying "a <b>ell-oh-tee-are</b> book" sounds wrong because the abbreviation starts with a vowel. When a normal word starts with a vowel, you use <b>an</b> not <b>a</b>. So, my question is, do you say "<b>A LOTR book</b>" or "<b>An LOTR book</b>"? <a href="../../../z/h/a/User%7EZhatt_72b1.html" title="User:Zhatt"><font style="background: black" color="white"><b>·</b><font color="#F0BE1E">Zhatt</font></font></a><a href="../../../z/h/a/User_talk%7EZhatt_27d4.html" title="User talk:Zhatt"><font style="background: black" color="white"><b>·</b></font></a> 21:24, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here's my 2 cents: If you were speaking, and were to say it out ("LOTR"), you'd use "an"; same way in the military we'd say "an LSVW". BUT…if you are using "LOTR" as a <i>written shorthand</i> for "Lord of the Rings", you'd say "'<b>a</b> LOTR book" because if you read it out you'd say "a <b>Lord of the Rings</b> book"; in the military, for example, if I wanted a lieutenant and a lineman, I would ask for "<b>a</b> Lt and <b>a</b> Lmn". Basically, write it exactly as you're going to read it. (I know that's not explained very clearly, but that's the best you'll get out of me before I turn into a pumpkin). <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigPig_e58e.html" title="User:SigPig">SigPig</a> 02:34, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not a linguistic either, but in my mind, acronyms and initialism are different concepts from abbrevations (allthough connected) and should remain as separate articles. An abbreviation in it's simplest form should have a full stop, e.g. "Mass." for "Massachusetts", while the initialism "MA" should not. Generally, an abbrevation is a simplified written form not normally used for speech, while an acronym/initalism is also used in speech. I'm not a native English speaker/writer, but I feel that the distinction is greather in other languages, like Norwegian and Swedish.</dd>
<dd>Similarly, syllabic abbreviation is a special form of initialism. Apocopation, on the other hand, is a special form of abbrevation.</dd>

<p>I also think it is best to leave things as they are, with separate articles. Lucien Duval, from the French Wikipedia, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>With regard to combining the article Apocopation into the article Abbreviation, although not a linguist I would suggest that such not be done. Abbreviations are letters taken from a word and used interchangeably with the word. E.g., kilometer and km. Apocopation, however, is a form of a word produced by shortening the original word and resulting in a word legitimate in its own right. For example, in Hebrew, the 3rd person singular feminine imperfect of hayah is tihyeh in its full form. The apocopated form, however, is thiy. This is not a contraction, however, for a contraction is the shortening of a word by omission of intermediate letters. Nor is it an abbreviation. Apocopation is distinct from both abbreviation and contraction. (David Medici)</p>
<p>I oppose the merge. There is enough distinct content about each subject to warrant separate articles. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_d79e.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride">Tantalum</a><a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETantalumTelluride_f5d7.html" title="User talk:TantalumTelluride">T</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETantalumTelluride_f5d7.html" title="User talk:TantalumTelluride">lluride</a> 21:57, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also am against the merge, for reasons similar to David Medici's, above. (I am also against the merging of Apocopation and Acronym and Initialism, as I posted on the Talk:Apocopation page. Unless two pages are so similar that there is a lot of redundant information and the concepts are basically similar, I think it is almost always wise, as a general rule, to keep them separate. - <a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKadin2048_74a5.html" title="User:Kadin2048">Kadin2048</a> 20:59, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Abbreviation's entry is sufficiently long already. Particular forms of abbreviation (the parent category for all word shortening techniques) like acronyms and apocope (specific mechanims for generating shorter words) warrant their own entries for those wishing greater detail.</p>
<p>On an earlier subject, I'd say leaving somewhat archaic abbreviations in as examples is a very good idea. After all, those are the abbreviations that readers are most likely to need a reference to decipher.</p>

<p>Is "Syllabic abbreviation" a recognised term in English? I googled it a few months ago and it seems to exist as a bona-fide term in Russian, but the English references were few: there are more now, I suspect due to the Wikipedia effect. There are only 2 hits in google print, one irrelevant and the other Russian. Maybe the section was added by a Russian-speaker? English texts distinguish <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blend.html" title="Blend">blends</a> from <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym.html" title="Acronym">acronyms</a>. I accept there is a useful distinction between acronyms-consisting-of-the-initial-<b>letter</b>-of-constituent-words and acronyms-consisting-of-the-initial-<b>syllable</b>-of-constituent-words, but if that distinction is not made in practice, the Wikipedia has no business inventing a name for it. There is enough contention on <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym_and_initialism.html" title="Acronym and initialism">acronym and initialism</a> between the "FBI is an acronym" and "no, FBI is an initialism" without adding yet another term to muddy the waters.<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestynes_50e7.html" title="User:Joestynes">jnestorius</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoestynes_bba0.html" title="User talk:Joestynes">talk</a>)</sup> 12:56, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What do the style guides say about the plurals of abbreviations that end in "S"? for example, do I say "I need the MSDSs for Thiamine and Acetic Acid" or "I need the MSDS's for Thiamine and Acetic Acid"? And if the apostrophe is OK (as my eye would like it to be) does that cause any confusion with "I can't read the MSDS's first line"? I don't think so. What do you apostrophe-jocks say?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not an expert [or an "apostrophe-jock"], but I would guess that the posessive would be MSDS', like when any other noun that ends with s is possesive. Looking at the article [as far as the plural goes] it seems like either way would be accepted, and the intent [to me] is clear both ways.<a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorca_a80b.html" title="User:Torca">Torca</a> 09:33, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article may have been flagged as needing <b>cleanup</b> because it has been suggested that:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>the article needs formatting, proofreading, or rephrasing in comprehensible English.</li>
<li>the article has multiple overlapping problems.</li>
<li>the article is very short and might need expanding, removal or merging with a broader article<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>For a full list of possible problems see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the cleanup process, the automated bot <a href="../../../p/o/c/User%7EPocKleanBot_6c5a.html" title="User:PocKleanBot">PocKleanBot</a> has generated this notice as a focus of cleanup efforts, and also contacted several contributing editors of the article to bring their attention to the problem. You should use this section to discuss possible resolution of the problem and achieve consensus for action. Only when there is a consensus that the article is now cleaned up should you then de-list it by deleting the cleanup tag from the article, this causes the article to drop off the monthly cleanup-needed list page.</p>

<li>Removing Cleanup tagging after seeing recent improvements and being attracted by the auto-tagging BOT above. The article is pretty good from what I see.<br />

Twould be nice to easily find who attached the <s><span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">Cleanup</a>}}</span></s> <span style="font-family:monospace;">{{<a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EConfusing_0b3e.html" title="Template:Confusing">confusing</a>}}</span> and especially, <b>when!</b> // <b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fra</a></b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html" title="User talk:Fabartus"><font color="green">nkB</font></a> 19:41, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I found this under the "Apostrophes" section:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Although, the proper way to write plurals when using abbreviations with numbers, decades, etc., would be to write them without an apostrophe, e.g. "Dot all your Is and cross all your Ts". This is because the "I" and "T" are not possessive; therefore, they do not need an apostrophe.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is pretty amusing, since an <i>I</i> doesn't need dotting, while an <i>i</i> does. (The <i>T</i> works either way, I suppose.) However, this is really a digression in <i>this</i> particular article, since <i>i</i> and <i>t</i> are being used in this case as letters, not as abbreviations. I'm going to remove this bit from the article, though I'll leave the bit in the previous paragraph about the differences between apostrophization of abbreviations and that of letters, though, since that is relevant. --<a href="../../../p/s/i/User%7EPsiphiorg_3dff.html" title="User:Psiphiorg">ΨΦorg</a> 02:03, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
