<h2><span class="mw-headline">External links</span></h2>
<p>I have taken the liberty of severely culling back the list. It was getting out of hand, with every vaguely Abba-related site and its dog listed. I have left in the official site, and a few others that seem notable or useful. We only need one lyric link (if any). This is the English Wikipedia so I've removed non-English sites, and also fancruft sites. If you think I'm being too harsh, then feel free to argue about it, but let's try and keep the standard of the article up here, and avoid too much cruft. Fans can easily find any of the other sites if they feel the need via the usual methods - i.e. google, etc. Wikipedia isn't a links directory. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 12:41, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why leave those links? abba4therecord.com and abba-thesingles.com essentially cover the same territory as the ABBA discography Wiki page; the Vocal Hall of Fame page has only a basic biography, which is better available on the official site or even right here; ABBA-Story.com only copies the Wiki bio, has news links pasted in from search engines, and a barely used forum; Photo Archive by Chris Water has a small selection of photos from one period for sale; and ABBA Lyrics Page breaches copyright, and its contents are better available on the official ABBA site. 211.30.175.174 22:36, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I could go for that - just one link to the official site. What do others think? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 06:31, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Official Site is all that is needed. Users can access all other ABBA related sites from there ... and allows them to join the ABBA community. Maggott2000

<dd>Agreed. That's the only link required here.</dd>

Also the image description page (as per <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">Wikipedia:Image description page</a>) is to have details relating to copyright and fair use rationale.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">God rid of a few pics...</span></h2>
<p>Okay, the pic of their first single should be in the article of that song.</p>
<p>Also, their 1975 album has no right to even be in the article, for one, it's useless, for two, it's right after their 1974 album, which I Might add, is to close. Yeah There is alot of things wrong, and it looks like it was made by a little college student, but don't worry. I'll fix it. -Dragong4</p>
<p><br />
Why is the same person calling themselves Roadster, Panama and Dragong4? Incidentally the "For a start, you can get rid of the trivia - most of it is unnecessary and could easily go on the pages regarding the respective songs" and "I love ABBA and The Beatles equally, so let's have no more of the "My group is better than your group!" zealot comments and accept that both groups are phenomenal, hugely-selling, talented acts. Obviously, the Beatles have sold more and were the more groundbreaking act but ABBA are not too far behind in terms of sales and popularity" were written by me. I'm not entirely sure if this unregistered user with IP address 67.189.99.161 should be allowed to call the shots here - seems like he has an axe to grind. Just look at the edits he (or possibly she) has made on this page in the past. Certainly seems less than biased. - MartinJP1983</p>

<p>After looking at the extensive "see also" branchings, it seems that we could a limited number of of meta-directory entries and the top-level three or four fan-sites. I hope that this does not open the flood-gates. -- 19:23, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Refer previous discussions on this. It is only necessary to provide the link to ABBAsite and Users can select any site they want from there. This also stops everyone bickering on their site being more important than others and therefore should be added. All website owner sites/fans have made efforts to make 'the best' site possible, so either it should open to everyone or just to the official site.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The composers could not notate?</span></h2>
<p>In the trivia section, it claims that the two composers (the two men) could not notate music, I have to wonder both how they were able to get their music composed and communicated to the two singers and their musicians who did back them up. Could it be that they had assistants who do the such work? If so, it would help the reader to understand exactly "what happened" during the creative process. -- 67.116.253.187 02:21, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did a little more research. Yep, is was all in their heads. If they sold any written music as part of their franchise, it must have been mostly simplified versions. -- 67.116.253.187 02:38, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My recollection is that vocalist Agnetha could notate, and would help write down their music. Seems pretty likely they would have had assistants to mark up the notes (and with their money, they surely had various servants making coffees, drinks, snacks, meals etc for them too!) <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 02:54, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
