<p>Since 2001, there have been abbreviation expansion articles. Such abbreviation expansions are both encyclopedic (intended as destinations), and serve as a fundamental structure of the entire wikipedia to prevent <a href="../../../l/o/n/Special%7ELonelypages_2fac.html" title="Special:Lonelypages">Special:Lonelypages</a> (aka orphaned pages).</p>
<p>Abbreviation expansion articles often have short one or two sentence entries about each topic. Readers most often will be uncovering the meaning of a simple term in a single step, but may want to use the links there for more exploration.</p>
<p>This is very different from "non-article" <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> pages, which are intended to catch ambiguous references and allow a team of editors to point links directly to the best article.</p>
<p>Circa <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_06.html" title="October 06">October 06</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_25.html" title="May 25">May 25</a>, various 2-letter, 3-letter, abbreviation, and acronym root lists and tables were developed.</p>
<p>Since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_10.html" title="May 10">May 10</a>, various guidelines for disambiguation of abbreviations, acronyms, and initialism has been some variant of:</p>
<ul>
<li>"No need to disambiguate the abbreviations here."</li>
<li>"Abbreviations pages replace disambiguation pages."</li>
<li>"Such pages facilitate navigation and replace disambiguation pages."</li>
</ul>
<p>The current guideline at <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> has been virtually unchanged since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a> 12:21:31, written by Docu and Eloquence working together:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pages of common two and three letter abbreviations group series of possible expansions for the letters, such as <a href="../../../e/l/e/Element_symbol.html" title="Element symbol">chemical element symbols</a>, similar to disambiguation pages. These should be expanded beforehand. Such pages facilitate navigation and replace disambiguation pages. See <b><a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_and_abbreviations_b498.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation and abbreviations">Wikipedia:Disambiguation and abbreviations</a></b> for details.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EAbbreviation_expansion_fa62.html" title="Edit section: Conflict at Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conflict at Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)</span></h3>
<p>The Manual of Style (disambiguation pages) (MoS:DP) is a comparatively recent innovation, begun on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_02.html" title="May 02">May 02</a> by <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a> <small>â€¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wahoofive_6859.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wahoofive">contribs</a>).</p>
<p>At about the same time that MoS:DP was first written, a small group (9:1) resolved <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_Deleted_April_2005_dbfe.html#Template:TLA" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/Deleted/April 2005">Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/Deleted/April 2005#Template:TLA</a> (without much discussion) to use {{2LCdisambig}} and {{TLAdisambig}} instead, and to use categories (later placed under <a href="../../../d/i/s/Category%7EDisambiguation_7fff.html" title="Category:Disambiguation">Category:Disambiguation</a>). This group included long-time contributors (such as Docu, Joy, Netaholic, and Radiant), who presumably understood the limited ramifications of this minor change.</p>

<p>The related {{2LCdisambig}} was never documented in MoS:DP. Unfortunately, this resulted in several variants:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">09-09</a> {{2LA}}, {{4LA}}, {{5LA}}, and {{LND}},</li>

<p>During the latter part of 2005, a fairly limited number of young folks involved in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Disambiguation_bf59.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Disambiguation">Wikipedia:WikiProject Disambiguation</a> turned their efforts from finding and updating ambiguous links (which often require considerable time and effort reading each reference) to reformatting disambiguation pages themselves. This devolved into turning anything that looked vaguely like a disambiguation page into the MoS:DP format, even when such pages (in particular, multi-stub and abbreviations pages) are <b>explicitly stated</b> as <b>not</b> disambiguation pages.</p>
<p>The activity caused considerable uproar (for example, most of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29_archive13_00a3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)/archive13">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)/archive13</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29_Freakofnurture_reverts_of_Tedernst%7E_mediation_needed__4390.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)/Freakofnurture reverts of Tedernst: mediation needed?">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)/Freakofnurture reverts of Tedernst: mediation needed?</a> and the other recent archives). One result was the removal of {{<a href="../../../s/h/i/Template%7EShipindex_88a6.html" title="Template:Shipindex">shipindex</a>}} articles from the ambit of disambiguation.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">November 14</a>, {{2LCdisambig}} was posted for deletion (see <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_Not_deleted_November_2005_2331.html#Template:2LCdisambig" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/Not deleted/November 2005">Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/Not deleted/November 2005#Template:2LCdisambig</a>, in an unusual step to <b>establish</b> consensus after orphaning had already begun. (There was no consensus to delete it.)</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_30.html" title="December 30">December 30</a>, while most folks were celebrating holidays and without any prior discussion, there was a particularly damaging series of <b>surreptitious</b> <u>template redirects</u> and <u>category closing</u> by <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedernst_2c24.html" title="User:Tedernst">Tedernst</a> (<a href="../../../t/e/d/User_talk%7ETedernst_685a.html" title="User talk:Tedernst">talk</a> <small>â€¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tedernst_1b88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tedernst">contribs</a>), who refused to abide by the prior TfD results.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EAbbreviation_expansion_fa62.html" title="Edit section: Straw poll on templates">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Straw poll on templates</span></h3>
<p>In early January, due to the conflicts and reversion wars described above, two related straw polls (now at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29_Disambiguation_subcategories_0237.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)/Disambiguation subcategories">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)/Disambiguation subcategories</a> covered the contested templates.</p>
<p>The polls were carefully limited to those <u>elements of style</u> related to disambiguation (a proper topic of MoS:DP), and divided the poll into:</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) the questions related to abbreviation templates, and</li>
<li>(B) the questions related to the existing disambiguation lists.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of the polls were that the small group of disambiguators wanted all ambiguous letter combination templates removed (8:3), and all disambiguation subcategory templates removed (9:2).</p>
<p>Clearly, the experiment of integrating abbreviation templates with disambiguation templates, an undertaking involving dozens of editors over the past 9 months, has failed. The comments indicate it is "confusing" and "complexity" to use several templates that automatically add subcategories.</p>

<p>Also,</p>
<ul>
<li>replace {{5LA}} with {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisambig_6efb.html" title="Template:Disambig">disambig</a>}} and Category:5-letter acronyms as appropriate;</li>
<li>replace {{LND}} as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most {2|3|4|5}LC are abbreviation expansion pages. Usually, the best solution (as with {{<a href="../../../s/h/i/Template%7EShipindex_88a6.html" title="Template:Shipindex">shipindex</a>}}) is to clearly separate conflicting parties, so that there is less friction between them.</p>

Please don't revert without discussion" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AAA&amp;diff=43226425&amp;oldid=43223110" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AAA&amp;diff=43226425&amp;oldid=43223110" rel="nofollow">second revert</a>).

<dd>As I've pointed out to him many times, the guidelines Mr Simpson speaks of refer very specifically to lists of letter combinations, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_all_two-letter_combinations.html" title="List of all two-letter combinations">List of all two-letter combinations</a>, and not to the disambiguation pages which he persists in changing and adding his new templates to. Now he is trying to sneak this new guideline past all of the editors involved in disambiguation pages, because he has little or no support. Mr Simpson wouldn't have a "serious problem" if he simply sought consensus and abided by it. <i>â€”<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-04-02&#160;04:31&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<li>I generally support the attempt you are trying to make here at addressing the semantic separation between abbreviations and words/phrases and treating the two problems with fit-for-purpose solutions. It would be useful to relate what path is being pursued for this toward policy-hood.

<dd>You conveniently skipped "Link any existing discussions related to the proposal to your proposal page". This proposed policy, and the CfD and TfD you mention (where are they?) remained completely off the radar of editors who watch the relevant Wikipedia and MoS pages dealing with disambiguation and abbreviations. Consensus on those pages is clearly against what you are doing here. <i>â€”<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-04-02&#160;04:25&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<p>Mr Simpson has just declared this an official policy, but I have reverted the label, since I see no evidence of consensus support for the idea. I have linked to this page from three of the relevant talk pages. Now that interested editors have a chance to find out about this proposal, let's take a straw poll to judge the consensus. <i>â€”<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-04-02&#160;04:40&#160;Z</small></i></p>

<li>There are already too many things to remember and, although I am prepared to accept that there may be a format issue to address for abbreviations, I see no reason offered by the proposer to deal with it outside the existing dab system. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid91_7ed4.html" title="User:David91">David91</a> 05:12, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is much simpler to consider "abbreviation expansion pages" disambiguation pages, especially because they serve the same function as disambiguation pages.

<li><b>Oppose</b> -- I wasted the last ten minutes of my life trying to understand this concept, thinking all the time <i>but that's what <b>dab</b> is all about, right?</i> Finally the light is dawning upon my poor, pointed head: This is a perfect simulation of dab, with a different name and a boatload of tps and cats to suit.

<li>Agreed with previous points; Simpson has been on this hobby-horse for months and won't let it go. He has yet to provide a <i>single</i> reason why abbreviation pages should have different style guidelines than ordinary dab pages, other than the ancient line "abbreviations pages replace dab pages", which, as pointed out above, applies to "Lists of..." pages instead. â€” <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineMunro_0200.html" title="User:CatherineMunro">Catherine</a>\<sup><a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECatherineMunro_06c5.html" title="User talk:CatherineMunro">talk</a></sup> 23:20, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just flat-out hate this proposal as a great example of rulecreep, and a colossal waste of time and effort. I resent having the opportunity to vote in opposition to this idea. Let's draw the line right here, unless there's some real big reason this idea is some help to editing and maintaining the best encyclopedia. If we have {{2CC}} then we should also have {{7CC}}, if 3 blades is good and four blades is better and 5 blades is the best, we could have six blades in our razor, then it would be bestest! We would have uncle and U.N.C.L.E on the page <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncle.html" title="Uncle">Uncle</a> and so on and eventually maybe all the articles would have {{<i>n</i>CC}} templates. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 06:11, 10 April 2006 (UTC)<br />

<li>So <i>this</i> page is why acronym dab pages don't call themselves dab pages. Begone! <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 06:39, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One thing I've noticed on a lot of these "abbreviation expansion" pages are a terrific number of redlinks found on some of them (e.g. <a href="../../../i/s/i/ISI_dc10.html" title="ISI">ISI</a>). I'm guessing that these pages/links are being automatically created off some giant list of every abbreviation (or <a href="../../../i/n/i/Initialism.html" title="Initialism">initialism</a>?) ever conceived of -- a list that's not based on any correspondence to the articles available on Wikipedia. Is it perhaps the desire not to have those redlinks removed that is driving effort to keep those pages seperate? <a href="../../../e/w/l/User%7EEwlyahoocom_d1b9.html" title="User:Ewlyahoocom">Ewlyahoocom</a> 07:41, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
