<dd>I think you have a great misunderstanding about the definition of a U.S. Military Veteran. Would you be interested in knowing the qualifications one has to meet in order to be called a U.S. Military Veteran? I assure you, you will not find the answers in Websters dictionary. The United States Government has a list of about 50 qualifiers that you have to meet in order to be called a Veteran. Depending on when you served, you may not be eligable for Veteran status if you did not serve in combat. You may not be eligable if you received a general discharge instead of an honorable discharge. Due to a paperwork error, a buddy of mine received a general discharge instead of the honorable discharge he deserved. It took a couple years to get it straightened out, and during that time he couldn't claim any Veteran benefits, healthcare, education, etc. It is a badge of honor to be called a Veteran, and it takes much more than service to qualify. I invite you to go to your nearest VA and talk to people there about what it means to be a Veteran of this nation. I think you will be very surprised to hear just what it takes. <a href="../../../m/u/t/User%7EMutant_Zero_f32a.html" title="User:Mutant Zero">Mutant Zero</a> 22:49, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The US military does not edit the english language. A veteran, out of www.dictionary.com, is someone who <i>has served in the armed forces</i>. Since none of us are trying to determine Mangum's benefits in her Wikipedia article, I'll fly with the dictionary.

<dd>Alright. I've attempted to have a civil discussion with you, but now I'm done. The U.S. Government disagrees with Mr. Webster on this subject, and I welcome you to bring your copy of Websters into a court of law and try to correct a Judge with it. Just remember this, the next time you're spitting in the face of the men and women who served this country with honor. Men and women, my good friends, and my uncle all died to protect your freedom and your rights. And if you can't respect them, then maybe you should show a little respect for the mothers and fathers who lost their children so that you could have your freedom.</dd>

<dd>How does Mangum conflict with the english definition of 'veteran', someone who <i>has served in the armed forces</i>? It's proven she served. I would hope Wikipedia users would respect that service, but apparently proof of service isn't enough for some critics of our vets. <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbe.Froman_da43.html" title="User:Abe.Froman">Abe Froman</a> 23:45, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a generic term, a "veteran" is simply someone who once served in an armed force. As a term of art, as used by the Veteran's Administration, there are about 50 different ways a person could quality, some quite surprising, and a number of ways a veteran could be excluded from the status of a "veteran" potentially eligible for the services of the VA. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 19:58, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

I DO NOT work for Wal-Mart, nor any of its subsidiaries, and don't own stock in the company. I DO NOT appreciate accusations that I am whitewashing the article. I believe the article should be a NEUTRAL account of what Wal-Mart is, not a bunch of over-glorified PR promoting the company, nor a bunch of negative slander on everything evil that Wal-Mart has done. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 22:09, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I'm C.lettinga, the "cabal mediator" here to take a look at your case. If you could fill me in a bit on what's happened since your request I can see how to move forward.--<a href="../../../c/2E/l/User%7EC.lettinga_b2f4.html" title="User:C.lettinga">C.lettinga</a> 07:01, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello, status quo since the last Mediation comment by the involved parties. The issue seems to have died down since the last edit concerning Mitrokhin. A mediator blessing the existing edited arrangement would finish the problem, I think.

<dd>I appreciate your concern and I support your inquiry. Indefinite blocks should not be casually used, and the integrity of Wikipedia admins must paramount. Please note that I was not involved in the discussion you mention and am a neutral party. The evidence used to make the decision, furthermore, was unambiguous. I would rather a hundred vandalsocks go unblocked than ban a single innocent user, so the quality of evidence in this had to, by definition, be <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutronium.html" title="Neutronium">neutronium</a> (as a measure of solid). - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 19:03, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Here is the full message on the ANI, I decided not to post it all there:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Abe, I trust Thatcher131, although we have different views about a lot of things, I respect his integrity and I am impressed how he has helped me several times before.</dd>
<dd>I honestly don't know all the sorid details about why rootology was desyoped, and I probably never will. All I know is that 6 people who were elected by wide margins to be arbcoms because of their history of being impartial, fair, and great editors, decided to desop him. Other things about the MONGO arbcom trouble me a little, but not this decision. rootology's behavior right before he was desoped was stupid and suicidal. It is hard to justify that. I think if Rootology wants to come back to wikipedia, he can apply to come back, because only he knows the reason why he was desyoped, better than me and you Abe. I believe in second chances, being a product of many second chances myself, but I also support the 99% of wikipedia rules, and think they are here for good solid reasons.</dd>
<dd>I have got to change my strategy in attempting to help people like rootology. Some wikiusers I have stopped from going over the brink, and they are still editing here on wikipedia, but several, like rootology, have started sockpuppet attacks, etc. This makes me look really bad for trying to help them. If you have any suggestions on how to approach this, I would welcome your advice.

<dd>Yep! can't be everywhere though! I haven't have a chance yet to read much about the controversy in the UK regarding the Commission over there, but one thing is sure, is that, beside the controversy around the archives themselves, Scaramella, Guzzanti &amp; al. have lost all credit in Italy. Not that any reasonable person would really believe that a former President of the European Commission, and liberal-minded at that, was "the KGB's man in italy"... <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 23:05, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
