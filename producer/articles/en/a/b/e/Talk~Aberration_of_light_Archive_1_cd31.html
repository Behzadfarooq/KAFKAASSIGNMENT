<dd>Thanks for your help. I have clarified some of your wording, especially changing the generic "motion" to the specific kind of motion, velocity or displacement, which is critical to understanding aberration. In general, Wikipedia articles need not be split unless they approach 32KB, which is the limit of some editors like Notepad in Windows. This article is now only 16KB. — <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Kress_19e1.html" title="User:Joe Kress">Joe Kress</a> 07:30, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">moving in an inertial frame?!</span></h2>
<p>The article starts off with claiming that aberration is due to "that an observer on Earth is moving in an inertial frame". In reality stellar aberration is due to the fact that the earth is <b>not</b> moving in an inertial frame. I can both explain it and refer to at least one book, but it's easy to understand that inertial motion does not result in an "apparent motion of celestial objects". Before I make corrections I like to know who originated that phrase, and why. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 08:46, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, that makes sense, thanks! Thus I also didn't express it well enough. I'll think about how to state it more clearly; anyway the subtlety is missing that inertial motion relative to an inertial frame is also not called stellar aberration - it's the change of velocity that does it. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 19:59, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK I did an attempt, and I hope it's OK (if not just revert and explain why). But I see that in the article more is to be done. For example, "The star's apparent position is hence displaced from its true position by the angle SES’" is a bit strange, as no "true position" can be determined - only a displacement of apparent positions. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 13:01, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No change in velocity is needed to produce aberration—a constant velocity through any inertial frame of reference also produces aberration. Indeed that is what the graphic is illustrating. The misunderstanding comes from its application to the apparent elliptical or circular paths followed by stars. But those paths are due to Earth's (nearly) circular orbit, not due to aberration per se. An extreme example of aberration would be experienced by an observer in a space ship travelling at almost the speed of light in a straight line. Almost the entire observable universe will be shifted from a celestial sphere into a celestial disk directly in front of the ship. Almost everything behind the ship will be observed at the edge of the disk in front of it. Only objects directly astern will still be behind it.

<dd>That's erroneous, and indeed the figure is misleading. The lead of the article is correct: what one commonly means with stellar aberration is the apparent motion of celestial objects - stellar aberration <i>is</i> the apparent elliptical or circular paths followed by stars. Ignoring parallax, no apparent motion occurs: they remain fixed in place. If you read your example again you'll notice that you only get a "shifting" by a <i>change</i> of speed.

<dd>Regarding "true position": Astronomy calculates the position of solar system objects by applying Newton's theory of universal gravitation. The results are their "true positions". To determine their observed positions, small corrections are applied, including aberration as well as relativity and <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light-time_correction.html" title="Light-time correction">light-time correction</a> (and even refraction for a topocentric rather than a geocentric frame of reference), resulting in their "apparent positions". When applied in the reverse, the process is called "reduction", so an observed "apparent position" is reduced to the star or planet's "true position". This distinction is simply extended to 'fixed' stars. "True position" and "apparent position" have specific technical meanings in astronomy, and both are used correctly here. — <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Kress_19e1.html" title="User:Joe Kress">Joe Kress</a> 02:03, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Harald88, I agree with Joe Kress's last two comments. The example of the space ship moving at nearly the speed of light is a good one. The aberration is caused by the velocity itself -- not a change of velocity. I think you are confusing the displacement of a star from its true position (which is aberration) and the <i>change</i> in this displacement during the course of a year, which causes a star's apparent position to describe (in the general case) an ellipse about its true position. --<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPortnadler_032a.html" title="User:Portnadler">Portnadler</a> 11:03, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No I'm confusing nothing. Which text book do you use for you definition, and which reference frame? We have no means to measure what you call "true position", as we don't know the "absolute speed" of the earth. Side note: it might one day become popular to use the CMBR frame, or the estimated centre of mass frame of the universe; but these result in completely different stellar aberrations than the ones that are now calculated. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 12:01, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article mentions <i>secular aberration</i>, which is due to the motion of the solar system relative to the galaxy (and the remainder of the universe, if you wish). It also states that "secular aberration can be regarded as constant for all practical purposes, and so is usually ignored." The corrollary of this is that we are regarding the barycentre of the solar system as our reference frame when discussing <i>annual aberration</i>, which is the main focus of the article. It follows from this that the "true position" of a star can be regarded as its position when observed from the barycentre.</dd>

<dd>I have my copy of Newcomb's <i>Compendium of Spherical Astronomy</i> by my side. It states the Law of Aberration as <i>The apparent position of an object seen by an observer in motion is displaced from the true position in which it would be seen if the observer were at rest by an amount equal in linear measure to the observer's motion at constant speed during the time occupied by light in passing from the object to the observer. The direction of the displacement is that of the observer's motion at the moment of observation</i>. --<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPortnadler_032a.html" title="User:Portnadler">Portnadler</a> 14:03, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Everyone is correct. A velocity consists of a speed and a direction. Earth's <i>speed</i> in its orbit around the solar system barycenter is virtually constant at 30 km/s, yet its <i>velocity</i> is always changing because its direction is always changing. It is this change in direction that causes the stars to follow elliptical paths due to aberration. If Earth's velocity was constant, meaning both its speed and direction were constant relative to a solar system barycenter that was not moving through inertial space (if the Sun and its gravity ceased to exist causing Earth to fly off on a tangent to its former orbit), then aberration would produce a shift in the position of each star that would vary depending on the angle between the direction to the star and the direction of Earth's constant velocity. The shift would be greatest at a constant 20.5" if the angle was 90° (moving broadside to the star) and least at 0" if the angle was either 0° (directly toward the star) or 180° (directly away from the star). The latter also describes the <i>secular aberration</i> due to the motion of the barycenter of the solar system through the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milky_Way_7069.html" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a> towards the star Vega at about 217 km/s, which would produce a maximum aberration at right angles to that motion of 150". The anisotropy of the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_background_radiation.html" title="Cosmic background radiation">cosmic background radiation</a> of about 0.1% means that the solar system is moving relative to the inertial reference frame of the universe at 600 km/s,<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/bkg3k.html#c4" class="external autonumber" title="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/bkg3k.html#c4" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> producing a maximum aberration of roughly 400" at right angles to that motion. The latter includes the motion of the solar system relative to the Milky Way, so stars within the Milky Way would have some constant aberration, and distant galaxies would also have some constant aberration. But as the article states, the aberration due to the motion of the solar system itself (exclusive of Earth's motion around the barycenter) is usually ignored—the constant shift in the positions of the stars and distant galaxies due to the (linear) motion of the solar system itself (during our lifetime) is simply accepted. Because the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Celestial_Reference_Frame_4156.html" title="International Celestial Reference Frame">International Celestial Reference Frame</a> relies on extra-galactic radio sources, which are presumably well outside the Milky Way galaxy, yet nowhere near the observable edge of the Universe, we don't quite have a true inertial reference frame. — <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Kress_19e1.html" title="User:Joe Kress">Joe Kress</a> 11:20, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good to see that we agree about the fundamentals; remains the details of how to explain it in a simple way that is nevertheless correct. Note that I haven't looked at the last changes yet, I just have time to read the above comment, and to add two references of my own, as Ii promised. But I should correct an important misconception in the above comment by Joe:</dd>
<dd>as I already stressed, if the earth were in inertial motion, no stellar aberration would occur, as the stars would remain fixed at the same angles. For it's indeed this change in direction that causes the observation of aberration, and it's the observed circular motion of the stars that is (or at least, was!) called aberration. Aberration of the solar system would be (should be) related to an assumed cosmic non-inertial motion of the sun, which has an observable effect in principle.</dd>

<dd>The following is from the <i>Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac</i>, p. 23
<dl>
<dd>Because the velocity of light is finite, the direction in which a moving celestial object is seen by a moving observer (its apparent position) is not the same as the direction of the straight line between the observer and object (its geometric position) at the same instant. This displacement of the apparent position from the geometric position may be attributed in part to the motion of the object and in part to the orbital and rotational motion of the observer, both of these motions being referred to a standard coordinate frame. The former part, which is independent of the motion of the observer, is referred to as the <i>correction for light-time</i>; the latter part, which is independent of the motion or distance of the object, is referred to as <i>stellar aberration</i>. (For stars the light-time is ignored). The sum of the two parts is called <i>planetary aberration</i> because it is applicable to planets and other members of the solar system.</dd>

<p>I assume that the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Celestial_Reference_Frame_4156.html" title="International Celestial Reference Frame">International Celestial Reference Frame</a> as referenced to intergalactic radio sources, and a frame that is referenced on the cosmic background radiation coincide (to within the currently attainable measurement accuracy.)</p>
<p>Recapitulating:<br />
Arguably, the cosmic background radiation is as close as it gets to defining <i>the inertial frame of the universe</i>. It is possible to calculate exactly what stellar positions would be measured by a telescope in space that moves in such a way that there is no Cosmic Background radiation anisotropy for that telescope platform. The cosmic background radiation frame is the only unique frame. I gather that positions as related to the unique frame are by convention categorized as "true positions" and that positions as related to any other frame than the unique frame are by the same convention categorized as "apparant positions".</p>
<p>As I understand it, the first usage of the word 'aberration' is about the <i>reception of light</i>. There is a large number of celestial objects (stars), and there is an observatory platform, with a significant velocity with respect to the barycenter of the large number of stars. The first usage of the word 'aberration', I gather, is about the physics of the proces of light <i>arriving</i> at an observatory platform.</p>
<p>There is something odd about some textbooks referring to 'stellar abberration'. If aberration is supposed to be about <i>reception</i> of light, how then is aberration also to be a property of stars? Clearly, the expression 'stellar aberration' in textbooks is physics shorthand, an expression that is only superficially related to the primary expression.</p>
<p>Harald88 is still somewhat dissatisfied with the wording. It seems to me that clarity can be achieved/improved by distinguishing between the primary meaning of 'aberration', and derived usages of that expression. --<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleonis_cb3e.html" title="User:Cleonis">Cleonis</a> | <a href="../../../c/l/e/User_talk%7ECleonis_c345.html" title="User talk:Cleonis">Talk</a> 12:08, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have a look at the definitions I posted above. I think we crossed in the post (so to speak). I have also reverted Harald88's last version of the introduction, because it did not properly introduce or cross-reference the concept of an inertial frame. Also, I repeat from the definion from the <i>Explanatory Supplement</i>, aberration is caused by the fact that the observer has instaneous velocity relative to the observed object. There is no need to complicate the explanation further. --<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPortnadler_032a.html" title="User:Portnadler">Portnadler</a> 12:17, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are right, I had more complexity than necessary. When two spacecrafts in space are only receiving signals from each other, they can deduce from measurements their relative velocity (up to deducing from measurements relative transversal velocity).

<dd>Sorry but no, Portnadler is not right this time: stellar aberration is the same for all stars. The explanation of the "Explanatory supplement" corresponds with the other sources that I cited on this page, and not with the paraphrase above by Portnadler: I stress once more that "orbital and rotational motion of the observer" differs from "the fact that the observer has instaneous velocity relative to the observed object". In fact, Portnadler here copied Einstein's erroneous explanation of 1905, which has been disproved by De Sitter when observing double stars: the velocity of the star is irrelevant for stellar aberration, as the distant stars are "fixed" for all practical purpose.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Another rewrite of the intro</span></h2>
<p>I have had another bash at rewriting the introduction. As others have pointed out, the definition of aberration depends upon the precise definitions of the <b>true position</b> and <b>apparent position</b> of an object. Stellar aberration (and light-time correction, when relevant) causes the difference between these two positions. Stellar aberration is caused by the fact the the observer has velocity relative to the object at the instant of observation. It is not necessary to introduce relavistic concepts, such as inertial frames. At velocities which are small relative to the speed of light, aberration can be calculated using classical methods. Remember that Bradley was nearly 200 years before Einstein. --<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPortnadler_032a.html" title="User:Portnadler">Portnadler</a> 15:14, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the try but it's still erroneous, eventhough I agree that no relativistic corrections need to be accounted for. The way Bradley formulated it is still perfectly valid - and I'll include it now. I hope that you don't think that I'm nitpicking, but all those at first sight subtle differences in formulation hide big differences in meaning.

<dd>The parts about the velocity of the observed object and the cosmic background are irrelevant, but aberration really is a displacement of apparent position, not a motion, caused by the Earth's velocity relative to a hypothetical stationary-by-definition observer on the Sun. There's no need for the "non-inertial" or "periodic" motion you've got in the intro. <i>Any</i> two observers in relative motion will, if they compare notes, see that the objects they see are in different positions. See for instance, <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/StellarAberration.html" class="external free" title="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/StellarAberration.html" rel="nofollow">http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/StellarAberration.html</a></dd>
<dd>Now, <i>because</i> the Earth's velocity is changing as it goes around its orbit, the vector of the aberration is also constantly changing, but the phenomenon doesn't need that.</dd>

<dd>See above for my additional explanation to Portnadler (if finally one explanation "clicks", then that one is likely good enough to copy to the article space!). But about this last one, it's again erroneous (and equally erroneous for rain drops!): the earth moves in the solar frame at nearly constant velocity v, resulting (schematically) in for example +v in January and -v in July. This velocity difference delta_v between consecutive measurements causes an observable angular shift of all stars on the photographic film, and <i>that</i> is called stellar aberration.</dd>

<dd>Wwoods, I find it amazing that you claim that 'the observer's position or velocity six months hence is <b>irrelevant</b> ', while Fourmilab -which you've read yourself- correctly explains that "On each point in its orbit, the Earth is travelling with a velocity with respect to the distant stars that differs by 60 kilometers per second from the velocity at the opposing point--where the Earth will be six months hence". <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 16:06, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The fact that the Earth's velocity is changing over the course of the year <i>is</i> irrelevant; the effect of aberration exists at every instant, though its value changes with the Earth's velocity. That comparison with the Earth six months hence just determines the range over which the aberration varies. Go back to fourmilab and read the rest of the page.</dd>
<dd>If a spacecraft is cruising along at a constant velocity of 0.99<i>c</i>, is the aberration it observes (a) huge, or (b) zero?</dd>

<dd>[reset indentation] Better to say 'observed <b>differences</b> in position'. And six months later, if they keep the same velocity, they'll observe the same huge aberration. Or, if they change velocity, they'll observe a corresponding change in aberration. Likewise, as the Earth's velocity changes over the course of a year, astronomers on Earth observe changing values of the aberration of stellar positions, relative to those "observed on average on earth".</dd>

<dd>Almost: it's inaccurate to talk of a "change of aberration, as the change of apparent position <i>is</i> the phenomenon that is called stellar aberration - but I already cited sources that point that out and explained why as well... <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 20:40, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No! As <i>you yourself</i> quoted above, aberration is "the difference between the apparent positions found by observers in relative motion". Just look at the formulas: <a href="../../../../fr/a/b/e/Aberration_de_la_lumi%C3%A8re.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Aberration_de_la_lumière">fr:Aberration</a>, <a href="http://www.fourmilab.com/cship/aberration.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fourmilab.com/cship/aberration.html" rel="nofollow">fourmilab</a>, <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/StellarAberration.html" class="external text" title="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/StellarAberration.html" rel="nofollow">wolfram.com</a>. Aberration is a function of velocity, not acceleration. A change of velocity produces a change of aberration.</dd>

<p>I totally agree with Wwoods. <s>What I really don't like about Harald88's intro is the reference to some arbitrary "inertial frame". All you need is the fact the observer has velocity relative to the object at the instant of observation.</s> In the case of an earthbound observer, the direction of this velocity vector changes during the course of a year – hence annual aberration. I propose to revert to my previous version of the intro, but will await other's comments before doing so. --<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPortnadler_032a.html" title="User:Portnadler">Portnadler</a> 08:11, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is an obvious confusion or misunderstanding here: I fully agree that it's not good to refer to some arbitrary inertial frame, as Wwoods does here above, and which leads to the miscomprehension that the phenomenon would be observed when in inertial motion.</dd>
<dd>So far I have improved the intro only. But, as both I and Cleon also pointed out above, it's an historically known error to refer to "the object at the instant of observation". For a summary of one abovementioned references that also discusses that error, see <a href="http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~pbrosche/aa/acta/vol03/acta03_096.html" class="external free" title="http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~pbrosche/aa/acta/vol03/acta03_096.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~pbrosche/aa/acta/vol03/acta03_096.html</a> <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 16:21, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>PS I quite like the simple but still correct description of the "Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac" , according to which stellar aberration is due to <i>the orbital and rotational motion of the observer</i>. If you prefer that formulation too, please don't hesitate to improve the intro accordingly. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 16:10, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But <i>the orbital and rotational motion</i> of the Earthbound observer is a special case. Aberration occurs if the observer has <i>any</i> velocity component that is perpendicular to the straight line between the observer and object. That is the simple point that you do not appear to understand.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Consider the following example. An observer is on a spaceship which has an instrument that is capable of measuring very precisely the angular separation of two objects. Close to a distant star is another star whose angular separation from the first star is exactly one degree, when the spaceship is at rest relative to the two stars (we assume they have no relative velocity between them either). This is the true angular separation. The spaceship now starts to move directly towards the first star. There is no tangential velocity relative to the first star, but there <b>is</b> to the second star. Aberration will therefore make the angular separation between the two stars to be slightly less than one degree (as an aside, this effect is <b>differential aberration</b> and perhaps warrants a paragraph in the main article). If the spaceship turns around and moves directly away from the first star, the angular separation will appear to be slightly more than one degree. --<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPortnadler_032a.html" title="User:Portnadler">Portnadler</a> 17:14, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Portnadler, we obviously continue to disagree about the usual meaning of the term stellar aberration, making an agreement on correct paraphrasing of the sources difficult. Happily that is not essential, as long as we can agree on citations. Note that in your last criticism you confused me with one of the sources that you supplied - and we both think that it's a good source.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, here my take on your example (note that I I'll be happy to see a source that distinguishes beteen "aberration" and "differential aberration").</dd>
<dd>Your example is fine, except for the "therefore" which is misleading in this context. Apparently you have difficulty with <b>the Almanac's clarification that stellar aberration is independent of the motion of the object</b>, and your example can be extended to illustrate that fact as follows:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Consider a third star with the same angular separation from the first star as between the first and second star, but which has a velocity equal to that of the space ship on its travel. Eventhough the velocity between the spaceship and that star becomes zero, the stellar aberration is still identical to that of the second star.
