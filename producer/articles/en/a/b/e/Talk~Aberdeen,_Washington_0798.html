<p>I was conceived &amp; occasionally raised in Aberdeen; I'd just like to voice my unwavering support for the first paragraph of this article. But Cobain was a little knob who obviously had some issues, and I think he wanted to blame his Aberdeen upbringing for his problems. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrodo_df69.html" title="User:Brodo">Brodo</a></p>
<p>I was born and raised in aberdeen and just recently moved to seattle to persue a career in sales. Kurt was my first cousin. It angers me to see people such as jshultz talk negatively about aberdeen honoring such a successful artist. It'd be nice if people kept their opinions about the deceased to themselves. Kurt was a fine human being who struggled with the life of a superstar. I think it is neat that Aberdeen is finally acknowledging his legend status, its about damn time. I remember coming home to visit my parents awhile back and read an article in the daily world talking about the contraversy of putting the "come as you are" sign up. Again, my family was deeply offended of some of the remarks that aberdonians made about someone they never knew. It's easy to make assumptions, it's tough to keep your mouth shut. My family has dealt with a lot over the years after his passing (books w/ nothing but false depictions, kurt &amp; courtney massacre of a biography) I wish the public would just understand that regardless of a persons status, they are still human and families do exist. Aberdeen is a great place to come from, not the best place to reside after growing up because of the lack of economy. I think something about the history of the town's high school should be included in the article. There are many traditions to make marks upon and i hope it is later incorporated.-Tyler Giese</p>
<p><br />
Tyler, I will reinsert my quote you removed, as I think you clearly did not read it as I had intended. The page originally had a mean and poorly written intro. in the 1st paragraph with this quote (That "Brodo" is refering to above your paragraph),</p>
<dl>
<dd>"however locals generally term it "Hicktown, USA" or, as famous Aberdonian Kurt Cobain put it:</dd>
<dd>"In Aberdeen, I hated my friends with a passion, because they were idiots."</dd>
</dl>
<p>To which I responded with this (somewhat sarcastic I will admit), "Yeah, I've often travelled through and it is as described (in article) but it seems a little harsh for the intro. page to a city. I wonder if the Cobain quote could be moved elsewhere only because it makes every resident sound like a total loser and I would think of the 16,000 residents at least one might have their lives together... JShultz"</p>
<p>So as you can see, I was not referencing the "Come as you are" sign, which I think is a wonderful tribute to Kurt, I was responding to a negative comment about Aberdeen with a call to remove the inapropriate terms of Hicktown...etc. Sorry for the confusion, but remember when you read an article six months later, things may have changed. The person who was insulting the town was in fact "Brodo". JShultz</p>
<p>What relevance does the line about the percentage voting for Kerry have? Why is that placed in this article so prominently?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I removed the line about the 2004 presidential election votes from the intro paragraph; It has no place their. I would also like to see the line about Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes leave the intro, but I couldn't find a more appropriate place to put it. Also, plase remember to sign your posts using four tildes (~~~~) at the end of your posts. --<a href="../../../h/o/j/User%7EHojimachong_c483.html" title="User:Hojimachong"><font color="#0000CC" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Hojimachong</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../h/o/j/User_talk%7EHojimachong_5367.html" title="User talk:Hojimachong"><font color="#00FFAA">talk</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hojimachong_3109.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hojimachong"><font color="#FF0000">con</font></a></sub> 00:22, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
