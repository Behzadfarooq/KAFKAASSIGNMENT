<p>Latest stats that I can find on the General Register site are mid-2005 population stats, and that is the linked reference for [1] on the page. Have you managed to find a different (more up-to-date) document that refers to the stat of 214,250?

<p>In the <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Aberdeen (disambiguation)">Aberdeen (disambiguation)</a> article there are over 30 other Aberdeens listed. Does anyone else think that this page should be moved to a title 'Aberdeen, Scotland'.</p>
<p>This could cause problems for links, but if the disambiguation was moved to the name 'Aberdeen' this will not cause much of a problem, especially if an edit on incoming major links is made straight out.</p>
<p>I do admit to liking the fact that my home town gets a better name than all the other Aberdeens, so perhaps the others contributing think the same... <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbacon_6f8e.html" title="User:Bobbacon">Bobbacon</a> 19:20, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say no, because Aberdeen is, I suspect, the oldest and the "original" Aberdeen (in the sense of being the inspiration behind the name of many of the others). It's arguable, (and I pray nobody brings up the unscientific number of Google hits) but in a global sense I predict it's the best-known as well.</dd>
<dd>Other major cities allow the most famous to take the prime article name. See <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> for example. I don't think anybody would reasonably expect that to go to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris%2C_Texas_5935.html" title="Paris, Texas">Paris, Texas</a>, or anywhere except the French capital.</dd>
<dd>Have a look at the debate at <a href="../../../t/y/r/Talk%7ETyre%2C_Lebanon_5ca1.html" title="Talk:Tyre, Lebanon">Talk:Tyre, Lebanon</a> for some interesting issues surrounding this broad topic. â <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup><i>(</i><a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a><i>)</i></sup> 19:28, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that it is the best known Aberdeen of all, and having looked through other arguements I think its best left put, at least until someone else brings it up again for discussion!

<p>King's College surely merits a more prominent feature on this page than the present picture of the Elphinstone Hall.

<p>I propose this article should be reorganised as per the <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITY_31e4.html" title="WP:CITY">WikiProject Cities</a> guidelines. This would involve using the following headings, and creating the major headings below. Comparing <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> to the <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured article</a> of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, it is obvious there is too much information on the page, and it would be better to split into different sections.</p>

<li>Introduction:</li>
<li>History
<ul>
<li>major historical events that occurred in city</li>

<p>There will also be the requirement for proper <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">referencing</a> â <a href="../../../p/m/j/User%7EPMJ_7638.html" title="User:PMJ">PM</a><a href="../../../p/m/j/User_talk%7EPMJ_f85b.html" title="User talk:PMJ">J</a> 13:55, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, having looked at the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> article I can see that under each subheading there is a link such as <i>main article: economy of Vancouver</i> in the Economy section for example. I suggest that some new pages are created to move the information into - although some sections such as the climate section obviously is short and will not require its own page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My suggestions would be pages for:
<ul>
<li>'Transport of Aberdeen' incorporating the transport section, plus the harbour and bridges from the architecture section</li>
<li>'Religion of Aberdeen' incorporating the section on churches</li>
<li>'Oil Industry of Aberdeen'</li>
<li>'Economy and industry of Aberdeen (non-oil related)'</li>
<li>'Theatres, museums and galleries in Aberdeen', this could perhaps instead be 'Visitor attractions in Aberdeen'</li>
<li>'Parks and open spaces in Aberdeen'</li>
<li>'Education in Aberdeen' incorporating schools and universities information, but not libraries</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As in the Vancouver article I would put a link at the top of each topic to the relevant main article and then write an overview of each on the actual Aberdeen page. I would suggest no more than two paragraphs for each section on the main page.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I couldn't agree more! It would probably be worth comparing the sections to those in other cities before creating the pages, as there is likely a specific style which is used for consistency â <a href="../../../p/m/j/User%7EPMJ_7638.html" title="User:PMJ">PM</a><a href="../../../p/m/j/User_talk%7EPMJ_f85b.html" title="User talk:PMJ">J</a> 21:20, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundee.html" title="Dundee">Dundee</a> is the closest comparable city to Aberdeen geographically, and it is a featured article so it should be a useful reference for Scotland specific sections. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 21:33, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would probably just call 'Economy and industry of Aberdeen (non-oil related)' - 'Economy of Aberdeen' for consistancy. Would probably be best to name the pages after the relevant categories if possible. The oil industry can be mentioned and then main 'Oil Industry of Aberdeen' or possibly 'Oil Industry in Aberdeen' can be linked to from the articles. Similarly, I'd suggest 'Religion in Aberdeen', 'Transport in Aberdeen' and 'Culture in Aberdeen' for consistancy with other articles and the category. May also be worth having a 'Sport in Aberdeen' article, or simply a link to <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen_F.C._38a9.html" title="Aberdeen F.C.">Aberdeen F.C.</a> etc. Phew! â <a href="../../../p/m/j/User%7EPMJ_7638.html" title="User:PMJ">PM</a><a href="../../../p/m/j/User_talk%7EPMJ_f85b.html" title="User talk:PMJ">J</a> 21:44, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(Removed links to previous suggestions to avoid confusion/starting of wrong title) The <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundee.html" title="Dundee">Dundee</a> article does seem to be more akin to the needs of Aberdeen due to proximity and relative size. <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> is for a much bigger city. I think different features should be taken from both.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I like the idea of a sport in Aberdeen article. I the near future I will create a golf course in Aberdeen article, so a <i>Sport in Aberdeen</i> article would be good to encompass that and Aberdeen FC, Cover Rangers etc...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>From what other people have suggested and looking at other articles I agree we need a template style for consistency, the best option seems to be <b><i>type of article</i> in/of Aberdeen</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Before creating new articles I think we need a consensus on what should go into each page. Right now for example, bridges are in the <i>Architecture and Built Environment</i> section, which is indeed correct but it could equally be put into <i>Transport in Aberdeen</i> as a new article. To avoid these arguments, I suggest that those sections for migration be argued on next to suggested titles (which I have listed below).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of the below suggestions, I like the idea of a tourism article as many reading the article will be tourists and it would be useful to give an overview of what to do for those who don't want to know the entire history. Due to the existence of wikitravel I propose such a page should complement (the advert free but commercial wiki) and not compete with it. If a tourism page could not be supported however, then it could be put into the culture article (which is my preference- though I have listed them separately below).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also cannot decide on a title for a Parks and Gardens article. The best I can think of is <i>Green Spaces and Walkways in Aberdeen</i>.

<dd>In the article there are politics details in the Present Day Aberdeen and the Aberdeen City Council sections. I propose taking out both sections and replacing them with a <i>Government and Politics</i> section (like Dundee) with the twinned cities included in this section. The creation of a <i>Politics of Aberdeen</i> article could then also be created. I think this would look neater.</dd>

The results and first post are <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Aberdeen_1f3f.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Aberdeen">Wikipedia:Peer review/Aberdeen</a>.

<dd>I've done a substantial bit of copyediting but there's certainly still a bit more cleaning up to do. I've left a few duplicate internal links in place where they're in fresh sections and are actively helpful, but in terms of prose there was a lot of duplication of phrases (such as "situated between two rivers" kind of stuff) and I suspect there will be more that could be culled. I've also made some changes to the layout of the culture section which was a bit oddly divided to my mind â actually I seem to recall doing much the same thing several months ago, but we got back into a situation where the definition of culture was a bit odd. Surely media and dialect are part of culture? Nice to see that lumpy old list of attractions gone though.</dd>
<dd>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marischal_College_8f9c.html" title="Marischal College">Marischal College</a>, I think there's still too much detail given that there is a separate article; what do you guys think? â <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup><i>(</i><a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a><i>)</i></sup> 00:28, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I moved the culture section around before since it was really long and I felt it need a bit of division to break it up on the page. Looking at it now that its cut down I think it looks quite neat but with one exception... open spaces. A while back I couldn't decide and I still can't where it should be placed. It is certainly a cultural area, but due to the cities heritage with the Britain in Bloom etc.. I can't decide if it merits its own section or not, so I am not going to touch it for now, do others agree?</dd>
<dd>Marischal College I think is mentioned twice, once in education, once in architecture, I think some tags (such as the link to the first largest granite building) are unnecessary (I have removed this- I added it in response to a peer review comment but I think it does look out of place now looking it at). I will leave any other editing on the subject up to others.</dd>
<dd>I was looking at other wikipedia entrys on Aberdeen, particularly the Czech entry and found out that Aberdeen is twinned with Houston (backed up by the <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sister_cities_of_Houston_b7f9.html" title="Sister cities of Houston">Sister cities of Houston</a> article. I am sure there are other details in these articles that are useful so if anyone else speaks other languages?.. we might be able to gleen some other useful information.</dd>
<dd>I have cut out the retail section and merged it into the 'Economy' and 'Future developments in Aberdeen' sections. The reasons being that having two future developments sections feels awkward within the article, the section was relatively small and because other articles do not generally have a retail section.</dd>
<dd>I think there may also be a case for a <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_in_Aberdeen_4387.html" title="Geography in Aberdeen">Geography in Aberdeen</a> article in future, although as of yet I don't think there is enough detail to justify it. I am going to see what I can find on the Denburn, Westburn and other subterranean water as a start. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbacon_6f8e.html" title="User:Bobbacon">Bobbacon</a> 07:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's looking much better with the sections merged â I'd considered merging them too, but decided not to "improve" them in the hope that they might eventually disappear!&#160;;) I don't particularly want to be the champion of this cause but I really don't think it's appropriate to have this kind of future speculation stuff at all. We're writing about Aberdeen as it is, and what made it what it is. Anything could happen in the future so it's potentially misleading to describe plans which may change as budgets and politics meander.

<dd>I completely agree, I began a future developments in Aberdeen page after finding a page about the new bypass and added it since there was already stuff about retail. I think the box about 'infrastructure' developments looks a bit untidy in the end, and if this article is aiming for featured status (which i hope it is) then it can't have any features that are likely to be too changable in the future. I have therefore moved the section, but retained a link in the 'see also' section.</dd>

<dd>Yes, there is no doubt that England has always had far more colleges than Aberdeen, so practically speaking it could handle many more students but the claim that it had two large multi-college universities at the end of the 16th century is just as verifiable as the claim that Aberdeen had two small single-college universities at that same time. Fairness doesn't really come into it. It's more a matter of civic pride. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 16:44, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can see that the city should be rightly proud of its institutions. Nevertheless, I have removed the sentence that Aberdeen had as many universities as the whole of England in the sixteenth century. I do not think that Aberdeen had two universities (as opposed to colleges) until the twentieth century. Oxford and Cambridge Universities each have had more than two colleges since at least the 13th century and very likely earlier.<small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.133.47.152 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.133.47.152_d13f.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.133.47.152">contribs</a>) 09:00, 11 March 2007.</small></dd>
