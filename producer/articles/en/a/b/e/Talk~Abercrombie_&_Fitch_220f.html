<dd>If there are factual errors, feel free to correct them. But please do not delete or otherwise try to set aside the factual, truthful criticisms of A&amp;F. I have no sort of vendetta with them and am professionally neutral with regard to their industry, but I note with alacrity that there is a pervasive pattern at A&amp;F in that they "surface" in the national news now and then for less than honorable reasons, respond to public outcries, and then go back to business as usual. One premise is that they are doing this quite intentionally, with the goal of both so-branding the company and getting free advertising in the process. It's an interesting if not necessarily honorable way to market their company, but:::Your edits look fine, Mike. Glad we talked a bit...I do respect your judgment and maturity. Enjoy your time at 'SC...it goes fast. --AustinKnight 03:39, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>One more thought. The history of the death of the store chain, and then its subsequent revival, is not listed. I think i am correct in recalling that there was a time when the store was completely gone, and then it was brought back. And then later it morphed into the lifestyle brand. I believe it was an early tenant in Trump Tower in 1980s. Not sure who all those folks are. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandlandUSA_3cd6.html" title="User:BrandlandUSA">BrandlandUSA</a> 04:26, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alright, but as an employee of the company I just really have to say that the writing in all the articles on A&amp;F stores seem to have the tell-tale signs of something written by marketing...and the history section especially of the A&amp;F article seems to be paraphrased from the Company's own official history that appears in the employee handbooks, etc.--ArrowHead 15:16, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't have access to the employee handbook. If that is the source then it should be included in the references.

<p>it seems to me that recent changes are completely un-NPOV. as a current associate in the Company I can state that the differences between Impact and Model at most stores are almost non-existent. often times, models after a few months will decide to switch to impact (and vice versa) suggesting that neither position is really more desirable than the other. secondly, no one simply "works in the back" as if they were confined to a dungeon. at any given time several impact team members will be on the floor in an a&amp;f store, working on updates, filling, etc. moreover, a lot of people simply do aspects of both positions on a regular basis. the idea the a&amp;f banishes people to the backroom who are non-white continues to be brought up again and again, but is simply not true. and if a store manager were doing that, he or she could basically be instantly fired after a complaint was logged anonymously with a&amp;f's discrimination hotline. the same stands for any form of discrimination at a&amp;f--racial, sex, sexual orientation, religious, whatever. there is a zero tolerance policy on discrimination of any sort. just anecdotally, i work with two latino/a and two african american managers at my store (out of a total of roughly 10), so i would say that it is hardly an un-diverse work environment. --ArrowHead 06:22, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The main point is indeed true, however, may I say that there is a difference between Impact and Brand Representatives. They have a completely different job description.

<p>Ok, so do we need a total number of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch stores as a corporation, or as the individual brand? <a href="http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=ANF&amp;script=410&amp;layout=6&amp;item_id=931224" class="external free" title="http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=ANF&amp;script=410&amp;layout=6&amp;item_id=931224" rel="nofollow">http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=ANF&amp;script=410&amp;layout=6&amp;item_id=931224</a></p>
<p>if we go there, to the company's 3rd quarter report, (The next one isnt until Feb. 20th, 2007) we see this</p>
<p>The Company operated 355 Abercrombie &amp; Fitch stores, 171 abercrombie stores, 369 Hollister Co. stores, and 11 RUEHL stores in the United States at the end of the third quarter of 2006.</p>
<p>a total of 906 stores. And if the total number is counted as that, (either way i think there should possibly be a listing for each brand total and corporation total) and its the only number used, wyoming would be the only state without an A&amp;F brand in it. new mexico i believe has four Hollister locations at the current time.</p>
<p>anyway, the opening of this article seems like it should start off with the corporation, and quickly detail the lower brand numbers. then when talking about the individual brands, mention the numbers of each. With it being written as it is currently, stating there are 350 stores, it sounds like that is the total number that the corporation currently holds between all brands. and hmmm, i think i repeated myself a bit. ill stop here. my username is kmccusker2 if you want to leave me feedback personally on this.</p>

<p>Over at the <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mulesing.html" title="Mulesing">Mulesing</a> article there is a bit of mention that Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, in response to pressure from <a href="../../../p/e/t/PETA_7157.html" title="PETA">PETA</a>, stopped stocking Australian / Merino wool products.</p>
<p>Can anyone advise,</p>
<ol>
<li>Did they actually carry Australian / Merino wool products before the "boycott"?</li>
<li>Did they indeed cease selling Australian / Merino wool products?</li>
<li>The boycott was requested in 2004 - are they selling any Australian / Merino wool <i>now</i>?</li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically, products effected would have the <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woolmark.html" title="Woolmark">woolmark</a>. Ideally, we'd need promotional material which could be cited. An e-catalogue or something would be fantastic!</p>
<p>To be honest - I don't even know what A&amp;F sell. I guess the main types of items for wool would be suits / blazers and woolen jumpers. Other woolen products probably wouldn't mention country of origin or wool type in the label - it'd just be "wool socks".</p>

<p>Back to my earlier talk post, after listening to the last conference call for Q4, the outlets created for both A&amp;F and Hollister are used for clothing with quality issues only. The statement about minorities being more likely to work in the back is, first, a biased statement. Also, from my experience, in 4 different stores, I have actually experienced the opposite for employment titles, which with 944 stores is in no way a representation of all stores, but just a display that the opposite side of the statement can also be found. And RMC, in the song list for the companies being mentioned, I do not think it is significant, a first for the brand, and especially not done by a popular culture, or even known (judging from his myspaces 720 total page views) recording artist, and therefore should not be in the article.</p>

<p>Is this needed? i took it out as it is always changing with seasons, and isn't encyclopedic. I think, especially since we are trying to move away from reading like an advertisement, this should stay deleted. Kmccusker2 21:04, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>does this article really need a section on the website itself? can't you simply sum something up about it in one sentence in a section about the company itself? if you have that, you'll need one for the other three brands as well, which is unnecessary. Kmccusker2 04:11, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
