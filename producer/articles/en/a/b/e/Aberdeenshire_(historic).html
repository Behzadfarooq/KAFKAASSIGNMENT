<p><b>Aberdeenshire</b> or the <b>County of Aberdeen</b> (<i>Siorrachd Obar Dheathain</i> in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Gaelic_b039.html" title="Scottish Gaelic">Gaelic</a>) is a <a href="../../../r/e/g/Registration_county.html" title="Registration county">registration county</a> of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. This area (excluding <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> itself) is also a <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenancy_areas_of_Scotland_b724.html" title="Lieutenancy areas of Scotland">lieutenancy area</a>.</p>
<p>Until 1975 Aberdeenshire was one of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counties_of_Scotland_28e8.html" title="Counties of Scotland">counties of Scotland</a>, governed by a <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_council.html" title="County council">county council</a> from 1890. The boundaries of the county were adjusted by the boundary commissioners appointed under the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Government_%28Scotland%29_Act_1889_dd47.html" title="Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889">Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889</a> that established the county council. In 1900, the county town of Aberdeen became a county of a city and was thus removed from the county.</p>
<p>The county bordered <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kincardineshire.html" title="Kincardineshire">Kincardineshire</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus.html" title="Angus">Angus</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perthshire.html" title="Perthshire">Perthshire</a> to the south, <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverness-shire.html" title="Inverness-shire">Inverness-shire</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banffshire.html" title="Banffshire">Banffshire</a> to the west, and the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_f231.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> to the north and east. It had a coast-line of 65 miles (105 km), and was the sixth Scottish county in area, occupying 5,107 km².<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1975 the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Government_%28Scotland%29_Act_1973_99d2.html" title="Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973">Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973</a> reorganised local administration in Scotland into a two-tier system of regions and districts. Aberdeenshire, along with the City of Aberdeen, Banffshire, Kincardineshire and most of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morayshire.html" title="Morayshire">Morayshire</a> were merged to form <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grampian_Region_7ac5.html" title="Grampian Region">Grampian Region</a>, with the former county being divided between the districts of <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Aberdeen_12df.html" title="City of Aberdeen">City of Aberdeen</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banff_and_Buchan_dc1d.html" title="Banff and Buchan">Banff and Buchan</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon%2C_Scotland_ef75.html" title="Gordon, Scotland">Gordon</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kincardine_and_Deeside_7502.html" title="Kincardine and Deeside">Kincardine and Deeside</a>.</p>
<p>In 1996 Scottish local government system was reorganised a second time to form a single tier of unitary council areas. The name was revived for the <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeenshire.html" title="Aberdeenshire">council area of Aberdeenshire</a>, which has different boundaries.</p>
<p>The area is generally hilly, and from the south-west, near the centre of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grampian_Mountains_%28Scotland%29_714d.html" title="Grampian Mountains (Scotland)">Grampians</a> send out various branches, mostly to the north-east.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>There was an <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeenshire_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_7867.html" title="Aberdeenshire (UK Parliament constituency)">Aberdeenshire constituency</a> of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Great_Britain_660a.html" title="Parliament of Great Britain">Parliament of Great Britain</a> from 1708 to 1801 and of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom_dcaf.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a> from 1801 to 1868.

The other components of the <a href="../../../d/i/s/District_of_burghs.html" title="District of burghs">district of burghs</a> became components of the then new <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montrose_Burghs_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_779b.html" title="Montrose Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)">Montrose District of Burghs</a>.</p>
<p>In 1868 the Aberdeenshire constituency was divided to form two new <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_constituency.html" title="County constituency">county divisions</a>, or <i>county constituencies</i>, namely <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Aberdeenshire_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_e787.html" title="Eastern Aberdeenshire (UK Parliament constituency)">Eastern Aberdeenshire</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Aberdeenshire_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_3f90.html" title="Western Aberdeenshire (UK Parliament constituency)">Western Aberdeenshire</a>.</p>
<p>In 1885 the Aberdeen <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgh_constituency.html" title="Burgh constituency">burgh constituency</a> was divided to form the burgh constituencies of <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen_North_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_97e3.html" title="Aberdeen North (UK Parliament constituency)">Aberdeen North</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen_South_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_160c.html" title="Aberdeen South (UK Parliament constituency)">Aberdeen South</a>.</p>
<p>In 1918 Aberdeenshire and <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kincardineshire.html" title="Kincardineshire">Kincardineshire</a> were treated as if a single county for parliamentary representation purposes, with the area of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kincardineshire_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_2877.html" title="Kincardineshire (UK Parliament constituency)">Kincardineshire county constituency</a> and the Aberdeenshire constituencies being divided into three new constituencies, <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kincardine_and_Western_Aberdeenshire_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_37d3.html" title="Kincardine and Western Aberdeenshire (UK Parliament constituency)">Kincardine and Western Aberdeenshire</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen_and_Kincardine_Central_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_f09c.html" title="Aberdeen and Kincardine Central (UK Parliament constituency)">Aberdeen and Kincardine Central</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen_and_Kincardine_East_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_8f31.html" title="Aberdeen and Kincardine East (UK Parliament constituency)">Aberdeen and Kincardine East</a>. Kincardine and Western Aberdeenshire included the whole of the former Kincardineshire constituency.</p>
<p>In 1950 the area of the former Kincardinshire constituency (as abolished in 1918) was merged into a the then new <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Angus_and_Mearns_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_779c.html" title="North Angus and Mearns (UK Parliament constituency)">North Angus and Mearns constituency</a>, and the Aberdeenshire area was divided into the <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeenshire_East_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_51a9.html" title="Aberdeenshire East (UK Parliament constituency)">Aberdeenshire East constituency</a> and the <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeenshire_West_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_ef0a.html" title="Aberdeenshire West (UK Parliament constituency)">Aberdeenshire West constituency</a>, but the boundary between these new eastern and western constituencies differed from that for the constituencies of the 1868 to 1918 period.</p>
<p>Boundary changes in 1955 enlarged the Aberdeenshire West constituency, and reduced the size of the Aberdeenshire East constituency.</p>
<p>In 1983, eight years after the local government county of Aberdeenshire was abolished, the Aberdeenshire constituencies were replaced with new constrituencies.</p>

<li><a href="../../../g/a/r/Garioch.html" title="Garioch">Garioch</a>, in the centre of the shire, comprises a beautiful, undulating, loamy, fertile valley, formerly called the granary of <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen%2C_Scotland_1d3f.html" title="Aberdeen, Scotland">Aberdeen</a>.</li>

<p>The greater part of the county is composed of crystalline <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schist.html" title="Schist">schists</a> belonging to the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metamorphic_rock.html" title="Metamorphic rock">metamorphic rocks</a> of the Eastern Highlands.</p>
<p>In the upper parts of the valleys of the Dee and the Don they form well-marked groups, of which the most characteristic are</p>
<ol>
<li>the black schists and <a href="../../../p/h/y/Phyllite.html" title="Phyllite">phyllites</a>, with flints, and a thin band of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Tremolite.html" title="Tremolite">tremolite</a> <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limestone.html" title="Limestone">limestone</a>,</li>
<li>the main or <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blair_Atholl_dc75.html" title="Blair Atholl">Blair Atholl</a> limestone,</li>
<li>the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quartzite.html" title="Quartzite">quartzite</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>These divisions are folded on highly inclined or vertical axes trending north-east and south-west, and hence the same zones are repeated over a considerable area. The quartzite is generally regarded as the highest member of the series. Excellent sections showing the component strata occur in Glen Clunie and its tributary valleys above Braemar. Eastwards down the Dee and the Don and northwards across the plain of Buchan towards <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rattray_Head_8f4f.html" title="Rattray Head">Rattray Head</a> and Fraserburgh there is a development of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biotite.html" title="Biotite">biotite</a> <a href="../../../g/n/e/Gneiss.html" title="Gneiss">gneiss</a>, partly of <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedimentary_rock.html" title="Sedimentary rock">sedimentary</a> and perhaps partly of <a href="../../../i/g/n/Igneous_rock.html" title="Igneous rock">igneous</a> origin. A belt of slate which has been quarried for roofing purposes runs along the west border of the county from Turriff by Auchterless and the Foudland Hills towards the Tap o' Noth near Gartly. The metamorphic rocks have been invaded by igneous materials, some before, and by far the larger series after the folding of the strata.</p>
<p>The basic types of the former are represented by the sills of <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidiorite.html" title="Epidiorite">epidiorite</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hornblende.html" title="Hornblende">hornblende</a> gneiss in Glen Muick and Glen Callater, which have been permeated by <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granite.html" title="Granite">granite</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegmatite.html" title="Pegmatite">pegmatite</a> in <a href="../../../v/e/i/Vein.html" title="Vein">veins</a> and lenticles, often foliated. The later granites subsequent to the plication of the schists have a wide distribution on the Ben Macdhui and Ben Avon range, and on Lochnagar; they stretch eastwards from Ballater by Tarland to <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> and north to Bennachie. Isolated masses appear at Peterhead and at Strichen.</p>
<p>Though consisting mainly of biotite granite, these later intrusions pass by intermediate stages into <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diorite.html" title="Diorite">diorite</a>, as in the area between Balmoral and the head-waters of the Gairn. The granites have been extensively quarried at <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubislaw.html" title="Rubislaw">Rubislaw</a>, Peterhead and <a href="../../../k/e/m/Kemnay.html" title="Kemnay">Kemnay</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/e/r/Serpentine.html" title="Serpentine">Serpentine</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troctolite.html" title="Troctolite">troctolite</a>, the precise age of which is uncertain, occur at the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Dog_c960.html" title="Black Dog">Black Dog</a> rock north of <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, at Belhelvie and near Old Meldrum. Where the schists of sedimentary origin have been pierced by these igneous intrusions, they are charged with contact minerals such as <a href="../../../s/i/l/Sillimanite.html" title="Sillimanite">sillimanite</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cordierite.html" title="Cordierite">cordierite</a>, <a href="../../../k/y/a/Kyanite.html" title="Kyanite">kyanite</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andalusite.html" title="Andalusite">andalusite</a>. Cordierite-bearing rocks occur near Ellon, at the foot of Bennachie, and on the top of the Buck of Cabrach.</p>

<p>A larger <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minerals.html" title="List of minerals">list of minerals</a> has been obtained from an exposure of limestone and associated beds in Glen Gairn, about four miles (6 km) above the point where that river joins the Dee.</p>
<p>Narrow belts of Old Red <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandstone.html" title="Sandstone">Sandstone</a>, resting unconformably on the old platform of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate.html" title="Slate">slates</a> and schists, have been traced from the north coast at Peterhead by Turriff to <a href="../../../f/y/v/Fyvie.html" title="Fyvie">Fyvie</a>, and also from Huntly by Gartly to <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kildrummy_Castle_ab0f.html" title="Kildrummy Castle">Kildrummy Castle</a>. The strata consist mainly of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conglomerate_%28geology%29.html" title="Conglomerate (geology)">conglomerates</a> and sandstones, which, at Gartly and at Rhynie, are associated with lenticular bands of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andesite.html" title="Andesite">andesite</a> indicating contemporaneous <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volcano.html" title="Volcano">volcanic</a> action. Small outliers of conglomerate and sandstone of this age have recently been found in the course of excavations in Aberdeen.</p>
<p>The glacial deposits, especially in the belt bordering the coast between <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> and Peterhead, furnish important evidence. The ice moved eastwards off the high ground at the head of the Dee and the Don, while the mass spreading outwards from the Moray Firth invaded the low plateau of <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buchan.html" title="Buchan">Buchan</a>; but at a certain stage there was a marked defection northwards parallel with the coast, as proved by the deposit of red <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay.html" title="Clay">clay</a> north of <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>. At a later date the local <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glacier.html" title="Glacier">glaciers</a> laid down materials on top of the red clay.</p>
<p>The committee appointed by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Association_86a2.html" title="British Association">British Association</a> proved that the Greensand, which has yielded a large suite of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cretaceous.html" title="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> fossils at Moreseat, in the parish of Cruden, occurs in glacial drift, resting probably on granite. The strata from which the Moreseat fossils were derived are not now found in place in that part of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, but Mr Jukes Brown considers that the horizon of the fossils is that of the lower Greensand of the Isle of Wight or the Aptien stage of <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. Chalk flints are widely distributed in the drift between Fyvie and the east coast of Buchan. At Plaidy a patch of clay with Liassic fossils occurs. At several localities between Logie Coldstone and Dinnet a deposit of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diatomite.html" title="Diatomite">diatomite</a> (<a href="../../../k/i/e/Kieselguhr.html" title="Kieselguhr">Kieselguhr</a>) occurs beneath the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peat.html" title="Peat">peat</a>.</p>

<p>The tops of the highest mountains have an arctic flora. At the royal lodge on Loch Muick, 411 m (1350 ft) above the sea, grow larches, vegetables, currants, laurels, roses, etc. Some ash-trees, 1 to 1.5 m (4 or 5 ft) in girth, grow at 400 m (1300 ft) above the sea. Trees, especially Scotch fir and larch, grow well, and Braemar has plentiful natural timber, said to surpass any in the north of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Stumps of Scotch fir and oak found in peat sometimes far exceed any now growing in size.</p>
<p>Moles occur at 550 m (1800 ft) above the sea, and squirrels at 450 m (1400 ft). Grouse, partridges and hares abound, and rabbits are often too numerous.

<p>Except in the mountainous districts, Aberdeenshire has a comparatively mild climate, owing to the proximity of much of the shire to the sea. The mean annual temperature at Braemar reaches 6 °C (44 °F), and that at <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> 8 °C (46 °F). The mean yearly rainfall varies from about 750 to 950 mm (30 to 37 in). In summer the upper Dee and Don valleys provide the driest and most bracing climate in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, and grain grows cultivated up to 500 m (1600 ft) above the sea, or 100 to 150 m (400 to 500 ft) higher than elsewhere in North Britain. Poor, gravelly, clayey and peaty soils prevail, but tile-draining, bones and guano, and the best methods of modern tillage, have greatly increased the produce. Indeed, in no part of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> has a more productive soil developed out of such unpromising material. Farm-houses and steadings have much improved, and the best agricultural implements and machines get widespread use. About two-thirds of the population depend entirely on agriculture. Farms are small compared with those in the south-eastern counties. Oats form the predominant crop, wheat has practically gone out of cultivation, but barley has largely increased. The most distinctive industry is cattle-feeding. Aberdeenshire fattens a great number of the home-bred crosses for the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and local markets, and imports Irish animals on an extensive scale for the same purpose, while an exceedingly heavy trade in dead meat for <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and the south occurs all over the county. Farmers also raise <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheep_farm.html" title="Sheep farm">sheep</a>, horses and pigs in large numbers.</p>

<p>A large <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing.html" title="Fishing">fishing</a> population in villages along the coast engage in the white and herring fishery, fostering the next most important industry to agriculture.</p>
<p>Aberdeenshire fishing developed almost exclusively due to the introduction of steam trawlers. The total value of the annual catch, of which between a half and a third consists of herrings, amounts to £1,000,000.</p>
<p>The industry produces both speldings (salted and rock-dried haddocks) and finnans (smoked haddocks). The ports and creeks belong to the fishery districts of Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Aberdeen, the last of which includes also three Kincardineshire ports. The herring season for <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, Peterhead and Fraserburgh lasts from June to September, at which time the ports become crowded with boats from other Scottish districts. Valuable salmon-fishings exist - rod, net and stake-net - on the Dee, Don, Ythan and Ugie.</p>
<p>The average annual despatch of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salmon.html" title="Salmon">salmon</a> from Aberdeenshire comprises about 400 tons.</p>

<p>Manufactures mainly cluster in or near the city of <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, but throughout the rural districts one finds much milling of corn, brick and tile making, smith-work, brewing and distilling, cart and farm-implement making, casting and drying of peat, and timber-felling, especially on Deeside and Donside, for pit-props, railway sleepers, laths and barrel staves. A number of paper-making establishments operate, most of them on the Don near <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>.</p>
<p>The chief mineral wealth comes from the noted durable <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granite.html" title="Granite">granite</a>, quarried at <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, Kemnay, Peterhead and elsewhere including for causewaying stones. <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandstone.html" title="Sandstone">Sandstone</a> and other rocks are also quarried at different parts. The shire imports mostly coal, lime, timber, iron, slate, raw materials for the textile manufactures, wheat, cattle-feeding stuffs, bones, guano, sugar, alcoholic liquors, fruits. The exports include granite (rough-dressed and polished), flax, woollen and cotton goods, paper, combs, preserved provisions, oats, barley, and live and dead cattle.</p>

<p>In 1801 the population numbered 284,036 and in 1901 304,439 (of whom 159,603 were females), or 154 persons to the square mile (59/km²).

Relics of <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crannog.html" title="Crannog">crannogs</a> or lake-dwellings exist at Loch Ceander, or Kinnord, five miles (8 km) north-east of Ballater, at Loch Goul in the parish of New Machar and elsewhere. <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dun.html" title="Dun">Duns</a> or forts occur on hills at <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunecht.html" title="Dunecht">Dunecht</a>, where the dun encloses an area of two acres (8,000&#160;m²), Barra near Old Meldrum, Tap o' Noth, Dunnideer near <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insch.html" title="Insch">Insch</a> and other places. Monoliths, standing stones and "druidical" circles of the pagan period abound, as do many examples of the sculptured stones of the early <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> epoch.</p>
<p>Efforts to convert the Picts started with <a href="../../../t/e/m/Teman.html" title="Teman">Teman</a> in the 5th century, and continued with <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columba.html" title="Columba">Columba</a> (who founded a monastery at Old Deer), <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drostan.html" title="Drostan">Drostan</a>, Maluog, and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machar.html" title="Machar">Machar</a>, lasting results emerged only slowly. Indeed, dissensions within the Columban church and the expulsion of the clergy from Pictland by the Pictish king <a href="../../../n/e/c/Nectan.html" title="Nectan">Nectan</a> in the 8th century undid most of the progress that missionaries had made. The <a href="../../../v/i/k/Vikings.html" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danes.html" title="Danes">Danes</a> periodically raided the coast, but after <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macbeth.html" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a> ascended the throne of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> in 1040, the <a href="../../../o/r/k/Orkney.html" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> men, under the guidance of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thorfinn_Sigurdsson%2C_Earl_of_Orkney_56cc.html" title="Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney">Thorfinn Sigurdsson</a>, refrained from further trouble in the north-east. <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macbeth.html" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a> was afterwards slain at Lumphanan (1057), a cairn on Perkhill marking the spot.</p>
<p>The influence of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normans.html" title="Normans">Norman</a> conquest of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> made itself felt even in Aberdeenshire. Along with numerous Anglo-Saxon exiles, there also settled in the country <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemings.html" title="Flemings">Flemings</a> who introduced various industries, <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxons.html" title="Saxons">Saxons</a> who brought farming, and Scandinavians who taught nautical skill. The Celts revolted more than once, but <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_III_of_Scotland_c146.html" title="Malcolm III of Scotland">Malcolm Canmore</a> and his successors crushed them and confiscated their lands. In the reign of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_I_of_Scotland_0ee5.html" title="Alexander I of Scotland">Alexander I</a> (ruled 1107 - 1124) mention first appears of <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> (originally called Abordon and, in the Norse sagas, Apardion), which received its charter from <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_I_of_Scotland_5d51.html" title="William I of Scotland">William the Lion</a> in 1179, by which date its burgesses had already combined with those of Banff, Elgin, <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverness.html" title="Inverness">Inverness</a> and other trans-Grampian communities to form a free <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanse.html" title="Hanse">Hanse</a>, under which they enjoyed exceptional trading privileges. By this time, too, the Church had extended its organisation, establishing the bishopric of <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> in 1150.</p>
<p>In the 12th and 13th centuries some of the great Aberdeenshire families arose, including the earl of Mar (c. 1122), the Leslies, Freskins (ancestors of the dukes of Sutherland), Durwards, Bysets, Comyns and Cheynes; significantly, in most cases their founders had immigrated to the district.</p>
<p>The Celtic thanes and their retainers slowly fused with the settlers. They declined to take advantage of the disturbed condition of the country during the wars of the Scots independence, and made common cause with the bulk of the nation.</p>
<p>Though <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Comyn_6075.html" title="John Comyn">John Comyn</a> (d. 1300?), one of the competitors for the throne, had considerable interests in the shire, his claim received locally little support. In 1296 <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_I_of_England_530d.html" title="Edward I of England">Edward I</a> made a triumphal march to the north to terrorise the more turbulent nobles. Next year <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Wallace_7afd.html" title="William Wallace">William Wallace</a> surprised the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> garrison in <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, but failed to capture the castle. In 1303 Edward again visited the county, halting at the Castle of Kildrummy, then in the possession of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_I_of_Scotland_06e8.html" title="Robert I of Scotland">Robert Bruce</a>, who shortly afterwards became the acknowledged leader of the Scots and made <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> his headquarters for several months. Despite the seizure of Kildrummy Castle by the English in 1306, Bruce's prospects brightened from 1308, when he defeated <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earls_of_Buchan_bb8d.html" title="Earls of Buchan">John Comyn</a>, earl of Buchan (died 1313?), at <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverurie.html" title="Inverurie">Inverurie</a>.</p>
<p>For a hundred years after Robert Bruce's death (1329) intermittent anarchy occurred in the shire. The English burned <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> itself in 1336, and the re-settlement of the districts of <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buchan.html" title="Buchan">Buchan</a> and Strathbogie occasioned constant quarrels on the part of the dispossessed. Moreover, the crown had embroiled itself with some of the Highland chieftains, whose independence it sought to abolish. This policy culminated in the invasion of Aberdeenshire by Donald, Lord of the Isles, who, however, suffered defeat at Harlaw, near Inverurie, at the hands of the earl of Mar in 1411.</p>
<p>In the 15th century two further leading county families emerged: Sir Alexander Forbes becoming Lord Forbes about 1442, and Sir Alexander Seton Lord Gordon in 1437 and earl of Huntly in 1445. Bitter feuds raged between these families for a long period, but the Gordons reached the height of their power in the first half of the 16th century, when their domains, already vast, were enhanced by the acquisition, through marriage, of the earldom of Sutherland (1514).</p>
<p>Meanwhile commerce with the Low Countries, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> and the Baltic had grown apace, Campvere (<i>Veere</i> in <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>), near Flushing (<i>Vlissingen</i>) in the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, becoming the emporium of the Scottish traders, while education was fostered by the foundation of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_College%2C_Aberdeen_483b.html" title="King's College, Aberdeen">King's College, Aberdeen</a> in 1497 (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marischal_College_8f9c.html" title="Marischal College">Marischal College</a> followed a century later). At the Reformation so little intuition had the clergy of the drift of opinion that at the very time that religious structures were being despoiled in the south, the building and decoration of churches went on in the shire. Protestantism came in without much tumult, though rioting took place in <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> and St Machar's cathedral in the city suffered damage. The 4th earl of Huntly offered some resistance, on behalf of the Catholics, to the influence of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Stewart%2C_1st_Earl_of_Moray_0331.html" title="James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray">James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray</a>, who was <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regent.html" title="Regent">regent</a> during the reign of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James VI</a>, but was defeated and killed at Corrichie on the hill of Fare in 1562.</p>
<p>As years passed it became apparent that Presbyterianism gained less generally support than Episcopacy, of which system Aberdeenshire remained for generations the stronghold in Scotland.</p>
<p>Another crisis in ecclesiastical affairs arose in 1638, when the authorities ordered subscription to the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solemn_League_and_Covenant_c9ac.html" title="Solemn League and Covenant">National Covenant</a>. Aberdeenshire responded so grudgingly to this demand that <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Graham%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Montrose_052b.html" title="James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose">James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose</a> visited the shire in the following year to enforce acceptance. The Cavaliers, not being disposed to yield, dispersed an armed gathering of Covenanters in the affair called the Trot of Turriff (1639), shedding the first blood of the civil war. The Covenanters obtained the upper hand in a few weeks, when Montrose appeared at the bridge of Dee and compelled the surrender of <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, which had no choice but to cast in its lot with the victors.</p>
<p>Montrose, however, soon changed sides, and after defeating the Covenanters under Lord Balfour of Burleigh (1644), delivered the city to rapine. He worsted the Covenanters again after a stiff fight on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">July 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/4/1645.html" title="1645">1645</a>, at Alford, a village in the beautiful Howe of Alford. Peace was temporarily restored on the "engagement" of the Scots commissioners to assist Charles I.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> welcomed <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> on his return from the Netherlands in 1650, but in little more than a year General <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Monck_32f7.html" title="George Monck">George Monck</a> entered the city at the head of the Cromwellian regiments. The English garrison remained till 1659, but the following year Aberdeenshire effusively hailed the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Restoration_df9a.html" title="English Restoration">Restoration</a>, and prelacy once more went into the ascendant. Most of the Presbyterians conformed, but the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_Society_of_Friends_321e.html" title="Religious Society of Friends">Quakers</a>, more numerous in the shire and the adjoining county of <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kincardine.html" title="Kincardine">Kincardine</a> than anywhere else in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, suffered systematic persecution.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glorious_Revolution_fc02.html" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> (1688) episcopacy passed under a cloud, but the clergy, yielding to <i>force majeure</i>, gradually accepted the inevitable, hoping, as long as <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_I_of_the_United_Kingdom_d84d.html" title="Anne I of the United Kingdom">Queen Anne</a> lived, that prelacy might yet become the national form of Church government. Her death dissipated these dreams, and as <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_I_of_the_United_Kingdom_a9fa.html" title="George I of the United Kingdom">George I</a>, her successor, was antipathetic to the clergy, it happened that <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobitism.html" title="Jacobitism">Jacobitism</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Episcopal_Church_03b9.html" title="Scottish Episcopal Church">episcopalianism</a> came to be regarded in the shire as identical, though in point of fact the non-jurors as a body never countenanced rebellion.</p>
<p>The earl of Mar raised the standard of revolt in Braemar (<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">September 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/1/1715.html" title="1715">1715</a>); a fortnight later <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Francis_Edward_Stuart_a104.html" title="James Francis Edward Stuart">James Francis Edward Stuart</a> was proclaimed at <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> cross; the Pretender landed at Peterhead on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a>, and in February 1716 he was back again in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. The collapse of the first rising ruined many of the lairds, and when the second rebellion occurred thirty years afterwards the county in the main remained apathetic, though the insurgents held <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> for five months, and Lord Lewis Gordon won a trifling victory for Prince <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_Prince_Charlie_d6fd.html" title="Bonnie Prince Charlie">Charles Edward</a> at <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverurie.html" title="Inverurie">Inverurie</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_23.html" title="December 23">December 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/4/1745.html" title="1745">1745</a>). The <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_William_Augustus%2C_Duke_of_Cumberland_2b2d.html" title="Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland">duke of Cumberland</a> relieved <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> at the end of February 1746, and by April the <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_Prince_Charlie_d6fd.html" title="Bonnie Prince Charlie">Young Pretender</a> had become a fugitive.</p>
<p>Thereafter the people devoted themselves to agriculture, industry and commerce, which developed by leaps and bounds, and, along with equally remarkable progress in education, transformed the aspect of the shire and made the community as a whole one of the most prosperous in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>.</p>
