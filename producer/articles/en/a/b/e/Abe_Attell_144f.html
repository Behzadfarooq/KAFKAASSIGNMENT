	    <p><b>Abraham Washington Attell</b> (born <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_22.html" title="February 22">February 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a> in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco, California</a> â€“ died <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_6.html" title="February 6">February 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Paltz_%28village%29%2C_New_York_09ed.html" title="New Paltz (village), New York">New Paltz, New York</a>), better known in the <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxing</a> <a href="../../../w/o/r/World.html" title="World">world</a> as <b>Abe "The Little Hebrew" Attell</b>, was a <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxer</a> who became known for his record-setting period as world Featherweight champion, as well as for his involvement in the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sox_scandal_da87.html" title="Black Sox scandal">Black Sox scandal</a> and other scandals.</p>
<p>Attell was <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a>, but he grew up in an <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_people.html" title="Irish people">Irish</a> neighborhood. Because of that, he often found himself involved in fights, and according to him, he would get involved in as many as 10 bouts each day as a kid. Attell's father abandoned his family when Attell was 13, and Attell had to sell newspapers to support his family. He used to sell them on the streets and corners, and while selling newspapers, he got a chance to witness the fight between Solly Smith and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Dixon_b715.html" title="George Dixon">George Dixon</a> for the world's Featherweight championship. With that, Attell and two of his brothers were convinced that maybe they had a future in boxing.</p>
<p>Attell's first fight was on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_19.html" title="August 19">August 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>, when he knocked out Kid Lennett in two rounds. His mother, who strongly opposed Attell's idea of being a boxer, later became one of Attell's staunchest supporters, even betting on her son to win. He gained the nickname "The Little Hebrew" in these early fights.</p>
<p>Attell won 10 fights in a row by <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knockout.html" title="Knockout">knockout</a> and later moved to <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver%2C_Colorado_0409.html" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a>, where he met Dixon for the world's Featherweight championship in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a>, when Attell was 18. He beat Dixon by a decision in 15 rounds, and became world Featherweight champion. He lost the crown in his second defense, being knocked out in five rounds by Tommy Sullivan. However, he regained the crown from Sullivan by beating him in their rematch by knockout. Attell then went on his streak of 18 defenses in a row (a division record until <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eusebio_Pedroza_def7.html" title="Eusebio Pedroza">Eusebio Pedroza</a> broke it in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>). Attell beat, among others, Battling Nelson and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Kilbane_8352.html" title="Johnny Kilbane">Johnny Kilbane</a> during that streak. His nicknamed changed into the "The Little Champ" during this streak.</p>
<p>During his time as a world champion, Attell was allegedly involved with <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">mafioso</a> <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Rothstein_b415.html" title="Arnold Rothstein">Arnold Rothstein</a>. According to some legends, they became very good friends during this period.</p>
<p>Attell went on to lose his world Featherweight title to Kilbane in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, losing by a 20 round decision, in a fight where Kilbane declared that Attell's handlers put a substance on Attell's glove to make Kilbane blind. According to live witnesses, Attell also tried an assortment of other illegal methods to win the fight.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>, Attell accidentally hit the referee on the face during a win against Willie Beecher. He finally retired in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>.</p>
<p>Attell managed one boxer in his career, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marty_Goldman_27cf.html" title="Marty Goldman">Marty Goldman</a>, to a <a href="http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=011947" class="external text" title="http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=011947" rel="nofollow">33 Win (10 ko's), 11 Loss, 3 Draw record in 47 career fights</a>.</p>
<p>Attell was involved in one of <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sport</a>'s largest scandals of all time, when he was accused in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> of being the messenger between Rothstein and players of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_White_Sox_cecb.html" title="Chicago White Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> organization, during the planning stages of the alleged <a href="../../../m/a/t/Match_fixing.html" title="Match fixing">fix</a> of the <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a>, also known as the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sox_scandal_da87.html" title="Black Sox scandal">Black Sox scandal</a>. Attell's name made it back to the newspaper headlines, and he along with Rothstein and many White Sox players, were formally accused of many charges, including fixing the event. All were eventually found not guilty but banned from participating in baseball activities. Attell subsequently denied being involved in any talks about fixing the series, and he alleged that the wrong Abe Attell was accused.</p>
<p>As a consequence, Attell is, alongside Rothstein, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoeless_Joe_Jackson_4194.html" title="Shoeless Joe Jackson">Shoeless Joe Jackson</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Rose_8e17.html" title="Pete Rose">Pete Rose</a>, one of the few people banned from joining the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum_de36.html" title="Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
<p>He was, however, inducted as a member of various halls of fame for boxers.</p>
<p>Attell had a record of 92 wins, 10 losses, 18 draws and 45 no-decisions, with 51 wins by knockout, making him a member of <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_Magazine_7546.html" title="Ring Magazine">Ring Magazine</a>'s list of fighters with 50 or more knockout wins.</p>
