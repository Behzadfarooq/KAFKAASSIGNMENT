	    <p>On the seconded of September 1993 I was born to Tracey and Geared O’Driscoll I have been living with my mum up till the summer of 2002. All has been going well until year five when I had to move schools to Saint JosephsWandal I was really angry at first but after a couple of months I fit right in. When I started year seven I didn’t really like it because I had the same teacher and the good thing about it I had a lot more responsibilities. About term three we had a substitute teacher named Katrina Philipson she was nice but she had really bad breath (I was like have you ever heard of a Tic Tac)</p>
<p>At the end of the year we went to the water slide in Yeppoon it was very fun on the slid everybody kept on doing trains and we hurt each other on the way down(Evan though that we weren’t supposed to). On the 27th of December 2006 we went down to the Blue Mountains. We drove down to Brisbane on the way down we had to stop a million times because we had the baby and the parents sari and geared had to drive down (which was completely Fair) After a couple of hours we got there and we stayed in this hotel called Ibis which was really nice for a three star. The next day we had a wander around Brisbane which was really nice then we went to the museum over at south bank which was really nice Evan though I was there when I was five (which is another story).</p>
<p>Then we got up at 5:00am on the 29th, so we could catch the train at 6:30am. We were on the train for 14 hrs! By the time we got there it was about 11:00pm so we were all really tired! We spent the day in Sydney. We went to Darling Harbor. Well first we got lost and ended up going some where else we were just about to leave, when we saw Paris Hilton! She was walking towards us and stopped to answer questions from the paparazzi! My brother Ashton was imitating her and Emily was laughing so she gave us the evil eye! After that we went up to Katoomba it was very foggy because of the cold after that we went to an Italian pizza restrant (I had spaghetti carbonara it was really nice).</p>
<p>When we got to the cottage we were staying at we had to go and have showers and after that we had a hot chocolate. And then we went to bed. The next day we had bacon and eggs for breky then after that we sat down and watched forest Gump (Which was a funny movie) After that we went for a walk up the mountain side and I lost my glasses well the Parents didn’t like that .</p>
<p>On the day we left we had to get up about 5.00am so we can get to the airport and after we landed in rocky about 8.35am I met my Grandmother at the airport and than she drove us down to our mum’s place and we stayed there for about a week and than with our grandmother for three days. A couple of months later we went to a family reunion and I met all of my relativities from the Goodwin Family</p>
