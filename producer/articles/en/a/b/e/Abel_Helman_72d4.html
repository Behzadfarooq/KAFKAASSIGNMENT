Abel Helman's tombstone in Ashland Cemetery, Ashland, Oregon</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="../../../1/8/2/1824.html" title="1824">1824</a>, and was of German descent. His father, John Helman, followed farming and in Ohio reared his family of seven children, of whom Abel D. Helman was the fourth in order of birth. His time during his youth was divided between work on the home farm and the acquirement of an education in one of the subscription schools common to that period. The younger generation often heard him relate in interesting manner tales of those early days. The schoolhouse in which he pursued his studies was a little log building with puncheon floor and rude slab benches and he used a quill pen learning to write. He afterwards learned the carpenterâ€™s trade in Wooster, Ohio, and followed that in connection with cabinet-making until he was twenty-six years of age. The news of god discoveries in California reached him from time to time until his desire to secure a fortune upon the Pacific slope was a dominant one in his life and led him to make his way to California. It was in January 1850, that he sailed for Aspinwall as a passenger on the steamer Ohio. He then walked across the isthmus to Panama, where he was forced to wait a month for a vessel to take him to his destination. In April, 1850, however, he arrived at San Francisco, whence he made his way to Beaver Creek and in addition to his work in the mines he followed his trade in Sacramento for some time. In 1851 he made a trip over the mountains to the Willamette valley, driving a mule team from Yreka, California, to Salem, Oregon, and while en route he crossed a part of the tract of land that he afterwards took up as a donation claim and upon which a large portion of Ashland is now built. He returned to California, however, and made his home at Yreka until January, 1852, when he came he came to Jackson county with several others, all of whom secured donation claims, including Mr. Helman, whose land comprised a large part of that upon which the city of Ashland now stands. After making preparations for having a home here he returned to Ohio and brought his wife and children with him to Oregon. Ashland, named after their old home in the Buckeye state, became their permanent place of residence. From that time forward Mr. Helman was closely associated with the upbuilding of the town and the development of his part of the county. Not a furrow had been turned nor an improvement made upon his land when it came into his possession, but with characteristic energy he began its development. The boundaries of his farm extended north and south along what is now First avenue above the Chautauqua grove and west on what is now Nutley street, thence north through the old North school grounds almost to Bear Creek. As the town developed he sold off much of his original tract but at the time of his death was still occupying a portion of the northern part of the claim embracing about ten acres of land.</p>
<p>On taking up his permanent abode here Mr. Helman joined with other settlers in many works of public improvement. He was connected with several others of the earliest settlers in building the first sawmill on the banks of Ashland Creek and also the first flour mill which occupied a site near the center of the city that is now devoted to park purposes. In fact, these business interests constituted the nucleus around which grew up the town of Ashland. The work of development and progress, however, was not accomplished without arduous labor on the part of the early settlers. They were forced to endure many hardships and privations incident to pioneer life and in the early days there was constant danger of Indian attack. Mr. Helman was with those who defended the interests of the pioneer in the Indian war of 1855 and 1856, being stationed at a fort on Wagner Creek. His commission as a first lieutenant of Company A, of the first Regiment, First Brigade, Oregon Militia, dated December 20, 1865, is still in existence and also that indicating his promotion to the captaincy the next year. All through his life Mr. Helman manifested a sense of justice and a fairmindedness that won him the admiration and respect of all. Every phase of pioneer life was familiar to him. He was among those whose efforts replaced the evidences of frontier life by the conditions of the advancing civilization. He became the first postmaster of Ashland and continued in that position for twenty-seven years, or from 1855 until 1882. He was never ambitious to hold office but when duty called him he never hesitated in the performance of a public service.</p>
<p>Mr. Helman was married twice. He first wedded Martha J. Kanagy, their wedding being celebrated in Wooster, Ohio. Unto them were born eight children: Mrs. Almeda L. Shepherd, who is living in California; John K., whose home is in Ashland; Mrs. Mary E. Niles, of Adin, California; Mrs. Martha J. Carter, living in Ashland; Abraham Lincoln, now residing in Idaho; Benjamin Butler, of Ashland; Ulysses Grant, of Petaluma, California; and O. O. Helman, also of Ashland. The wife and mother died many years ago and Mr. Helman afterward wedded Mrs. Sue Rockfellow, who still survives him. Mr. Helman ranked high in Odd Fellow Circles, having a wide acquaintance among the order throughout the state. He was on of the first members of Ashland Lodge, No. 45, I. O. O. F., and for many years served as one of its officers, filling every position in the subordinate lodge. In 1892 he was grand master of the grand lodge of Oregon. He became a member and past patriarch of the Pilot Rock encampment and he was also grand patriarch of the grand encampment of Oregon. For two years he was grand representative from Oregon to the sovereign grand lodge sessions and he was also prominent in the Rebekah organization. He was laid to rest with the honors of the order, having died on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_5.html" title="March 5">5 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>, when he was almost eighty-six years of age. He had remained almost to the last a splendidly preserved man, vigorous and alert both physically and mentally. He was free from ostentation and display but the sterling traits of his character were always manifest in his relations to the individual and the community at large. Wherever known he was highly esteemed and most of all where he was best known, and at his death he left the enviable record of an untarnished name.</p>
