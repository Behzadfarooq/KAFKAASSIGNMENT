<p>I created stubs for the two by-election articles, though I would greatly appreciate it if you could flesh them out a little bit; the Green Party of Manitoba appears to have already held its leadership election in November 2006, so we can safely forget about that one. We might want to start Outremont federal by-election, 2007, though? â€”<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Nightst</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_esperanza_7d46.html" title="User:Nightstallion/esperanza"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">a</span></font></a><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightstallion_a8d9.html" title="User:Nightstallion"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">llion</span></a> <a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightstallion_e2b1.html" title="User talk:Nightstallion"><i>(?)</i></a> 21:51, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>As campaign manager in Canadian, politics, all electronic maps that appear in the Elections Canada and the Elections Ontario site in the public domain. You are an American, and do not know Canadian copyright. This is the fourth inappropriate tagging of an image I've seen you do. Stop and and think before you tag something like this.<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbebenjoe_a6d5.html" title="User:Abebenjoe">Abebenjoe</a> 20:56, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I just got off the phone with Paula at Elections Ontario, there is no prohibition for election boundary maps, as I knew and stated earlier. In case you are unfamiliar with Ontario, or even Canadian intellectual law (I am not a lawyer), works by the government, unless explicitedly stated, have no prohibitions on them with regards to copyright. It is wise to quote the source of the image, like Elections Ontario, but that's it. I know this practically as well, since I do have to publish content from the different election commissions, riding boundary maps, or public results are always in the public domain. Lists of electors, which is confidential obviously cannot be published. As well, paper riding maps have to be bought, but if it exists on the website as a free download, again it is in the public domain. This has always been Elections Ontario and Elections Canada's policies since the Internet has been around.<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbebenjoe_a6d5.html" title="User:Abebenjoe">Abebenjoe</a> 21:21, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I contacted the Provincial Secretary of the NDP, Diane O'Reggio, weeks ago, and she gave the permission. Further, again, you do not understand Canadian Copyright. I will remove your disput tag from her page. As a member of the NDP executive that paid for this photo as well as someone who deals with its rights, I find it ridiculous that you are questioning the copyright on the photo. <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbebenjoe_a6d5.html" title="User:Abebenjoe">Abebenjoe</a> 23:01, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Here's the deal with that Cheri DiNovo photo. If you tag it fair use, I'm going to list it as a <a href="../../../r/e/p/Category%7EReplaceable_fair_use_images_5561.html" title="Category:Replaceable fair use images">replaceable fair-use image</a>.

If you want it kept, you need to provide something in writing from the copyright owner stating that they are irrevocably releasing all rights to the image or specifically releasing it under the terms of a free license such as the GFDL.

<li>Fine. I will not only send you confirmation regarding Cheri, but all Ontario NDP candidates and Members of Provincial Parliament. Usually I am the photographer of note for West-end Toronto NDP candidates, but in Cheri's case I wasn't (I won't go into that here). Which means I could have said I was the author, which under Canadian copyright law would allow me to make it available under GFDL. But, I can tell you as one of the former directors of the Ontario New Democratic party, that the media release is a license to publish it. Unlike the USA, we do not have "Fair Use" of copyrighted material. In Canada, it is called "Fair dealing", and it is a lot more restrictive than the American "fair use" clause, which, b.t.w., is a legal defense used when copyright violations enter into a legal dispute. So, the real question is, how do you want this "written" confirmation, since I can't snail mail it, and I can only either scan a letter or copy an email (in Canada, email has legal written status)? As stated in the copyright notice, all that is needed is attribution that the Ontario NDP is the source. Wikipedia will not have to pay a license fee. Since I am no longer a director of the party, I can no longer grant this on my own, but I do know this is irrevocably true. I'll either have Diane, as Secretary of the Party (General Manager), or Howard Hampton's office (the leader of the party), create the document, and I will then create a new copyright template for ONDP images.<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbebenjoe_a6d5.html" title="User:Abebenjoe">Abebenjoe</a> 06:59, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, I've moved poor Donald Macdonald again as it's not wikipedia style to include postnomial initials in an article title. Also, I suspect that both <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_S._Macdonald_f1d0.html" title="Donald S. Macdonald">Donald S. Macdonald</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_C._Macdonald_ceef.html" title="Donald C. Macdonald">Donald C.

<ul>
<li>Normally I'd agree with you, but at least the other two Donalds have a middle name. Try as I might, I haven't been able to find a middle name, therefore it was more politicially neutral to go with his postnomial initials. At least we don't need to use parenthesis. I also chose postnomimial because there are than a few examples of that on Wikipedia. I suggest we change back to the postnomial title.<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbebenjoe_a6d5.html" title="User:Abebenjoe">Abebenjoe</a> 19:39, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Actually, now that I've revisited the title, '(Nova Scotia)" is fine. I thought you reverted it to (Nova Scotia politician)". I hope this is the last move. Now if we could only determine if he actually ever had a middle name, we'd be all set. Of course, with our luck, it would be "C." or "S.".<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbebenjoe_a6d5.html" title="User:Abebenjoe">Abebenjoe</a> 19:48, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just so you know, protecting a page isn't just a matter of adding the template to the top of the article; the article also has to be manually locked by an administrator. I've now done that (and I knew as soon as the article got unprotected in the first place that the vandal was <i>eventually</i> going to come back), but I just wanted to let you know that normally you should discuss page protection with an administrator (me, <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">User:CJCurrie</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">User:Bucketsofg</a>, etc.) or post the request at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_page_protection_b2ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for page protection">Wikipedia:Requests for page protection</a>, since part of the process can <i>only</i> be done by an admin. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:16, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks, I didn't realize it was an admin function. Didn't know the process for page protection requests either. Now that it is protected, i suggest keep it that way until at least the end of October 2007. I'll likely be adding more material to this article in the next few weeks.

<p>Hi, regarding your adding of the cc-by license to this image. How did you came to this conclusion? There is no mention of that in the site where it came from and in the image description. In the removal of the replace tag on the article you stated that it was PD. It can't be both. This image is a promotional image, you could probably assume from the fact that it was for media purposes that the image can be redistributed but not the other options which the cc-by license gives. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarion96_c83d.html" title="User:Garion96">Garion96</a> <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarion96_d01f.html" title="User talk:Garion96">(talk)</a> 02:50, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi there. This was decided more than three weeks ago. I obtained permission from Diane O'Reggio, to use this picture. Unless you want Howard Hampton himself to give you permission, I think that should be sufficient. You are now the third person, that has tried to edit this. Proper permissions were sought and granted. <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbebenjoe_a6d5.html" title="User:Abebenjoe">Abebenjoe</a> 02:57, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If there is permissions to release it under the cc-by license, could you please add the e-mail to the image talk and send a copy of the e-mail to permissions-en(at)wikimedia(dot)org. Or any other license. As long as the license allows the image to be freely redistributed, modified, used commercially and for any other purpose.

<p>If you have or can get Diane's permission in <i>writing</i>, it wouldn't hurt to post the text of it to the image's talk page. I'll keep an eye on the situation in the meantime. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:54, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah. I've got Paul Ferreira doing that now for all the MPPs. I'll see if she will email me the permission. I know that they will allow it, and wouldn't even think of suing. I'm not sure whether the current person is an American, but I get the distinct impression, these people that go after copyright, do not understand copyright law, especially in Canada. I'm not a lawyer, but I've worked in the film and television industry as a producer, director and editor, and I am fairly conversent with the Federal Copyright Act. One of the biggest questions asked is, if copyright is questionable, what's the likelihood of legal action. With the NDP, using one of their campaign photos of a candidate, would not get anyone in trouble legally. Also, I think the people that have been trying to delete this image are using American copyright legislation, not Canadian. It is my understanding of the Canadian Act that if you publish press releases, and pictures from the, they are fair game. At most, attribution is required, and usually that is not required. Anyway, I'll try to light a fire under Cecil St. and get them to send me a formal blanket copyright permission for living, dead and current ONDP/CCF candidates and MPPs.

<p>Thank you for your work on the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Ferreira_035a.html" title="Paul Ferreira">Paul Ferreira</a> article. It might be worthwhile to create articles about him in the French and Portuguese Wikipedias as well.

<li>How do I help? Is there an assessment grid of some sort? I know the difference between a Stub and Start article, but the difference between a Start and a B article seems to be a fine point. I just want to be clear, because I don't want to begin upsetting people by giving them unduly low scores.<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbebenjoe_a6d5.html" title="User:Abebenjoe">Abebenjoe</a> 20:47, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hey! Thanks for responding! A <b>Stub</b> rating is an article that is at its most basic, like <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yani_Gellman_c25c.html" title="Yani Gellman">Yani Gellman</a>. It is basic information, not a whole lot. You would not walk away <i>really</i> understanding the subject of the article too completely. A <b>Start</b> rating is an article that usually has at <i>least</i> an infobox and/or a picture of the subject. The article is usually broken up into sections (or if you are kind, break it into the appropriate sections) and contains a decent, succinct amount of information on the life of the subject (look at <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_McKie_6032.html" title="Aaron McKie">Aaron McKie</a>, contains no photo, but has an infobox and article is broken into sections). Most articles in the unassessed category are of the <b>Stub</b> rating and will need future editing. While going through and tagging articles with the right assessment, if there are any articles you come across that you find interesting I would bookmark them so you can help develop them later on. If you have any more questions, just let me know! --<a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgod_66f8.html" title="User:Ozgod">Ozgod</a> 07:16, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
