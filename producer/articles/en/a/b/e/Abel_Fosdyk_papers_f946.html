<p>The <b>Abel Fosdyk papers</b> is one of many theories as to the fate of the <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_ship.html" title="Ghost ship">ghost ship</a> the <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Celeste_388b.html" title="Mary Celeste">Mary Celeste</a></i>.</p>
<p>More than 40 years after the <i>Mary Celeste</i> was found, papers and documents belonging to a deceased, well educated man named Abel Fosdyk indicated that he had been a secret passenger on the ship. The papers were found by Howard Linford, a friend of Fosdyk, after Fosdyk's death and were published in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a> in the <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Strand_Magazine_65ef.html" title="Strand Magazine">Strand Magazine</a></i>.</p>
<p>Fosdyk's writings indicated that he had to leave the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> quickly due to some misfortunes, and being a friend to Captain Briggs, he convinced the captain to allow him onboard. While at sea, Captain Briggs had a carpenter build a high special deck for his young daughter and wife, one that would allow them an ample view while at sea. By his writing, the location of the special deck would have coincided with the spot where those who found the <i>Mary Celeste</i> noticed odd slits in her permanent deck.</p>
<p>Fosdyk's writings go on to tell an odd story of a fluke, accidental deaths, and misfortune. According to the writings, set down in the manner of a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diary.html" title="Diary">diary</a>, one day Captain Briggs engaged in a lighthearted dispute with a crew member about how well a man could swim with his clothes on. Captain Briggs suddenly jumped overboard, and jokingly began swimming around to prove his point. The crew were laughing and several others from the 7 member crew jumped into the waters with him while Captain Brigg's wife and child, Fosdyk, and a couple more members of the crew stepped up onto the specially built deck for a better view of the fun.</p>
<p>Suddenly, one swimming crew member screamed in agony. Looking around, they saw that he was being attacked by a shark, and he quickly disappeared under the water. The remaining members of the crew also ran up onto the specially built deck to better see what was happening, and it promptly collapsed tossing them all into the sea and leaving no one onboard the <i>Mary Celeste</i>.</p>
<p>What followed, by Fosdyk's account, was a splashing confusion, with sharks attacking all those in the water, with the exception of Fosdyk, who by accident had landed atop of the shattered piece of deck. The <i>Mary Celeste</i> floated away from their location and by the time the shark attack was over, Fosdyk was the only survivor, and he was unable to reach the ship. He floated for several days, starving for water and suffering from exposure, finally washing ashore on the coast of <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>. Fearful of retribution due to the outlandish details of his story, he never revealed the incident to anyone. It only came to light after his death because Linford went public with it.</p>
<p>Although possible, there is no way to verify any of Fosdyk's claims. If indeed it was he who wrote them, it would be easy and convenient for someone to claim to have been a <i>secret passenger</i>, if for no other reason than to explain why no ships records would have indicated his presence. Also, although possible that the entire crew could have been so misfortunate as to allow them all to leave and/or fall from the ship, it is not probable. The crew were mostly seasoned men, many of whom had served in the navy or on board ships for most of their lives. Fosdyk indicates that the <i>Mary Celeste</i> was a ship of 600 tons, when in fact it was less than a third of that. His writings also indicate that the crew were <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English</a>, when in fact they were mostly <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_people.html" title="German people">German</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_people.html" title="American people">American</a>, a detail that would most likely not have been overlooked, seeing that he would have had a daily interaction with the entire crew, since there were only 7 crew members.</p>
<p>Fosdyk was not making any claims to achieve fame or fortune, and in fact never revealed anything to anyone about the incident prior to his death. It's left unknown as to what actually happened to the <i>Mary Celeste</i>.</p>
