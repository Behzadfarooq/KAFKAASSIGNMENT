<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/w/Abwehr.html" title="Edit section: The Abwehr before Canaris">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Abwehr before Canaris</span></h2>
<p>The Abwehr was created in 1921 as part of the Ministry of Defence when Germany was allowed to form the <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichswehr.html" title="Reichswehr">Reichswehr</a>, the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armed_Forces_ec0c.html" title="Armed Forces">military organization</a> of the <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weimar_Republic_9fad.html" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a>. The first head was Major Friedrich Gempp, a former deputy to Col. Walther Nicolai, the head of German intelligence during World War I. At that time it was composed of only three officers and seven former officers plus a clerical staff. By the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> it was organized into three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>I. <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconnaissance.html" title="Reconnaissance">Reconnaissance</a></li>
<li>II. <a href="../../../c/i/p/Cipher.html" title="Cipher">Cipher</a> and Radio Monitoring</li>
<li>III. Counterespionage</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichsmarine.html" title="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a> intelligence staff merged with the Abwehr in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, with the rise of the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> movement, the Ministry of Defence was reorganized; surprisingly, on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_7.html" title="June 7">June 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, a naval officer, Capt. Konrad Patzig, was named chief of the Abwehr, despite the fact that it was staffed largely by Army officers. But perhaps not surprisingly, due to the small size of the organization and its limited importance at that time, it was unsuitable for a more ambitious Army officer. Another possible factor was that naval officers had more foreign experience than their Army counterparts and understood more of foreign affairs. However, all three services eventually developed their own intelligence staff.</p>
<p>Because of Abwehr-sponsored reconnaissance flights across the border with <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, Patzig soon had confrontations with <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_Himmler_4919.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, head of the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schutzstaffel.html" title="Schutzstaffel">SS</a>. Army leaders feared that the flights would endanger the secret plans for an attack on Poland. Patzig was fired in January <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a> as a result, and was sent to command the new <a href="../../../p/o/c/Pocket_battleship.html" title="Pocket battleship">pocket battleship</a> <i><a href="../../../g/e/r/German_pocket_battleship_Admiral_Graf_Spee_0478.html" title="German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee">Admiral Graf Spee</a></i>; he later became Chief of Naval Personnel. His replacement was another Reichsmarine captain, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_Canaris_328a.html" title="Wilhelm Canaris">Wilhelm Canaris</a>.</p>

<p>Before he took over the Abwehr on 1 January, 1935, the soon-to-be Admiral Canaris was warned by Patzig of attempts by Himmler and <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reinhard_Heydrich_f2f0.html" title="Reinhard Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a> to take over all German intelligence organs. Canaris, a master of backroom dealings which were so much a part of life, thought he knew how to deal with them. But even while he tried to maintain an at-least cordial relationship with them, the antagonism between the Abwehr and the SS did not stop with Canaris at the helm.</p>
<p>It came to a head in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> when <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> decided to help <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josef_Stalin_83d9.html" title="Josef Stalin">Josef Stalin</a> in the latter's purge against the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Army_ccba.html" title="Red Army">Soviet military</a>. Hitler ordered that the German Army staff should be kept in the dark about Stalin's intentions, for fear that they would warn their Soviet counterparts. Accordingly, special SS teams, accompanied by burglary experts from the criminal police, broke into the secret files of the General Staff and the Abwehr and removed documents related to German-Soviet collaboration. To conceal the thefts, fires were started at the break-ins, which included Abwehr headquarters.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/w/Abwehr.html" title="Edit section: 1938 reorganisation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1938 reorganisation</span></h3>
<p>Canaris reorganized the agency in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, with the Abwehr being subdivided into three main sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Central Division</b>, (also called Department Z - <i>"Abteilung Z"</i> or <i>"die Zentrale"</i> in German), acted as the controlling brain for the other two sections, as well as handling personnel and financial matters, including the payment of agents. Throughout Canaris's tenure it was headed by Generalmajor <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Oster_c14d.html" title="Hans Oster">Hans Oster</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The Foreign Branch</b>, (<i>"Amtsgruppe Ausland"</i> in German) (later known as <b>Foreign Intelligence Group</b>) was the second subdivision of the Abwehr and had several functions:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>liaison with the OKW and the general staffs of the services,</li>
<li>coordination with the German Foreign Ministry on military matters, and</li>
<li>evaluation of captured documents and evaluation of foreign press and radio broadcasts. This liaison with the OKW meant that the Foreign Branch was the appropriate channel to request Abwehr support for a particular mission.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Abwehr I. II. &amp; III.</b> constituted the third division and was labeled "counter-intelligence branches" but in reality focused on intelligence gathering. It was subdivided into the following areas and responsibilities:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>I.</b> Foreign Intelligence Collection (further subdivided by letter eg. I-Ht)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>G - false documents, photos, inks, passports, chemicals</dd>
<dd>H West - army west (Anglo-American Army intelligence)</dd>
<dd>H Ost - army east (Soviet Army intelligence)</dd>
<dd>Ht - technical army intelligence</dd>
<dd>i - communications- design of wireless sets, wireless operators</dd>
<dd>L - air intelligence</dd>
<dd>M - naval intelligence</dd>
<dd>T/lw - technical air intelligence</dd>
<dd>Wi - economic intelligence</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Attached to Abwehr I. was Gruppe I-T for technical intelligence.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>II.</b> <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabotage.html" title="Sabotage">Sabotage</a> - tasked with directing covert contact / exploitation of discontented minority groups in foreign countries for intelligence purposes.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Attached to Abwehr II. was <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandenburgers.html" title="Brandenburgers">Brandenburg Regiment</a>, an offshoot of Gruppe II-T (Technical Intelligence), and unconnected to any other branch outside of Abwehr II. Gruppe II-T.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>III.</b> <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-intelligence.html" title="Counter-intelligence">Counter-intelligence</a> division- responsible for counter-intelligence operations in German industry, planting false information, penetration of foreign intelligence services and investigating acts of sabotage on German soil. Attached to Abwehr III. were:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>IIIC - Civilian Authority bureau</dd>
<dd>IIIC-2 - Espionage cases bureau</dd>
<dd>IIID - Disinformation bureau</dd>
<dd>IIIF - Counter espionage agents bureau</dd>
<dd>IIIN - Postal bureau</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Abwehr liaisons were also established with the Army, Navy and Luftwaffe High Commands, and these liaisons would pass on specific intelligence requests to the operational sections of the Abwehr.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/w/Abwehr.html" title="Edit section: Ast / Abwehrstelle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ast / Abwehrstelle</span></h3>
<p>Under the structure outlined above, Abwehr placed a local station in each military district in Germany, (<i>"Wehrkreis"</i>), called '<b>Abwehrstelle'</b> or '<b>Ast'</b>. Following the German Table of Organisation and Equipment<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> model of Abwehr headquarters, each Ast was usually subdivided into sections for</p>
<dl>
<dd>espionage ( I ),</dd>
<dd>sabotage ( II ), and</dd>
<dd>counter-intelligence ( III ).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Typically each Ast would be commanded by a senior Army or Naval officer and would be answerable to Abwehr HQ. in Berlin. Operations carried out by each Ast would be in tandem with the overall strategic plan formulated by Admiral Canaris. Canaris in turn would receive instructions on what intelligence gathering should take priority from the OKW or, increasingly after 1941, the <a href="../../../f/%C3%BC/h/F%C3%BChrer.html" title="Führer">Führer</a> <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, directly. In practise however, each Ast was given considerable latitude in mission planning &amp; execution- a facet of the organisation which ultimately damaged its intelligence gathering capability.</p>
<p>Each local Ast could recruit potential agents for missions and the Abwehr also employed freelance recruiters to groom and vet potential agents. In most cases, the agents who formed the Abwehr were recruited civilians, not officers/soldiers from the military. The recruitment emphasis seems to have been very much on <i>quantity</i> not <i>quality</i>. The poor quality of recruits often lead to the failure of Abwehr missions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Abwehr I was commanded by Colonel Hans Pieckenbrock. Abwehr II was commanded by Colonel Erwin von Lahousen and Abwehr III was commanded by Colonel Egbert Bentivegni.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/w/Abwehr.html" title="Edit section: Abwehr operational structure in Neutral countries">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Abwehr operational structure in Neutral countries</span></h3>
<p>In neutral countries the Abwehr frequently disguised its organisation by attaching its personnel to the German Embassy or to trade missions. Such postings were referred to as "War Organisations" (<i>"Kriegsorganisationen"</i> or <i>"KO's"</i> in German). In neutral but friendly <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> for example, the Abwehr had both an Ast <i>and</i> a KO, whilst <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> had neither. In friendly countries of interest, occupied countries, or in Germany itself, the intelligence service would normally organise "Abwehr sub-stations" (<i>"Abwehrleitstellen"</i> in German or <i>"Alsts"</i> in German), or "Abwehr adjoining posts" (<i>"Abwehrnebenstellen"' in German' ). The</i> "Alsts" <i>would fall under the jurisdiction of the geographically appropriate Ast, which in turn would be supervised by the Central division in Berlin.</i></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/w/Abwehr.html" title="Edit section: Canaris and Die Schwarze Kapelle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Canaris and Die Schwarze Kapelle</span></h3>
<p>During his reorganisaton, Canaris took care to surround himself with a hand-picked staff, notably his second-in-command, Hans Oster and <a href="../../../e/r/w/Erwin_Lahousen_d7ff.html" title="Erwin Lahousen">Erwin von Lahousen</a>, Section II Chief. All but one were not members of the Nazi party. The exception was Rudolf Bamler, who was appointed as chief of Section III by Canaris to gain the trust of Himmler. Canaris did make sure to keep Bamler on a short leash however, and restricted his access to operational information. Canaris had good reason to do this because unknown to the High Command and Hitler, during his reorganisation Canaris had peppered the chief operational and administrative staff of the Abwehr with men more loyal to him than to the Nazi Government. While outwardly Canaris appeared to be the model of intelligence-gathering efficiency, evidence exists that he secretly opposed, and actively worked against the wishes of his Commander in Chief. Canaris, Oster and the Chiefs of Abwehr sections I.,II., and III. were all heavily involved in what the Security Police <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicherheitsdienst.html" title="Sicherheitsdienst">Sicherheitsdienst</a> were to later dub "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Orchestra_9b23.html" title="Black Orchestra">The Black Orchestra</a>" (<i>"Die Schwarze Kapelle"</i> in German), a plot to overthrow the Nazi regime from the inside.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> Canaris's operational decisions, his choice of appointments and their decisions, and crucially for the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Reich_a799.html" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a>- the input each plotter had into Abwehr operations, are all tainted by these secret dealings.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/w/Abwehr.html" title="Edit section: The Abwehr During World War II">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Abwehr During World War II</span></h3>
<p>Under Canaris the Abwehr expanded and proved relatively efficient during the early years of the war. Its most notable success was <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Nordpol_3573.html" title="Operation Nordpol">Operation Nordpol</a>, which was an operation against the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> underground network, which at the time was supported by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Operations_Executive_8413.html" title="Special Operations Executive">Special Operations Executive</a>. In March <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, the Germans forced a captured SOE radio operator to transmit messages to Britain in a code that the Germans had obtained. Even though the operator gave every indication that he was compromised, the receiver in Britain did not notice this. Thus the Germans had been able to penetrate the Dutch operation and maintained this state of affairs for two years, capturing agents that were sent and sending false intelligence and <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabotage.html" title="Sabotage">sabotage</a> reports until the British caught on.</p>
<p>But it was ineffective overall for several reasons. Much of its intelligence was deemed politically unacceptable to the German leadership. Moreover, it was in direct competition/conflict with SS intelligence activities under Reinhard Heydrich and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Schellenberg_dd92.html" title="Walter Schellenberg">Walter Schellenberg</a>. The animosity between the SS and Abwehr did not stop there. Many of the Abwehr's operatives — including Canaris himself — were in fact anti-Nazi and were involved in many assassination attempts against Hitler, including the most serious one on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_20_Plot_efc3.html" title="July 20 Plot">July 20, 1944</a>. Canaris even employed <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> in the Abwehr and used the agency to help a small number of Jews to escape from Germany into <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. But perhaps the biggest reason was that Canaris himself sought to undermine the Nazi cause.</p>
<p>Despite the Abwehr's many intelligence coups, its effectiveness was more than negated by agents who — with Canaris's blessing — aided the Allies in whatever covert means were necessary. He personally gave false information which discouraged Hitler from invading <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>.

He even provided intelligence to the Allies on German intentions as well.</p>
<p>The SS continually undermined the Abwehr by putting several Abwehr officers under investigation, believing them (correctly) to be involved in anti-Hitler plots. The SS also accused Canaris of being defeatist in his intelligence assessments, especially on the Russian campaign. One such briefing reportedly resulting in Hitler seizing Canaris by the lapels, and demanding to know whether the intelligence chief was insinuating that Germany would lose the war.</p>

<p>The incident which eventually resulted in the dissolution of the Abwehr came to be known as the "<a href="../../../f/r/a/Frau_Solf_Tea_Party_344f.html" title="Frau Solf Tea Party">Frau Solf Tea Party</a>", which took place on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_10.html" title="September 10">September 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>.</p>
<p>Frau Johanna (or Hanna) Solf, the widow of Dr. <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_Solf_4b6a.html" title="Wilhelm Solf">Wilhelm Solf</a>, a former Colonial Minister under <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaiser_Wilhelm_II_17eb.html" title="Kaiser Wilhelm II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> and ex-<a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambassador.html" title="Ambassador">Ambassador</a> to <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, had long been involved in the anti-Nazi intellectual movement in Berlin. At a tea party hosted by her, a new member was included in the circle, an attractive young Swiss doctor named Reckse. It turned out that Dr. Reckse was an agent of the <a href="../../../g/e/s/Gestapo.html" title="Gestapo">Gestapo</a>, to which he reported on the tea party and turned over several incriminating documents.</p>
<p>The Solf circle was tipped off and had to flee for their lives, but they were all rounded up on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_12.html" title="January 12">January 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>. Eventually everyone who was involved in the Solf Circle except Frau Solf and her daughter, the Countess Lagi Gräfin von Ballestrem, were executed.</p>
<p>One of those executed was Otto Kiep, an official in the Foreign Office, who had friends in the Abwehr, among whom were <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Vermehren_39ad.html" title="Erich Vermehren">Erich Vermehren</a> and his wife, the former Countess Elizabeth von Plettenberg, who were stationed as agents in <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. Both were summoned to Berlin by the Gestapo in connection with the Kiep case. Fearing for their lives, they contacted the British and defected.</p>
<p>It was mistakenly believed in Berlin that the Vermehrens absconded with the Abwehr's secret codes and turned them over to the British. That proved to be the last straw for Hitler. Despite the efforts of the Abwehr to shift the blame to the SS or even to the Foreign Ministry, Hitler had had enough of Canaris and he told <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_Himmler_4919.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Himmler</a> so twice. He summoned the chief of the Abwehr for a final interview and accused him of allowing the Abwehr to "fall into bits". Canaris quietly agreed that it was "not surprising", as Germany was already losing the war.</p>
<p>Hitler fired Canaris on the spot, and on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_18.html" title="February 18">February 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, Hitler signed a decree that abolished the Abwehr. Its functions were taken over by the <a href="../../../r/s/h/RSHA_366a.html" title="RSHA">RSHA</a>. This action deprived the armed forces (and the anti-Nazi conspirators) of an intelligence service of its own and strengthened Himmler's control over the generals.</p>
<p>Canaris, by this time a <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_admiral.html" title="Vice admiral">vice admiral</a>, was cashiered and given the empty position of chief of the Office of Commercial and Economic Warfare. He was arrested on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_23.html" title="July 23">July 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> in the aftermath of the <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_20_Plot_efc3.html" title="July 20 Plot">July 20 Plot</a> against Hitler and executed shortly before the end of the war, along with Oster his deputy. The functions of the Abwehr were then totally absorbed by the <i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicherheitsdienst.html" title="Sicherheitsdienst">Sicherheitsdienst</a></i>, a sub-office of the <i><a href="../../../s/c/h/Schutzstaffel.html" title="Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a></i> (SS) security command, the <a href="../../../r/s/h/RSHA_366a.html" title="RSHA">RSHA</a>.</p>
