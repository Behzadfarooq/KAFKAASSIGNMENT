<p>The term <b>Abjection</b> literally means "the state of being cast off." The concept of abject exists in between the concept of an object and the concept of the subject, something alive yet not. In contemporary <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critical_theory.html" title="Critical theory">critical theory</a>, it is often used to describe the state of often-marginalized groups, such as <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women.html" title="Women">women</a> or <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexuals</a>. This term originated in the works of <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julia_Kristeva_ac20.html" title="Julia Kristeva">Julia Kristeva</a>. Often, the term <b>space of abjection</b> is also used, referring to a space that abjected things or beings inhabit.</p>
<p>Following Kristeva's formulation of abjection in <i>Powers of Horror - An Essay on Abjection,</i> abjection can be seen as letting go of something we would still like to keep. In the case of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood.html" title="Blood">blood</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semen.html" title="Semen">semen</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair.html" title="Hair">hair</a> and <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excrement.html" title="Excrement">excrement</a>/<a href="../../../u/r/i/Urine.html" title="Urine">urine</a>, we recognize these as once being a part of ourselves, thus these forms of the abject are taken out of our system while bits of them remain in our selves. When one encounters blood, excrement, etc. outside of the body, one is forced to confront what was once a part of oneself, but no longer is. Dismemberment compels the same kind of heightened reaction when one confronts the horror of detachment. A dismembered finger or limb is identified as belonging to one's own body and is 'missed' while at the same time repulsive to the viewer for no longer being a part of the whole. Because humans frequently shed skin and blood etc. there is a higher tolerance to it and we are not as horrified as we would be in the case of dismemberment, yet most are not willing to engage with excrement or blood due to its detached nature. In a way, we exist in abjection: the process of creating our self (identity) is never-ending. The act of "selfing" ("identifying") ourselves is the only common feature of all people.</p>
<p>According to Kristeva, since the abject is situated outside the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbolic_order.html" title="Symbolic order">symbolic order</a>, being forced to face it is an inherently traumatic experience. For example, upon being faced with a corpse, a person would be most likely repulsed because he or she is forced to face an object which is violently cast out of the cultural world, having once been a subject. We encounter other beings daily, and more often than not they are alive. To confront a corpse of one that we recognize as human, something that <i>should</i> be alive but isn't, is to confront the reality that we are capable of existing in the same state, our own mortality. This repulsion from death, excrement and rot constitutes the subject as a living being in the symbolic order.</p>
<p>This act is done in the light of the parts of ourselves that we exclude: un-namely â€“ the mother. We must abject the maternal, the object which has created us, in order to construct an identity. This is done on the micro level of the speaking being, through her subjective dynamics, as well as on the macro level of society, through "language as a common and universal law." We use rituals, specifically those of defilement, in order to maintain clear boundaries between nature and society, the semiotic and the symbolic. This line of thought begins with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Douglas_1e1c.html" title="Mary Douglas">Mary Douglas</a>' seminal book, <i>Purity and Danger</i>.</p>
<p>The concept of abject is often coupled (and sometimes confused with) the idea of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Uncanny_%28Freud%29_d56c.html" title="The Uncanny (Freud)">the uncanny</a>, the concept of something being "un-home-like", or foreign, yet familiar. The abject can be uncanny in the sense that we can recognize aspects in it, despite its being "foreign". An example, continuing on the one used above, is that of a corpse, namely the corpse of a loved one. We will recognize that person as being close to us, but the fact that the person dead, and "no longer" the familiar loved one, is what creates a sort of <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_dissonance.html" title="Cognitive dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>, leading to abjection of the corpse.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/j/Abjection.html" title="Edit section: The abject in fiction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The abject in fiction</span></h2>
<p>According to Barbera Creed's <i>Horror and the Monstrous Feminine</i> a male's relationship with the mother and other females is complicated by his use in <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horror_fiction.html" title="Horror fiction">horror</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> as we are forced to confront the feminine as horrific and abject. Through an analysis of the film <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_%28film%29.html" title="Alien (film)">Alien</a> (1979) and the female roles and representations, Creed explains how females are often related to the object of horror, be they as the object of horror or the object of the actual horrors desire/hatred. The conclusion is that through monstrous representations of the female or the Mother, the audience is drawn into viewing them as abject rather than subject or object. The aliens themselves from the film in question are often described as having <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phallus.html" title="Phallus">phallus</a>-like appendages in the shape of their head and tongue, while maintaining an almost female form. Their interaction with the human crew takes on very abject roles as one crew member, a male, is forcibly impregnated (clearly as a product of rape) with an alien that eventually rips itself from the male 'womb' in a horrific scene of blood and gore. The process of a male being impregnated through the mouth, gestating in a being that has no womb and ripping itself free in a shower of blood is one way in which this film abjectifies female roles.</p>
<p>Abjection is also a major theme of the 1949 work <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thief%27s_Journal_0698.html" title="The Thief's Journal">The Thief's Journal</a> (Journal du Voleur) by French author <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Genet_ee64.html" title="Jean Genet">Jean Genet</a>. As a criminal outcast from society, during a fictionalised account of his wanderings through Europe in the 1930s, he claims to actively seek abjections as an <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existentialist.html" title="Existentialist">existentialist</a> form of 'sainthood.'</p>
