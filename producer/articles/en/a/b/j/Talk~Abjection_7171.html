<p>This essay is awful. The terms are undefined, it's a narrative, there's no examples, and it its dense and confusing.</p>
<p>The term is first defined as rejection... isn't there an aspect of horror to it though? "Abject poverty"? How can the abject be "taken out of our system while bits of it remain in our selves": that's a contradiction, and implies a second-party actor as well. "The act of "selfing" ("identitying") ourselves is the only common feature of all people" - that's not true! All people have brains, too. And spinal columns. And a cardiovascular system. And, if we exclude the severely brain-damaged, things like thoughts and feelings and emotions are pretty universal too.</p>
<p>There clearly needs to be more than one source used, because either Kristeva is being sorely misrepresented... or Kristeva is full of crap. We feel horror at the sight of a dead body because it's "outside the symbolic order"? Really? I thought it was because it confronts us with our own mortality, and because it violates our mental habit of looking for signs of life in our fellow humans - a corpse is "wrong" because we are genetically predisposed to prefer the living over the dead. Further, we are (perhaps instinctively) wary of dead bodies as being possible sources of infection or disease.</p>
<p>"This act is done in the light of the parts of ourselves that we exclude: un-namely – the mother." What the hell? Total non-sequitor, nevermind that "un-namely" isn't a word. This entire paragraph is again asserting as factual, what is (at best) a tenuous hypothesis about the development of human children's psyche.</p>
<p>Sorry about the rant. I hope I'm not the only one who finds this entire entry worse than useless. --<a href="../../../l/e/p/User%7ELeperflesh_e32b.html" title="User:Leperflesh">Leperflesh</a> 06:28, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The concept of abjection is a contradictin of terms by definition. I'll do what I can to 'fix up' the article, but you're dissagreeing with points that you then later agree with. I do not see a problem with most of the points you disgree with, you simply do not understand the defintions I suppose. I'll do what I can to bring it down to an intelligible level I guess. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaddius_2203.html" title="User:Thaddius">Thaddius</a> 14:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can't objects be abject? Like blood or sperm? People don't want to see abject things because they belong ín the body and not outside? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 89.98.75.222 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_89.98.75.222_d70c.html" title="Special:Contributions/89.98.75.222">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I've just added this to the article, but abject can be in between the object and the subject, the idea that something is alive, yet not. Blood, sperm, excrement, all these things were a part of you or someone else at one time and they have moved from the living world to some kind of congnitive purgatory where their state of being hasn't been rationalized yet, not reaching the concept of object yet. Loose hair is another example, some people refuse to touch hair that is clogging a drain in a shower or a sink out of abjection. As you said, people are much more comfortable with hair, excrement, sperm, and blood when they are in/on the body in the way that 'should' be. There are some who have a sort of <a href="../../../s/e/p/Seperation_anxiety.html" title="Seperation anxiety">seperation anxiety</a> about losing these things too out of fear of abjection. Such is the case of the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_retentive.html" title="Anal retentive">anal retentive</a>, afraid to let go of their excrement; those who faint at the sight of blood; even cases of people who injest (out of compulsion) their hair/skin/etc. as it falls from their body. The article mentions women and homosexuals as being abject, and while this is true that they can be treated as such, it is rather confusing to mention the object\subject\abject relation so early on. On that matter, I must admit, I do not know much, so I'll leave it be, but I hope what I've mentioned helps a little. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaddius_2203.html" title="User:Thaddius">Thaddius</a> 07:33, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While Huxley doesn't define the term <i>abjection,</i> he uses the word <i>abject</i> gratuitously in his masterpiece <i>Brave New World</i> and the subsequent essays of <i>Brave New World Revisited.</i> When I return to school in January, I can find references if this would help.</p>
<p>I think it's faulty to attribute this word to Kristeva as if she invented its philosophical meaning in some quasi-Hegelian sense. A clarification of this would be nice, and maybe even structuring articles such that the pre-Kristeva usages of <i>abject</i> in literature do not look like they were influenced by her. --<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedpennings_c616.html" title="User:Tedpennings">Tedpennings</a> 19:38, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The word abject means existing in a low or downcast state, Kristeva (if she was indeed the one to come up with the idea) just took the word for this idea. Maybe a link to its Wikitionary page?--Absurdity 03:19, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
