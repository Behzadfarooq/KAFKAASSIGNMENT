<p>The article has "<i>Given the size of the precinct in question, it would be unlikely for the officers on duty not to have heard the assault or witnessed Volpe's pride in his actions</i>". This seems to indicate that they later said they heard nothing, so that someone must be lying, Louima or the other officers. But the article does not mention their statement. This must be resolved, either by mentioning their statement, or by removing the sentence about the size of the precinct. <a href="../../../p/h/s/User%7EPhS_8126.html" title="User:PhS">PhS</a> 13:29, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The wording of this article as of 9 September 2006 reads as biased. All actions taken by Volpe and the other accused officers are referred to as "alleged," which is properly appropriate to cases where charges have been filed but no ruling has been handed down; in this instance the accused officers were either found guilty in trial or pleaded guilty and allocuted the details of their crimes. Neither Volpe nor his co-defendants chose to plead under the Alford doctrine, which further diminishes the likelihood of the legal finding of guilt not reflecting true culpability. Moreover, the reference to Sean Hannity's statements and actions is not rebutted in the article with consideration of whether injuries of the severity Louima was treated for could have been caused by consensual sexual activity, "rough" or otherwise (though a reasonable person, per the legal standard, might infer that multiple surgeries would be unlikely to be needed following consensual sex). Finally, the omission, from an article whose subject is Abner Louima and which focusses on his police-brutality complaints against Volpe and the NYPD, of the circumstances of Louima's arrest -- that a police officer had been assaulted, that other NYPD officers were angry about that assault, that Louima was mistaken for a suspect in that assault, and that he was later found to have had nothing to do with said assault -- is simply not appropriate.</p>
<p>(I wish I had time to run down sources and fact-check my details -- all of this is from memory of following the cases at the time -- but I don't even have time to look up the password or even which email address is associated with my login [theJack]. I haven't had time for real editing in too long. Like graffitied articles, however, this is something I just can't let stand. Thanks in advance to anyone who follows up the POV-tagging.) —The Jack [not logged in] 69.183.245.211 23:44, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I cleaned it up, expanded on the role of Charles Schwarz, added the links and citations. Its all very well documented still since it happened in the Internet era. There is still a lot of work needed to be done. We need further bio info on Louima, what he was doing and the circumstances surrounding his arrest. Also, the external links need to be converted to references. There is no reason that this entry be stub quality for long. All it needs a bit of further work. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 10:25, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. With that in mind, I've converted the cites to refs. And also I deleted some refs, since the news organ of a political party, namely the cites from the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_Communist_Party%2C_USA_1d99.html" title="Revolutionary Communist Party, USA">Revolutionary Communist Party</a>'s "Revolutionary Worker" and the website of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Socialist_Movement_7d68.html" title="World Socialist Movement">World Socialist Party</a> are not appropriate Wiki sources, as besides having a stated political bias, verge on conspiracy theory (the latter also features an article on its site about how the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amadou_Diallo_24c5.html" title="Amadou Diallo">Amadou Diallo</a> trial was <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/feb2000/dia1-f28.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/feb2000/dia1-f28.shtml" rel="nofollow">rigged</a>. I am sure better citation can be found for these facts, but I'm late for work so someone else is going to have to do the digging.</dd>

<dd>Heheh, you're either a VERY fast typer or your using some sort of script to convert all these external references.

<p>On a serious matter, why do you think that we can't cite WSWS.ORG as a reliable news source? The link you cite (on the conspirational bent of WSWS.org) that the Diallo trial was <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/feb2000/dia1-f28.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/feb2000/dia1-f28.shtml" rel="nofollow">rigged</a> happens to be an <i>editorial</i>, not a news item. Obviously anyone taking a citation from an editorial is going to encounter problem. On the other hand, how is news cited from a socialist website any different from news cited from <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_News_e423.html" title="Fox News">Fox News</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Times_50df.html" title="Washington Times">Washington Times</a> or the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>? All rather right wing sources but accepted on Wikipedia as "good" references as contrasted to the left leaning WSWS.org website. Fact is fact is fact - whether derived from a left leaning newspaper/website or a right leaning conservative one. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 21:06, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>All the news sources you list can credibly be called "slanted", fair enough, however the Socialist and Revolutionary Worker are not primarily the products of news and media organizations, they are the publishing arms of <i>active political parties</i>. I wouldn't consider them appropriate sources any more than the <i>Daily U.S. Democrat</i> or <i>The Libertarian Gazette</i> (not that those exist, I'm just saying). I have no problem with reputable left-leaning sources, the Village Voice or the Nation, for example. I have a problem with explicitly political organization-dispatches being used as news sources. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 21:51, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Regarding that, I've replaced the Socialist Worker ref you put in with one from CNN.com that cites the same facts of Volpe's threatening Louima's life. Hope this doesn't offend. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 21:59, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>None, whatsoever. Your reasoning is very sensible. I have finally cleaned up the last stubborn citation required tag. The details of Abner Louima's life when he was arrested is pretty hard to coax out online. The most decent reference I can find is a print article in the New York Times newspaper. The reference note cites the print edition of the newspaper. Dedicated researchers can buy the complete text of the article from the NYT <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D13FA3D5B0C708DDDA10894DF494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fL%2fLouima%2c%20Abner" class="external text" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D13FA3D5B0C708DDDA10894DF494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fL%2fLouima%2c%20Abner" rel="nofollow">paysite</a>. The article is also referenced in the this <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/dlj/articles/dlj48p1157.htm#H1N3" class="external text" title="http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/dlj/articles/dlj48p1157.htm#H1N3" rel="nofollow">law school document</a> (the external reference link) as footnote #27.
