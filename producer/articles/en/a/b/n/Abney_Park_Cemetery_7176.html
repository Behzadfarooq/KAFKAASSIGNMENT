<p>Abney Park, the London <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregational_church.html" title="Congregational church">Congregational|Congregationalists'</a> pioneering non-denominational place of rest that reflected new world burial ideas at <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Auburn_Cemetery_a10b.html" title="Mount Auburn Cemetery">Mount Auburn</a> in Massachusetts, opened as a model garden cemetery in 1840. Its approach was based on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregational_church.html" title="Congregational church">Congregational|Congregationalists'</a> role in the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Missionary_Society_b846.html" title="London Missionary Society">London Missionary Society</a>, whose 'fundamental principle' was, likewise, to develop a wholly non-denominational exemplar.</p>
<p>At first there were many links between Abney Park Cemetery and the LMS but this nonconformist (and in particular Congregationalist) period came to a close in the early 1880s when a strictly commercial general cemetery company was formed and the land at Abney Park was made over to the new enterprise. Though the park had not been formalised in 1840 as a cemetery through Act of Parliament or consecration, and Church faculty law never applied - burial ground use, had, by the 1880s, already come to predominate over the wider preservationist and educational objects of its founders.</p>
<p>The founders' financial and legal model had unfortunately not been as radical as their objects had required. Although the original directors also referred to themselves as trustees, having established a trust deed under which they sought to preserve the park in perpetuity, they let the park for operational purposes to the same individuals as a conventional Joint Stock Company (in common with most private cemeteries of the period), rather than perhaps breaking the mould as a provident society. The weakness of the model lay in the detail however, but this was not evident for thirty years. An eventual successful prosecution by the Crown, ruled that despite their unusual business model and the way in which plots were seemingly sold as freehold land, the legal arrangements were actually inadequate to achieve a different status from any other commercial cemetery, either for the company or the registered keepers of plots. In consequence, company income could not be held in trust for the park, but was to be treated as for any other commercial profit-making company and taxed accordingly.</p>
<p>Eventually sold on the open market to a wholly commercially-minded general cemetery company in the 1880s, established with a similar name, three new cemeteries were founded in London's suburbs or nearby countryside. From then onwards standardised park-like landscaping principles came to be applied at Abney Park, replacing much of the unique <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arboretum.html" title="Arboretum">arboretum</a> planting. Air pollution also took its toll, badly affecting the conifer walks. After the First World War, path infill began to be practiced; a situation that became severe in the 1950s and was continued into the 1970s, when the commercial cemetery company went into liquidation.</p>
<p>By 1980, apart from one forecourt building, the park had been passed to the local council as a disused burial ground and open space. Since that time, having no remaining burial rights and only occasional discretionary interments where families had previously held plots from the company, nature has been allowed to take its course.</p>
<p>The park is now a popular place to visit, with a range of educational, training and cultural events and an annual summer open day. It is a designated Local Nature Reserve and Conservation Area. Apart from the South Lodge extension on the forecourt, Abney Park's freehold is owned by the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Hackney_2929.html" title="London Borough of Hackney">London Borough of Hackney</a>. The park is situated near Stoke Newington High Street, London N16, and it is leased to the <a href="http://www.abney-park.org.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.abney-park.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Abney Park Cemetery Trust</a>. It occupies 32 acres (129,000 m²), which includes a nature reserve, a classroom, a visitor's centre and a magnificently dramatic central chapel which, sadly, is disused. The park is normally opened by the Trust for free public access on weekdays and weekends from about 9.30 am to 5 pm, and for access or events agreed with the Trust at all other times.</p>

<p>One of the '<a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnificent_Seven%2C_London_cf7f.html" title="Magnificent Seven, London">Magnificent Seven</a>' parkland <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cemeteries.html" title="List of cemeteries">cemeteries</a> created in the early Victorian period, albeit set out in an entirely different way to the others and with somewhat wider purposes, Abney Park features an impressive entrance designed by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hosking_78ad.html" title="William Hosking">William Hosking</a> FSA in collaboration with <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Bonomi_the_Younger_bd90.html" title="Joseph Bonomi the Younger">Joseph Bonomi the Younger</a> and the cemetery's founder <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Collison_51e5.html" title="George Collison">George Collison II</a>. This frontage was built in the then increasingly popular 'Egyptian Revival' style, with hieroglyphics signifying the 'Abode of the Mortal Part of Man': a venture too far into the architecture of the African continent for <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus_Pugin_4d2f.html" title="Augustus Pugin">Augustus Pugin</a> who pilloried the idea, hoping no-one would repeat such a radical departure from 'good' Christian gothic design (see illustration for <i>Grounds of a Quaker School</i>). A similar criticism had previously been made when the first Egyptian-style entrance to a western cemetery had been constructed at Mount Auburn Cemetery in the 1830s, on which Abney Park Cemetery was partially modelled. By contrast, influential figures who appreciated the composition, complimented William Hosking and Joseph Bonomi on their scholarly frontage design; including the influential arbiter of design taste, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Claudius_Loudon_81bc.html" title="John Claudius Loudon">John Loudon</a>, who described it as a '<i>judicious combination of two lodges with gates between'.</i></p>
<p>Bracing the controversy, Abney Park could claim to be the earliest complete design for a permanent 'Egyptian Revival' entranceway at a cemetery anywhere in the world. The gateway at Mount Auburn Cemetery from which it took its inspiration, was at that time still a temporary structure, being made of dusted wood and sand; its permanent 'Egyptian Revival' design was not built until two years after Abney Park's daring design opened. In England there were already some examples of the use of 'Egyptian Revival' architecture on a small-scale, including one example of a small 'Egyptian Revival' gate installed at a cemetery for Nonconformists near Sheffield in 1836. However, Abney Park Cemetery became the first to employ the style for cemetery buildings, and also the first to introduce it for a complete entrance design.</p>

<p>At Abney Park the use of motifs not associated with contemporary faith served a profound purpose, since it was consciously opened as the first wholly nondenominational garden cemetery in Europe. True, other garden cemeteries sometimes used the term loosely, meaning only that they had laid out more than one denominational area or built more than one chapel. Abney Park Cemetery was the first to be laid out with 'no invidious dividing lines' separating the burial areas of one faith or religious group from any other, and even its one chapel, the <a href="../../../a/b/n/Abney_Park_Chapel_dfd6.html" title="Abney Park Chapel">Abney Park Chapel</a>, a remarkable feast of <i>Puritan</i> or northern Europan brick gothic yet with ample stone dressings and a little neoclassical design woven in, had but one central chamber for the common use of all, and but one entrance. As such it was the first nondenominational cemetery chapel in Europe. William Hosking, in being handed the task of achieving this vision, became the first architect to design a nondenominational cemetery chapel in Europe. Underpinning this was a unique legal basis in comparison with the other garden cemeteries of its period; Abney Park was not set aside solely for cemetery use by Act of Parliament, and was not formally consecrated as burial land. Perhaps more so than any other it was entitled to be considered as a park as well as a cemetery.</p>

<p>Abney Park was unique in being the first arboretum to be combined with a cemetery in Europe; offering an educational attraction that was originally set in a landscape of fields and woods, some distance from the built-up boundary of London. Its 2,500 trees and shrubs were all labelled, and arranged around the perimeter alphabetically, from A for <i>Acer</i> (<a href="../../../m/a/p/Maple.html" title="Maple">maple</a> trees) to Z for <i>Zanthoxylum</i> (American toothache trees).</p>
<p>The emphasis on an educational landscape, as opposed to a purely aesthetic, visually attractive picturesque, drew partly on a simplified version of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Claudius_Loudon_81bc.html" title="John Claudius Loudon">John Loudon's</a> 'Gardenesque' concept, and applied something akin to this, but with a unique alphabetical approach, and no structural mounding, to a picturesque cemetery design. It was much admired by John Loudon, who described Abney Park Cemetery as 'the most highly ornamented cemetery in the vicinity of London', albeit that he favoured a more formal and classical approach to garden cemetery design as a general rule and, in 1843 developed design principles for such an approach.</p>
<p>At the Stoke Newington cemetery the botanical planting was carefully sited since the design sought to do as little as possible to change the existing picturesque parkland. This careful approach drew on that used at <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Auburn_Cemetery_a10b.html" title="Mount Auburn Cemetery">Mount Auburn Cemetery</a> near <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> where Dearborn had emphasised the compatibility of horticulture and even an experimental garden with a cemetery, leading to the opening of a cemetery supported by the Massachusetts Horticultural Society; one that succeeded in establishing a picturesque landscape coupled with botanical garden specimens and an adjoining scientific garden. There were important differences however; the New England cemetery had benefited from a more sylvan setting than that of Abney Park, and a much larger estate. Nonetheless, the ties were evident. The founding directors of the Abney Park project were all <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregational_church.html" title="Congregational church">Congregationalists</a>, who together with other <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nonconformism.html" title="Nonconformism">nonconformists</a> had strong links with their brethren in the new world, to where they had emigrated in search of religious freedom. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Collison_51e5.html" title="George Collison">George Collison</a>, Abney Park Cemetery's company secretary, and the key force behind its radical design, recorded his visit to, and impressions of, Mount Auburn Cemetery, in a book published to coincide with the opening of the Stoke Newington cemetery. It also contains a complete list of all the arboretum species and varieties planted at Abney Park.</p>
<p>The concept of the arboretum -and indeed also a rosarium - was inspired by, <a href="../../../l/o/d/Loddiges.html" title="Loddiges">George Loddiges</a> FLS FZS, a local Hackney nurseryman who became a small shareholder in the cemetery company and was appointed to lead its landscape design, planting and educational labelling, to complement <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hosking_78ad.html" title="William Hosking">William Hosking's</a> layout and building and engineering (drainage) scheme. The pair worked closely as a design team under the guiding influence of the third designer <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Collison_51e5.html" title="George Collison">George Collison</a>, who represented the client company both as its solicitor and principal learned visionary. <a href="../../../l/o/d/Loddiges.html" title="Loddiges">George Loddiges'</a> earlier experience in designing an a to z arboretum at his Mare Street nursery, and possession of one of the largest ranges of trees and shrubs then grown for sale in Britain, ensured success.</p>
<p>The overall effect was to establish Abney Park as the most impresively landscaped garden cemetery of its period. However regretably, Loddiges Nursery closed in the early 1850s and thereafter maintenance of the trees and shrubs and of their botanical labels, was impaired. Today Loddiges' work is of unparalleled significance to landscape design, being recognised as of European importance. Abney Park was the first London cemetery to be invited to join the Association of Significant Cemeteries in Europe (ASCE) and it is the only surviving example of an English landscape designed by <a href="../../../l/o/d/Loddiges.html" title="Loddiges">George Loddiges</a> FLS FZS.</p>

<p>Such an elaborate planting scheme for a park cemetery may also be a reflection of the symbolic importance the founding directors attached to the land that formed Abney Park Cemetery. As nonconformists, who treasured the independence of their religious beliefs—and therefore practised Christianity outside of the established <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>—they held the land <i>itself</i> to be of immense significance for it had previously been two neighbouring and inter-related 18th-century parkland estates, the grounds of Abney House and Fleetwood House, where the revered non-conformist Doctor of Divinity, educationalist and poet Dr. <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Watts_28b2.html" title="Isaac Watts">Isaac Watts</a> lived and taught, and indeed wrote several of his popular books and hymns. The black American author, Arthur Paul Davis, provides an excellent biography of Watts for those who wish to take further interest.</p>
<p>Due to these religious associations, Abney Park Cemetery rapidly became the most attractive Victorian resting place for nonconformist or dissenting ministers and educationalists, principally those from a Protestant dissenting tradition. Indeed it stands today as the most important burial place in the UK of 19th-century <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregational_church.html" title="Congregational church">Congregational</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist.html" title="Baptist">Baptist</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodist</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation_Army_4c99.html" title="Salvation Army">Salvation Army</a> ministers and educationalists, including <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Newman_Hall_1fc7.html" title="Christopher Newman Hall">Christopher Newman Hall</a> and many others, some of whom are mentioned below. Whereas <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunhill_Fields_9a6f.html" title="Bunhill Fields">Bunhill Fields</a> was described by the poet Southey as "the Campo Santo (saints' abode) of the Dissenters <i>in respect of its late 17th century and 18th century burials, Abney Park took on the mantle during the Victorian period in the writings of E. Paxton Hood for the Religious Tract Society.</i></p>
<p>Though it primarily attracted Congregational, Methodist and Salvation Army nonconformists, rather than certain other nonconformists such as Quakers, or non-Protestant nonconformists such as Catholics or Jewish people, Abney Park Cemetery more than any other nineteenth century cemetery was open to the burial of all regardless of their religious convictions or leanings. Whilst its founding directors were all Congregationalists and they were concerned to find a place for such burials, they expressly established the Stoke Newington cemetery as the first fully nondenominational cemetery in Europe (where anyone could be buried anywhere). Selection of a site with historical associations with Dr Isaac Watts, served this purpose well for Dr. Watts' had been honoured in death with a bust in the Anglican Westminster Abbey to complement his burial at the Independent's Bunhill Fields. Subsequently his hymns and scholarly works had become widely used and referred to by many denominations such that in the nineteenth century the Rev. John Stroughton could write: <i>Dr. Watts was as far removed from sectarianism as a man could be</i>. Abney Park Chapel, sometimes referred to informally as Dr Watts' Chapel, in the heart of the cemetery became its spiritual and landscape focal point along with its axial walk to Church Street, Dr Watts' Walk, chosen in 1845 as the most appropriate site in London for a public statue to Dr Watts sculptured by <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Hodges_Baily_c52e.html" title="Edward Hodges Baily">Edward Hodges Baily</a> RA FRS.</p>

<p>Besides its religious associations, <a href="../../../a/b/n/Abney_Park_52d3.html" title="Abney Park">Abney Park</a> has a strong educational pedigree, indeed its prominent Director in the mid to late Victorian era, <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Charles_Reed_MP_f63f.html" title="Sir Charles Reed MP">Charles Reed</a>), was also the Chairman of the London School Board - and Hackney's first MP.</p>
<p>Significantly, the early Victorian cemetery and arboretum park was the setting for the first premises in England to be used exclusively as a <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan.html" title="Wesleyan">Wesleyan</a> training college, following use of temporary, shared facilities in Hackney, and prior to the building of their own spacious colleges and grounds, one in the north of England, and a second at Richmond Hill to which the college at <a href="../../../a/b/n/Abney_Park_52d3.html" title="Abney Park">Abney Park</a> removed in 1843.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/b/n/Abney_Park_52d3.html" title="Abney Park">Abney Park</a> was also a notable <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaker.html" title="Quaker">Quaker</a> College for Girls, although this lost exclusive use of attractive grounds in the eastern part of <a href="../../../a/b/n/Abney_Park_52d3.html" title="Abney Park">Abney Park</a> on formation of the cemetery, leaving only the school house (Fleetwood House) and a small garden for the private use of the students. However, they were welcome to use the new cemetery's educational arboretum and this, along with <a href="../../../a/b/n/Abney_Park_52d3.html" title="Abney Park">Abney Park</a> as a whole, was rarely shared with many others in the early years of the new cemetery, except at weekends.</p>
<p>The school had been founded by the educationalist, scientist and prominent slavery abolitionist <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Allen_%28Quaker%29_87e4.html" title="William Allen (Quaker)">William Allen</a>, and run in a most enlightened and imaginative way by Susannah Corder who later emigrated for a while to Boston and emerged as a talented Quaker biographer. The school's founding prospectus, dated 1824, proposed "an Establishment in our religious society on a plan in degree differing from any hitherto adopted". Though providing an education only for girls, it taught astronomy, physics and chemistry, in a radical departure from the traditional range of subjects offered by female academies of its day.</p>
<p>The school's innovative approach included transport arrangements. When the school first opened, the girls had to walk all the way to Gracechurch Street in the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_London_c553.html" title="City of London">City of London</a> to attend Quaker worship, so a horse-drawn coach was purchased to seat 25 pupils on a pair of facing bench seats. Large horse-drawn coaches that could accommodate so many passengers had only just been designed in Europe; the first having just been introduced into Paris where they were beginning to be used for fare paying passengers. The designer of these large, stable, coaches, was <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Shillibeer_a376.html" title="George Shillibeer">George Shillibeer</a>, who had learnt his trade at the London coach company of Hatchetts in Long Acre. He delivered one to the school in Stoke Newington: the first school bus in the world. In 1827 <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Pease_%28railway_pioneer%29_bfeb.html" title="Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)">Joseph Pease</a>, a Quaker visitor to the school, wrote a verse in which he describes the advent of the new 'bus':</p>

<p>Look carefully, and Pugin's caricature of Abney Park Cemetery (picture right) includes a 'Shillibeer's Funeral Omnibus'. This invention was arousing some debate in 1843, as had the girl's science academy at Fleetwood House, Abney Park in its day, and now the new nondenominational park cemetery. All were seen by parts of London society as iconoclastic.</p>
<p>This was an era of great social change, and strong views with vigorous debate were not uncommonly expressed through such political and social satire. Indeed, Abney and Fleetwood Park's Quaker girl's school had earlier been the setting of a popular cartoon published in London by one of the era's most eminent satirists - <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cruikshank_1a28.html" title="George Cruikshank">George Cruikshank</a>.

Abney Park Blitz memorial. Most of the space is taken up with the names of the victims of the 1940 Coronation Avenue incident (September 2005).</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Abney Park contains memorials to three hundred and seventy-one servicemen from the local borough of Stoke Newington who sacrificed their lives in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_world_war.html" title="Second world war">second world war</a>. Unusually, Stoke Newington has two 'Cross of Sacrifice' monuments constructed shortly after the end of WW1 based on <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reginald_Blomfield_e09e.html" title="Reginald Blomfield">Blomfield's</a> famous design: one on the lawn in front of St. Mary's Church on Church Street, and one in front of the south-facing facade of <a href="../../../a/b/n/Abney_Park_Chapel_dfd6.html" title="Abney Park Chapel">Abney Park Chapel</a> in the cemetery. The names associated with the first cross are displayed a short distance away (inside the foyer of the public library on Church Street) whilst the names of those associated with the second cross (those who are interred in the cemetery) are recorded on a north-facing wall added to the platform on which it stands unless burials are otherwise individually marked. Near the cemetery cross, the names of second world war servicemen who lost their lives and have been buried in the cemetery without separate commemoration, have also been displayed.</p>
<p>The cemetery's attractive 'Cross of Sacrifice' serves as a landmark, but though rising proudly on a ragstone platform of contrasting Portland Stone, it cannot be viewed on the important approach from Church Street since the cemetery company chose to infill Dr Watts' axial walk at the time the war memorial was erected, so rather sadly, designed the platform screen wall to prevent the cross from being appreciated from the south. The Trust hopes to redeem this if a redesign can be agreed, so as to display the cross for all to see and as a vantage point and focal point overlooking both directions of the original axis from the chapel spire and its ogee arch along Dr Watts' Walk, and on to Abney House gate; the axis that commemorates the life of the Rev. Dr Isaac Watts. Slightly off this exact axial alignment, and just as poignant in its way, is the small <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blitz_2aa3.html" title="The Blitz">Blitz</a> memorial that records civilian deaths, closer to the south entrance (picture right).</p>
<p>Though it suffered extensive property damage in the war, Stoke Newington's death toll was relatively low by the standards of some other Hackney districts like <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoreditch.html" title="Shoreditch">Shoreditch</a>, and it would have been lower still, were it not for one horrific incident on 13 October 1940, when a German bomb made a direct hit on a crowded shelter at Coronation Avenue, just off the high street. Most people in the shelter were killed, and as the illustration shows, the list of the dead from this one incident takes up nearly three of the four panels on the memorial. Many of the dead were Jewish and some were refugees from the Nazis.</p>
<p>The war has still not totally loosened its grip on the area. Of two known unexploded bombs (UXBs) remaining in Stoke Newington, one is located somewhere in Abney Park.</p>

<p>As may have been implied already, Abney Park Cemetery was the only garden cemetery of its era to be influenced by New World cemetery design ideas due to the strong links between its founders and New England; in particular Boston. The Stoke Newington cemetery reflects the design style adopted for Mount Auburn, for example in its use of an Egyptian Revival entrance and arboretum. However, though its 'model' lay in the New World, it drew on different romantic landscape associations. Whereas Mount Auburn Cemetery celebrated the 'Sweet Auburn' of poetry, in particular the nature and woodland associated with the Auburn village area, it was the 'romance' of religious and historical associations that primarily attracted the founders of London's first nondenominational garden cemetery, to Lady Mary Abney's estate which had served as an inspiration to the celebrated Isaac Watts. Nonetheless, on its opening, Abney Park was by far the most sylvan of all garden cemeteries in Britain; its many stately trees imbued the landscape with a uniquely well-timbered inheritance or 'green cloak', and plans were put in train to encourage this further with collections of trees arranged along, and set back from, path edges. Whereas the cemetery at Mount Auburn had been blessed with a natural woodland setting, well suited to its founders' ethos of creating an Elysian paradise, Abney Park would take some time to more closely reflect its predominantly woodland style of cemetery design and a more transendental view of nature as proposed by Emerson, and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoreau.html" title="Thoreau">Thoreau</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a>.</p>

<p>Slowly, however, time has healed this difference and the landscape at Abney Park has grown closer to its New World cousin. Mature trees and woodland now adorn Abney Park, completing its transformation into a woodland cemetery. This has been so profound a change that by the early 1990s the cemetery was acknowledged to be the largest woodland ecosystem in North London so close to the centre of the City of London, and became designated as the first statutory <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservation_ethic.html" title="Conservation ethic">Local Nature Reserve</a> in the London Borough of Hackney.</p>
<p>Under careful management the woodland is slowly becoming enriched through natural regeneration. The northern areas are slowly returning to native oaks with a hornbeam and hawthorn understory, and a woodland ground flora that includes Wood False Brome grass and Wood Spurge; the whole being interspersed with naturalising exotic thorns and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Service_Tree_of_Fontainebleau_cf50.html" title="Service Tree of Fontainebleau">service trees</a> to add a cross-cultural dimension. Meanwhile, the sandy brickearth soils that extend from Church Street along Dr Watts' Walk to the chapel lawns, the sole surviving heathland in Hackney, are returning to a lighter structure based on Silver Birch woodland and heathy species such as bracken fern. Today, a range of woodland birds, mammals and butterflies are supported; the grounds forming one of north London's largest breeding sites so close to the City for some very attractive species such as the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speckled_Wood_8131.html" title="Speckled Wood">Speckled Wood</a> butterfly.</p>
<p>Nature changes gradually however, and the ecology will need active habitat management if these semi-natural sylvan qualities are to be preserved and enhanced, and to ensure that the naturalising exotic arboretum trees (such as <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crataegus_heterophylla.html" title="Crataegus heterophylla">Various-leaved Hawthorn</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Service_Tree_of_Fontainebleau_cf50.html" title="Service Tree of Fontainebleau">Service Tree of Fontainebleau</a>) and plans for the replacement of <a href="../../../l/o/d/Loddiges.html" title="Loddiges">Loddiges</a>' perimeter A to Z arboretum, contribute their valuable educational and botanical interest to parts of the grounds.</p>

<p>Part of a Victorian account of a visit to the admire the beauties of Abney Park Cemetery, reads:</p>
<p><i>There is a beautiful cemetery in Stoke Newington, and it was given to the inhabitants in memory of <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Mary_Abney_1d59.html" title="Lady Mary Abney">Lady Abney</a>, who was a sincere friend to Dr. Watts. There is in it a pretty little church, where funeral services are performed by all denominations of Christians.</i></p>
<p><i>Lady Abney was very liberal in her religious views, and the cemetery is, with its church, open to all alike, and though its grounds were never consecrated, yet many rigid churchmen have been buried in it. There is no quieter burial spot within a dozen miles of London in any direction, and there are cedars of Lebanon in it, wide lawns, and beautiful flowers.</i></p>
<p><i>There is an old clergyman in the church, who is always ready to officiate for a small fee on funeral occasions. He is over eighty years old, his hair is like the snow, and he is a fit companion to such a solemn place.</i></p>
<p><i>One shining evening, with a female friend we visited the cemetery, and stopped in the little [largely] Gothic <a href="../../../a/b/n/Abney_Park_Chapel_dfd6.html" title="Abney Park Chapel">chapel</a> to talk with the venerable clergyman. The tears actually sprung over his eyelids when we said that we came from America.</i></p>
<p><i>The old man asked a thousand questions about the wonderful far land of liberty in the west, which we were glad to answer. Almost every family among the poor respectable classes in England, has some member, or relation in America.</i></p>
