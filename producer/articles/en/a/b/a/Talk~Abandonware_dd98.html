<dd>So, uh, we'd like to have a few more specifics before baldly declaring an article "POV". What exactly do you think is biased? Remember that NPOV is not about editing out controversial POVs, but about attributing them to specific parties, without endorsing any as "more true". <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 03:58, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My main objection to it is that it seems to operate from the assumption that Abandonware is basically good, if occasionally mistaken in assuming something is abandoned when it isn't. There doesn't seem to be any argument against abandonware as a whole except to note that it is not actually legal. Also, towards the end, when you get to the stubbier paragraphs, it takes on a bit more of a biased approach. Or I could be overreacting and firmly voted down. These things happen. =) <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 04:06, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article is quite clear that Abandonware is not legal to distribute (in most jurisdictions). It does differ from simple piracy. I would agree that the original author or authors (of which I'm not one) have some POV, but I don't think it's excessive. The remark about copyright extension probably does go too far.--<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">Gadfium</a> 04:12, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the article should be deleted or anything, but I think a paragraph about the potential harms of abandonware needs to be added, and the copyright extension needs to go. I'm just not quite qualified to do the potential harms of abandonware paragraph, though I'll do it anyway if no one else wants to. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 04:21, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Assumption that abandonware is good" is kind of vague - do you have a specific phrase or wording that seems objectionable? Noting that it is illegal seems like a pretty clear negative. I'd be interested to hear about the potential harms, you must know more about it than I do, so write away and we'll all tinker with the result. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 04:40, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone has just mentioned to me on a forum that the "External Links" section is named "Legal" Abandonware titles. The 'Legal' term is misleading because it assumes that all the content of those sites is now in the public domain, which is not true. Aadlg 13:32, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The intention is to have legal "abandonware" sites listed, instead of "legal" abandonware ones. People just keep adding them illegal sites.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../e/v/k/User%7EEvktalo_7520.html" title="User:Evktalo">evktalo</a> 09:47, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Shouldn't those links be moved to the Freeware article? Liberated Games, for example, is not about Abandoned games, its about propietary games that became freeware (or released the source code).<a href="../../../s/e/g/User%7ESega381_a591.html" title="User:Sega381">Sega381</a> 03:48, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"An abandonware fan is a video game player who thinks that video games that are no longer on the market are more fun than video games that are still on the market." IMO, just becuase you like abandonware doesn't mean that you think it's more fun than current games. It just means that you enjoy playing games that are old, that's all. Am I making sense here?</p>

<p>Freeware is, 99% of the time, NOT public domain software. Just because you can download something for free off the internet does not mean it is in the public domain.

"Is it piracy" Well as said before, there are "gray" games and legal "white" games available. But, let's compare this to piracy. By its very nature privacy imposes that you are lowering or degrading the value of something. Thus, stealing from a corporation. This is where the confusion is. Some titles are still being sold but are on abandonware sites. This is clearly breaking the law. ALSO, if there are large amounts of used copies for sale you may be stealing from them. Next piracy imposes that you received protected material without the owner’s permission. Well here is another area of confusion. Notice I said protected. By this I meant copyright. If you notice many "liberated" or re-released programs as freeware still have a copyright on them. But, it was with the owner's permission it was distributed. But, if we go back to the example of Yoot tower (above) we notice there was no copyright found. Now here is the question. We have eliminated already through these two rules, about half of the abandonware sites. Also, we have justified those sites below who did not break either of the rules. But we have a few sites that are still in the gray area. These sites normally say they carry only legal material, asking for user assistance for getting rid of bad material and bringing good ones in. So, if we put Yoot tower to the test, it is no longer sold anywhere (maybe 2-5 used if any) so for the most part it passes the first law. It also breaks half of the second law, there may be a copyright but it is no longer enforced or was simply dropped. But for some reason it does not show up on the copyright search like it's prequel Sim Tower. The last complication of this is there are no longer official websites for either of the games. So, the company may have announced its continuation of the copyright or just dropping it. Then I found it on a lot of pirate abandonware sites and on one that said it was legal. This one was user maintained. Here is the problem with that. The user who uploaded it may have not known the complexity of the status of the game. Or, he was just a pirate and uploaded it anyway. On the other hand, he may know for a fact that it was legal. In these cases, you will just have to make up your own mind.</p>

<p>The common definition of abandonware by the "abandonware community" (the largest group of sites and people, including many who are responsible for the terminology, which is a fairly cohesive population) is contingent on the availability of the software, <b>not</b> upon the age of the software (as is implied by the article). Furthermore, the moral justification which is most commonly used is that the damage caused to current or potential future owners of the IP in question is outweighed by the benefit of the availability of the software. Lists of commonly misconcieved titles which are actually still available for sale are maintained (though I believe the primary list is currently out-of-commision) to guide what sites should not make available. The age of the software is a distant second to the availability (for example, many Apogee/3DRealms games are prohibited even though they are far, far older than many commonly termed abandonware titles).</p>
<p>As for the unethical / "bad" aspects of Abandonware, they are appropriately represented, but the organization of the article is such that things are slightly muddied and poorly structured. The article needs to be revised and reorganized. Research pertaining to the relevant sections of the US Code and the international Berne Convention agreements has been done and is available in the Abandonware community, but I do not have it readily available currently. Considering the legal and ethical status of the issue this cross-referencing would provide extremely beneficial to the article. Some extremely valuable information is also available from the Internet Archive <a href="http://www.archive.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archive.org" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> as they have recently been involved in a court case <a href="http://www.archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=31480" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=31480" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> to more firmly establish the status of abandoned ("orphaned") digital works (and also recieve judicial permission to become a public archive).</p>
<p>Slightly off-topic from the above, but the mentioned iD games are *not* freely available. Much of the engine core has been open sourced, but rarely -- if ever? -- the entire codebase (for example the Windows source for Doom was not released because it contained licensed 3rd party sound code) and thus far no games that they have released have included the art or level files (WADs, etc). As such, legal copies of the original game must first be obtained and I think that these titles should be removed. --129.252.196.36 01:15, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We can't link to sites distributing Abandoneware illegally. All the sites I deleted were doing this, or were offering links to sites that would allow you to do so.

<p>While some copyrights have been released by the owners, 99.99% have not. Not enough people understand the basis for why, so I've tried to give a quick answer to why nations do not recognize abandonware (WIPO, which aims to bring copyright protection the world over into common ground) and the specific example of why it's currently not accepted by the legal system in the United States. The only serious conflict between WIPO signatories and the United States (on this issue) is the term of the US copyright which is now ridiculously long. However, conflicts over un-released copyright terms in video games won't be an issue for at least another few decades when the copyright terms start to expire in countries with earlier expiration dates (and even then, it will be over the earliest '70s video games, nothing anyone will probably be in a rush to exploit). It would be nice if some users with good knowledge of EU or Japense copyright law could chime in with the rules in their respective jurisdictions. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 15:57, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having just came across this article again, I was thinking it was overly engrossed in legalities. Reads like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>. Citing the U.S. Constitution is just way over the top. I think the lead already covers just about everything there is to know about the legal status of abandonware ("The term has no legal meaning"), and I'd rather see more about the legal <i>history</i> of abandonware: Have there been any major legal battles over abandonware? <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 07:00, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With respect, I think there's no such thing as "overly engrossed in legalities" --particularly when talking about a topic like "abandonware". There's no original research in that section, rather it's just stuff any American copyright attorney would be able to regurgitate. However, I think it needed revision (which is my fault entirely). The structure uses the traditional legal line of reasoning: issue, rule, analysis, conclusion (but on a very basic version, not pioneering anything unknown or new). Because it's not recognized in the law, there are no notable cases (although it's likely to have been mentioned in an academic paper). The current legal structure doesn't allow for there to really be an argument over whether something is abandonware: either the copyright holder released it in a writing or didn't (that's why it has to be by formal writing: to make very clear that it was intended so there won't need to be a trial trying to figure out intent). <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 17:10, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I concurr. Although most countries have copyright laws that are generally similar in effect, the underlying reasoning is often different. Canada's laws, for instance, indicate that the 'loss of profit' argument has some merit in deciding whether a use of material violates copyright. It is possible that the use of abandonware without a copyright release, by an individual, would be ruled upon as legal in that [my] country. I think a better approach to the legal/ethical situation would be to clearly state the essential parameters of abandonware (i.e., not distributed, not supported, old, unmarketable... however you think of it) and provide clear links to whatever work is going on over on the copyright pages; perhaps even start a subsection there. Carefully hammering out a discussion of copyright law here seems like duplication of effort; furthermore, the concept of abandonware seems to indicate a certain indifference to the technicalities of copyright in the first place. 69.49.44.11 15:57, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current first sentence: <i>Abandonware is computer software which is no longer being sold or supported by its copyright holder.</i> This definition is clear and straightforward. However, some of the rest of the article seems to use the term in a different sense. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="../../../a/b/a/Abandonware.html#History_of_abandonware" title="Abandonware">Abandonware#History of abandonware</a>:
<ul>
<li><i>Abandonware was quite low-key until the advent of the Internet</i>: What does it mean for software to be quite low-key? Seems nonsensical. Presumably the author meant that such software was not distributed much, that is, the distribution of abandonware was low-key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In <a href="../../../a/b/a/Abandonware.html#United_States" title="Abandonware">Abandonware#United States</a>:
<ul>
<li><i>the concept of abandonware conflicts with the basic copyright concept</i>: What is the conflict? Pointing out that a copyright holder isn't doing anything with their copyright (which according to the first sentence is all that using the term "abandonware" entails) doesn't conflict with recognizing and honouring that copyright. Presumably the author is speaking here of the notion that if the copyright holder does nothing with their copyright, then it is (legally? morally?) unobjectionable to distribute, modify, etc., the copyrighted work. Is that notion part of the term "abandonware" or not?</li>
<li><i>Because abandonware would conflict with the stated goal [of the copyright clause in the US constitution] of granting "exclusive right" (irrespective of profit), it is not currently recognized in the United States.</i> Again, this sentence only makes sense if the term "abandonware" includes in its meaning the idea that it is okay to distribute, etc., a copyrighted work when the copyright holder isn't doing anything with it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What's happening in these examples? If they exhibit proper use of the term, we should adjust the definition accordingly. If not, we should rewrite the examples. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStebulus_a924.html" title="User:Stebulus">Stebulus</a> 20:42, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the discussion of the constituional basis for copyright in relation to abandonware, a very copyright maximalist stance is taken. The phrase "Because abandonware would conflict with the stated goal of granting "exclusive right" (irrespective of profit), it is not currently recognized in the United States." Is clearly wrong, and warant rephrasing. The goal of this article in the US constitution is to "Promote the progress of science and useful arts", and the "exclusive right" is merely a means. Once software is abandoned (and thus is no longer available to the public), the more rational explanation would be for the exclusive right to be no longer enforceable. I suggest rephrasing the entire section, and removal of the reference to Eldred v. Ashcroft as mostly irrelevant. -- Jeroen Hellingman.</p>

<p>Not all antique software is abandonware, and not all abandonware is antique software. GNU Emacs is antique software that's still in active use. Ami Pro was abandonware even at the time when it was still a viable product. Abandonware does have the connotation of very old programs, but doesn't have to. A new coinage like "abandonware" hasn't had time to settle down into a precise definition yet. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott1329m_ea13.html" title="User:Scott1329m">Scott1329m</a> 12:53, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But what about the second sentence in this article: <i>"Sometimes, it is used as a blanket category for any software over a certain age, usually five years."</i> The problem with having a separate article on "antique software" is that the category largely overlaps this one, but the term has not caught on. If you Google "antique software," most of the results are for software for tracking antiques. I speak as someone who once wrote an entire article on "antique software." But were I to do it over again, I'd use the term "abandonware" instead because that seems to be the prevailing term for old software that people collect - the way people collect stamps, coins, and model trains. This usage would seem covered by the "blanket category" phrase above. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarte_ba69.html" title="User:Barte">Barte</a> 15:52, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if someone wants to really go into this, but Lucasarts in it's various names and forms over the years has been pretty aggressive, especially as far as PC game companies go, in enforcing their rights to their old software. Even games like the Monkey Island and some of the older Indiana Jones games, which stopped being sold in some cases well over a decade ago, are vigerously protected by their legal staff. This is obviously their legal right to do, the only reason I bring it up here is they are far more vigilant then virtually any other game company on the market on the issue, especially in regards to very old games. Also from just quick browse of Abandonware sites, they appear to be pretty effective at the enforcement as well. I'm not good enough at dealing with Wiki's to even begin to know how to apply this to this page though, so I'm just kicking it here as an FYI to people who understand this site better. {Sunday, 2006-12-24 T 23:37 UTC}</p>

<p>CONSENSUS: Linking from this article to abandonware archives is highly controversial. The consensus that has emerged among the abandonware world is that these sites are controversial because they have not only abandonware but warez, which is essentially pirating current software.

<dd>Hey, the fact that no one has taken down this site yet shows the software is worthless&#160;:) But, seriously, I agree - Vetusware is an historical researcher's paradise - old DOS abandonware from the 1980s and early 1990s, and some shareware. There's nothing wares-related to it. They may have picked up 1 or 2 packages that might be marginally still supported, but if so it's very rare. Most of their stuff is either operating systems or applications which includes a lot of historical releases that I don't know where else could be found. I actually contributed a lot of stuff to them a few months ago, but they've never put my stuff online. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott1329m_ea13.html" title="User:Scott1329m">Scott1329m</a> 21:56, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Vetusware is a challenge. Almost by definition, "abandonware" and "warez" are going to be intersecting sets. Any abandonware that hasn't been released into the public domain (no software copyrights that I know of have expired) is warez in the technical sense. The legal issue is like a tree falling in the forest when no one is around to hear it - by definition, the software is abandoned and no one is going to be paying lawyers to write takedown orders and enforcing the copyrights. It's not like vetusware or anywhere is pirating software someone's selling in Best Buy today. (I strongly object to that sort of thing.) I think the site serves a research purpose, which is why it was on the page. Someone who wants to run WP 4.1 (1985) is not going to be doing so because they aren't going to pay for modern versions (!) and want to pirate it the way someone could download a modern version ISO image from a BitTorrent or eMule feed. The only people who want the software would be those who have research or sentimental (or both, for abandonware collectors) reasons. (I personally contacted WP's current owner, Corel, who brushed off my request for historical versions.) If you really want to be pedantic, Borland's Museum said they were going to put up Turbo C 1.0 and 1.5, but never did - is that software PD because they said they were going to make it PD? Or is it not because they never bothered to actually put the zip file on their site? (Those versions were among the ones I uploaded to vetusware that have never actually been put on the site.) However, if every other day someone is going to come along and summarily delete the link w/o discussion, it's better off gone. Vetusware is very findable in google. I do admit that Vetusware is indiscrete, and does have a few packages up there that I would not like to see, such as the current Borland Turbo Assembler and a few other things that are still for sale. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott1329m_ea13.html" title="User:Scott1329m">Scott1329m</a> 19:28, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, there's very few companies, if any, that'll supply old copies of software to consumers, which is unfortunate. I'll just mention briefly, Microsoft (I'm sure other companies don't either) doesn't care for these type of sites, and if they find them, they'll more than likely receive a typical "Cease and Desist" order.

<dd>I agree with the above and would add that much of this is proportion and intent. To cite a similar, better known example: YouTube vidoes are by and large legal, and when someone posts something otherwise, the site readily removes them on request. We known Vetusware is predominantly abandonware. We can only assume that the site's very existence shows that it hasn't had to defend itself in court, though more info would be useful. So re: the article, perhaps a separate section is called for: something like <i>"Sites hosting abandonware."</i> With a proviso introduction: <i>"The following sites predominantly host downloadable abandonware, although some titles may not qualify as such."</i><a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarte_ba69.html" title="User:Barte">Barte</a> 21:05, 26 December 2006 (UTC).

<dd>Well, for me, as ScummVM co-leader, an ever-working sign of a warez site was presence of Sierra's titles (which are being sold by Vivendi as compilations right now) and LucasArts titles, as LEC legal department is ever-chasing entity for their intellectual property.

<dd>I've done a lot of historical research into early DOS days, and Vetusware is the <i>only</i> abandonware site with non-game programs I've ever encountered. (You can find some programs on eMule.) I've spent a lot of time looking through it, and most of the site is abandonware. There are probably a handful of what could be classed "wares" - the worst one I've seen is the current Borland Turbo Assembler - but almost all of the site is ancient applications like WordPerfect 4.1 that are unattainable - except buying them from used software dealers, and the ethics are similar to tape trading concert recordings among fans (or Internet sharing, now) versus buying a bootleg from a dealer. In either case, the field is so small that it's not even on the radar. I wish vetusware would stay farther back away from the gray area, so it wouldn't attract the wrong kind of attention, but that's their decision. (As for MS, this is the company which released Word 5.5 for DOS for free during Y2K because it had so little value that the patch was easier just to put up for mass download.) I am not familiar with games, so I don't know what's an abandoned vs. current game. If vetusware is putting up currently sold games, boo hiss to them because it'll get their site taken down. It's helped me research software I thought I'd never get. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott1329m_ea13.html" title="User:Scott1329m">Scott1329m</a> 11:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I removed the current links, since they all offer current software available for sale, I can give several examples from each web site if required. If you really want older software to become more available, linking to software currently available in re-releases isn't going to help at all. At least try to find links, which only offer software no longer for sale. That shouldn't be difficult, if there really is a concept of only 'abandonware' and not just general piracy of older software. Kirben 05:45, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as has been argued, the good of vetusware outweighs the bad - there probably are a few things there still for sale, but it's the only place that has true abandonware applications which are not games. It seems silly to have this link added removed added removed ad nauseum - perhaps the best thing to do is have <i>NO LINKS AT ALL</i> and have a paragraph saying
<dl>
<dd><i>Abandonware web sites are a gray area. Many of these sites have historical archives of abandonware which is not easily obtainable by any other means. But these sites also can contain, inadvertently or intentionally, some software which has not been abandoned and is still being sold. Because of this ambiguity, no links are provided in this article. Many feel the inclusion of non-abandoned software taints the legality and purity of these sites, making them legally and morally questionable.

<p>Okay, so now I agree that vetusware is warez. They just put up Power C from MIX, which is still being sold and is still viable. (I'm kinda miffed because they won't post Turbo C 1.0, true abandonware, but they'll post something that's still for sale?)

<dd>The attempt to define freeware as a sub-classification of abandonware is part of the attempt to show "abandonware" is an overly broad classification that -- besides games -- includes freeware that has been abandoned (no one could say GNU awk for DOS is not abandonware), commercial software, etc etc etc -- abandonware is a class, not a specific type of software like the other -ware words such as shareware. (The only other -ware word I can think of that defines a class is "shovelware".) In light of today's open source movement, historical freeware is of interest because it shows the ethos of GNU and free software has deep roots in the past. In the context of historical research (which this section tries to highlight, to show that abandonware is more than pirating old games!), the MS-DOS port of GNU awk is historically significant because it shows the GNU ethos at a very early date (I can't remember but at least by '86 or so). That was what the cryptic sentence was trying to say, but this may be too much original research for Wiki tastes, even though it is simply trying to get a grip on the vague terminology. Of course, I may be the only historical researcher into the mid 1980s DOS world ever, so this may be irrelevant. My wiki entries try to highlight some of this old software. See <a href="../../../p/c/-/PC-LISP_1d7f.html" title="PC-LISP">PC-LISP</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_Easy_As_9d6b.html" title="As Easy As">As Easy As</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbo_Debugger_f586.html" title="Turbo Debugger">Turbo Debugger</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/WordPerfect_4.1_9fc3.html" title="WordPerfect 4.1">WordPerfect 4.1</a>, and others. I've added screen shots and clarification to other articles about what is now abandonware. My whole point about this is to capture some of this computer history before it is lost forever. There's more to abandonware than games -- and the "more" is historically significant to the history of computing. It may be, however, that the history of computing is too irrelevant to preserve. Or, maybe abandonware needs to be divided into games vs other software. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott1329m_ea13.html" title="User:Scott1329m">Scott1329m</a> 14:52, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the terms tend to blend and that "abandonware" is somewhat blurry. When I first wrote about the subject (for a Japanese magazine), I called it Antique Software and concentrated not on games, but on OSs, programming languages, utilities and early office-class software that seemed to be garnering hobbiest interest, as well as a smattering of academic interest (such as the software collection at the Computer History Museum in the Silicon Valley). My working assumption was that I was writing about software that was no longer published, but was still of largely historical interest. That definition doesn't assume piracy. For example, an archivist might collect a legal distribution of a copyrighted OS that is no longer for sale.</dd>

The last paragraph in that section which I added) addresses the non-game side of the coin. Re: <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeware.html" title="Freeware">freeware</a>, it already has a Wikipedia entry, so I'm still unclear why the Abandonware article would attempt to define that term here.</dd>

<p>Well--the Wikipedia guidelines say "be bold"--so I'm floating this trial reorganization and trimming of the article. I've rewritten the lead and cut some of the material that doesn't seem to directly address abandonware, per se, but delves into related topics like software copyright law. A problem with all of this is that while the term clearly addresses a class of software--older titles still of interest (possibly pirated, hopefully not)--formal definitions and discussion outside sources are still hard to find.

<p>Some editors making recent changes to this and related articles have clearly allowed their personal opinions to cloud their objectivity. I understand wanting to make sure that your perspective is represented in the body of the article, but this has gone beyond merely adding information clarifying the legal status of a category of software or discussing the merits of the various philosophical perspectives on the subject. Those things would be fine, but information detailing the opposing viewpoint is being systematically edited out, to the point that the article is becoming less sensible. The very definition of the term 'abandonware' has been mostly removed from the text! Certainly, the defining ideas behind the argument in favor of the concept of abandonware have been taken out or de-emphasized to an absurd degree. The article is about abandonware, for God's sake! You can't remove the perspective that gives the term its definition. It is necessary for both arguments to be represented here in an accurate and complete way. In your zeal to get you point across, you are doing damage to the information in the article. I would have just reverted the edits altogether, except that there was some useful cleanup and such scattered in with the unhelpful and biased stuff. Seriously, let's get it together.

Maybe there needs to be a category Abandonware, with articles for Abandonware Games, Abandonware Applications, Abandonware Developer Tools, Abandonware Legality, etc? The problem with a scheme like this is there's so little interest in abandonware outside of the gamer community. The other big issue is that there is no clear definition of abandonware - warez pirates have taken over the term like used car dealers have taken over "march madness". A real tragedy that they're destroying abandonware. There needs to be some sort of archival exception for obsolete software so it can be preserved and studied. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott1329m_ea13.html" title="User:Scott1329m">Scott1329m</a> 11:34, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Scott1329m: there are at least two classes of abandonware and having followed the non-game segment, I think it hard to make the claim, as anonymously made above, that "abandonware" is just a synonym for warez. Check out <a href="http://www.outliners.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.outliners.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.outliners.com/</a> --which is also linked in the article, for just one example.-<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarte_ba69.html" title="User:Barte">Barte</a> 18:57, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I originally wrote a Wikipedia article entitled "Antique Software" that covered the non-game segment, then later merged it here because this seemed like the more used catagory. I suppose that title could be resurrected, but it does seem like an artificial distinction.-<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarte_ba69.html" title="User:Barte">Barte</a> 18:59, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
