<p>This text came from an old public domain resource (copyright now expired) and, it turns out, duplicated an entry already added under an OldLink; I've redirected that page to this one. I wonder, though, if we should preserve the text as-is, as was done on the old one, or make every attempt to update it so it's useful as something other than a sociological curiosity. I personally favor updating it, but it won't be a problem to restore the old text in its original form if that's what the consensus is. --KQ</p>

<p>Yes! Yes! Update, combine, rearrange, add. Be bold! I also OK to mention Britannica and Gutenberg by reference on Talk pages, just don't mention either of them on the page itself, or credit them just to give credit. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a></p>

<p>While the page mentions the structure of various abaci and says they can be use for addition through cubic roots(!) I would very much like to see a description of how they can be used as such. Any experts out there care to add?</p>
<p>^^I agree. I came to this page hoping to gain an understanding of how the abacus works. I got a lot of great history, but nothing on how exactly to use them.68.203.182.120 22:26, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Its similarity to the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_abacus.html" title="Roman abacus">Roman abacus</a> suggests that that was the ultimate source, and this was very possible, since there were direct trade relations between the classical world and China, and Mongol traders along the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silk_Road_2b99.html" title="Silk Road">Silk Road</a> were a bridge between East and West. It could even have been introduced by the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_legion.html" title="Roman legion">Roman soldiers</a> captured by the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_empire.html" title="Persian empire">persians</a> and sold to the Chinese emperor as engineers. Most were later ransomed, but many found China much to their liking.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This connection is way too far-fetched in my opinion for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are more dissimilarities than similarities.</li>
<li>Roman uses removable beads</li>
<li>Chinese uses sliding beads</li>
<li>Roman abacus uses 1-plus-4 beads to represent decimal numbers</li>
<li>Chinese abacus uses 2-plus-5 beads to represent either decimal or hexadecimal numbers</li>
<li>Roman used the abacus purely as a counting tool.</li>
<li>Chinese used it as a calculating device by developing advanced computation techniques to do multiplication, divison, square root and cubic root on the abacus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such claim needs more evidence than just pure speculations. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKowloonese_2c09.html" title="User:Kowloonese">Kowloonese</a> 01:14, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is not pure speculation. Claiming the Mayans were influenced by the Egyptians solely because of a similarity of large buildings that exist in both civilization is an example of <i>PURE</i> speculation. There was no opportunity for the two cultures to come into contact.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Roman abacus dates back to at least 100 BCE.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The well-known version of the Chinese abacus, the Suan Pan, emerged in the 13th century, when most of the cultures in the world were using the 10-digit <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positional_notation.html" title="Positional notation">positional notation</a> system which, almost one thousand years earlier, the Romans lacked.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_Dynasty_44d2.html" title="Yuan Dynasty">Yuan Dynasty</a> (1271-1368) was when the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongol.html" title="Mongol">Mongols</a> rule China. It was a period of cultural enlightenment. The Mongols replaced the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Chinese_7b2f.html" title="Han Chinese">Han Chinese</a> bureaucrats and all important central and regional posts within China were monopolized by Mongols, who also preferred employing non-Chinese from other parts of the Mongol domain--Central Asia, the Middle East, and even Europe to fill positions for which no Mongol could be found. Scientic education, literacy, and public works florished under Mongols. It was in this melting pot of cultures and enlightenment, that the Suan Pan leaped into existance as a fully formed two-deck abacus in the 13th century.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Admittedly, as far back at 190 CE, there were references to abaci in China. It was mentioned in a book of the Eastern <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Dynasty_53c4.html" title="Han Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a>, namely <i>Supplementary Notes on the Art of Figures</i> written by Xu Yue in that year. Of course, this was at the height of the Roman Empire. In addition to trading via the Mongols along the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silk_Road_2b99.html" title="Silk Road">Silk Road</a>, there is proof of direct contact between the cultures. <i>Hou Hanshu</i> (History of the Later Han) recounts that a Roman convoy set out by emperor <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoninus_Pius_84a5.html" title="Antoninus Pius">Antoninus Pius</a> reached the Chinese capital Luoyang in 166 CE and was greeted by Emperor Huan.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Chinese Trade in the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tang_Dynasty_fbdb.html" title="Tang Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</a> (618-907) along the Indian Ocean and the Middle East would have provided direct contact with India and Islam allowing them to accquire the concept of <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero.html" title="Zero">Zero</a> and the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal_point.html" title="Decimal point">decimal point</a> from Indian and Islamic merchants and mathematicians.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another reference to an abacus in China occurred at the latest during the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Song_Dynasty_fcad.html" title="Song Dynasty">Song Dynasty</a> (960-1297), when Zhang Zeduan painted his Riverside Scenes at Qingming Festival. In this famous long scroll, an abacus is clearly seen lying beside an account book and doctor's prescriptions on the counter of an apothecary's (Feibao). Worthy of note is the increased Mongol influences as Song Dynasty collapsed under Mongol incursions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By the 13th century, the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_numeral.html" title="Chinese numeral">Chinese numeral</a> system is a fully expressed 10-digit system with <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positional_notation.html" title="Positional notation">positional notation</a>, so it is not unreasonable to expect the Chinese to have developed computing techniques for the abacus that are readily expressed as algorisms under a positional notation system.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Any form of advanced arithmetic is extremely difficult using <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_numerals.html" title="Roman numerals">Roman numerals</a> which lacked the Zero and positional notation. Before an arithmetic operation could be transfered to an abacus, someone had to develop the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algorism.html" title="Algorism">algorism</a> for the operation. The complexity of multiplication and division under <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_arithmetic.html" title="Roman arithmetic">Roman arithmetic</a> did not mean they were limited to only counting on an abacus. The limitation of the advanced arithmetic operations is a function of limitations of the Roman numeral system and not their abaci.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The adaption of the Roman abacus to the needs of the Chinese numeral system could be the cause of the mutation from 1/4 to 2/5 beads. I have found no evidence for or against early Chinese abaci having other than the 2/5 configuration. If a Roman abacus was presented to the Han Emperor in 166 CE, (no doubt the staff and merchants whom accompanied the envoy would have had abaci as well) then the intervening centuries were sufficently long enough for the Chinese to make the abacus their 'own' by adapting to their needs.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, I did find an obscure reference that there was a Roman abacus with 2/5 configuration, but I am not sure if the author was correct. The author of the article cites K. Menninger, Number Words and Number Symbols (New York: Dover, 1992) as the source.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Note that the text of the article did not assert the connection was proven. However, I believe that there is more than enough evidence to <i>suggest</i> such a connection and that such a connection is not pure speculation as you claim. If more evidence presents itself, I am sure references will be cited and proofs offered.</dd>

<dd>I am not convinced despite everything you quoted here. There were many similar inventions in Chinese and Western culture that were proven to be developed independently. Almost all cultures around the world figured out what a year and a month is because they all looked at the same sky, not because they made contact and shared notes. Almost all cultures around the world figured out how to count in ten. Not because the cultures had contact with each other, it was because human beings have the common physiology, the ten fingers. The 1/4 bead counting came naturally when people used one hand to count while the other hand was busy sorting things. People count in ten because of ten fingers in two hands, people modified it into 1/4 counting because one hand got busy and then they figured out that they can count using the thumb to represent 5 and the fingers to represents ones. The abacus could very well be a natural extention to finger counting. Chinese and Roman could easily come up with the same idea independently.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You could believe Mayan and Egyptian could came up with large buildings independently because you couldn't find any evidence that the two cultures made contact. What if the evidence show up tomorrow, will you then claim Mayan and Egyptian learned their building technique from each others? Substitute buildings with abaci, then the same argument becomes very weak. Proving Chinese and Roman had contact does not prove their abaci are related.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, the 1/4 and 2/5 design of the abaci were developed independently. And Chinese stuck with the same design all along because they used it for both decimal and hexadecimal calculation. The Japanese adopted the Chinese abacus, but they didn't use them for hexadecimal calculation, and they removed the two redundent beads and resulted to a design very similar to the Roman abacus.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another example is the weighing unit in China and the Imperial weighing unit from England. Chinese had one jin for 16 liang while the English had one pound for 16 ounces. You can argue they learned from each other because they made contact and the hexadecimal approaches are strikingly similar. However, when you understand the 16 based unit were natural result from using a beam balance scale to make division. For example, you spit one pound of your grains into two piles until the scale balances on both size, you repeat it 4 times and you get an ounce. The Chinese did the same with their grain to come up with the similar 16 base units. Whether the two cultures made contact or not is irrelevant.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Unless you have found literature that explained the origin of the abaci, the claim in the article is baseless and should be removed. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKowloonese_2c09.html" title="User:Kowloonese">Kowloonese</a> 07:59, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I think the problem here lies in whether certain suggestions are likely or not. If the possibility is there but remote, it is not worth putting in an encylopedia article. I "suggest" the opposite. I "suggest" that the similarity is due to the fact that both Chinese and Roman have 5 fingers in each hand, not because Roman contacted Chinese back in 166 CE. It is also possible that some alien civilization invented the abaci, but I rather not make such kind of suggestion here. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKowloonese_2c09.html" title="User:Kowloonese">Kowloonese</a> 18:39, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you have a great idea. Why not suggest your alternative speculation in the article as well? We can make a subsection called 'Origins' and suggest both possibilties, present the underlaying evidence and allow the reader to decide what is non-trival content or not. We can refer the reader to the this entry in the discussion section for further infomation as well.</dd>

<p>I live in Novosibirsk and I did not see an abacus in use for a long time neither here nor in Berdsk (a small town nearby) despite what the "Russian abacus" section currently says. Can anyone confirm if abacus is still used somewhere in Russia? --Mivlad 00:45, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe that I'm the one who added that bit to the article. I lived in <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karaganda.html" title="Karaganda">Karaganda</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazakhstan.html" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> for a year (in 2002) and saw the russian abacus used by the sellers every day at my local markets. Not used by everybody, but still quite common, in several different locations. Karaganda being the third most developed city in the country, I suspect that the abacus is even more prevalent in the rural areas of Kazakhstan and Russia, not to mention the other (lesser developed) republics.</dd>

<dd>I just returned from several days in Lukoyanov, a small town near Nizhny Novgorod. Because of my interest in calculation, my hosts showed me an old abacus they had, one essentailly the same as the "Russian abacus" pictured in the article. They indicated that the abacus was still used by older women in shops in the area. They also indicated that their ten-year-old daughter had used an abacus in school, but I suspect it may have just been a way of teaching the meaning of numbers, rather than the use of an abacus as a practical instrument.--LarryC 20:25, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some time ago, I contributed the text (and image) on school abaci, hoping others would elaborate a little on it. Here's what's in the article today:</p>
<dl>
<dd>==School abacus==</dd>
<dd>Around the world, abaci have been used in elementary schools as an aid in teaching arithmetics. In Western countries, a model similar to the Russian abacus and often known as a bead frame has been common (see image). - <i>Image text:</i> School abacus used in Danish elementary school. Early 20th century.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In particular, I am unsure of the "Western countries" thing, and of the history of such abaci - I know we've had them in Denmark, and I know some plastic toys designed in USA include wire frames of a similar design.

<dd>Continued — actually going to each of the links — I&#160;discovered that one of them was to a page in Japanese that didn't show anything about abaci, at least not prima facie, and wouldn't be understandable to most of English Wiki's users; and that another was to a site that merely sold abaci.

<p>The article seems to focus on the historical aspects of the abacus well but does not seem to mention the potential of the abacus as a arithmetic tool. I feel that it should be noted that many schools of the Japanese abacus (soroban) learn to calculate with both the abacus as well as mentally. More specifically, calculations are done mentally in the same way that they are done on the abacus (i'm just trying to say that they aren't done the same way we were taught in school). With proper training, the abacus user can become faster than a calculator. Of course, this is assuming the calculator is slowed down by a human pushing the buttons. I can be more specific as to how this is accomplished if you feel this is something that should be mentioned in the article. Basically, I felt that the tone of the article made the abacus sound like an outdated artifact that is only used in elementary education. While this is somewhat true, I know that there are still competitions up to around middle school grades where the soroban is anything but outdated and slow.</p>

<p>"From this, a variety of abaci were developed; the most popular were based on the bi-quinary system, using a combination of two bases (base-2 and base-5) to represent decimal numbers." Is that strictly true? Are we sure that isn't supposed to be a combination of base-1 and base-5? I don't own an abacus, but it seems to me that it would be difficult to represent binary with a string of beads. --<a href="../../../s/k/r/User%7ESkrapion_6c26.html" title="User:Skrapion">Skrapion</a> 21:16, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Each column in a Japanese has one upper bead and 4 lower beads. The upper bead can be in the up or down position, which up/down = two states i.e. binary. The lower beads can be moved in zero-up, one-up, two-up, three-up and four-up position, i.e 5 different states, i.e. a base-5 number. Likewise, the Chinese Abacus has 2 upper beads and 5 lower beads. Usually one of the bead in both upper and lower deck is not used, so it is used like the Japanese version. When the extra bead is used, the upper deck can represent 0, 5 or 10, (a base-3 system) and the lower beads continue to be used a a base-5 system with one bead unused except in a special case where all 5 beads moved up together with the 10 in the upper deck to represent 15. i.e. the beads' position in each column can represent 0 to 15 by combining the base-3 and base-5/6 values. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKowloonese_2c09.html" title="User:Kowloonese">Kowloonese</a> 01:56, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Ther's a duplication (partial overlap) of this page with <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomogram.html" title="Nomogram">Nomogram</a> - <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMeduz_14cb.html" title="User:Meduz">Meduz</a> 09:55, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not really -- one is an analog device, the other is digital. About the only overlap is that they can both be used for calculation (as can a slide rule, computer, or pencil &amp; paper). <a href="../../../q/u/o/User%7EQuota_b8dd.html" title="User:Quota">quota</a> 11:21, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
