<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense released two dossiers bearing the detainee ID 762.</p>
<p><a name="First_Detainee_Transcript_Numbered_762" id="First_Detainee_Transcript_Numbered_762"></a></p>

<p>One is a single page that contains a note from the detainee's Personal Representative that reads: <i>"The detainee will contest his enemy combatant status in the courts in January.<sup id="_ref-CsrtAbaidullah_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtAbaidullah" title="">[2]</a></sup>"</i></p>

<p>There is a second transcript for a detainee with ID number 762.<sup id="_ref-CsrtAbaidullah2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtAbaidullah2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The transcript of his testimony is eleven pages long. It does not contain a specific list of the allegations against him. Several of the allegations can be interpolated from some of the answers he offered:</p>
<p>He acknowledged that he had, briefly, been enlisted in the Taliban's Army -- but he had been forcibly conscripted.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that he had a notebook with some drawings of landmines. When he was conscripted his beard had not grown in, so he was considered too young for front line duty. He had, therefore, been sent for training. He had briefly attended training where he was taught about how to set land mines to destroy Northern Alliance tanks. He said he had deserted after two days, and hed then used the notebook to record his debits and credits from the stall he had in the bazaar. The Taliban had looked for him, for a while, after his desertion. But, the American invasion occurred shortly thereafter, and they quit looking</p>
<p>One of the allegations against him seems to have been that he was living in a house belonging to a Taliban leader. By his account the house had belonged to an official in Afghanistan's communist regime, named Ali Jhan. He and his widowed mother had moved in when Jhan had fled after the Taliban took power.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that there were mines on his property. When he and his widowed mother had moved in to the house after Jhan's departure they found he had left behind several hundred land mines. They would have been dangerous to keep in the house, and dangerous to turn in to the Taliban -- who apparently routinely punished those who turned in weapons. So his mother decided to bury them on a waste scrap of their property.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/a/Abaidullah.html" title="Edit section: Administrative Review Board Hearing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative Review Board Hearing</span></h2>
<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
<p>Abaidullah chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing.<sup id="_ref-ArbAbaidullah_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ArbAbaidullah" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Abaidullah denied all the allegations. He acknowledged that he had confessed some of the statements attributed to him. But it had been during the time he was held in Bagram, and was subjected to abusive interrogation techniques. Abaidullah said he had a knife held to his throat, and threatened that if he did not make the admissions his interrogators they wanted they would slit his throat. He said he had his hands suspended above his head for long periods of time. He had been subjected to long periods of sleep deprivation. He had a bag a sand suspended from his bound hands, and had been made to march back and forth all night long.</p>

<p>Abaidullah acknowledged that the Madrassa he was accused of attending did exist. But he attended a modern school, finishing eleventh grade, until the Taliban shut it down.</p>
<p>He was forced, by the Taliban, to attend a mine warfare school. But he went AWOL after just two days. The Taliban came looking for him, several times, but relatives hid him. Then the Americans overthrew the Taliban. He had kept a notebook in which he had transcribed notes during his two days in the mine warfare school. Most of the notebook was empty and he had used the remaining pages to record his income and expenses from his business.</p>
<p>Abaidullah acknowledged that there were mines on his property. He and his widowed mother had been allowed to move into a house abandoned by a military leader opposed to the Taliban. His mother found mines, of unknown age, buried in their home. It wasn't safe to turn in weapons during the Taliban's reign. They were apt to torture the person turning them in, demanding they confess to where other weapons were. So his mother decided to bury the mines elsewhere on their property.</p>
<p>Abaidullah acknowledged that he did owe his partner money. <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamid_Karzai_9fff.html" title="Hamid Karzai">Hamid Karzai</a>'s government issued new currency, and he had bought a quantity. Then the value of the currency dropped in value. He denied that his partner had ever tried to ask him to pay off the debt by assisting in terrorist or resistance operations. He said he was unaware of his partner having any ties to the Taliban or al Qaeda.</p>
