<p><b>Abahlali baseMjondolo</b> is a movement of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shack.html" title="Shack">shack</a> dwellers in South Africa which started with a road blockade in <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durban%2C_South_Africa_7931.html" title="Durban, South Africa">Durban, South Africa</a> in early 2005.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>The words <i>Abahlali baseMjondolo</i> are <a href="../../../i/s/i/IsiZulu_0d57.html" title="IsiZulu">isiZulu</a> for <i>people who stay in shacks</i>.</p>
<p>Abahlali refuses to participate in party politics or any NGO style professionalisation of struggle and instead seeks to build people's power where people live and, to a lesser extent, where people work.</p>

<p>Since the 2005 road blockade its membership has grown from the entire population of the 6 000 strong Kennedy Road settlement in the Clare Estate area of Durban to the point where 13 entire settlements have voted to collectively affiliate to Abahlali and govern themselves autonomously from state politics. There are also a further 23 branches in other settlements that are not collectively affiliated to Abahlali but which do allow independent political activity. The movement now also works with street traders and has a further 3 branches of street traders, all of which are in <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinetown.html" title="Pinetown">Pinetown</a>. It also has members in eMmaus and Motala Farm who live in poor quality houses rather than shacks and who joined because their communities are adjacent to Abahlali shack settlements. The movement's red t-shirts have become famous and Abahlali is often simply known as Izikipa ezibomvu (the red shirts). Individuals in the state and linked to a local NGO have alleged that the shirts are provided by some nefarious source. But Abahlali members, as well as visiting academics who have spent time with the movement, and some journalists, report that the shirts are, in fact, made in the shacks on rented pedal power sewing machines in all night sewing sessions by a Women's Sewing Collective.</p>

<p>The movement is best known for having democratised the internal governance of many settlements and having organised numerous large marches on local councillors, as well as the mayor and the provincial Minister of Housing. The organisation has also fought against evictions and forced removals by mass mobilisation and court action; successfully used access to information law to force the city to reveal its plans for the forced removal of many shack settlements; demanded the electrification of shack settlements to stop the regular fires; campaigned for access to water and sanitation; fought for land and housing in the city; started creches; held quarterly all night music, poetry and drama evenings; run a 16 team football league; provided HIV/AIDS care; started a ten thousand copies per issue newspaper; vigorously opposed what it sees as authoritarianism from government, business and some vanguardist left NGOs; won major and sustained media attention and sought to win popular control over decision making that affects poor communities. One of their key slogans (along with 'Land! Housing!, 'Sekwanele!' etc.) is 'Talk to Us, Not about Us!'. Abahlali has produced 6 or 7 shack dwelling public intellectuals who regularly comment and, in some instances, write in the local media in English, Zulu and Xhosa.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Office holders at branch, settlement and movement level are elected annually in open assemblies. At least half of all elected positions are filled by women. Office holders are given mandates for action at open weekly meetings, are subject to recall and the secretariat can credibly claim to represent approximately 30,000 people. People who present the movement to the media and who travel to represent the movement elsewhere are elected, mandated and rotated and at least half of the people elected to fulfil these responsibilities are women. At assemblies male and female questioners and speakers are alternated. One of the movement's founding principles, which is regularly reaffirmed publicly, is that no one in the movement will ever make any money from the movement. The movement accepts no money from political parties, governments or from those NGOs which seek to use donor funding to substitute their own voices and projects for those of the poor and is 100% run by unpaid volunteers. Funds are raised by a small annual membership fee of R7 (1$ US) and occasional irregular small donations and are strictly used for movement (not individual) expenses such as transport, printing, bail costs etc.</p>
<p>The movement has a number of sub-committees and internal organisations such as a Churches Sub-Committee, a Youth League and a Women's League.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/a/Abahlali_baseMjondolo_4162.html" title="Edit section: Harassment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Harassment</span></h2>
<p>Individuals in the ruling party, including the eThekwini City Manager Mike Sutcliffe and Mayor <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obed_Mlaba_4d2c.html" title="Obed Mlaba">Obed Mlaba</a> and many others, have very often accused Abahlali of being manipulated by a 'third force' or a foreign intelligence agency. No empirical evidence has ever been adduced for these claims but they have created a climate that justifies violent repression. The movement has suffered sustained illegal harassment from the state<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> that has resulted in almost 200 arrests of Abahlali members and repeated police violence in people's homes, in the streets and in detention. On a number of occasions the police have used live ammunition, armoured vehicles and helicopters in their attacks on unarmed shack dwellers. In 2006 the local city manager, Mike Sutcliffe, implemented a complete ban on Abahlali's right to march which was eventually overturned in court. The movement has also laid numerous assault, as well as theft and wrongful arrest charges against the police. On 4 December 2006 a pregnant women lost her child and a man was killed when the police attacked residents of the Siyanda settlement who had blockaded a major road. Police harassment has been strongly condemned by human rights organisations including, most notably, the Freedom of Expression Institute which has issued a number of statements in strong support of Abahlali's right to speak out and to organise protests. Police violence against Abahlali has been quite widely covered in the mainstream international media (e.g The New York Times<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>, The Economist, Le Monde etc). Not one of the arrests of Abahlali members has ever led to a trial and no member of Abahlali has ever been convicted of any offence. A number of Abahlali members have come under major pressure at work due to their activities in the movement and some have been forced out of jobs in both the public and private sectors including S'bu Zikode, the elected head of the movement.</p>
<p>Individuals in the state (and in late 2006 a few individuals linked in different ways to a local NGO, the Centre for Civil Society, who undertook a campaign of slander against the movement and individuals in it) have, often pandering to the most base race and class stereotypes, presented the organisation as a group of criminals under the malevolent influence of a white man. A number of local academics have responded by pointing out that no empirical evidence has ever been provided in support of this assertion, that none of the people making these claims have ever attended an Abahlali meeting or undertaken interviews with members of Abahlali, and, moreover, that this is a racist interpretation very similar to the manner in which the state and white <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_society.html" title="Civil society">civil society</a> typically described mass movements of the African poor under <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a>. Moreover there is now a large body of detailed ethnographic academic work on the movement, written by researchers from around the world, all of which, without exception, stresses the radically democratic and highly principled nature of the movement.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
