<p>Hello again! Talk about timing&#160;;) First and foremost, thanks for correcting my rudimentary English grammar and terrible spelling mistakes. I was actually halfway through editing the article, but had to do a short break, so I didn't manage to give it the final look I intended to, and an appropriate message to you. I apologize for the fact that it made it look quite impudent.</p>
<p>As concerns production sites, I have added the <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> template because I have never heard of that and it seems unlikely. I of course believe you know it from a certain source, and I wanted to draw your attention to that by adding this template, which I hoped you would substitute with a link or reference to the said source. I would be most obliged if you would. In general, this article needs good references - what I used as a reference in this last edit was the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050401064203/www.carsfromitaly.com/fiat/index.html" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050401064203/www.carsfromitaly.com/fiat/index.html" rel="nofollow">Marea page @ CarsFromItaly.com</a>, accessed by the <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayback_Machine_934e.html" title="Wayback Machine">Wayback Machine</a>, as this wonderful site is unfortunately down now. Thank God there's <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Archive_a5d5.html" title="Internet Archive">Internet Archive</a>!</p>
<p>Other than that, I also think the engine section can be remodelled in a more clean and informative form. I personally like an arrangement like in the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daihatsu_Applause_afdd.html" title="Daihatsu Applause">Daihatsu Applause</a> article. I am going to get back to the article sometime later today - it would be great if you could add more of the information you have in the meantime! The <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fiat_Bravo_Brava_8895.html" title="Fiat Bravo/Brava">Fiat Bravo/Brava</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fiat_Stilo_9066.html" title="Fiat Stilo">Fiat Stilo</a> articles are a total mess too... Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> -</p>
<dl>
<dd>As concerns <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru%C4%87ac.html" title="Perućac">Perućac</a>, I take it you found it interesting because you have stationed (is this the correct verb in English?) in Bosnia. I am not sure whether I understand everything there, but isn't the power station there a <a href="../../../p/u/m/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity.html" title="Pumped-storage hydroelectricity">pumped-storage</a> one?</dd>
<dd>As concerns <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renault_Modus_4b5e.html" title="Renault Modus">Renault Modus</a> - there are heaps of orphaned car articles like that and that's great you took care of this one! First of all, I recommend you to join the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Automobiles_13cd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Automobiles">Wikipedia:WikiProject Automobiles</a>. What we are striving towards now as concerns articles on individual models is replacing old-school tables with the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_automobile_a057.html" title="Template:Infobox automobile">appropriate Infobox</a>, cleanup, getting rid of POV undertones and in general structuring the articles better and expanding them. Also, adding references is what many Wikipedians forget about, though it is crucial - otherwise, how do we know what is actually true here?- Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 19:05, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Forgot about one thing - what plagues automotive articles are unreferenced rumors, gossip and speculation (referenced would become information per se), like the Grand Modus thing. They do not belong in an encyclopedia at all, even if they are interesting and relevant. That is what forums and car mags are for. So, if you come accross anything like that, could you please ask the author to provide an appropriate reference (which would be manufacturer's press release or equivalent, no forum postings or media gossip), tag it with <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, or if the author fails to do so or it seems generally unlikely, just delete it.

<p>The only picture of mine on the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamborghini_Gallardo_fbda.html" title="Lamborghini Gallardo">Lamborghini Gallardo</a> page is of a Gallardo finished in pearl orange, a factory color. The colors of the image may have washed very slightly because of the bright sun, but to my eyes, it's still quite recognizable as orange. If the image appears pink to you, I would suggest tuning the color settings on your monitor. <a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagvar_a2b3.html" title="User:Jagvar">Jagvar</a> 18:46, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Tom, i'm Graham (GsmithEIDW) - from the Autocar forum (Same username here). I live in Dublin, Ireland and drive a Hyundai Coupe 2.0 litre. I'm not nearly as experienced a wikipedian as you seem to be, but I'm learning as I go. I don't have very much spare time as I'm involved in a number of other hobby projects too, so I don't think I'll be able to take on any large projects here. I normally just add things in small and somewhat random doses. Actually to date I think most of my contributions probably aren't car related despite being an avid enthusiast - anyway nice to meet you. Its about time I wrote something in my own talk page on here! <a href="../../../g/s/m/User%7EGsmithEIDW_00e8.html" title="User:GsmithEIDW">G.</a> 10:50, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the note. I had not given any thought to this matter of visible numberplates, though I dimly recall wondering how the car owner would feel if she came across her car on the wikipedia. I'm not convinced there is any pressing need to obscure the numberplate, but equally have no strong feelings against so doing. If you feel strongly about it - and I guess as you've raised it you have some positive inclination - then please do so. No objection from me. best wishes --<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagishsimon_49c0.html" title="User:Tagishsimon">Tagishsimon</a> <a href="../../../t/a/g/User_talk%7ETagishsimon_9445.html" title="User talk:Tagishsimon">(talk)</a></p>

<dd>Hi, I am awake enough to understand what you say, I believe&#160;:D I've just had a fresh coffee. As concerns the warning banner you might have seen on my talk page, it seems I actually probably have this <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome.html" title="Chronic fatigue syndrome">CFS</a> thing, which basically means I don't feel well at all and nobody knows why, but there is a chance I could even die from that. Funny, heh?</dd>
<dd>Coming back to the Vauxhall VX220 thing - most of the differences you mentioned aren't very substantial I am afraid, I guess one could find some like this for other Vauxhall/Opel pairs. I believe they could comfortably be covered in one article (Opel and Vauxhall), as most of what there is to be said about them is the same, and even if one would want to list all "differences", including the most trivial ones, they would still fit in well in the article. What is important here is the design/development process. I believe we can assume the Vauxhall was the original vehicle this time, so I think for a change the Vauxhall should be the main article with Opel redirecting. Finns det något mer att säga?

<dd>PS. I believe the Lightning should also be covered in the same article for the sake of clarity and not generating too many separate entries.
<dl>
<dd>Thanks! I wish it was a just a hangover, but a hangover going on for over a year is nothing nice, actually. Anyway, happy to see we have reached a compromise over the VX220, it would be good to cobble the article together now&#160;:D Cheers, Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 21:26, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Abarthaddict, you were on the list of members at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Automobiles_13cd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Automobiles">WikiProject Automobiles</a> and we are introducing a new way of listing members, as the old list was becoming too long. Our new method involves having all of our members in a category.</p>
<p>To add yourself to the category just add the userbox to your user page by putting <b>{{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWiki_Auto_Project_6d83.html" title="Template:Wiki Auto Project">Wiki Auto Project</a>}}</b> where you want the userbox. Alternatively if you don't like the userbox you can add <b>[[Category:WikiProject Automobiles members|Abarthaddict]]</b> to your userpage.</p>
<p>If you no longer wish to be a member of the project, simply don't add the userbox or category, there's no pressure.
