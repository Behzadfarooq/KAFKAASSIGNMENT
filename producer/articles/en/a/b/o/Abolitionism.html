<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/o/Abolitionism.html" title="Edit section: Britain">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Britain</span></h2>
<p>The slave trade within England was made illegal in 1102, and the last form of enforced servitude (<a href="../../../v/i/l/Villein.html" title="Villein">villeinage</a>) had disappeared in Britain by the beginning of the seventeenth century. However, by the eighteenth century, black slaves began to be brought into <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> as personal servants. They were not bought or sold, and their legal status was unclear until 1772, when the case of a runaway slave named <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Somerset_06ac.html" title="James Somerset">James Somerset</a> forced a legal decision. The owner, Charles Steuart, had attempted to abduct him and send him to <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamaica.html" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> to work on the sugar plantations. While in London, Somerset had been <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptised</a> and his godparents issued a writ of <i><a href="../../../h/a/b/Habeas_corpus.html" title="Habeas corpus">habeas corpus</a></i>. As a result <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Murray%2C_1st_Earl_of_Mansfield_58a5.html" title="William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield">Lord Mansfield</a>, Chief Justice of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Bench_cd9f.html" title="King's Bench">Court of King's Bench</a>, had to judge whether the abduction was legal or not under English <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Law_8277.html" title="Common Law">Common Law</a> as there was no legislation for slavery in England. In his judgement of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_22.html" title="June 22">22 June</a> <a href="../../../1/7/7/1772.html" title="1772">1772</a> he declared: "Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged." It was thus declared that the condition of slavery did not exist under <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_law.html" title="English law">English law</a>. This judgement emancipated the 10 to 14 thousand slaves in England and also laid down that slavery contracted in other jurisdictions (such as the American colonies) could not be enforced in England.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>After reading of the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset%27s_Case_aa98.html" title="Somerset's Case">Somerset case</a>, a black slave in Scotland, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Knight_924a.html" title="Joseph Knight">Joseph Knight</a>, left his master, John Wedderburn. A similar case to Steuart's was brought by Wedderburn in 1776, with the same result: that chattel slavery did not exist under the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_Scotland_f34a.html" title="Law of Scotland">law of Scotland</a> (nevertheless, there were native-born Scottish serfs until 1799, when <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal_miners.html" title="Coal miners">coal miners</a> previously kept in serfdom gained <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_emancipation.html" title="Political emancipation">emancipation</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/o/Abolitionism.html" title="Edit section: First steps">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First steps</span></h3>
<p>Despite the disappearance of slavery in Great Britain, in the American and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_West_Indies_f0ac.html" title="British West Indies">West Indian colonies</a> of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, slavery was a way of life.</p>
<p>By 1783, an anti-slavery movement was beginning among the British public. That year the first English abolitionist organization was founded by a group of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quakers.html" title="Quakers">Quakers</a>. The Quakers continued to be influential throughout the lifetime of the movement, in many ways leading the way for the campaign. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">17 June</a> <a href="../../../1/7/8/1783.html" title="1783">1783</a> the issue was formally brought to government by Sir Cecil Wray (<a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retford.html" title="Retford">Retford</a>), who presented the Quaker petition to parliament. Also in 1783, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Beilby_Porteus_620f.html" title="Bishop Beilby Porteus">Dr Beilby Porteus</a> issued a call to the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> to cease its involvement in the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slave_trade.html" title="Slave trade">slave trade</a> and to formulate a workable policy to draw attention to and improve the conditions of <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-Caribbean_16a2.html" title="Afro-Caribbean">Afro-Caribbean</a> <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slaves.html" title="Slaves">slaves</a>.</p>
<p>Black people played an important part in the movement for abolition. In Britain, <a href="../../../o/l/a/Olaudah_Equiano_2e5f.html" title="Olaudah Equiano">Olaudah Equiano</a>, whose autobiography went into nine editions in his lifetime, campaigned tirelessly against the slave trade.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/o/Abolitionism.html" title="Edit section: Growth of the movement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Growth of the movement</span></h3>
<p>In May 1787, the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_for_the_Abolition_of_the_Slave_Trade_3420.html" title="Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade">Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade</a> was formed, referring to the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_slave_trade.html" title="Atlantic slave trade">Atlantic slave trade</a>, the trafficking in slaves by British <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merchants.html" title="Merchants">merchants</a> who took manufactured goods from ports such as Bristol and Liverpool, sold or exchanged these for slaves in <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Africa_e6b4.html" title="West Africa">West Africa</a> where the African chieftain hierarchy was tied to slavery, shipped the slaves to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_colonies.html" title="British colonies">British colonies</a> and other <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> countries or the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American colonies/USA</a>, where they sold or exchanged them mainly to the Planters for rum and sugar, which they took back to British ports. This was the so-called <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triangle_trade.html" title="Triangle trade">Triangle trade</a> because these mercantile merchants traded in three places each round-trip. Political influence against the inhumanity of the slave trade grew strongly in the late eighteenth century. Many people, some African, some European by descent, influenced abolition. Well known abolitionists in Britain included <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Ramsay_%28abolitionist%29_e301.html" title="James Ramsay (abolitionist)">James Ramsay</a> who had seen the cruelty of the trade at first hand, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granville_Sharp_083f.html" title="Granville Sharp">Granville Sharp</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Clarkson_c9a9.html" title="Thomas Clarkson">Thomas Clarkson</a>, and other members of the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clapham_Sect_5a5e.html" title="Clapham Sect">Clapham Sect</a> of <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> reformers, as well as <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quakers.html" title="Quakers">Quakers</a> who took most of the places on the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_for_the_Abolition_of_the_Slave_Trade_3420.html" title="Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade">Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade</a>, having been the first to present a petition against the slave trade to the British Parliament and who founded the predessor body to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_for_the_Abolition_of_the_Slave_Trade_3420.html" title="Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade">Committee</a> . As <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissenters.html" title="Dissenters">Dissenters</a>, Quakers were not eligible to become British MPs in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, so the Anglican evangelist <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Wilberforce_04a9.html" title="William Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a> was persuaded to become the leader of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_parliament.html" title="British parliament">parliamentary</a> campaign. Clarkson became the group's most prominent researcher, gathering vast amounts of information about the slave trade, gaining first hand accounts by interviewing sailors and former slaves at British ports such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>.</p>
<p>Mainly because of Clarkson's efforts, a network of local abolition groups was established across the country. They campaigned through public meetings and the publication of <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamphlets.html" title="Pamphlets">pamphlets</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petitions.html" title="Petitions">petitions</a>. One of the earliest books promoted by Clarkson and the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_for_the_Abolition_of_the_Slave_Trade_3420.html" title="Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade">Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade</a> was the autobiography of the freed slave <a href="../../../o/l/a/Olaudah_Equiano_2e5f.html" title="Olaudah Equiano">Olaudah Equiano</a>. The movement had support from such freed slaves, from many denominational groups such as <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedenborgians.html" title="Swedenborgians">Swedenborgians</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quakers.html" title="Quakers">Quakers</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptists.html" title="Baptists">Baptists</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodists.html" title="Methodists">Methodists</a> and others, and reached out for support from the new <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">industrial workers</a> of the cities in the midlands and north of England. Even women and children, previously un-politicised groups, became involved in the campaign although at this date women often had to hold separate meetings and were ineligible to be represented in the British Parliament, as indeed were the majority of the men in Britain.</p>
<p>One particular project of the abolitionists was the negotiation with African chieftains for the purchase of land in West African kingdoms for the establishment of 'Freetown' - a settlement for former slaves of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">the American colonies/USA</a>, back in west <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>. This privately negotiated settlement, later part of <a href="../../../s/i/e/Sierra_Leone_8171.html" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a> eventually became protected under a British Act of Parliament in 1807-8, after which British influence in West Africa grew as a series of negotiations with local Chieftains were signed to stamp out trading in slaves. These included agreements to permit British navy ships to intercept Chieftains' ships to ensure their merchants were not carrying slaves.</p>
<p>In 1796, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Gabriel_Stedman_9cfd.html" title="John Gabriel Stedman">John Gabriel Stedman</a> published the memoirs of his five-year voyage to <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surinam.html" title="Surinam">Surinam</a> as part of a military force sent out to subdue <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maroon_%28people%29.html" title="Maroon (people)">bosnegers</a>, former slaves living in the inlands. The book is critical of the treatment of slaves and contains many images by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Blake_00bd.html" title="William Blake">William Blake</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesco_Bartolozzi_21a9.html" title="Francesco Bartolozzi">Francesco Bartolozzi</a> depicting the cruel treatment of runaway slaves. It became part of a large body of abolitionist literature.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slave_Trade_Act_d51a.html" title="Slave Trade Act">Abolition of the Slave Trade Act</a> was passed by the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom_dcaf.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">British Parliament</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_25.html" title="March 25">25 March</a> <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a>. The act imposed a fine of £100 for every slave found aboard a British ship. The intention was to entirely outlaw the slave trade within the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, but the trade continued and captains in danger of being caught by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> would often throw slaves into the sea to reduce the fine. In 1827, Britain declared that participation in the slave trade was piracy and punishable by <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_sentence.html" title="Death sentence">death</a>.</p>

<p>After the 1807 act, slaves were still held, though not sold, within the British Empire. In the 1820s, the abolitionist movement again became active, this time campaigning against the institution of slavery itself. The <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Slavery_Society_4f7d.html" title="Anti-Slavery Society">Anti-Slavery Society</a> was founded in 1827. Many of the campaigners were those who had previously campaigned against the slave trade.</p>

<p>The Abolitionist Movement set in motion actions in every State to abolish slavery. This succeeded in every northern state by 1804; although the emancipation was so gradual that there were still a dozen "permanent apprentices" in the 1860 census. The principal organized bodies to advocate this reform were the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quakers.html" title="Quakers">Society of Friends</a>, the Pennsylvania Antislavery Society, and the New York Manumission Society. The latter was headed by powerful Federalist politicians, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Jay_7ffe.html" title="John Jay">John Jay</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, and republican <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Burr_2154.html" title="Aaron Burr">Aaron Burr</a>. Thanks to the considerable efforts of the NYMS, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> abolished slavery (gradually) in 1799. In terms of numbers of slaves, this was the largest emancipation in American history (before 1863). New Jersey in 1804 was the last northern state to abolish slavery (again in gradual fashion). At the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_Convention_cd5b.html" title="Constitutional Convention">Constitutional Convention</a> of 1787, however, agreement was reached that allowed the Federal government to abolish the international slave trade in 1808, which it did.

<p>In the early part of the 19th century, a variety of organizations were established advocating the movement of Blacks from the United States to locations where they would enjoy greater freedom; some endorsed <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colony.html" title="Colony">colonization</a>, while others advocated <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emigration.html" title="Emigration">emigration</a>. During the 1820s and 1830s the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Colonization_Society_ac98.html" title="American Colonization Society">American Colonization Society</a> (A.C.S.) was the primary vehicle for proposals to eventually do away with slavery by returning American blacks to <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>.

There was, however, considerable opposition among African Americans, many of whom did not see colonization as a viable or acceptable solution to their daunting problems in the United States.

That is he demanded that slave-owners repent immediately, and set up a system of emancipation. After 1840 "abolition" usually referred to positions like Garrison's; it was largely an ideological movement led by about 3000 people, including freed blacks. Abolitionism had a strong religious base including Quakers, and people converted by the revivalist fervor of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Great_Awakening_e04e.html" title="Second Great Awakening">Second Great Awakening</a> in the North in the 1830s. Belief in abolition contributed to the breaking away of some small denominations, such as the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Methodist_Church_9e4f.html" title="Free Methodist Church">Free Methodist Church</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> abolitionists founded some colleges, most notably <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bates_College_c114.html" title="Bates College">Bates College</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a> and <a href="../../../o/b/e/Oberlin_College_8aa2.html" title="Oberlin College">Oberlin College</a> in <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>.

<p>In the North most opponents of slavery supported other modernizing reform movements such as the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temperance_movement.html" title="Temperance movement">temperance movement</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_school.html" title="Public school">public schooling</a>, and prison- and asylum-building. They split bitterly on the role of women's activism.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_O%27Connell_e9b1.html" title="Daniel O'Connell">Daniel O'Connell</a>, the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> leader of the Irish in Ireland, supported the abolition of slavery in the British Empire and in America. O'Connell had played a leading role in securing <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Emancipation_5e59.html" title="Catholic Emancipation">Catholic Emancipation</a> (the removal of the civil and political disabilities of Roman Catholics in Great Britain and Ireland) and he was one of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Lloyd_Garrison_1e12.html" title="William Lloyd Garrison">William Lloyd Garrison</a>'s models. Garrison recruited him to the cause of American abolitionism and O'Connell, the black abolitionist <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lenox_Remond_7d26.html" title="Charles Lenox Remond">Charles Lenox Remond</a>, and Theobold Mayhew, the temperance priest, organized a petition with 60,000 signatures urging the Irish of America to support abolition. O'Connell also spoke in America for abolition.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repeal_Association_c1fa.html" title="Repeal Association">Repeal Associations</a> in the United States largely took a proslavery position. Several reasons have been suggested for this: that the Irish, who were in any case competing with blacks for jobs, disliked having the same arguments used for Irish and for black freedom; that they were loyal to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Constitution_b784.html" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, which defended <i>their</i> liberties, and disliked the fundamentally extraconstitutional position of the Abolitionists, and that they perceived abolitionism as Protestant. In addition, the slaveholders had no hesitation in voicing support for the freedom of Ireland, a white nation outside the United States.</p>
<p>Radical Irish nationalists - those who broke with O'Connell over his refusal to contemplate the violent overthrow of British rule in Ireland - had a diversity of views about slavery. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Mitchel_3942.html" title="John Mitchel">John Mitchel</a>, who spent the years 1853 to 1875 in America, was a passionate propagandist in favor of slavery; three of his sons fought in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_Army_46d5.html" title="Confederate States Army">Confederate Army</a>. On the other hand, his former close associate <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Francis_Meagher_34e1.html" title="Thomas Francis Meagher">Thomas Francis Meagher</a> served as a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier_General_8b0d.html#United_States" title="Brigadier General">Brigadier General</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church in America was centered in slaveholding Maryland, and, despite a firm stand for the spiritual equality of blacks, and the resounding condemnation of slavery by Pope Gregory XVI in his bull, <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Supremo_Apostolatus_845f.html" title="In Supremo Apostolatus">In Supremo Apostolatus</a> issued in 1839 continued in deeds,if not in public discourse, to support slaveholding interests. The Bishop of New York denounced O'Connell's petition as a forgery, and if genuine, unwarranted foreign interference; the Bishop of Charleston declared that, while Catholic tradition opposed slave trading, it had nothing against slavery. No American bishop supported abolition before the Civil War; even while that war went on, they freely communicated with slave-owners. One historian observed that ritualist churches separate themselves from heretics rather than sinners; he observes the same acceptance of slavery among the Episcopalians and the Lutherans.

<p>After O'Connell's failure, the American Repeal Associations broke up; but the Garrisonians rarely relapsed into the "bitter hostility" of American Protestants towards the Roman Church. Some antislavery men joined the <a href="../../../k/n/o/Know_Nothings_3f6c.html" title="Know Nothings">Know Nothings</a>, in the collapse of the parties; but Edmund Quincy ridiculed it as a mushroom growth, a distraction from the real issues; and although the Know-Nothing legislature of Massachusetts honored Garrison, he continued to oppose them as violators of fundamental rights to freedom of worship.</p>
<p>Even the evangelical Protestants <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Lloyd_Garrison_1e12.html" title="William Lloyd Garrison">William Lloyd Garrison</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Brown_aa28.html" title="John Brown">John Brown</a>, however, regarded the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence_f3f2.html" title="United States Declaration of Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a> as being as important as the Bible. In 1854, Garrison wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a believer in that portion of the Declaration of American Independence in which it is set forth, as among self-evident truths, "that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Hence, I am an abolitionist. Hence, I cannot but regard oppression in every form – and most of all, that which turns a man into a thing – with indignation and abhorrence. Not to cherish these feelings would be recreancy to principle. They who desire me to be dumb on the subject of slavery, unless I will open my mouth in its defense, ask me to give the lie to my professions, to degrade my manhood, and to stain my soul. I will not be a liar, a poltroon, or a hypocrite, to accommodate any party, to gratify any sect, to escape any odium or peril, to save any interest, to preserve any institution, or to promote any object. Convince me that one man may rightfully make another man his slave, and I will no longer subscribe to the Declaration of Independence. Convince me that liberty is not the inalienable birthright of every human being, of whatever complexion or clime, and I will give that instrument to the consuming fire. I do not know how to espouse freedom and slavery together.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

In <i>The Struggle for Equality</i>, historian James M. McPherson defines an abolitionist "as one who before the Civil War in the Untied States had agitated for the immediate, unconditional, and total abolition of slavery in the United States."
</pre>
<p>Although there were several groups that opposed slavery (such as the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_for_the_Relief_of_Free_Negroes_Unlawfully_Held_in_Bondage_47b8.html" title="Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage">Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage</a>), at the time of the founding of the Republic, there were few states which prohibited slavery outright. The Constitution had several provisions which accommodated slavery, although none used the word.</p>
<p>American abolitionism began very early, well before the United States were formed as a nation. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Sewall_702f.html" title="Samuel Sewall">Samuel Sewall</a>, a prominent Bostonian and one of the judges at the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salem_Witch_Trials_65f2.html" title="Salem Witch Trials">Salem Witch Trials</a>, wrote <a href="http://www.masshist.org/objects/2004september.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.masshist.org/objects/2004september.cfm" rel="nofollow">The Selling of Joseph</a> in protest of the widening practice of outright slavery as opposed to indentured servitude in the colonies. This is the earliest-recorded anti-slavery tract published in the future United States.</p>
<p>Abolitionists included those who joined the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Anti-Slavery_Society_7d8e.html" title="American Anti-Slavery Society">American Anti-Slavery Society</a> or its auxiliary groups in the 1830s and 1840s as the movement fragmented.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> The fragmented anti-slavery movement included groups such as the Libery party; the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society; the American Missionary Association; and the Church Anti-Slavery Society. McPherson describes three types of abolitionists prior to the war between the states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the ideological spectrum, from immediate abolition on the Left to conservative antislavery on the Right, it is&#160;:often hard to tell where "abolition" (which demanded unconditional emancipation and usually envisaged civil&#160;:equality for the free slaves.) ended and "antislavery" or "free soil" (which desired only the containment of&#160;:slavery and was ambivalent on the question of equality) began. In <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a> particularly, many free&#160;:soilers were abolitionists at heart; in the mid-Atlantic states and even more in the old Northwest, political&#160;:abolitionists tended to submerge their abolitionist identity in the broader but shallower stream of free soil.</dd>
</dl>
<p>All of the states north of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> began gradually to abolish slavery between 1781 and 1804; all the states abolished or severely limited the slave trade, <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhode_Island_988e.html" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a> in 1774 (<a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> had also attempted to do so before the Revolution, but the Privy Council had vetoed the act), all the others by 1786, Georgia in 1798. These northern emancipation acts typically provided that slaves born before the law was passed would be freed at a certain age, and so remnants of slavery lingered; in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, a dozen "permanent apprentices" were recorded in the 1860 census. The first state to abolish slavery outright was Pennsylvania in 1780.</p>
<p>The institution remained solid in the South, however, and that region's customs and social beliefs evolved into a strident defense of slavery in response to the rise of a stronger anti-slavery stance in the North. The anti-slavery sentiment, which existed before 1830 among many people in the North, was joined after 1840 by the vocal few of the abolitionist movement. The majority of Northerners rejected the extreme positions of the abolitionists; <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, for example. Indeed many northern leaders including Lincoln, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Douglas_c88f.html" title="Stephen Douglas">Stephen Douglas</a> (the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic</a> nominee in 1860), <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_C._Fremont_454b.html" title="John C. Fremont">John C. Fremont</a> (the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> nominee in 1856), and <a href="../../../u/l/y/Ulysses_S._Grant_1b52.html" title="Ulysses S. Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> married into slave owning southern families without any moral qualms.</p>
<p>Abolitionism as a principle was far more than just the wish to limit the extent of slavery. Most Northerners recognized that slavery existed in the South and the Constitution did not allow the federal government to intervene there. Most Northerners favored a policy of gradual and compensated emancipation. After 1849 abolitionists rejected this and demanded it end immediately and everywhere. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Brown_%28abolitionist%29_519b.html" title="John Brown (abolitionist)">John Brown</a> was the only abolitionist known to have actually planned a violent insurrection, though <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Walker_%28abolitionist%29_5f1c.html" title="David Walker (abolitionist)">David Walker</a> promoted the idea. The abolitionist movement was strengthened by the activities of free <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-Americans_ce19.html" title="African-Americans">African-Americans</a>, especially in the black church, who argued that the old Biblical justifications for slavery contradicted the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>. African-American activists and their writings were rarely heard outside the black community; however, they were tremendously influential to some sympathetic whites, most prominently the first white activist to reach prominence, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Lloyd_Garrison_1e12.html" title="William Lloyd Garrison">William Lloyd Garrison</a>, who was its most effective propagandist. Garrison's efforts to recruit eloquent spokesmen led to the discovery of ex-slave <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Douglass_7ab5.html" title="Frederick Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>, who eventually became a prominent activist in his own right. Eventually, Douglass would publish his own, widely distributed abolitionist newspaper, the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Star_%28newspaper%29_4432.html" title="North Star (newspaper)"><i>North Star</i></a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1850s, the American abolitionist movement split into two camps over the issue of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Constitution_b784.html" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>. This issue arose in the late 1840s after the publication of <i>The Unconstitutionality of Slavery</i> by <a href="../../../l/y/s/Lysander_Spooner_53a2.html" title="Lysander Spooner">Lysander Spooner</a>. The Garrisonians, led by Garrison and <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendell_Phillips_a126.html" title="Wendell Phillips">Wendell Phillips</a>, publicly burned copies of the Constitution, called it a pact with slavery, and demanded its abolition and replacement. Another camp, led by <a href="../../../l/y/s/Lysander_Spooner_53a2.html" title="Lysander Spooner">Lysander Spooner</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerrit_Smith_addd.html" title="Gerrit Smith">Gerrit Smith</a>, and eventually Douglass, considered the Constitution to be an antislavery document. Using an argument based upon <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_Law_c1a6.html" title="Natural Law">Natural Law</a> and a form of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_contract.html" title="Social contract">social contract</a> theory, they said that slavery existed outside of the Constitution's scope of legitimate authority and therefore should be abolished.</p>
<p>Another split in the abolitionist movement was along <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_class.html" title="Social class">class</a> lines. The artisan republicanism of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Dale_Owen_af0b.html" title="Robert Dale Owen">Robert Dale Owen</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frances_Wright_76a4.html" title="Frances Wright">Frances Wright</a> stood in stark contrast to the politics of prominent elite abolitionists such as industrialist <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Tappan_99a2.html" title="Arthur Tappan">Arthur Tappan</a> and his evangelist brother <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Tappan_9ce5.html" title="Lewis Tappan">Lewis</a>. While the former pair opposed slavery on a basis of solidarity of "wage slaves" with "chattel slaves", the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whig_Party_%28United_States%29_806f.html" title="Whig Party (United States)">Whiggish</a> Tappans strongly rejected this view, opposing the characterization of Northern workers as "slaves" in any sense. (Lott, 129-130)</p>
<p>Many American abolitionists took an active role in opposing slavery by supporting the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underground_Railroad_7d7b.html" title="Underground Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>. This was made illegal by the federal <a href="../../../f/u/g/Fugitive_Slave_Law_of_1850_9fb4.html" title="Fugitive Slave Law of 1850">Fugitive Slave Law of 1850</a>, but participants like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harriet_Tubman_fd00.html" title="Harriet Tubman">Harriet Tubman</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Highland_Garnet_5340.html" title="Henry Highland Garnet">Henry Highland Garnet</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Crummell_6eef.html" title="Alexander Crummell">Alexander Crummell</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amos_No%C3%AB_Freeman_cd4e.html" title="Amos Noë Freeman">Amos Noë Freeman</a> and others continued regardless with the final destination for slaves moved to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. Two significant events in the struggle to destroy slavery were the <a href="../../../o/b/e/Oberlin-Wellington_Rescue_d40b.html" title="Oberlin-Wellington Rescue">Oberlin-Wellington Rescue</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Brown_%28abolitionist%29_519b.html" title="John Brown (abolitionist)">John Brown</a>'s raid on <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harpers_Ferry_eb07.html" title="Harpers Ferry">Harpers Ferry</a>.</p>
<p>After the issuance of the <a href="../../../e/m/a/Emancipation_Proclamation_d12b.html" title="Emancipation Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>, abolitionists continued to pursue the freedom of slaves in the remaining <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slave_state.html" title="Slave state">slave states</a>, and to better the conditions of black Americans generally. The passage of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_7b97.html" title="Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a> in 1865 officially ended slavery.</p>

<p>Although outlawed in most countries today — with the notable exception of <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauritania.html" title="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>, where it is still practised publicly — slavery is, nonetheless, practiced <i>in secret</i> in many parts of the world, with outright enslavement still taking place in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia.</p>
<p>There are three general types of slavery today: wage slaves, contract slaves, and slaves in the traditional sense.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../w/a/g/Wage_slavery.html" title="Wage slavery">Wage slavery</a></b> is most common in underdeveloped areas, where employers can afford to employ people at low wages, knowing they can't afford to risk their employment. Most child laborers can be considered to be wage slaves.</li>
<li><b>Contract slaves</b> are generally poor, often illiterate, people who have been tricked into signing contracts they do not understand.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">Slavery</a> in its traditional sense</b> is still very active; only its activities are carried out underground. Actual slavery is still carried out much the same way it has been for centuries: people, often women and children, are abducted (usually from an underdeveloped country such as in the Middle East, South America, Africa and the former Soviet Bloc countries), loaded aboard a ship and smuggled to a foreign country (usually Asia or the Middle East) and they are sold, the men and male children sold for labor, while the women and girls for domestic slavery or to work as unwilling prostitutes primarily in the West.</li>

<p>Slavery still exists today all across the world. Groups such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Slavery_International_492c.html" title="Anti-Slavery International">Anti-Slavery International</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_the_Slaves_3268.html" title="Free the Slaves">Free the Slaves</a> continue to campaign to rid the world of slavery.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_10.html" title="December 10">December 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_General_Assembly_e5b8.html" title="United Nations General Assembly">General Assembly</a> of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> adopted the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights_2e89.html" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. Article 4 states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Since 1997, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Justice_619c.html" title="United States Department of Justice">United States Department of Justice</a> has, through work with the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_of_Immokalee_Workers_da2b.html" title="Coalition of Immokalee Workers">Coalition of Immokalee Workers</a>, prosecuted six individuals on charges of slavery in the agricultural industry. These prosecutions have led to freedom for over 1000 slaves in the tomato and orange fields of South Florida.</p>
<p>This is only one example of the contemporary fight against slavery worldwide, which is especially pervasive in agriculture, apparel and the sex industry.</p>
<p>In the contemporary United States, the mantle of "abolitionist" has been widely embraced by those who seek to abolish the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> and those advocating immigration rights.</p>

<p>The abolitionist movements and the abolition of slavery has been commemorated in different ways around the world in modern times. The United Nations General Assembly declared 2004 the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Year_to_Commemorate_the_Struggle_against_Slavery_and_its_Abolition_1420.html" title="International Year to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and its Abolition">International Year to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and its Abolition</a>. This proclamation marked the bicentenary of the birth of the first black state, Haiti. Numerous exhibitions, events and research programmes were connected to the initiative.</p>
