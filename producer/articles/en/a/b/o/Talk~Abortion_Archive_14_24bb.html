<p>Awp! Jesus joseph and mary, (I just saw God and I think he was driving a Cadilac) we need to archive badly. We've got duplicate sections (my fault). Could everyone run through discussions they were recently indovled in and sign them offas closed? As for those being duplicated, those most recently involved, could they please collapse them into a single new section? Thanks!--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 04:57, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The page is huge, indeed. our, uh, conflict with the vote had much to do - on my part - with the fact that there were *three* separate places that it was being discussed/voted upon, on this one discussion page. i, er, 'vote' that at minimum, all the 'article move' discussion be archived, and that discussion start fresh. (mind you, i know precisely zero about the archiving process, so i don't know what is or is not possible or appropriate). cheers. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 05:02, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What about archiving everything, putting in section headers for current discussions (Fetal pain, Should we move? Mental health, Herbal abortion - those are the ones I see as currently active, and if someone wants to continue or re-open a topic they can certainly do so) with a brief statement starting the section saying "Archived discussion about this can be found 'here' and 'here' with links to the relevent parts of the archive? Simple enough to do. Keep the "To-do" list at top. For the Should we move? section put in Anastrophe's summary, with the additions of the others who voted in the Standing vote section. If anyone wants to change their position, they can edit and add a comment at the bottom: "Changed vote from No to Yes because (reason) (sig w/timestamp.)" I have posted some sources which have not been used or commented on, but I can re-paste them in Sources or the relevent section. Sound reasonable? <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 11:58, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>good idea. i would also recommend - something i've noticed is endemic to WP and i think is a shortcoming of the design (aside from the fact that users must do their own 'threading' by adding colons ahead of their entries) - i wonder if it might not be a good idea, at the top of the discussion page, to simply suggest "when starting new discussion about a new topic, please begin that section at the BOTTOM of this page". i don't know the etiquette of it, so if i'm off base, no problem. it just seems to me that info should flow downward rather than upward or in the middle. WRT to 'should we move' etc discussion and votes, i would recommend that it simply start fresh, again, and keep it all in one place. i've noted above my concern about the discussion being broken up amongst three separate areas of the one discussion page. those who wish to vote again may do so, and we'll leave it at that - skip any reproduction of previous votes, as it is a _process_ rather than an up-or-down vote as tznkai pointed out. just my 3.1415926535897932384626 cents.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 19:23, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Always add new topic to the <i>end</i> of the page. No need to add a notice to the Talk page here, simply move new entries to the end and remind the editor to do that next time.

<p>Hey everyone. Just a reminder -- Remeber to tag a vandal's talk page when reverting vandalism. Add the warning tags (such as {{subst:test}}, {{subst:test2}}, {{subst:test3}}, {{subst:test4}}) on the vandal's talk page, in sequential order, after each instance of vandalism. Doing this assists administrators in determining whether or not the user should be blocked. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuasipalm_6524.html" title="User:Quasipalm">Quasipalm</a> 15:24, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is new to me, and I'm not sure I understand the instructions here. Suppose vandal 123456 gets reverted. I click on his number, and that takes me to a talk page, but it is not necessarily his unique talk page -- that number may be shared by other people who visited but did not log on. Anyway, I want to put a tag. Exactly what do I type if vandal 123456 has vandalized the article "Happy face" and I've reverted it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Updated poll results</span></h2>
<p>I added latest (Nov 2005) polling data from CNN/Gallup/USA Today. Limited the data to the general issue of whether abortion ought to be legal, rather than who identifies with the undefined terms "pro-choice" and "pro-life" as the use of those labels is a sub-debate within the larger debate about legality (previous data was from Aug 2005 and focused on undefined labels). <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Goodandevil</a> 21:43, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>These two polls are asking the same questions. In addition, the ABC News/Washington Post poll deals with the same theme — should abortion be "harder" or "easier" to obtain — and it is <i>newer.</i> There is no reason to include three polls investigating the same thing. The public opinion section is a <i>summary</i>; ballooning the U.S. section to thrice the length of Canada, Ireland, etc. is counter to the goal of brevity, not to mention counter to the goal of representing a world-wide view.

<dd>If "paring down" was your original goal, why include three nearly-identical polls? To stack the deck in your favour, perhaps? Then you insist upon adding patent POV nonsense like "liberal abortion laws" and "in all circumstances - the current law under Roe v. Wade" -- AFTER you were warned about NPOV, 3RR, and after the addition was moved to the page for discussion (and the formation of a consensus). There is no such thing as a one-person consensus.

<dd>I was the one who added this topic and explained my edits on the talk page. I only added things after you decided to selectively add data. The most recent data is also the most relevant in that it simply discusses when people think abortion should be legal. The man on the street has no idea what Roe v Wade is, so any poll asking about that sheds almost no light on his or her view of when it shold be legal. The most recent Gallup poll also notes a huge majority in favor specific notification restrictions, but I did not include that. However it belongs in this section just as much as the data you want included does. My point in the end is that the latest poll plus a link to other polls is all that is needed or helpful in this article. You have assumed bad faith from your very first comment about my edits. You also are the revert king tonight. And you did not even bother to look at the talk page or the content of the edits before qvetching.

<dd>Kyd, thanks for excluding me - but if I'm ever a problem let me know.</dd>
<dd>Goodandevil - it is considered good form to read the talk page prior to making major edits to an article, which you neglected to do. Kyd's point about going US_centric is well made - perhaps your additional data would be more appreciated there. As you can see from the "to do" list, this article is under considerable revision, and as you can see from the length of this talk page, a great deal of effort and discussion is going into each edit <i>prior</i> to its being placed on the article space. This article is inherently prone to POV edits, and the regular editors (and many of the passers-by) realize this and try to acheive consensus prior to making such fundamental changes. I suggest you follow this procedure yourself - if you have a specific edit you feel should be made, state it clearly, with your reasoning, and we'll be happy to incorporate it if consensus agrees. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 01:23, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I commend you to follow your own advice. I originally removed older CNN/Gallup data and replaced it with recent data, and pared back the US section even further, noting so on this talk page. Kyd did not like that, so Kyd reverted to the old Gallup data and reverted to the lengthier US section. It was only then (after Kyd made it clear that older data that Kyd favored had to be included) that I expanded the poll data for balance. I repeat: my goal was and remains to pare down the US section and only include the most relevant and recent date. My most recent edits have made the US section among the shortest of the bunch. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Goodandevil</a> 01:50, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good, this page is the result of much consensus and is currently in the process of undergoing a concerted rewrite. As such, and in light of the recent spate of random POV edits and pointless acts of vandalism, especially by anonymous IPs (and you, today, seem to have logged out accidently during the edit war), it's only natural that some users might adopt a zero-tolerance, "revert first, ask questions later" policy to supicious edits like this one: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion&amp;diff=29522961&amp;oldid=29522847" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion&amp;diff=29522961&amp;oldid=29522847" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. We're subjecting pretty much every edit we're making to extensive debate. The revision lumbers forward at a glacial, almost bureucratic pace, but it lumbers forward nonetheless.

<p>I am happy to agree to assume good faith - it makes play time more fun. I do have to say that the only difference betweena c-section and the Hysterotomy is the dead baby versus live baby part. Such a significant and ugly reality is never easy to state "neutrally" (funny how the dead baby would never consider being intentionally put to death as a neutral act) without dishonoring our species and common sense. But you note how quickly it was edited and euphemised so abortion supporters would not have to dwell on the ugliness of it all. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Goodandevil</a> 01:57, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK. Status quo is not the best way of describing it. The section was added the same day that it was removed. My point is that rather than discuss whether or not it was POV or how it could be improved, it was pulled with the edit summary along the lines of <i>per talk</i> - not <i>POV</i>. There was no <i>per talk</i> until after it was pulled and no discussion until after I asked where the discussion was.</dd>
<dd>Truth is, I'm not sure that it <i>can</i> be made NPOV, but I think it would have been (and still is) worth the effort. And, until there is general agreement that the subject of the section <i>is</i> POV, it should be left in...my opinion. --<a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EElliskev_d446.html" title="User:Elliskev">Elliskev</a> 22:16, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The JAMA study was rejected as a reliable source because two of its contributors had been or were in some way affiliated with Planned Parenthood. The sources for the fetal pain text submitted by Chooserr were 2/3 pro-life sites and 1/3 dead link. It is a simple matter of holding all sources to the same universal standard. It would be improper to allow unsubstantiated claims into the article under some fuzzy idea of grace. The <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burden_of_proof.html" title="Burden of proof">burden of proof</a> lies with the editor to prove his claims <i>before</i> he posts.

<dd>If the section remained, and a discussion regarding the verifiablity of the claims took place, I'd having nothing to say once it was removed. But, that didn't happen. Maybe a compromise could have been some language about conflicting studies, i.e. what <i>is</i> known. Instead, what happened happened and a few users were left with a pretty sour taste. --<a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EElliskev_d446.html" title="User:Elliskev">Elliskev</a> 00:21, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If someone posts something that is poorly-sourced, or borderline POV, you move it to the discussion page, and then see if anything can be salvaged from it. If it can, then you will be able to present readers with a completed, well-sourced product. In this manner, you preserve the quality of the article, while fostering community involvement. Can you imagine what the average level of quality on Wikipedia would be if we just let verifiability fly in the interest of not stepping on anyone's toes?

<p>This all seems irrelevant to me ... can a fetus feel pain? We're not sure. Can abortions be done in a manner such that pain is minimized? Yes. You can easily administer anesthetics in massive doses to the fetus (doesn't matter becuase the fetus is going to die anyway). And that way you guarantee it will be feeling no pain. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde</a> 08:28, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cyde-in many countries where abortion is federally/state funded, the question of whether or not to use aneasthetic comes down to dollars and cents; so of course one asks if it's necessary. And, it is definitely no secret, that the study of fetal pain and sensory perception relates to the study of fetal personhood and their subsequent rights.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Interestingly enough, in Roe vs. Wade, when one of Roe's lawyers stated that the matter of fetal personhood doesn't matter, because of the rights of the mother, one of the judges asked if the lawyer realized that this meant that a mother who felt a living child was detrimental to her health could kill her; the lawyer responded in the affirmative, but was cut off by another judge before she could finish her response. She declined to elaborate on her response upon further questioning. But the point remains - the study of fetal personhood is important to many, and if it is determined the fetus is a person with rights, then it would dramatically effect the status of abortions, as the reasoning of the judge is sound, and the lawyer's response would most likely fall apart in court. And thus many are interested in, and follow, research in this regard.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 07:15, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would prefer it be better sourced than an unidentified number of "doctors' reports" that "up to" 50 babies a year survive abortion. Two organizations have launched investigations - that should yield less questionable data. If we do include, we should include that the investigations are pending and include the +19 to 24 weeks gestation involved.

<dd>The hard data exists: some doctors have failed to kill fetuses as was their desire and there is currently enough evidence to form a government committee to investigate the concenrs that the Royal obstetrics society and others (who are officially or publicly on record as pro-abortion) have voiced. Hard data does exist and is why action is being taken. Even abortionists feel icky about this). From the article:</dd>
<dd><i>In August clinicians in Manchester published an analysis of 31 such babies born in northwest England between 1996 and 2001. “If a baby is born alive following a failed abortion and then dies (because of lack of care), you could potentially be charged with murder,” said Shantala Vadeyar, a consultant obstetrician at South Manchester University Hospitals NHS Trust, who led the study. A systematic investigation of data collected through the CEMACH indicated that there are at least 50 cases a year nationwide in which babies survive abortion attempts.</i></dd>

<dd>Information reported as fact by the Times of London (an ardently abortion-friendly paper)has already been fact-checked by professionals.

<dd>thanks much, that helps enormously - I'm not familiar with UK papers, and as abortion tends to be such a POV issue, I'm suspicious of any single-source data as disturbing as this.

<dd>I am not the person to start it off as I would definitely make some people unhappy. I think you have the basics. I suggest that the fetus becomes a baby or infant (all are medical terms) once outside the mom. Its absolutely POV (since it is medically incorrect, colloquially never done, and is a euphemistic practice seen only in the abortion industry and the heavily pro-abortion "mainstream" media outlets) to refer to the human as a fetus once it is living out side the womb. Give it a try and I will give you my opinion. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Goodandevil</a> 02:04, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think neonate would be the correct term - it describes a fetus within the first four weeks outside of the womb. So here we recognize ethical concerns (which is, after all, the reason for the investigations), and we stick to NPOV medical terminology (neonate instead of baby). Opinions? If for/against, please explain your reasoning.

<dd>My objections are mostly to violations of consensus - even if the seeming majority is only 2 to 1. It is stretching AGF to the limit for me when someone goes and reopens something that's been settled.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New fetal pain section</span></h2>
<p>Hello all. I have tried to provide a NPOV section on this very contentious issue to satisfy both sides - believe me, it's not easy&#160;:) Tell me what you think. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrisvegas_f939.html" title="User:Brisvegas">Brisvegas</a> 02:51, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here this the full text of Brisvegas' contribution:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The issue of when a fetus can feel pain is a highly divisive and keenly debated one. While scientists have acknowledged that a foetus can indeed feel physical pain<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_pain.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_pain.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, professional opinion is still divided as to when the foetus has the necessary sensory perception to experience pain. Several academics, usually those supporting abortion, contend that only once connections to the <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebral_cortex.html" title="Cerebral cortex">cerebral cortex</a> are made can the fetus experience pain; this usually occurs during the third trimester of the pregnancy, when only 1% of abortions are carried out. Other scientists, who mainly hold pro-life convictions, argue that a fetus can feel pain as early as 7 weeks, during the first trimester. The personal bias of many researchers is believed to influence their analysis of any experiments they undertake into the phenomenon. The topic has also been hotly debated by many politicians of both persuasions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Pain in an adult, child, newborn or late-term fetus originates as an electrical impulse in a body's <a href="../../../p/a/i/Pain_receptor.html" title="Pain receptor">pain receptors</a>. This signal is sent via nerve pathways to the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_column.html" title="Spinal column">spinal column</a>, and then to the <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thalamus.html" title="Thalamus">thalamus</a> - a part of the brain that relays signals from the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peripheral_nervous_system.html" title="Peripheral nervous system">peripheral nervous system</a> to the <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebral_cortex.html" title="Cerebral cortex">cerebral cortex</a>, where it is sensed as pain.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In a fetus, pain receptors develop around 7 weeks after conception; the spino-thalamic system at about 13 weeks. However, the connections to the cortex are established only after about 26 weeks into pregnancy. Most pro-life advocates believe that pain can be felt by the fetus when these systems are only partly formed. Most pro-choice advocates believe that only once all the connections between the receptors and brain can pain be felt - i.e. sometime after about 26 weeks into pregnancy.</dd>

<dd>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, Dr. Robert White, director of the Division of Neurosurgery and Brain Research Laboratory at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, gave testimony before the House Constitution Subcommittee of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_the_United_States_f5e4.html" title="Congress of the United States">Congress of the United States</a>. He stated that, at 20 weeks' gestation, the fetus "is fully capable of experiencing pain...Without question, all of this is a dreadfully painful experience for any infant subjected to such a surgical procedure."<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_pain.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_pain.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></dd>

One directs an abortion clinic at San Francisco Hospital, while the lead author undertook legal work with <a href="../../../n/a/r/NARAL_bea6.html" title="NARAL">NARAL</a>, an pro-choice group for six months.</dd>

<p>Kyd - "The impact of abortion upon the fetus is a matter of consideration among scientists and political activists." Not really - most agree the impact is that the fetus dies. I would put a smiley, but it just doesn't seem right. I would suggest new wording; "The physical and mental awareness of the fetus during abortion is a matter of consideration......," or "The experience of the fetus during abortion is a matter......." or something along those lines.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 07:01, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History of Abortion</span></h2>
<p>The term "respectable and scientific" profession of medical doctors was modified to "evolving." This was the same "scientific" community beginning to develop theories of eugenics, trying to "scientifically" prove inferiority of various races by said eugenics, etc., etc., etc. The community was evolving in its views, and endeavoring to be respectable and scientific - but that is no different from any other medical community going back to Greek and even Sumerian times. All sought to be scientific and respectable, based upon the definitions of their times. This seems to me a POV addition intended to make it seem like the prohibition of abortion was not based upon good intentions or scientific knowledge of the time, which is contrary to the case.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 05:19, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reverted the section to its original form. The addition was speculative and largely unsubstantiated. I've read theories like this before: medicalization in the 19th century was the result of male doctors fighting to supress the female herbalists and mid-wives, and, thus, was part of the greater pre-suffrage trend toward enforced patriarchy. It's an interesting approach, yes, but it also the sort of thing that demands a bona-fide source (<a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 16:10, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These are the next sections which need to be updated and properly sourced. Most of the current text under physical health seems good; however, it could use a bit of tweaking, in terms of clarity, and a few sources wouldn't hurt.</p>
<p>There is currently no information on the elevated level of risk associated with illegal and/or unsanitary abortion. Chihuahua produced a number of sources on the subject above (see the thread "Change to 'Health Risks'"). She also produced two sources on the mortality rates of abortion: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5103a1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5103a1.htm" rel="nofollow">Abortion Surveillance</a> and <a href="http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/reduction_of_maternal_mortality/e_rmm.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/reduction_of_maternal_mortality/e_rmm.pdf" rel="nofollow">WHO: Reduction of Maternal Mortality</a>.</p>

<dd>Yes, that's better. "Theory" was a poor choice of word.

<dd>The term "causal relationship" is indispensible. We need to note that this hypothesis does not merely posit an association, or correlation, between the two, but rather that it seeks to establish that induced abortion (and, thus, miscarriage) are a <i>cause</i> of breast cancer. A thorough reading of Carl Sagan, and ilk, has driven home in me the important difference between correlation and causation. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 02:37, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Elective_abortion" id="Elective_abortion"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Elective abortion</span></h2>
<p>I am moving this to discussion for the time being. What follows is a rather lengthy rationale for my recent reversions.</p>
<p>Goodandevil believes we should divide the AGI statistics into "elective" and "therapeutic." This was defended in the edit logs as "follow[ing] the NPOV definition in the article." Here are the <i>actual</i> definitions from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Therapeutic abortion:</i> An abortion performed because the pregnancy poses physical or <b>mental health risk</b> to the pregnant woman."</dd>
<dd>"<i>Elective abortion:</i> An abortion performed for any other reason."</dd>
</dl>
<p>See the words that I've bolded? It's called a loophole. It means that all of the things that Goodandevil classified as "elective" could fall under this article's definition of "therapeutic" (the current definitions, for what it's worth, seem to be mutually contradictory, which is something we might want to address in the article overhaul).</p>
<p>It is unhelpful, unencyclopedic, and POV to "lump" statistics together in a conclusive manner. Elective abortion, in the context of this article, should refer to any abortion that is not forced or coerced (such as under China's one-child policy or forced abortions on disabled women). Beyond this, it is not our place to define what is or what is not an "elective abortion." Some would classify abortions in the case of rape or incest as being "elective" (i.e., the abortion wasn't medically necessitated and thus having it was a matter of choice); others would classify abortions for social indications as being "therapeutic" (i.e., negative circumstances in the woman's life necessitate the relief of a therapeutic abortion). The simplest solution, then, is to just present the numbers without drawing conclusions for the reader.</p>
<p>The following text has also been removed for discussion:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In developed industrialized nations, abortion is overwhlemingly an elective procedure (for example, 98% of the abortions in the U.S. are "elective", while 2% are considered "therapeutic")." <a href="http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The article cited is an aggregation of abortion statistics filtered through a biased lens (Read the article. "Extreme," "convenience," etc., etc.). Johnston concludes that abortions for social indications are "elective" and thus we have the the 98%/2% figures. As helpful as the Johnston archive might be, otherwise, a "statistic" is based upon his <i>opinion</i>, and not <i>fact</i>, isn't very helpful to the article. The "statistic" could even be changed if we adjusted our definition. If no abortion other than one to preserve the life of the woman is to be considered therapeutic, then 99.8% would be elective; if any reason for having an abortion could, in some way, be considered therapeutic, the number becomes 100%. If we want to include data on reasons for abortion in the U.S., it would be better to consult the primary sources.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">to add to the "to do" list...</span></h2>
<p>I don't know how this got dropped, but it still needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>In short, a lengthy debate occured a while back about changing the introductory sentence to the following:</p>
<p>An abortion is the termination of a pregnancy associated with the death of an unborn human being (known as an embryo or a fetus).</p>
<p>The reasoning included a few points, a few of which were:</p>
<p>- If you're talking to an average person, which of these two do you think is the best way to describe an action. "Let's juxtapose orbicular muscles and have a reciprocal transmission of carbon dioxide and microbes". OR, "Let's kiss". The average person is going to say "wtf did you just say?" if you choose the former. And that same thing happens when they read the first sentence of this article. The average person does not understand (when we're talking about a human pregnancy) that embryo/fetus means human being.</p>
<p>- Many testimonies of women who have undergone abortion did not understand that the embryo/fetus inside them was in fact a distinct, unique human being, and not simply a lump of tissue. They did not understand that when the doctor said it was an embryo/fetus, that meant it was a human being. And, unfortunately, in some cases, doctors and abortion clinics have outright said to a woman "it is just a lump of tissue, nothing more", when in fact that is not the case. And as these women find out that it was a human being, many of these women have horrible mental problems, and some have even committed suicide. A short three words in the definition of abortion could have prevented these problems if these women had seen that definition prior to their abortion. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Barwick (<a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarwick_0039.html" title="User talk:Barwick">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Barwick_56cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Barwick">contribs</a>) 13 December 2005.</small></p>

<dd>Barwick 06:16, 14 December 2005 (UTC) No, once again, you find me a scientist that will dispute the FACT that a fertilized human egg and sperm is in fact a human being. And if by chance you can find a respectable scientist who'll do that, then you tell me what that "thing" is. It's not a fish, it's not a snake, it's not a frog, it's not a bacteria, it's a human being, and nothing else. Simply in a different stage of development from my two-year old daughter, and a different stage from you and I.</dd>

<dd>Barwick 06:16, 14 December 2005 (UTC) No, it IS still a serious issue on the table. It is not an "unproductive distraction", it got tabled because people on here couldn't face the facts that were presented, and instead started personal attacks against me, which led to it being moved to the archives.</dd>
<dd>The simple fact is this: Wikipedia isn't a medical journal, it isn't a scientific journal, it isn't an engineering spec sheet, it is a webpage that is read by the average joe. And time and time again it has been shown that the average joe does not understand that an embryo or fetus is in fact a human being, as opposed to "just a lump of tissue" as they've been told. And just as my example where I've said the same thing by saying "Let's juxtapose our orbicular muscles and have a reciprocal transmission of carbon dioxide and microbes" and saying "Let's kiss", the simple fact remains that both are scientifically correct, but only ONE is going to be both easily understood AND scientifically correct.</dd>

<dd>What are you talking about? You STILL haven't answered the question, if it isn't a human being, then WHAT is it? I've already stated it's not a snake, and it's not a bird, nor is it some sort of bacteria, so it must be human of some sort. And it is not simply "human life", for my liver is "human life", and every cell in my body is "human life" but is not "me" on its own. The "fetus/embryo" is "itself" completely unto itself. Unlike my left kidney which needs the rest of me to form "me" (and I can still be all "me" without my left kidney), a "fetus/embryo" is still completely "itself" without the addition of anything else to it, it therefore is in fact more than just "human life". It is a human being, completely unto itself, wholly separate from its mother and father, except to give it care (just like my two year old daughter requires our care).

<p>No, you're missing the point. The point is, very few people realize that when we're discussing human abortion, a fetus/embryo is a human being. The majority of people out there, if asked "Scientifically, what is an embryo 1 week into pregnancy", and given a multiple choice question, would respond "mass of tissue". This is in fact NOT true, and summarizing the definition of the two to say "human being" would clear this matter up quickly and without complication. Barwick 18:33, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

And (here's where I come in with POV) YOU are the one being POV in demanding that it not be placed in the article, lest some women realize the truth and begin to oppose abortion on the basis that it isn't just a "lump of tissue" like they've been told (aka lied to about) before. It's the simple truth, there is a concerted effort out there to present abortion as "not killing a human, but just preventing a lump of tissue from developing into a human", to make it so their consciences can accept abortion.

Are you aware that a human embryo and a starfish embryo (for example) are essentially the same thing (both exhibit O3 symmetry) early in their development? It is only when the human embryo develops a trunk and head (moving to O2 symmetry) and the starfish begins to develop "arm" buds (moving to S5 symmetry) that the difference can be seen. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 14:40, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>People for the last couple decades have been describing a "fetus" and "embryo" as "just a bunch of tissue". Because of this, the average man and woman out on the street THINKS that a fetus or embryo is "just a bunch of tissue", or "part of its mother" as opposed to a wholly unique human being. Unlike anyone else that's ever existed on this planet, and unlike anyone else that ever will exist on this planet. This article does NOT get that point across, and I've presented an EASY way to present that fact. Two words. Extremely simple and extremely effective. Barwick 22:22, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The average person on here comes in with pre-conceptions about a topic</li>
<li>The average person on here doesn't follow every link to get a more in-depth understanding of the topic, ESPCIALLY when they THINK they know about something already.</li>
<li>The average person THINKS that they know what an embryo or fetus is, and they think it is a "lump of tissue that will develop into a human being". They do NOT know the fact that it is "a wholly unique individual, solely in a different stage of development from you and I". The latter is the more accurate description, and the easiest way to sum that up is to say "an abortion is the termination of a pregnancy associated with the death of an unborn human being (referred to as an embryo or fetus)".</li>
<li>The average person believes a fetus or embryo is NOT yet human, because that's what they've been told. Wikipedia NEEDS to clear this up, and only calling it a "fetus" or "embryo" is ok for a medical journal, but NOT for an Encyclopedia that the average Joe comes to to learn at.

<dd>Barwick, I understand your point perfectly, but you seem to have missed mine. The first line, which you have a problem with, states that "an abortion is the termination of a pregnancy associated with the death of an embryo or a fetus." This means the embryo or fetus of <i>any animal</i>. I also included this sentence before, but you chose to ignore it: "Any female mammal can experience abortion, however this article focuses exclusively on abortion in women." You can't change "embryo or fetus" in the opening sentence to "human being" because that would be an incorrect definition on that point alone, regardless of whether you view a <i>human</i> embryo to be equivalent to a <i>human</i> being. The later sentence makes it clear that this article deals with abortion in women, but the opening sentence has to stay as is to be an accurate definition: <i>any</i> embryo or fetus from <i>any</i> mammal can be aborted. I understand that you fervently believe it to be a <i>fact</i> that embryo = human, but many editors have said that they see that as merely an opinion. Maybe you should look a little deeper into it. -<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParallel_or_Together__1f4b.html" title="User:Parallel or Together?">Parallel</a> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParallel_or_Together__26d2.html" title="User talk:Parallel or Together?">or Together</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parallel_or_Together__f6e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parallel or Together?">?</a> 04:50, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A survey is being taken right now as to what people believe a fetus or embryo is, and so far the results have come back as 68.14% stating that a fetus or embryo is "not human". The survey is as follows:</dd>
<dd>Without referring to any other reference (if someone walked up to you on the street, how would you respond?), please answer the following question:</dd>
<dd>Scientifically (not morally), what is a fetus or embryo?
<ul>
<li>A - A collection of tissue, not a human (40.9%)</li>
<li>B - A collection of tissue, somewhat similar to a human (4.54%)</li>
<li>C - A collection of tissue, very much like a human, but not yet a human (22.7%)</li>
<li>D - A collection of tissue, wholly human (31.8%)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>While not a scientifically perfect survey, I think it gives some basic proof that the average person (more than 2 out of every 3 people) believes that a fetus or embryo is not a human. I think this is strong evidence to suggest that the average person has a massive misunderstanding. And so, can we please, FINALLY come to a consensus as to how to modify the first sentence to properly summarize what a fetus or embryo is?</dd>
<dd>As I understand, people mostly just have an issue with the word "being", as opposed to just "human". I think the word "being" belongs in there, others don't, claiming that it represents personhood. I disagree with their statement there, but at any rate, I think we can reach a compromise on modifying the first sentence here, what do you think Tznkai? Although I strongly disagree with it, perhaps we just drop the word "being", and go with the modified sentence "Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy associated with the death of an unborn human <s>being</s>, referred to as an embryo or fetus." This will clear up any confusion a reader (&gt;2/3 of readers) might come in here with, and is very clear, concise, and simple to understand.</dd>

<p>The statistics in the "Induced Abortions" section are misleading.</p>
<p>It lists "Rape, Incest, Other" as 2.1% of all abortions, which is VERY misleading.</p>
<p>The fact is, less than 1/2% (.5%) of all abortions are done for rape/incest combined.</p>
<p>This should be fixed, as it is VERY misleading.</p>
<p>I'm not even going to go into the breakdown of "fetal problems" and "threats to mother's health", but considering *anything* qualifies as "health problems", suffice to say that in most of those circumstances, the life of the mother (or child) is nowhere near in danger, but rather her "well-feeling" is in danger. I've even personally witnessed a woman who had her 4-5 year old son standing right next to her and when asked if she had any other children, she replied "Oh no, I didn't want to go through that [pregnancy] again". A "qualified" reason to list "mother's health" as an abortion.</p>
<p>At any rate, the breakdown needs to show: Rape/Incest: &lt; .5%, and "Other" 1.6%.</p>

<p>0.5% plus 1.6% is 2.1%. This isn't misleading: it is, at worst, a case of the "lumping" of two small-percentage statistics. If clarification is in order, fine, as the article is currently undergoing a revision, and we're scrutinizing all of its sources. As for the anecdote, <i>non sequitur</i>. I find many, if not more, "selfish" reasons for having children than for not (I've witnessed a man say, "I hope it's a boy this time," in front of his expectant wife and three daughters).

<dd>Barwick 06:26, 14 December 2005 (UTC)It is misleading, because one of the most common defenses I hear for abortion is "well, they are done a lot because of incest or rape". Lumping "Incest, Rape, and Other" together actually QUADRUPLES the apparent number of abortions that are done for Incest or Rape. It is misleading, and "other" is ALWAYS cited as its own number, and never with something else. It is a simple way to misrepersent findings. If rape/incest is such a small percentage, than it is simply included in "other" without any mention, OR it is presented as its own data. Heck, I could find one person who had an abortion because her mom had green hair that told her to do it, and present that as .0001% of the surveyed population, combine it with "other" and have 2% of the people who got abortions for the reason: "Mother had green hair/Other". Is that TRULY representative of the reasons women got an abortion?"</dd>
<dd>Clumping rape/incest together with "other" simply inflates the statistics to make it look like rape/incest is a common reason for abortion, when in fact it is not, and that needs to be stated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This .5% figure doesn't come from the same study as the rest of the figures. You cannot just mix and match the statistics like that - I'm guessing that the .5% number comes from your 1988 source, and it would be (statistically) wrong to subtract it from the "rape/incest/other" category of a completely different 1998 study. If you find another accurate and recent source that you feel better represents the latest data, then you bring that complete set here and we can discuss it. -<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParallel_or_Together__1f4b.html" title="User:Parallel or Together?">Parallel</a> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParallel_or_Together__26d2.html" title="User talk:Parallel or Together?">or Together</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parallel_or_Together__f6e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parallel or Together?">?</a> 06:50, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Barwick 17:05, 14 December 2005 (UTC) In response to the request by Parellel or Together, here is the complete results of that survey: The study is cited below the link, the original table is linked to below, and look at the 2004 survey results (there's an 1987 which showed 0.4% - 1.3% as a range of uncertainty based on extrapolated data from a 1998 report, and a 2004 survey also):</p>

<p>Finer, Lawrence B., Lori F. Frohwirth, Lindsay A. Dauphinee, Susheela Singh, and Ann M. Moore, "Reasons U.S. Women Have Abortions: Quantitative and Qualitative Perspectives," Sept. 2005, Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, 37(3):110-118, on line at AGI <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3711005.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3711005.pdf" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.</p>
<p>While the focus on here is on rape and incest, it should also be known (although I don't know how to represent this in statistics) that the "mother's health" includes what she believes may be perceived physical or mental problems she may have, however unlikely they are to occur. But like I said, I don't know how we can represent that unless we fund a study ourselves to differentiate between the reasons. And in the case of "possible fetal health problems", while that is sometimes given as a reason, it has been documented (and I know women who've gone through this) where at the slightest sign of anything not being 100% correct, the doctor actually encourages a woman to think about abortion because the baby "might have a health problem", when in fact there are no problems at all with the child. Basically, there was no verified health problem, but the doctor recommended it anyhow. Again, I don't know how to represent THAT one in statistics, it's hard to track down except by personal experiences.</p>

<dd>Barwick, if you could, please sign at the end of your comments, it makes it easier to read. If the last bit about doctor encouragement is true (and I myself am skeptical) there should be some data on it somewhere. If so, its definatly a valuable contribution to both the main and debate articles. However, we need *hard* research, at the very least a reputable collection of anecdotes numbering in the hundreds, if not thousands. This is a very strong claim, and needs to be supported vigerously.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 17:14, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Do a search for more, I didn't search very hard, I guarantee there's many more out there like that, it's not an uncommon thing, considering one lady I know very well has had a similar testimony, and if she wasn't pro-life, she might have consented to the abortion and thought nothing of it, never realizing her baby was perfectly fine, THAT is why it is hard to find statistics on it, especially without looking at pro-life sources.

<dd>The fact alone that one of the testimonies is in an HTML file titled "Babies Not Slaughtered" should sound your alarm bells, Tznkai. If you look at it, you'll find that it's on an anti-abortion site, Abortion TV, which also hosts shock pictures. The last anecdote is delivered 2/3rds of the way into what is actually a pro-life essay. Anecdotes, in and of themselves, are insufficient as a form of evidence. Any scientist will tell you this. So, perhaps, it would be better to look for sources in the forms of news articles or court documents. I know there are legal precedents for the claim of wrongful abortion. In fact, there's already an article on the subject here on Wikipedia: <a href="../../../w/r/o/Wrongful_abortion.html" title="Wrongful abortion">wrongful abortion</a>. It has been tagged for clean-up for the past four months. Here is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wrongful_abortion&amp;oldid=23144287" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wrongful_abortion&amp;oldid=23144287" rel="nofollow">revision</a> I did, which didn't satisfy the article's masters, but has some good, accessible sources nonetheless. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 02:39, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's going to be extremely difficult to find a court case on when a doctor wrongly suggested an abortion, for the reasons described above, and from a site that isn't pro-life, and I'll recount them here:
<ul>
<li>A person who isn't pro-life is much less likely to oppose the doctor's recommendation that they have an abortion, and therefore they are much less likely to go through with the pregnancy, which is the only way women find out that there was nothing wrong with their child in the first place.</li>
<li>A woman who is pro-life and goes through with the pregnancy (against the doctor's recommendation) dosn't have any case in court, becuase the doctor never did anything to harm her or her child (at least not physically). Many women have documented that they considered a lawsuit against the doctor, only to find out from the lawyers they were seeking for advice, that they couldn't win the case since nothing was done. Barwick 22:27, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You're making sweeping generalizations about human nature that are in no way pertinent to the article. Are we seeking to document the phenonmenon of wrongful abortion, or aren't we? As for court cases: Baker v. Gordon, 759 S.W.2d 87 (Mo. Ct. App. 1988), Johnson v. United States, 810 F. Supp. 7 (D.D.C. 1993), Breyne v. Potter, 574 S.E.2d 916 (Ga. Ct. App. 2002), Martinez v.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">New statistics paragraph</span></h3>
<p>I'm bracketing off a new subsection to work on a revised statistics section. Scanning over the AGI study <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3711005.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3711005.pdf" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, I noticed that we've managed to spectacularly fail in mentioning that there are multiple reasons that women choose to get an abortion. Unfortunatly, as always the statistics focus on US, but those are still notable and are the most up to date statistics we seem to have found.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 17:24, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. Thanks Barwick for bringing that study up! I think it is way too US-specific to be included as the only information (in other words, I'd like the statistics already in the article to stay), but the information is definitely good - it is recent and it is notable. I agree that it should be included in the article in some form or another. -<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParallel_or_Together__1f4b.html" title="User:Parallel or Together?">Parallel</a> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParallel_or_Together__26d2.html" title="User talk:Parallel or Together?">or Together</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parallel_or_Together__f6e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parallel or Together?">?</a> 00:20, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Stats and Biased Sources in General</span></h2>
<p>1. There does need to be a better presentation of this data.</p>
<p>2. Because "Rape" or "Incest" are often red flags used to garner support for legal abortion, it is important to give accurate data and not lump the information in with other categories. Rape or incest very rarely the reason for abortion, and this article ought to be clear about that. Lumping it in with unddefined "other" is not beneficial to the reader's understanding of this issue.</p>
<p>3. Similarly, a chart showing global data and data for selected countries would be helpful to show that reasons can vary by country.</p>
<p>4. <b>Barwick</b>, welcome aboard. The prevailing bias in the English speaking wiki-world is definitely to love abortion. That bias is apparent amongst most who edit this article, and as such any neutral presentation of information is (very biasedly) categorized as having a pro-life bias. Having said that, pro-life people also need to ensure they are truly opting to present factual information or a neutral presentation of various views. Because abortionists are always pro-abortion, any scientific data about abortion and most experts in the field hold a pro-abortion bias - that makes it hard to preserve neutrality in this article. Same for any "journalism" sources - journalists and editors are committed to support legal abortion, and their bias is obvious in their news coverage - which again makes it hard to keep this article neutral.</p>
<p>5. But some people, like Tzankai, do seem to truly seek a neutral article.</p>
<p>6. Stick around, Barwick - your presence is most definitely needed here!!!!</p>
<p>7. Public opinion polls in the US consistently reveal that a majority of the people think most abortions should be outlawed. Most Amreicans think abortion should be legal only in cases of rape, incest, or when the pregnancy poses a severe physical health threat to the mother (not a mental health threat). That is not debatable - that is a reality. Pro-life views are MAINSTREAM, no matter how many times people tell you otherwse.</p>
<p>8. Its high time most others who edit here realize that FACT. To adopt the view that "abortion is always a valid choice" (that most editors here seem to adopt and argue when discussing bias within the article) as if it were the neutral view is to adopt a POV that is held by many and rejected by many.</p>
<p>9. The paradigm needs to change. NPOV in this article should reflect that pro-life and pro-abortion views have popular support and are both mainstream views. NPOV should also acknowledge that virtually all people who work in the abortion industry are pro-abortion and hold a pro-abortion POV. Same for most journalists and most newspapers - they admittdly have a pro-abortion bias.</p>
<p>10. That bias should be acknowledged by all and taken into account when editing and determining bias.</p>
<p>11. Thank you, Barwick, for your contributions.</p>

<p>An anonymous editor added something about a coat hangar abortion to the article.

<dd>Coat hanger abortions are/were extremely rare, and in fact if it is to be mentioned as a reason abortions were legalized or should be kept legal (for the very mention of a coat hanger abortion is an argument towards legal abortion), then it should also be mentioned that when abortions were illegal, doctors still performed them and they were in fact much safer on average than they are today. Because if a woman had complications from a doctor's performed abortion when they were illegal, that doctor was stripped of his license. And so they were much more careful to ensure nothing went wrong.Barwick 17:20, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what you're trying to argue here. What exactly do you mean when you say, "doctors still performed them and they were in fact much safer on average than they are today." When you say "them", are you referring to "coat hangar abortions"? I don't think doctors ever did such a thing. And let me try to understand your stream of logic ... X should be illegal because if a doctor does X, messes it up, and gets caught, he loses his license, whereas if X is legal, messing up isn't such a big deal? I don't think you've thought this through. If a doctor "messes up" an abortion and endangers the life of a patient he sure as hell is going to be in trouble. One of the arguments in favor of abortion is that when it's illegal you just see many many back-alley abortions that are hella dangerous. But none of this is why I wanted to include coat hangars into the article in the first place. I wanted to list it as simple historical fact. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cyde_0b5a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cyde">contribs</a></span></sup> 17:48, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article needs to discuss the phenomenon of unsafe abortion. We could take a two-fold approach: modern and historical, with illegal abortion and its effects upon the Western world being discussed in "history of abortion," while the increased threat and associated risks of continued unsafe abortions are presented under "health effects." Or, perhaps, it would be better to have one, all-inclusive section on "unsafe abortion" under "health effects"? Let's decide upon a course of format, first, and then we can begin the sourcing process. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 03:09, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do know that one has to be very careful in examining info/statistics in this regard - numbers cited by the pro-choice movement, if to be believed, would have established unsafe abortions prior to the legalization of abortion to be the leading cause of death of women of child-bearing age in the US (essentially any abortion could have been regarded as unsafe prior to legalization, as it was unregulated)! If I recall correctly, numbers cited to the media would have put it at about 10% of deaths of women of child bearing age were due to unsafe abortions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Actual statistics at the time of Roe vs. Wade actually showed few deaths from illegal abortions each year - although there may have been large numbers of women with complications, statistics/studies in the seventies/eighties showed complication rates (ranging from infection, sterility, future risk of ectopic pregnancy, etc) to be as high as 25%, not exactly indicating that legal abortion was any safer. I'd be happy to dig up some of those stats, but it will have to wait until after Christmas.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 19:31, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When I did my earlier research (I think its archived now) I found a common thread - illegal abortion deaths are always drastically underreported, because they are illegal.

<dd>Dona, most issues could be resolved through creative wording: "It is <i>estimated</i> by some authorities that umpteen women per annum died as a result of unsafe abortion in the United States before <i>Roe. v. Wade</i>." We could cite both the broad and conservative numbers, too, if it'd help. Roughly, I remember a conservative estimate of 200 per year, in the U.S., and a greater estimate pinning it at 2000 to 4000. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 02:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mother's health</span></h2>
<p>We seem to have had an intresting discussion brewing on the definition of health. While it isn't our place as editors to define whats a legitimate definition of health, do we need to have an on article discussion of it? or simply wikilink <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health.html" title="Health">health</a> and let the readers figure it out?--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 17:17, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Seems to me that the Wiki article (as well as the WHO definition?) is a bit off - they imply that "health" is a positive term, whereas I have always understood "health" itself to be a neutral term that defines the current physical and mental condition of the body - hence your doctor will say you are in "good health" or "poor health" (although, to confuse the issue, one could always say a person is "healthy," implying "good health." Eargh!).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However - for the purposes of this article - I think that both the Wiki article, as well as my understanding, boil down to the same thing: a "health" effect of abortion would be an effect that either negatively or positively influences your physical and mental condition. Is there really the need to discuss it beyond that for the purposes of this article?<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 21:45, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Link to "Aborted Children"</span></h2>
<p>An anon user has twice now tried to insert a link to "Aborted Children". I reverted his changes on a couple of criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>The site doesn't do anything to advance the topic at hand.</li>
<li>The site is decidedly NPOV.</li>
<li>The site could be classified as a shock site.</li>
<li>The link was added solely to try to "discourage" abortions by showing unpleasant pictures of the results.</li>
<li>The link is innapropriately named. These aren't aborted children, they are aborted fetuses. Children are typically at least three or four years old .. before that you'd call them toddlers, and before that, babies or infants. There's no such thing as an "aborted" child, only a murdered child. The link did not actually contain pictures of murdered children (and that wouldn't be relevant anyway).</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Pictures of most surgical operations are going to appear to be disgusting to most people. You could replace a lot of those pictures on the linked page with pictures of, say, appendectomies, and the average viewer wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Just because pictures of something can be shocking to ones sensibilities is not a reason to prohibit that practice. Images of appendectomies would gross out most people too but clearly appendectomies shouldn't be outlawed.</li>

<dd>It would be prudent to simply add in that it is possible for the infant to survive the failed abortion, that there are known cases, and provide link(s). As it is, the failed abortion section simply states that the doctor finds himself in an ethical dilemna; it lends weight to the ethical considerations and the investigation happening in Britain at this time by indicating that there are known cases of the infant surviving, and in fact surviving into adulthood.

<dd>This Pew Research Center/Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life poll from the same page is more accurate for Roe v. Wade discussion:</dd>
<dd>"In 1973 the Roe versus Wade decision established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion, at least in the first three months of pregnancy. Would you like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn its Roe versus Wade decision, or not?" Form 1 (N=589, MoE ± 4.5)</dd>

<dd>The CBS/NYT Poll data is good; I certainly wouldn't call it suspect. However, drawing the conclusion that "59% do not support the current interpretation of Roe v Wade" is impossible from the poll. Favoring "stricter limits (on abortion)" does not imply a lack of support for Roe v. Wade, but rather might also indicate a desire to see more parental/spousal notification laws (among other similar laws which do not fall foul of Roe v Wade). The CBS/NYT poll didn't ask about Roe v. Wade, so I think it would be hard to draw inferences from it regarding that SC decision. The Pew poll specifically mentions Roe v Wade and is still recent (Nov 2005). That doesn't mean I think the CBS/NYT poll shouldn't be included, but rather than it should be strictly and accurately represented. -<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParallel_or_Together__1f4b.html" title="User:Parallel or Together?">Parallel</a> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParallel_or_Together__26d2.html" title="User talk:Parallel or Together?">or Together</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parallel_or_Together__f6e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parallel or Together?">?</a> 14:27, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I meant add Pew data, and move GEs addition here so we can rework it until it is no longer misleading and achieves consensus, but if you want to rework it where it is that will work also.

<dd>Pew is not acceptable at this time - see dicussion below. It is also not current data. My solution is the least POV and addresses the ever-changing poll data that we know will keep appearing. This article is not about polling - listing the most recent and pointing to the resst is suffificient. Otherwise the poll data will be a constant POV nightmare as it is now. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Goodandevil</a> 14:46, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can see a smidgen of a point for objection on the Roe not being mentioned, so I have eliminated that from the article. But the Pew poll is hardly a good indicator of opinion of the actual law under Roe. Any objective person with knowledge of the Suprme Courts rulings in this area understands that current interpretatin of Roe v Wade has disallowed virtually all restrictions on Abortion up until the minute a child is born, regardless of gestational age or viability (throughout all nine months of pregnancy its legal under current interpretation or Roe and no restrictions have been allowed). So the Pew wording misleads (by highlighting the early stage of pregnancy and ignoring the later stage and therfore mischaracterixing the actual effect of Roe on abortion restrictions) the person being interviewed to infer that late term abortion is not permitted by current interpretations of Roe. Can you follow why I take issue with the Pew's wording? In any event, the latest poll should always be the one featured with a link to the rest of the data. Thats an easy way to avoid POV from ever creeping in. The latest scientific poll regardless who likes or dislikes the result. And it also is a good way to deal with what we know will be ever changing data. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Goodandevil</a> 14:36, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Similarly, the Pew poll asks about "completely overturning" Roe - which is so undefined as to be meaningless - and as worded makes it likely that the person interviewed will reject the something so drastic as "completely overturning" Roe. By the way, most legal scholars would likely tell you that Roe is such a convoluted legal opinion to begin with that it would be hard to even define what "overturning" would consist of. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Goodandevil</a> 14:46, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unless you are a professional pollster, I don't see what you taking issue with the Pew polls wording has anything to do with it. You can't argue that the CBS/NYT poll is <i>not</i> suspect while the Pew poll <i>is</i>. The latest scientific poll is a good rule of thumb, but the polls are asking different questions. They aren't the same poll. Your interpretation of what Roe v Wade has and hasn't disallowed is also flawed.

<dd>I see no issue with the Pew poll. It presents an additional dimension of the abortion debate which is unanswered by other polls which deal merely with abortion restrictions, etc. There are people, who, when asked, "Do you think abortion should be allowed?" would answer, "no," but would nonetheless say they wanted Roe to be upheld (The pro-life personally, pro-choice globally crowd); there are others, who, when asked the same question, would answer, "yes," but would nonetheless say that they wanted Roe to be overturned (The sort of people who believe such leglistation should be left to states, and not a federal mandate). -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 14:52, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like this version if a bloated version must exist. I will be adding more variants, though. Its POV to bloat it up to make some happy and then not allow other nucanced variants of similar querstions. Although we have three polls listed that address the same topic for the US - no other country has so many variants. Most recent poll ought to be listed, regardless of the question asked, then the link to the more comprehsnsive data. Its funny to watch some of you try so hard to keep the latest poll data out because I posted it and to keep similar old poll data in because I remvoed it.

<dd>"Completely overturning Roe v Wade" has no discernable meaning. Please explain what it means legally. I challenge you do it. Its so vague as to be meaningless, and could mean 1000 things, and could even include keeping abortion legal but using a wholly different legal argument. And providing an incomplete if not inaccurate explanation of what Roe allows within the Pew question is very problematic. That is whats wrong with Pews poll. And quite frankly I am certain that most of you are intelligent enough to understand precisely the point I am making and the mileading nature of Pew's a question. You are all very good at ignoring the point as it makes it easier to excise my edits.

<dd>There seems an (over)abundance of polls from the U.S. So, I tried to divide them into three seperate themes, or rather have polls answering three seperate questions:
<ul>
<li>In what circumstances do Americans think abortion should be allowed? Do they think it should be allowed in "all circumstances," "no circumstances," or "most circumstances."</li>
<li>How do Americans feel about abortion access? Do they want more restrictions? Do they believe abortion should be made "harder to obtain," "easier to obtain," or left as it is now?</li>
<li>How do Americans feel about Roe vs. Wade? Do they want it overturned or upheld?</li>

A November 2005 <a href="../../../p/e/w/Pew_Research_Center_484e.html" title="Pew Research Center">Pew Research Center</a> poll asked Americans about <i><a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_vs._Wade_a3e3.html" title="Roe vs. Wade">Roe vs. Wade</a></i> and found that 26% want it overturned while 65% do not. <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should satisfy the three "dimensions" I laid out above. The first poll deals with circumstances, the second with access, and the third with Roe v. Wade. All are the newest data from the Polling Report site. I'd add this, now, but I'm respecting Tznkai's tag. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 16:15, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the order you listed the CNN poll results. Now its a mish mash. This makes more sense and it was this way for several weeks without complaints.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>39% think abortion should only be legal in "a few circumstances" and another 16% said it should be legal under "no circumstances", while 26% believe it should be legal in "all circumstances" and 16% that it should be legal in "most circumstances"<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Goodandevil</a> 16:25, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, most recent polls should be on top, and CBS/NYT data should highlight largest % first, unless the smaller number is listed first so as to note its relative smaller size such as "a minority of 38% think things should stay the way they are whereas..." Otherwise its POV to list the smaller number first. That just too obvious. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Goodandevil</a> 16:27, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I've tried to use logical order, based on the opinion: i.e. those who think it should be legal in some circumstances, most circumstances, all circumstance, no circumstances. Some, to most, to all, to none. Logical. I also think that was the order the CNN article gave the statistics in. Otherwise, you're just picking nits. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 16:36, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>BTW, the three polls are presented in the same order which I defined the three dimensions: circumstances, access, and Roe vs. Wade. This is the structure upon which I constructed the revision, as KC requested that I do. Also, having the "majority" percentage be stated first could also be inherently POV, because this could be seen as adding special weight to the "bigger" number, and thus commenting on its worth over the other numbers, and thus the other opinions. If you want, the logical progression could run in the opposite direction, from none to some. But, really, I don't see how such fault-finding is helpful to this article. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 16:50, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"None, Some, Most, All" might be rational and neutral. But "Some, Most, All, None" is certainly not neutral as the only basis to use that order would be personal preference, as there is scant (not any) rational basis for jumping around as you do. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.223.17.html" title="User:84.146.223.17">84.146.223.17</a> 00:03, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">American polls</span></h2>
<p>It appears someone wants some of the polls removed. I oppose it on the following grounds:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first poll gives a better breakdown of opinion; it was taken by a dedicated polling agency (Gallup); it indicates a greater tendency towards pro life/abortion restrictions.</li>
<li>The second poll is a news agency poll, with less breakdown; but indicates a greater tendency towards pro-choice/unrestricted access.</li>
<li>The third is on Roe vs. Wade, a trial that needs to be considered independent of the legality of abortion, as it is possible the trial was flawed (as is testified by the then "Jane Roe," who claims it was bogus).</li>
</ol>
<p>PLEASE take the discussion here instead of starting an edit war - which polls to be included are a matter of consensus, not personal opinion.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 23:58, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>All polls show people want more restrictions unless skewed by misleading questions that imply Roe only allows early abortion or that simply cites Roe with the person answering possibly and (likely) having no idea what curent law (under Roe's ciurrent meaning) is.</li>
<li>CBS/NYT poll shows 59% favoring more restrictions than there are now. (not in accord with Roe as currently interpreted by the courts.</li>
<li>The Pew poll mischaracterizes Roe as allowing only early abortions, and masks the reality today in the USA that no abortion can ever be illegal for a woman who wants one. On top of that, it seeks the same information as the CBS/NYT poll (scientific poll) by inquiring whether people agree with current law. Again, it is silly to waste space repeating so many polls. THe most recent poll should appear with a link to the Polling Report that has the other polls. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.223.17.html" title="User:84.146.223.17">84.146.223.17</a> 00:11, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've argued against using polls on this page previously, and I'm not going to rehash the whole thing again. However, I want to bring up that the simplest solution is to not include public opinion polls on this page. 1) people never agree on which polls to use 2) polling data is always changing 3) no poll is perfect 4) this is a page about abortion yet all polls focus on america, sometimes europe, and sometimes latin america but never asia or africa. My opinion is that this page should mention that abortion is controversial in the US and latin america and a handful of european states, but nowhere else and leave it as that. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuasipalm_6524.html" title="User:Quasipalm">Quasipalm</a> 01:00, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would prevent this type of edit war, but then we'd have the edit wars when people wanted to insert polls. OTOH we could cite WP:BIAS and take them out. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 02:24, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The polls have existed on the page for months without issue. Only one person (and, it would seem, this person's sockpuppet) has objected to their presentation. This person has decided that repeatedly starting edit wars, even against a 4/1 consensus, is the preferrable thing to do. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 03:36, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>However, I would support the complete removal of polls, if it comes right down to it. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 03:44, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that because abortion is controversial in only a few places (America, Latin America, and some places in Europe according to Quasipalm) that this is a perfect reason for including poll data from only these areas. Might as well be as accurate as we can. I think that the inclusion of all three American polls, presenting three different aspects of the debate, is good. However, if the polls must go to reach NPOV concensus, then that should be the primary consideration. I just don't feel taking away the polls is necessary. -<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParallel_or_Together__1f4b.html" title="User:Parallel or Together?">Parallel</a> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParallel_or_Together__26d2.html" title="User talk:Parallel or Together?">or Together</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parallel_or_Together__f6e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parallel or Together?">?</a> 06:19, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>it seems we three have total consensus, then - polls from areas where abortion is controversial, and all 3 American polls, to present different aspects, but if it becomes a major issue better to take them out rather than spend all our time reverting and arguing with the one dissenter. Does that sum it up? <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 14:54, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When someone actually and adequately addresses the complaint that Pew gives a bogus explantio of Roe as it is currently applied, I will relent. Until then, Pews question is both biased and the results are meaningless. Address this issue or I will continue to delete the data and certianly will add a POV and accuracy marker in the polling section. What is odd is that none of you are willing to acknowledge that the polls are trying to find out whether people want the current law changed or not. Its all about Roe. But when you ask directly about Roe and do not offer the person being questioned an accurate and helpful unbiased explanation of current law under Roe, the poll resulkt is just laugahbly useless and biased.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does any editor not understand that current law DOES allow all abortions for any reason throughout pregnancy? (BTW, the partial birth abortion ban has been suspended nationwide while the law is being challenged in federal court). Perhaps we should ensure that editors know the subject matter - the facts - before having a silly argument in the absence of facts. Please explain if my understanding of current law under the latest interpretation of Roe is flawed. And cite why. Otherwise lets drop that debate since its silly to waste time with it.</li>
<li>Does anyone not agree that the wording of Pew's question makes the person being interviewed likely to falsely, and out of ignorance and due to the suggestive wording of the question, assume Roe simply allows early abortion and does not apply to abortions in the 9th month of pregnancy? Please explain how you come to such a conclusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly Pew's poll tries to suggest to the person being polled that only early abortions are allowed under Roe. At least with the CNN and CBS polls the question does not purposfully distort current law and simply asks if they think abortion ought to be restricted any differenlt than it is now. It is particularly humorous to see you all ignore the one solution that solves the entire problem and ignore it precisely because the solution is from me. THe solution is to simply create a rule for the page that only the latest trustworthy poll's data should be included with a link to the page that contains all rest. That gives no POV an advantage, avoids constant poll data wars, actually directs those who are curious to more data, and avoids any charge of US-centrism for the polling section. BTW, I cannot log on as Goodandevil on the computer I have been using as it will not accept certain cookies. (Some of you are so funny in you attempts to villify me - or my goodness a sock puppet - egad - oh how evil and dastardly.) Keep it up. I am sure it makes you feel better. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.213.254.html" title="User:84.146.213.254">84.146.213.254</a> 17:13, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One of Wikipedia's rules, indeed, is to be bold -- but there's a thin line been boldness and stubbornheadness. Okay, fine, you've said your piece, but most everyone thinks that your course of action is unreasonable. Edit wars prove <i>nothing</i>, solve <i>nothing</i>, and contribute <i>nothing</i>. They will only build frustration and acrimony. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 17:37, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now, as a gesture toward productiveness, let's weigh in on GE's concerns about the Pew poll, which are presented in above edits. GE, you hold off from waging an edit war, we go through the motions of trying to achieve an actual consensus and turn this into something productive. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 18:16, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your gesture is appreciated. My gesture was to default to the NPOV that the newest poll be in the article regardless of who likes or dislikes it. Can't get more NPOV than that.

<dd>"Perhaps you will all eventually realize that." is bordering on insulting. We realize you think you're right, any sane person thinks their position is correct, however implying that anyone who might disagree with you is <i>wrong</i> as opposed to having a <i>differing opinion</i> is inherently insulting. I'm sure you didn't mean to insult everyone on this page, I'm merely drawing your attention to this. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 19:11, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
