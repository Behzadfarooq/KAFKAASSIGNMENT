<h2><span class="mw-headline">Abortions in New Zealand and Australia</span></h2>
<p>I suspect most of you are from the US but it would be helpful if you could expand the articles from other countries for example, NZ. As mentioned in the NZ abortion article <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_in_New_Zealand_2080.html" title="Abortion in New Zealand">Abortion in New Zealand</a> the law currently only allows abortion when it a risk to the mental health or physical health of the mother. This is similar to the law in some (all?) Australian states I believe. Generally speaking I believe, it has been interpreted rather loosely to allow abortion on demand i.e. to mean that anyone who genuinely wants an abortion (and is not being pressured) into it can get once for mental health reasons. This is a big amibigous and technically there may be a legal risk to doctor I believe. The article on Australia isn't too bad but the article on NZ needs more info around this. I'm a bit to busy to add to it but perhaps someone could? Maybe try recruting some people from NZ to help you. To start you if, these links may be helpful <a href="http://www.abortionlaw.co.nz/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abortionlaw.co.nz/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.abortion.gen.nz" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abortion.gen.nz" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and also try some of the local papers e.g. <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> as the issue is 'hot' recently due to the publication of the controversial (and IMHO flawed) study (by an NZ 'pro-choice' doctor) on the supposed mental health risks from abortion. IMHO, the situation in NZ is also somewhat similar to NZ in that most political parties don't want to 'rock the boat' and even Drs appear to be satisfied with the way it works now. Although there is an ongoing court case by an anti-abortion group and there was also a (failed) attempt to change the law to force parental notification by Judith Collins a opposition MP 1.5 years back. And I'd have to say, given the current political climate in NZ, I suspect any attempt to clamp down on abortions will probably fail. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 17:16, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>health.families.com is not a good reference - there is no indication of where this website gets the percentage it uses. Do you know what its source is? The article should rely on something more substantial given that there is little to no real solid information on this topic since women often don't even know when they are pregnant. I don't think you want to open up the pandora's box of citing unsourced articles regarding information that is NOT consensus in the medical community. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a> 14:15, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1. The <b>www.families.com</b> is NOT a good medical research source ESPECIALLY when the information cited is not backed up by any research, and the research that does exist contradicts this source (read on). <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a> 14:35, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>2.There is a major (though understandable) flaw in this wiki article's analysis of the one very credible source it does cite. If you read the text <a href="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:O9e1tDsOamgJ:www.unc.edu/news/archives/jun99/wilcox2.htm+On+day+11,+more+than+50+percent+of+pregnancies+fail+and+on+day+12&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:O9e1tDsOamgJ:www.unc.edu/news/archives/jun99/wilcox2.htm+On+day+11,+more+than+50+percent+of+pregnancies+fail+and+on+day+12&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, you will find that of all fertilized ova that implanted during the 9th through the 12th day, <b>cumulatively only 25% miscarried (48 of 189)</b>. This wiki article misrepresents what the percentages actually indicate by falsely concluding that the cumulative miscarry rate by the end of the study was much larger than 25%, when in fact the only thing one derive from the study would be that through day 12 there was only a 25% miscarry rate.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The risk of early loss was strongly related to the time of implantation," the authors wrote. "Early loss was least likely when implantation occurred by the ninth day (13 early losses among 102 pregnancies, or 13 percent) rising to 26 percent (14 of 53 pregnancies) when implantation occurred on the 10th day, 52 percent (12 of 23) on the 11th day and 82 percent (9 of 11) with implantation after day 11."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. As such we will need to re-work this section to convey what the research actually indicates. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a> 14:35, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Alright, I'm having a hard time parsing everything here. As I understand it, 136 is telling us that the current statistics are misleading bcecause they're not detailed enough?--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 15:41, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The wiki article flat out gets the percentages wrong. First, the widely accepted rate of miscarraiges is 20-25%. <a href="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:Y9Q87xctGpQJ:www.umm.edu/pregnancy/stayhealthy/articles/miscarriage.html+rate+of+miscarriage+&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:Y9Q87xctGpQJ:www.umm.edu/pregnancy/stayhealthy/articles/miscarriage.html+rate+of+miscarriage+&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Second, the research (Wilcox) cited by killerchi actually confirms the 25% rate. There is NOTHING in that article to support a miscarry rate any higher than 25%. Third, the wiki article falsely uses a rate (78%) more than triple the accepted rate and more than triple the rate in study killerchi has cited! Fourth, the www.families.com website article cited is just a bad source and should not be cited in this article (espcially since it is not the widely accepted figure). Fifth, other websites are currently copying this misinformation from wikipedia and repeating it. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a> 15:56, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>2 Is this in discussion, or the article itself?</dd>
<dd>3 not sure what the source of this one was, but it doesn't surprise me as days 0-12 or so are particularly deadly. We have a source somewhere?</dd>
<dd>4 I don't see this cited in the article anywhere</dd>
<dd>5 Irrelivant. We want accurate info period, don't need to convince us.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 16:01, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. No one has cited any published conclusive data on rate of miscarriage including unconfirmed pregnancies, although I have read it is thought to ad another 20-30% (making the overall rate at most about 50%). But there is no study to confirm it.</dd>
<dd>2. Incorrect rate % is in the actual wiki abortion (and miscarriage) articles.</dd>
<dd>3. Source is NOT cited in the article (other than referencing the wiki miscarriage article that has the bad info). Source were listed here in talk by killerchi. The study cited actually followed 199 pregnancies. 10 fell out for unspecified reasons - 189 went forward with the study. Of those, 141 pregnancies continued past 6 weeks, and 48 miscarried by the end of the 12th day. (Total 189)</dd>

<p>You must have meant something else for #1. Conclusive published data for the miscarriage rate for <i>unconfirmed</i> pregnancies? If they aren't confirmed, no one knows there was a miscarriage. This is nonsensical. Why don't you think this through and rephrase?</p>
<p>Also, please stop referring to me as Killerchi. If KillerChihuahua is too much to type, just type KC - thanks! <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 20:27, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your sources did not pan out - and so now you are nitpicking. Clearly my point is that the absolute most that it could be is 50%, but even that number can't be confirmed (as you apparently now agree), so the actual confirmed number is less than 1/3 of the number you insisted it should be.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Latest polling information has been added</span></h2>
<p>January 2006 CBS news poll:</p>
<ul>
<li>27% always legal, 15% greater restrictions, 50% only legal for rape/incest/life of the mother, 5% never legal
<ul>
<li><b>70% think there should be more restrictions than those currently in place</b> (remember, every woman in the USA can get an abortion for any reason at any time in the pregnancy no matter what as long as she can pay for it - there are parental consent laws in some states for minor girls but the Supreme Court requires an easily accessible and streamlined judicial bypass and requires the judge to grant permission in all cases unless the girl indicates she is not voluntarily seeking the abortion)</li>
<li><b>55% think that 95% of the legal abortions in the USA should be outlawed</b></li>
<li><b>only 27% support current abortion law</b> (always legal)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is very similar to the data in the Nov 2005 CNN poll. Other polls that ask generic questions about keeping "Roe" or overturning it seem to mask the actual views of those being polled since few people have any real idea of what the current laws actually allow. When asked to be specfic, clear majorites want all or most abortions (all but rape, incest or life of the mother) outlawed.<a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a> 09:11, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Funny you should mention that - it appears that splitting up those who want to outlaw at least 95% of the abortions into a bunch of seemingly small % is quite tricky indeed! I am sure you agree that this CBS poll and the CNN poll consistently show that a sound majority wants abortion to be illegal - as a minimum - in cases of rape, incest or the life of the mother. Most folks would have a hard time realizing that from this article.

<p>So, here's the deal: I set up a little structure to help determine which polls we include in the U.S. section back in Archive 14 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Abortion/Archive_14#Updated_poll_results" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Abortion/Archive_14#Updated_poll_results" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. In short, 1. the cirumstances in which abortion should be allowed, 2. abortion access, 3. opinion on Roe vs. Wade. Thus, I removed the CNN poll, as it was redundant with the updated poll Goodandevil added. We now only need to find an updated poll to deal with item two on the list: access.</p>
<p>Goodandevil seems determined to prove something. I prefer, like Tznkai, to let the numbers speak for themselves and to let readers draw their own conclusions. You could shift the conclusion regarding the CBS poll the other way if you altered your filtering mechanism: "75% of Americans think abortion should be available in some form (27% + 33% + 15%)." There is a January 2006 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll listed on Polling Report in which Americans who consider themselves "pro-choice" outnumber Americans who consider themselves "pro-life" by 11% (you can't criticize the poll as being "undefined," either, because there is data for those who "Don't Know What Terms Mean"). <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Again, the data don't like being pulled and tweaked. It makes them uncomfortable. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 20:23, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is foolish to think this source is the end all, be all. While I would guess that the majority are not in favor of abortion (as approximately 80% or higher of America is Christian), but one should be more analytical. The most viewer grossing television shows get maybe 30 million viewers, so at best possible means the CBS Poll is getting maybe 10% of America's opinion. Not to mention a potential slant of the viewers of CBS. While I don't disagree with the poll, it's hardly even worth debating on. -TKO</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fetal Pain</span></h2>
<p>Depending on how the article is worded, we may have to have one section for fetal pain in the 2nd and 3rd tirmesters and one for fetal pain in the 1st trimester. Be careful when editing this section. The medical scientific and legalfact is that fetuses who experience pain can be aborted for any reason at all.

<p>The article lists "fetal pain" as a subsection under the "suggested effects" section. But thousands of legal abortions happen in the second and third trimseter, a gestational age when all agree fetal pain is a real phenomenon. Thus, for thousands of abortions, fetal pain is not a merely a suggested effect, but a real one that the medical community acknowledges. The article should address this.

<p>This article includes fetal pain and lumps in abortions that no one denies involve fetal pain with those abortions where fetal pain is not certain.

<p>I have asked for input and now have tried out various versions to include this non-POV fact (that a fetus in fact can experience pain). The article needs to explicitly state this, rather than simply noting there is a controversy about pain experience. The controversyu shoudl not mask the fact that is not in controversy. Please suggest alternatives for including this undisputed FACT rather than simply editing the fact out. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a> 15:47, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Tznkai, I have edited the section header as I considered it a typo.</p>
<p>In the article, I restored Ann's earlier version, leaving aside the issue of whether "Emergency contraception" is a neutral term. It certainly is controversial enough that the mere statement "A pregnancy that is prevented before implanation but after conception is termed emergency conception" is not enough. Either we leave out the whole field of "post-fertilisation, pre-implantation" issue here, or we should give proper coverage to the whole issue, including the "moral part".</p>
<p>I also disagree with Alienus when he says that "Moral equivalence is not the issue" (it certainly is an issue worth mentioning). He is correct in saying that "Someone could believe that a fertilized egg is a "human life" yet still recognize that pregnancy begins with implantation", but that doesn't warrant his edit, as it is the human life part that is relevant to the issue and NOT the definition when pregnancy begins.</p>
<p>I believe the now restored version addresses all issues best(leaving aside the EC wording issue). I certainly cannot see any inaccuracies in it.</p>

<dd>KC, saying that morals don't belong here (and frankly, this is merely one sentence) is POV (and a quite extreme one). Of course, morals are dealt with in a more comprehensive way in another article. My sentence also serves the purpose of referring readers to the colloquial usage of "abortion" in debates. And we don't any citations beyond what we already have as this doesn't indulge in any debate but rather only points to the fact that there is a debate. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 11:58, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To say "moral don't belong here" is an extreme POV, but you appearently didn't advocate it - you only mentioned it.

<dd>Agreed. The pro-choice view is a moral view that holds that morality in general - other than personal morality of the pregnant mom - has no role.

<dd>Ok, thanks for clearing that up. I still feel that is not POV, I am trying to prevent POV. Morals as a whole are inherently prone to dispute. There are two extremes of which you are considering only one: abortion is immoral, abortion is moral. Saying the question is "anti-abortion morals only" or "no morals" is leaving out the other extreme, as well as shadings in between.</dd>
<dd>Moving forward, you feel (if I understand you correctly) that the moral considerations of preventative abortion aka emergency contraception, should be included. So there is a choice: to include or not? and if the decision is to include, then there is the question, how to phrase in an NPOV manner, give due weight, and cite appropriately.

<dd>KC, to reiterate: to exclude something because they issue doesn't matter is a POV, as opinions on what matters and what doesn't are different. That a statement discounting morals is itself a moral statement is of course a paradox that those who say so mostly don't get.</dd>
<dd>Any moral considerations should, if included, be put into the debate section. And there they should be properly referenced. But ... the bit about "moral equivalence" is IMHO part of the definitions section, as it addresses the incongruity between the present definition medical of pregnancy (and hence the medical definition of abortion) and the defintions relevant for the moral debate. In fact, in explaining here that for moral purposes, EC while not medically/technically abortion, is seen as morally equivalent, we are saving us the trouble of including an extra section on EC in the debate section, as we have set the foundation that - in moral terms - EC goes together with abortion, one way or the other.</dd>

<dd>Nonsense. To exclude something because it doesn't matter is not necessarily POV, in fact, it usually is not POV. Example: It may be true that G. W. Bush made mud pies on his 5th birthday and his grandmother took a picture, but it most emphatically does <i>not</i> matter, and should be excluded from an article on Geo. W. Bush.</dd>
<dd>Further, this is the first time the opinion on what does and does not "matter" has been raised, with you pontificating at me, about what I have no idea. What point are you trying to make? Please try to be clearer in your meaning. Are you suggesting that Morals be included? Which morals? Where? Please be specific and clear.

Morals can be tricky because the word has a connotation of innateness -- it often traces back to one's feelings ("abortion is icky") or religion ("my deity decrees..."). A discussion about whether to include a mention of EC and ethics (since it follows a more public and evolving approach) could lead to a better consensus.

<p>New or changing definitions are a sign of controversy and possible linguistic manipulation to advance certain views.

<p>What is the "emergency"? A <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_emergency.html" title="Medical emergency">medical emergency</a> is an injury or illness that requires an urgent need of medical attention to alleviate an immediate threat to one's health. If a woman has sperm inside of her, medically speaking there is no emergency. There may be a personal desire to quickly address the matter, but is is NOT a medical emergency. Fertility is a sign of health. Contraception, medically speaking, is not actually <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_care.html" title="Health care">health care</a> as commonly understood - rather it is elective medical treatment (similar to elective medical treatment to make one look younger). Contraception by definition always inhibits the normal natural state of reproductive health. The exception is the rare case of a woman actually suffering from a medical condition that makes pregnancy dangerous to her health. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a></p>

<dd>It's not <i>necessarily</i> a medical term. There are contexts where it can be medical, where medical advice and special circumstances require professional intervention as you noted above. Usually however, it is birth control choice available to women; since stopping a pregnancy could be viewed as "maintaining human health", as in maintaining her non-pregnant status then I guess it is "medical". But that's a debatable point since a pregnancy is a natural biological state which has health benefits as well as dangers. Clear as mud? Good. Since a pregnancy cannot begin (in biological and medical terms) until implantation this discussion is moot; and contraception wether in a medical or nonmedical context is appropriate. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 21:59, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The new definitions of pregnancy and contraception. It all goes back to the politically motivated re-definition of pregnancy (and contraception) in 1965 that was created exclusively to get around then-existing federal law. Of course we never hear about it because those who report on these matters embrace contraception as a social good - and the truth about this lingusitic end-run is less important to many than the end result (widespread acceptance of contraception). As with abortion (Roe), the end result mattered more than actually complying with the constitution. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a> 16:51, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We are not here to debate the authenticity of accepted definitions. They are accepted definitions, and how accepted, by who, and whether they should accept them can be left to diffrent articles. (Abortion debate should have a pretty massive section on changing definitions).</p>
<p>Pregnancy is defined as beginning at implanation. This is, as far as I can tell, a widely accepted definition by various people with and without medical degrees. As it was pointed out, it has a certain benifit of common sense, as petri dishes cannot be pregnant.</p>
<p>Emergency Contraception is as stated, a poor term, but I've got 1.8 million google hits and no better terms to move the article to. If someone else does, feel free and we will accomidate within the article as needed.</p>
<p>EC is a little fish in a very big pond. This is not the battleground where we take on the definitions of the Pro-life Pro-choice terminology debate of the week. We need to mention EC, because people are going to wonder why it isn't here.

<dd>has been removed. I think it's important, relevant information, and I think Str's change in wording was a big improvement. Also, I don't think it was <i><b>so</b></i> long that it really had to go. Tznkai, you say we need to mention EC, because otherwise people will wonder why it's not there. Surely the reason they'd wonder is precisely because of the issue of whether or not it's the equivalent of an abortion (which means that that point is relevant). After all, people won't wonder why we don't mention condoms in the abortion article. I'm not going to revert (at the moment at least), because I haven't read the whole discussion on this talk page, and there may have been some consensus that I missed.

Although I do advocate the use of medical terminology and definitions when it can help bring NPOV to an article, or resolve debate when that terminology is neutral, Wikipedia is by no means a place where only the medical majority definition/terminology/POV should be presented. If a significant portion of a population holds a belief, then that portion should be represented here. Those who believe that life (ie pregnancy) begins at conception as opposed to implantation, are not an insignificant number (especially as one must not restrict one's self to the US, or Western nations). That said, there are a number of people who view EC as an abortifacient (or at least as a potential one, as it could either prevent ovulation if it hasn't occured, prevent fertilization if it has, or prevent implantation if fertilization has occured/occurs anyways). On the other hand, it does not change the fact that as far as simple definitions go, it does not fall under abortion in a purely <i>technical</i> sense.</dd>

<dd>SO - what I would propose&#160;: either add a bullet under definitions for EC, state what it does, and then refer people to the abortion debate section below to address the issue; or remove the reference to EC from definitions entirely, and simply address the issue in the debate section(Tznkai, I believe you agreed to this earlier up the page). <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 01:55, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I liked the verbiage Str1977 and I had worked together on: "Medically, methods of birth control that prevent implantation, such as emergency contraception, are not considered to be abortion; however, emergency contraception is considered equivalent to abortion by those who believe that human life begins at conception." One puppy's opinion, that seems to cover it without getting mired in it. Its a little comma laden at the moment, but we can tweak it if other editors see merit in this version. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 02:32, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like your wording - I thought people were complaining more about it's location than the wording at this point. It could be refined by saying that "... however, <i>prevention of implantation</i> is considered equivalent..." as that encompasses all methods of contraception that prevent implantation; but if people are happy with wording/location, I'm not going to belabour the point! <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 06:48, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(reduce indent)Hrm.. As the statement begins with "Medically, methods of birth control that prevent implantation, such as emergency contraception..." wouldn't immediately following that with <i>prevention of implantation</i> look and read a little redundantly? The way it is written, the common term is defined, then the ethical consideration of when pregnancy begins according to different beliefs is addressed. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 15:57, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry - what I was trying to say was that there are other products not under the blanket term emergency contraception that prevent implantation - as an example, I was explaining earlier on that <i>any</i> contraceptive that prevents implantation would be seen as a (potential) abortifacient from the point of view of the Catholic Church, and various pro-life groups. This would indicate that more than just emergency contraception is seen as the equivalent of abortion...however, emergency contraception is probably the most commonly addressed issue, so whatever you think works is fine with me.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 17:47, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding the use of medical definitions, what is the acknowledged practice on Wikipedia as a whole? For example, does the obligation exist to post traditional Chinese medicine's alternative standpoint into every medical article? Does every definition in geology have a qualifier pointing out creationism's alternative standpoint simply because there are is a significant minority opinion? It seems like some exceptions are being made because this is a controversial topic. Is that the right thing to do? Hadamhiram 05:20, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hadamhiram, you are misunderstanding something. The medical definition is the medical definition and is included as such (though debatable and not revelation, but it's up to medics to discuss this) - the broader definition however is common and valid in ethical considerations ("equivalency") and hence a note about this is included as well. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 13:41, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Minor quibble: abortion may be responsible for a birth rate, but infanticide is not by definition (child must be born to be killed in infanticide, yes?) First sentence, second paragraph, suggest reword or remove infanticide. Sentence 3, suggested modification to: In 1991 the female-to-male <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_ratio.html" title="Sex ratio">sex ratio</a> in India was found to be skewed from its biological norm of 100 to 105, to an average of 108 to 100. (fewer commas, flows a little better I think.) Third para, first sentence, perhaps: ...where there is also a historic preference for sons, in addition....</dd>
<dd>Feel free to reject any or all of these ideas.

<dd>First paragraph: Okay, you're definitely right about the confusion caused by the use of the term "infanticide" in conjuction with the phrase "birth rates." Addition of "parially" notes that there are other factors at work. The initial Wiki-link of "sex-selective" abortion links to the article <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex-selective_abortion_and_infanticide.html" title="Sex-selective abortion and infanticide">sex-selective abortion and infanticide</a>. So, hopefully, this is sufficient, because this article is discussing S-SA, not infanticide.</dd>
<dd>Second paragraph: Breaking it down with three commas, in my opinion, helps to seperate the first ratio from the second. If others agree, though, I can change it, because it's minor.</dd>
<dd>Third paragraph: "Son preference" is the academic term for the phenomenon. Here's a Google search <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=son+preference&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=son+preference&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> with the first few hits seeming to be scholarly treatises on the subject. This term, alone, seems to garner more data on the subject than the term "sex-selective abortion" did. There are reams and reams of data which I would like to incorporate, but, again, this is a summary. Although, I'm going to primary source the India study from the Lancet, but that requires registration first, and right now I need lunch.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ethics and Morality can't be seperated</span></h2>
<p>Wikipedia: "<a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">Ethics</a> (from Greek ethikos) is the branch of axiology – one of the four major branches of philosophy, alongside metaphysics, epistemology, and logic – which attempts to understand the nature of morality; to define that which is right from that which is wrong. The Western tradition of ethics is sometimes called moral philosophy." IOW, morality is the basis upon which one determines what is ethical. Ethics is applied morality. e.g. "Thou shalt not kill" is a moral precept - and ethics is the application of that (and other) moral precepts to determine if one can morally kill in self-defense. Not sure why some are so afraid of morality appearing on this page. Being pro-choice is a moral view that excludes other moral views - just as pro-life is. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a> 07:37, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Historically speaking, nutmeg has been used as an abortifacient since (if memory serves me correctly) Roman times - and is sufficiently effective that even some modern resources warn pregnant women to avoid consumption of large amounts of nutmeg in cooking/baking (I can try to dig those up if need be).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"phenomenon in <b>women</b> to phenomenon in <b>humans</b></span></h2>
<p>In the opening paragraph, I changed it from reading "phenomenon in <font color="red">women</font>" to "phenomenon in <font color="red">humans</font>". This was done because abortion involves <b>two parties</b> and because the immediate context refers to a species of mammal (gender having already been established by the word "female"). It was reverted by someone who claimed it was already a talked about and settled issue. Talked about or not (I don't know), but <i>there is still bias</i> in this terminology. I propose changing it as I did. -- &#160;<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title="IS"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="IS" width="25" height="18" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a>&#160;<font color="#B53C07"><b>Guðsþegn</b></font>&#160;–&#160;<small><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_3d46.html" title="User:Guðsþegn">U</a><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User_talk%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_daf2.html" title="User talk:Guðsþegn">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_518d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Guðsþegn">C</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Gu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_319a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Guðsþegn">E</a></small>&#160;– 19:53, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I understand what you mean, Guðsþegn, but I think the opposition relevant here is "any female mammal" vs. "female human" = "woman". True, abortion involves two parties but this applies to "animal abortions" as well. The objective of the sentence however was indicate that this article is restricted to abortion of humans. Of course, we could also write "female human" but "woman" seems more simple to me. Any other thoughts? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 20:19, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My version, + Kyd's spelling fix: An <b>abortion</b> is the termination of a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> associated with the death of an <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryo.html" title="Embryo">embryo</a> or a <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetus</a>. This can occur spontaneously, in the form of a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a>, or be intentionally induced through chemical, surgical, or other means. All <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammalian_pregnancy.html" title="Mammalian pregnancy">mammalian pregnancies</a> can be aborted; however, this article focuses exclusively on the abortion of human pregnancy. As I recall its the pregnancy that is aborted, which isn't "in" the woman so much as occuring there. I just cut the male/female thing out since I didn't see the point, but thats just me.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 20:22, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Explanation was reverted, but should be adopted</span></h2>
<p>Earlier today I changed the wording in the "Definitions" section as follows (my changes in <font color="red">red</font>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Methods of birth control that prevent implantation, such as <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_contraception.html" title="Emergency contraception">emergency contraception</a>, are not considered to be abortion; however, emergency contraception is generally considered a <font color="red">moral</font> equivalent to abortion <font color="red">(and is often called abortion)</font> by those who believe that human life begins at <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertilisation.html" title="Fertilisation">conception</a> <font color="red">because implantation creates no <i>per se</i> fundamental change in the moral status of the one conceived.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My changes were <b>NPOV changes</b> because they gave explanation to what was unexplained. The subtle non-neutral POV of leaving dissenting opinion unexplained, and therefore presumably ignorant, existed in the original wording. The changed wording is <b>describing</b> why "those who believe that human life begins at conception" believe that "emergency contraception" (usually a misnomer because done after conception; etymology: <i>contra</i> + con<i>ception</i>) is "generally considered equivalent to abortion", when the article just said it wasn't abortion. The reason: it is the "moral equivalent ... because implantation creates no <i>per se</i> fundamental change in the moral status of the one conceived." <b>This is an accurate explanation meant to promote NPOV</b>. I won't go into a revert war, but this absolutely should be included.</p>
<p><i>Wikipedia NPOV policy and its official explanation state that:</i></p>
<ol>
<li>"articles should be written from a neutral point of view, <b>representing views fairly</b>"</li>
<li>"the easiest way to make your writing more encyclopedic is to <b>write about what people believe</b>, rather than what is so"</li>
<li>"We should, instead, write articles with the tone that <b><i>all</i> positions presented are at least plausible</b>"</li>
</ol>
<p>Contrary to the one who reverted my change claiming "POV", I propose that my newer language in this instance goes further in <b>upholding NPOV policy</b> than does the original language, and it should be adopted. -- &#160;<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title="IS"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="IS" width="25" height="18" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a>&#160;<font color="#B53C07"><b>Guðsþegn</b></font>&#160;–&#160;<small><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_3d46.html" title="User:Guðsþegn">U</a><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User_talk%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_daf2.html" title="User talk:Guðsþegn">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_518d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Guðsþegn">C</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Gu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_319a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Guðsþegn">E</a></small>&#160;– 20:05, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Scrap it entirely. The "Definitions" section is meant to be a place for defining terms -- nothing more, nothing less -- and something as sticky as this is just too tempting for editors on both sides to burden an otherwise stream-lined section with belaboured explanations of POV. And then start revert wars when they aren't pleased with the presentation of one or the other side. Move it to the abortion debate sub-section, or perhaps a new sub-section, under "Suggested effects: Emergency contraception," or, "Social issues: Refusal clauses," dealing with issue of doctors and pharmacists who refuse to perscribe the morning-after pill and birth control for the above reasons. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 20:53, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The former "induced abortion" section was haphazard. I have created a new section, "Incidence," to contain information about the numbers of and reasons for induced abortion (and, additionally, statistics on miscarriage). Now, we need to update the information on reasons for abortion, in addition to adding statistics on the number of abortions performed annually. In the meantime, the section can also serve as a place for information on factors which influence the rate of abortions, such as sex-selection, unsafe abortion, until the social issue steps in and covers them in full. Let's find and review potential sources here. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 23:51, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've rephrased a section inserted by ZimZum about weighing up the risks of an abortion. While it raised a valid point, it sounded a little bit POV to me:</p>
<p>The original was:</p>
<p><i>The risk of complications increases depending upon how far the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> has progressed. Risks caused by the possible <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complications_of_pregnancy.html" title="Complications of pregnancy">complications of a pregnancy|</a> are subsequently avoided.</i></p>
<p>I rephrased it to:</p>
<p><i>The risk of complications occurring can increase depending on how far the pregnancy has progressed, but these risks may be counterbalanced by complications that would occur from carrying the pregnancy to term.</i></p>
<p>I don't know, I might be splitting hairs here, but ZimZum's edit didn't sound right. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamyskis_2c95.html" title="User:Jamyskis">Jamyskis</a> <font size="-3"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamyskis_5b40.html" title="User talk:Jamyskis">Whisper</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jamyskis_a771.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jamyskis">Contribs</a></font> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title="Germany"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="Germany" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 16:21, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

So what if Denmark had less abortions than the U.S. ... it also has a hell of a lot fewer people, too.

<dd>Snark attack. Sorry. "Meaningless" on its own seems to discount difficult research. Also, rhetorical questions like, "So what if Denmark had less abortions than the U.S.?" (presumably typed in the tone of, "What are you — stupid?") are themselves "snappy." It is difficult to construct anything out of constructive criticism when it comes as contentious nitpicking. Longer explanations of why something is wrong (and preferably how it can be fixed), which are removed of the sarcasm, are certainly welcome. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 00:11, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed. Cyde Weys had a point - the figures on their own were useless. He could have expressed it a little more subtlely than to trash others' hard research, but it was a valid issue. The results were certainly interesting, especially as Germany and South Africa are in general more religiously conservative (as a whole, the US just has the "loudest", as opposed to the most numerous conservatives) than the rest. I may sneak in a few more countries later on just to illustrate the contrast a bit better, and I'll take Tznkai's suggestion of including legal/illegal ratios and see if that helps.

<dd>I'd considered adding more countries, too, but avoided it again because it was bit much information to include in the summary of a top-tier article. If you can find reliable data for most countries, where do you draw the line? I said 15. I only accepted countries in which abortion was generally legal; criminalization was a convenient way to thin out the pool of candidate nations (no point noting the, say, 75 abortions legally allowed per year in Ireland, or Egypt, or any place else that restricts abortion — or is there?). I tried to include non-Western countries, but, nontheless, didn't stray too far out of the G8. Tznkai suggested that we should create an "abortion statistics" article. Maybe an "abortion incidence" article, too? -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 23:28, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article, due to its controversial nature, is already acknowledging qualifiers and popular opinions that are relevant (ie: the minority opinion that pregnancy begins at fertilization) though they differ from the positions of established authorities (ie: the medical community). That is fine. But I am disturbed that nowhere in the article (or in the discussions that I can find) is there any mention of the origin of human values. From a truly logical NPOV, humans have a radically biased position regarding the value of human life, human beings, and human children, fetuses, embryos, blasticists, and gametes. In all human societies, a newborn infant has more 'rights' than an adult chimpanzee. That is NOT a neutral point of view. I think this issue is profoundly relevant to the topic of abortion. Simply stating that, "complex ethical, moral, philosophical, biological, and legal issues have a strong relationship with that individual's value system" with a slight afternote on religion does NOT adequately address the non-neutral nature of this article. It would be far more accurate and NPOV to state something like: "People in all human societies tend to value human life above all other forms of life. The basis of this seemingly inherent bias is cultural, religious, and possibly biological." Obviously members of a social species will evolve to value their own kind above others. Our cultures and religions are a form of social darwinian selection: societies whose members believe human life is more valuable than mosquitos have more children, and institutions that indoctrinate and enforce those values create societies which survive and thrive. But ultimately, the view that human life is special is NOT a NPOV; ultimately, that point of view is biased by our culture, our religion, and our evolved psychology. Once again, this is profoundly relevant to the issue of abortion and deserves to be addressed in the article. Hadamhiram 05:54, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I appreciate Kyd's approach. Anthropocentrism should be addressed. But in sufficient detail to establish its true relevance. What bothers me about this and all other coverage of the abortion issue is that it is predicated upon massive assumptions, and the bias of those assumptions acts as a lens through which all other information regarding the issue is distorted. The truth is that the abortion issue is only an issue because the religious beliefs of some people in some societies give one particular type of biomass special status. In purely biological and rational terms, a week-old fetus has no more consciousness, self-awareness, or other emergent properties that make humans human than my left elbow or a t-bone steak. The unspoken assumption that fetuses are special because they have a spirit or soul undeniably predicates the entire issue! Laws in societies which claim to have separation of Church and state, like the US, are blatantly compromised by these unspoken religious assumptions. It is a massive violation of my first-amendment rights to make laws based on religious beliefs and values derrived thereof. Yet, no inkling of this is mentioned in the article whatsoever. To dismiss this with a pass mention of 'anthropocentrism' and to appeal to technicalities in the NPOV policy is tantamount to brushing the entire substance of the abortion issue under the rug. I don't think burying our heads in the sand or bending over backwards for political correctness is what wikipedia is all about. Hadamhiram 07:22, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, Wikipedia is not a discussion forum. We try to keep philosophical discussions to a minimum around here, as it impedes productivity, and might even create hostility. Some statement of principle is unavoidable, of course, as Wikipedians are people, and are going to be moved to share their POV at points. It's just a lot easier to make a case by explaining how you believe the article is lacking and what could be done to fix it. Otherwise, it's difficult to seperate the user's ideological statements from their practical suggestions, which, in my experience, makes it really easy to just blanket dismiss it all as "POV-pushing." I happen to agree that anthropocentrism is scientifically indefinsible. However, other editors don't share this viewpoint, and NPOV is about striking that delicate balance between accommodation and pandering. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 08:10, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There was a time when the majority of people thought the world was flat. The majority is often wrong. While it is appropriate to acknowledge the majority perception, it violates the spirit of wikipedia which is centered upon truth to give erroneous perceptions credence no matter how popular they happen to be at the time. As for conjuring images that the entire medical community of the modern world has somehow conspired to corrupt its own science with "nuanced politicized re-definitions" for the purpose of covertly defying current American cultural trends, that is well off the deep end and into tinfoil hat territory.

<p>I edited the pro-choice "core statement of belief" in the Abortion Debate section. The pro-life statement is: "Is the fetus a human being with a fundamental right to <i>life</i>?" The pro-choice one used to be: "Should the state or the individual have <i>choice</i> on the matter of abortion?" I changed the pro-choice statement to: "Does a woman have the right to <i>choose</i> whether to continue a pregnancy?" I felt this statement is a clearer representation of pro-choice sentiment. I felt the "state or the individual" part of the previous statement was confusing, especially since no pro-choicer I know advocates the <i>state</i> choosing to abort fetuses. 66.194.52.249 02:04, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think your edit wasn't fully thought out for a few reasons. 1) You can be pro choice and still advocate for father-to-be consent laws, so the mother-to-be should not be singled out. (In other words, "individual" is better wording than "woman.") 2) You mis-read the question, it's an "either / or" question -- the implication is that pro choice people believe that individuals should have the freedom to choose and that the state should not. So, to answer the pro choice question in a pro choice fashion: the woman has the right to choose, the state does not.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Health POV</span></h2>
<p>The health section lists complication after complication, and you have to read very carefully to learn that an early-term abortion is safer than carry the pregnancy to term. Hiding this fact seems very biased to me, since it would leave readers with a misleading impression of abortion's safety. In fact, even the complications mentioned apply largely to later-term abortions, particularly those in the last trimester. It would be nice if, in addition to the accurate summary I changed it to lead with, we offered some statistics on the risks. I already dug up citations for a reduced mortality rate with abortion, but it would be better if we had rates for various complications. Since the alternative to abortion is childbirth, we should also list the rates of complications inherent in it. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 16:13, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unsafe legal abortion due to unsafe (or at least questionable) tactics at licensed clinics</span></h2>
<p>Abortion has complications associated with it. That is covered elsewhere - agreed. But some abortionists are bad doctors and some clinics are more concerned about "moving the meat" (higher earnings) and minimizing costs than about women's health. Some clinics notoriously won't call an ambulance if they have a complication for fear of losing other patients from the controversy - and some even require patients to agree to the no ambulance/no hosputal policy in writing. The most aggregious events are when doctors try to hide their mistakes or even simple complications and end up killing the patient by denying them proper care at a hospital. In any event, if you are unaware of these facts, I cn understand - the media does keep them well-hidden. But they are UNSAFE ABORTIONS, not simply complications associated with abortion. Or perhaps someone can explain why there is no difference between a money-grubbing quack abortionist who does shoddy work and the abortionist who actually tries to do things according tpo protocol. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.255.126.html" title="User:84.146.255.126">84.146.255.126</a></p>

<dd>Again, agreed. The legal abortions I am speaking of definitely fall into the WHO definition as they were done either by persons exhibiting a lack of skill or within environments that ignore the minimum medical standards. Legality of abortion is not the issue. <b>Independent of prevailing legislation, an unsafe abortion is defined by the WHO as "...a procedure for terminating unwanted pregnancy either by persons lacking the ncesessary skills or in an environment lacking the minimal medical standards of both" (WHO,1993) which therefore exposes the woment to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.</b> See footnote #1 at this link from WHO's website <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:cR21ReWAGC4J:www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/studying_unsafe_abortion/+%22unsafe+abortion%22+defined&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:cR21ReWAGC4J:www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/studying_unsafe_abortion/+%22unsafe+abortion%22+defined&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>User:84.146.255.126|84.146.255.126]]</dd>

Funny how a coroner's report or a mewspaper account is not enough for you.(Or perhaps you did not even bother to read the cause of death of the women in the link?) Why would anyone be so adamant that shoddy practices by abortionists and abortion centers be remain under wraps? Do you really believe that there are no quacks out there? There are quacks who are crappy doctors just trying to make money off of poor people in every field of medicine. And abortion's whole history is rife with such people. They get away with it because abortion is usually something people are ashamed of (and also because we no have a complicit adamanatly pro-abortion media) so the news rarely comes to light to the public. But you must certainly know that even among pro-choice obgyns they will admit that abortionists who have the assmbly line abortion clinics are looked down upon generally as people who have no skills and are the scum of their profession. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.255.126.html" title="User:84.146.255.126">84.146.255.126</a>

<li>Brenda Banks: 35-year-old Brenda had a 13-week abortion at Hillcrest Women’s Surgi-Center in Washington DC on September 30, 1989. She went into shock after the abortion because of blood loss, so an ambulance was called. Despite being given a total hysterectomy and 20 units of red blood cells, she died the following afternoon. Her uterus had been perforated during the abortion and several major blood vessels had been lacerated or cut in two. When Banks family tried to sue the clinic and the abortion doctor, Llewelyn Crooks, they were unable to collect money from either, since Crook’s insurer was insolvent and the clinic carried no malpractice insurance. (District of Columbia Superior Court; “Woman died after abortion at Hillcrest in D.C.,” Defend Life, March-April 2001)</li>
<li>Belinda Byrd: On January 24, 1987, Belinda, age 37, had an abortion performed at Inglewood Woman’s Hospital. During the procedure, her uterus was badly perforated. However, she was left unattended for three hours after the abortion, and was then detained an additional two hours before she was transferred to a hospital. After being in a coma for three days, she died. Belinda was one of 74 women who had had an abortion in the clinic’s single operating room on that day, and one of 24 women who were operated on during the last two hours of the day. When paramedics arrived at the clinic, they found Belinda in a bed that was covered with blood. State inspectors contend that no post-anesthesia evaluation had been conducted. Belinda died from complications on January 27, 1987. Her mother wrote to a Los Angeles district attorney: “I am the mother of [Belinda], victim of abortionists at [abortion clinic address]. I am also the grandmother of her three young children who are left behind and motherless. I cry every day when I think how horrible her death was. She was slashed by them and then she bled to death . . . She has been stone dead for two years now and nobody cares. I know that other young black women are now dead after abortion at that address. Where is [the abortionist] now? Has he been stopped? Has anything happened to him because of what he did to my [Belinda]? Has he served jail time for any of these cruel deaths? People tell me nothing has happened, that nothing ever happens to white abortionists who leave young black women dead. I’m hurting real bad and want some justice for [Belinda] and all other women who go like sheep to slaughter.” (California Certificate of death # 87-015832; California Department of Health Services Case No. 8-0001 “Accusation”; Amici Brief by Christine Smith Torre filed in support of Appellants in Webster v.

<li>Dorothy Brown: Dorothy, age 37, underwent a first trimester abortion at a Chicago clinic on August 16, 1974. Hours later, she died from shock related to uncontrolled bleeding. The Centers For Disease Control reported a black, 37-year-old woman who died in 1974 after having a 14 week abortion at a clinic. The cause of death was hemorrhaging from an incomplete abortion. This woman was probably Dorothy. (Chicago Sun-Times, The Abortion Profiteers Series, November 12-December 3, 1978; Illinois Coroner’s Certificate of Death, # 621691; “Deaths from Second Trimester Abortion by Dilatation and Evacuation: Causes, Prevention, Facilities,” Cates, Grimes, Obstetrics and Gynecology, 58:4, October 1981, p. 403)</li>
<li>Myrta Baptiste: This 26-year-old woman bled to death on December 18, 1982, after an abortion at Women’s Care Center in Miami. Her uterus had been perforated during the abortion, and although she showed signs of hemorrhage, an ambulance was not immediately called. Myrta was 10 weeks pregnant when she went to the clinic for a safe, legal abortion. Ironically, her abortion was neither. Her death is counted as resulting from an illegal abortion because although the clinic she went to was legal, the doctor who performed her abortion was not licensed to practice medicine in Florida. Another woman, Shirley Payne, would die after an abortion at this same clinic 17 days later. (“Fourth Woman Dies After Abortion At Miami Clinic,” The Miami Herald, January 5, 1983, 1D; “Cluster of Abortion Deaths at a Single Facility,” Kafrissen, Grimes, Hogue, Sacks, Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, 68:3, September 1986, 387-389)</li>

<p>Kyd, the sources are government offices, regular newspapers, and scholarly articles. You must have missed that fact. This is simply about UNSAFE ABORTION in the USA that is well-documented. Malpractice in legal abortion is a far different phenomena than an unpreventable death caused by abortion. Surely you understand the difference. And 4 deaths at one clinic (according to the Miami Herald) is not simple malpractice - it is an "unsafe abortion" clinic - unsafe and legal and noteworthy as an example of unsafe abortion in the land of abortion-on-demand that was supposed to save us all from back alley butchers. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.255.126.html" title="User:84.146.255.126">84.146.255.126</a></p>

I edited an article to add important information. My point was made by editing despite your bullying and changing the goalposts. I did not edit to make a point in the sense you seem to ascribe to it. I don't give a rat's apples that you are an admin (that just means you can be a bigger bully, but so what? someone would have objected to this information anyway. Its what people here do - they try to keep factual information unflattering to abortion out of the article. I find it amazing that an intelligent person woudl not understand the relevance of the information. This section discusses back alley abortions. Which is always part of the saga of why abortion is now legal - to prevent such butchery. Noting that such buthery happens and that similar quacks exists despite the change in the law is noteworthy and the most appropriate place to note it is in this section. Otherwise as a minimum such infalmmatory and emotional rhetoris as back alley abortion has no place in this section. Some clinics are very similar to back alleys. Have you ever visited a clinic in a low income neighborhood? I have. You would not bring your dog there. I have given you exactly what you asked for - or please explain how I have not. Otherwise you HAVE moved the goalposts. Funny how I knew you would. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.255.126.html" title="User:84.146.255.126">84.146.255.126</a></p>

<li>While I concede the point that medical malpractice and death caused by abortion procedures is a subject of note, I'm wary of your motives for including something like this in the article, not to mention where you placed it. The problem is that death caused by incompetence, lack of due care or just plain bad luck in an abortion procedure is no different than many other procedures. People have even died from doctors taking a blood sample. This is where the argument falls flat. I don't see why incidences where such a procedure has resulted in death through incompetence can't have a brief mention under Health Effects, as long as it is worded appropriately and sources are provided. You don't need to produce a list of cases to prove your point. You shouldn't even be on here to prove a point. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamyskis_2c95.html" title="User:Jamyskis">Jamyskis</a> <font size="-3"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamyskis_5b40.html" title="User talk:Jamyskis">Whisper</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jamyskis_a771.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jamyskis">Contribs</a></font> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title="Germany"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="Germany" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 13:14, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

By a raw count, the majority of countries actually prohibit abortion except for in special cases (rape or health of the mother). When a lot of people see "is legal" they will assume what is meant is "legal on demand." <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 20:42, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for Abortion Products</span></h2>
<p>Well, I've asked before (and put it on the to-do list), but it has since been removed, and I don't see it in the article, so I'll ask again:<br />
Information on abortion by-products, research<br />
For example, cells taken from the placenta are used in research. Other things are also of use, stem-cells, etc.<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Definitions"</span></h2>
<p>I noticed someone keeps trying to add "botched abortion" and "failed abortion" into the list of definitions. I have been unable to verify that these are in fact "medical" terms, and instead seem to be neologisms created by whomever to help push their point of view. <a href="http://www.medterms.com" class="external free" title="http://www.medterms.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.medterms.com</a> only lists the following for "abortion" medical terms: artificial abortion, habitual abortion, induced abortion, multiple abortion, recurrent abortion, spontaneous abortion, and therapeutic abortion. Of those, artificial, induced and therapeutic all have the same meaning. Habitual and recurrend both mean 3 or more miscarriages; multiple means 2 or more miscarriages. Spontaneous is the same as a miscarriage. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 01:50, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Double Standard or Fake "Rule" (No shock sites or photos)</span></h2>
<p>Kyd, these following topics all have disturbing, shocking images of graphic violence within the wikipedia articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Lai_massacre_fb94.html" title="My Lai massacre">My Lai massacre</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So why is there the constant mantra here on the abortion article that no such images can even be linked to the abortion article? Why are some shocking photos of human death considered acceptable, but photos of fetal demise are absolutely censored out by you? Why the double standard? <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.245.55.html" title="User:84.146.245.55">84.146.245.55</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not a double standard. Images must be weighed according to the value they add to the article. Shock images are available for all types of surgery, but they are generally of no value to the completeness of the article. A massacre generally only has rather graphic images, and those images can add to the article. Your comparison is inept. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 21:48, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The images on those pages are not all that disturbing or shocking and are appropriate to describe the incident. They also can be very important to understanding the topic. However, I question how much value "shock" photos would give to this article to help the reader understand what an abortion is? <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 21:52, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Implied by your answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. There is no such actual rule.</li>
<li>2. Whereas it is helpful to understand murderous atrocities via shocking photos (cut the crap on whether photos of a lynched black man is shocking), it is in no way helpful to understand abortion by seeing medical diagrams of how the procedure is performed, or photos of the procedure or the fetal tissue after abortion.</li>
<li>How open-minded. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.245.55.html" title="User:84.146.245.55">84.146.245.55</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't put words in your mouth, don't put them in mine. Secondly, I limited my comment to "shock" photos, which I would define as those which include copious amounts of blood, severed limbs, etc. An image of a hanging is not the same as an image of a decapitation, for example. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 22:08, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Glad to see your somewhat open on the issue. Even <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_implant.html" title="Breast implant">breast implant</a> surgery has diagrams of the surgery within the main wikipedia article. Why is it harmful to add similar diagrams to this page? <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.245.55.html" title="User:84.146.245.55">84.146.245.55</a></p>
<p>An ultrasound of an abortion is a fuzzy black and white blob. It is in no way bloody or gross. It shows what happens - what abortion is. Why is that considered improper to link to that material? <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.245.55.html" title="User:84.146.245.55">84.146.245.55</a></p>
<p>I will be adding the link to "Silent Scream" (very tasteful clinical video that describes fetal sonograms and shows a sonogram during an abortion with POV commentary). There is no rational basis to keep the link off this page, especiallt when it is virtually the only way a person can ever witness this extremely common surgery without having an abortion (and even then, most abortion doctors won't allow the mother to witness the sonogram of the fetus at any time). <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.245.55.html" title="User:84.146.245.55">84.146.245.55</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>It's really simple: The implied purpose for shock videos is to add POV spin.</dd>
<dd>The analogies offered weren't at all analagous. Aside from the current American White House, you're not going to find a lot of people favoring torture, so there's not much controversy. On the other hand, there are large numbers of people on both sides of the abortion issue, so it's quite controversial.</dd>
<dd>Since most people see most surgery as disturbing, disgusting and generally shocking, showing such things here is not any sort of neutral act. Therefore, I fully support the continued removal of shock images, videos, and so on, including links.</dd>
<dd>If you disagree, make an argument that addresses my points. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 23:45, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a general ground rule formed by consensus; it is not the random dictat of a single user. Please note that pro-choice sites are beholden to the exact same rule, so it is not an issue of one-sided censorship, although I will admit that it is harder to find pro-choice sites which contain material which would exempt them from inclusion. <a href="http://www.womenonwaves.org" class="external text" title="http://www.womenonwaves.org" rel="nofollow">Women on Waves</a>, for instance, features a picture of the naked corpse of a victim of a botched illegal abortion.</p>
<p>The issue with torture and genocide articles is one of control. We don't edit those articles, so, we leave it to those who do to help determine the sort of content which is suitable to them. I know that Wikipedia is not censored for minors. However, I wonder if a case could be made for individual discrimination based upon "good taste." There has been a long-standing debate on the <a href="../../../f/e/c/Feces.html" title="Feces">feces</a> article as to whether the article should feature an image of a human turd.</p>
<p>Abortion pictures and shock links, however, wouldn't lend themselves to the educational and encyclopaedic value of the article in the same manner that other objected images might. You can try to claim that abortion pictures are being delivered in a neutral, illustrative context, but it's hard to defend them as being anything other than argumentative. We're trying to write an informative article, here, not a pamphlet arguing for or against abortion.</p>
<p>In Archive 12, in a thread entitled "External Links," Tznkai suggested that all the POV links in the "External links" section be done away with entirely due to its rampant bloatation and abuse. It was <i>I</i> who defended the value of such links, albeit if the list was trimmed down, regulated, and reorganized. See also: "External Links overhaul" (Archive 12), "Picture survey" (Archive 13), "Too Many Links!" (Archive 14), and "Link to 'Aborted Children'" (Archive 14) for futher precedent. I instituted the warning in the hope that it would motivate people to refrain from bloating the section with non-essential, non-informative sites. The interests in winnowing out such links were twofold: to keep the text length at at reasonable size, and, also, to avoid turning this from an encyclopedia article into a soapbox. If such links <i>must</i> be included, then move them to an appropriate sub-article, where the purpose they serve would be much more of a constructive one. I had hoped that the honour system would work and that people would be able to govern the urge to shoehorn in POV links.</p>
<p>Perhaps Tznkai was right after all. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 04:11, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Killerchahua, it seems that every diagram or photo of an abortion or how it is performed would offend you. As you say with torture, with abortion the only images that could ever exist would offend you. SO your standard seems to be "I don't like such images, and despite the fact any image of abortion would be offensive, I stand by my view that no one should see abortion images of any type because no one can learn anything from them." That is quite an odd view since every since people generally consider it good to be informed about surgery - but with abortion your view is that more information is bad. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.246.151.html" title="User:84.146.246.151">84.146.246.151</a>

<dd>It seems the only reason that images or ultra sounds are blocked from the abortion page is because some people have person issues with seeing them (which these issues should be dealt with by seeking professional help or not going to links in which upsetting images may be present.) Yes some things are shocking, the truth can be disturbing, in such cases as lynching or the holocaust. I see no reason why an ultra sound of an abortion or medically documented images of abortion cannot be a link on the page. A warning above the link that notified the viewer that images may be disturbing would be a truthful solution.</dd>
<dd>Since the abortion page is not about botched abortions, but abortion in itself, I see no reason why the fetus cannot be shown after the abortion or during a surgical abortion, as seen by an ultra sound. There are not even any links available.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Straw poll initiated by Kyd</span></h2>
<p>In response to comments posted on this page noting that there really is no rule banning so-called "shock links" (and that there is no definition for what would be banned), Kyd started a vote (poll) asking if we should censor links to images of abortion procedures or results, and he invited commentary. After several hours, the vote was 3 to 1 against such a ban. Apparently frustrated with the results, he wiped out the entire vote/poll/commentary section (within less than half a day). I am adding it back, since such an action is clear vandalism. Some people like to hide discussion, and even like to hide what happens during an abortion.

<dd>Nevertheless, you asked for input and then erased it when you did not like the input. Such straw polls are not at all forbiden. Becuase they may not be fruitful or beneficial does not mean they are forbidden - and there is no RULE against them. But to elininate a poll simply becuase you realize your position is not very good on the questioned posed - well, that is not good wikipedia behavior and can be seen as evidence of the weakness of your view. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.206.84.html" title="User:84.146.206.84">84.146.206.84</a></dd>

<dd>Not to worry, Kyd, that isn't a policy - just a general rule of thumb. I"ve seen straw polls be helpful, on occasion. Those instances were a good faith effort on the part of all concerned to get a feel for whether there was general consensus, and ppl simply signed the correct section, kept their comments to the comments section, and so on.

<p>Actually, killarchihuhua, votes followed immediately by commentary (often lengthy and including back and forth debate), is standard procedure at wikipedia when voting (here is an example:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_4" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_4" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>). The vehemence exhibited here to keep fair comments explaining a vote (or clarifying the question) off of the DISCUSSION page is VERY telling. Most people realisze that people afraid of ideas are people who don't believe or don't understand their own ideas emough to discuss and defend them - and who are not confident their own ideas will hold up when juxtaposed to other ideas.<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.206.84.html" title="User:84.146.206.84">84.146.206.84</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Linking to Images is Allowed</span></h2>
<p>Without some explanation that withstands scrutiny as anything more than an attempt to protect readers from exposure to what happens during an abortion procedure (and to sanitize the article from anything that sheds negative light, however objective, on abortion), it is hereby acknowledged that linking to abortion-related medical diagrams and ultrasound images is allowed within the main article, despite the fact that some people prefer not to view them. There is no rule nor is there any basis for banning such links. Such a ban goes against wikipedia policies. Links to other types of images may also be appropriate to provide more information about various topics within the article, and it is always wrong for any editor to claim that there is a policy banning such links or images (when there is in fact no such policy). If the article discusses coathanger abortions, then a link to images related to such abortions is appropriate for readers to click on if they so desire. Etc. 84.146.253.203</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a basis for banning such links: consensus among the editors. Consensus is the trump card here on Wikipedia, so until you have more support, your link will not be part of the article. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuasipalm_6524.html" title="User:Quasipalm">Quasipalm</a> 17:31, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>You both have it backwards. The original problem is that the across the board banning of illustrative links was done WITHOUT consensus or discussion. It was just announced. That is the problem. Thats not how it works. I am sur eyou all realize that. I have never even attempted to link to any images. Its about the principal that such links are automatically banned and deleted without any discussion on the merits. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.237.55.html" title="User:84.146.237.55">84.146.237.55</a></p>
<p>You have no more authority to declare abitrary rules than I do.

<p>There is no "no shock links rule". And there is no definition of "shock links". Right now your definition is "links I don't like". That will not do.

<dd>Which requires a discussion of the link before simply banning it. You can't speak for what most editors would think. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE A DISCUSSION PAGE - TO FIGURE THAT OUT! Yet the very attempt to discuss this was BANNED! Amazing. I am sure you are not prouid of that fact. You cannot be. Its shameful. It makes it look like there is something to hide. You may want to encourage another approach. "No discussion on the discussion page" is a shitty policy. Currently, as of the last tally, the links should be allowed (the vote was 3 to 1 in favor of such links before the losers pulled the discussion). Since the side that was losing banned discussion of the topic, they have to live with the consequences of censoring without consensus. Last known consensus is to allow links. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.237.55.html" title="User:84.146.237.55">84.146.237.55</a></dd>

<dd>The silent scream is, to say the least, not an objective depiction of abortion. It is making a case against abortion, using emotive (and incorrect in many instances) language. Coupled to that it is outdated, made in 1984, and our understanding of the foetus during development during the last 20 years has progressed markedly. If you want a consensus on this particular link, I assure you this consensus will be against it - it IS a shock link. | <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaully_efd5.html" title="User:Spaully">Spaully</a> 18:40, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I crawled over their (Silent Scream) content.... I had no idea that 'organized crime' was behind Ob/Gyn medical facilities. (er, yup, that's actually in one of their movies, no joke).&#160;:-) The Silent Scream movie procedure is a suction aspiration procedure (only one type of abortion), and the language used is fairly over-the-top. It doesn't meet my standards for "shocking", but it's clearly an advocacy piece, and intentionally misleading (and inaccurate) at times. It probably doesn't belong in this article page, just because it's not about abortion as a whole (it's only about one procedure, and clearly advocacy), but it may be suitable for one of the deeper pages. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 01:42, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm familiar with this as well, and agree with your conclusion. It's pure POV, and not even the sane, measured sort. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 04:24, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Ronabop. I personally wasn't "shocked" when I checked it out, but I did find it to be complete and utter POV garbage. However, it was inteded to shock, and there has been a consensus in the past about not including purposefully advocacy-driven shocking links. &#160; ⇔ &#160; <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParallel_or_Together__1f4b.html" title="User:Parallel or Together?">| | ⊕ ⊥</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParallel_or_Together__26d2.html" title="User talk:Parallel or Together?">t</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parallel_or_Together__f6e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parallel or Together?">c</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Parallel_or_Together__2560.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Parallel or Together?">e</a>) 10:16, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>External links are for garnering more information on a specific topic. The links you post are not informational - they are to pictures that are displayed to deliberately push a point of view across, and it is for this reason that they are not allowed. I would even say that the link at <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silent_Scream_e5b2.html" title="Silent Scream">Silent Scream</a> is inappropriate, and would it be at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-life.html" title="Pro-life">pro-life</a>. Silent Scream isn't intended to give information, it is intended to shock. Sites such as the NRLC and Prolife UK provide useful info on the views of pro-life individuals and are thus just about OK, but in their nature they belong only under <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-life.html" title="Pro-life">pro-life</a> for people looking for more info on those views, and not in an article like this one because they are inherently biased and not useful. I'm sure you'll get it one of these days, 84. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamyskis_2c95.html" title="User:Jamyskis">Jamyskis</a> <font size="-3"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamyskis_5b40.html" title="User talk:Jamyskis">Whisper</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jamyskis_a771.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jamyskis">Contribs</a></font> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title="Germany"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="Germany" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 13:26, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Might it be worth semi-protecting this page permanently? It seems to me that 99% of constructive edits come from people who have been Wikipedians for a while, and it seems to be a major vandalism target. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamyskis_2c95.html" title="User:Jamyskis">Jamyskis</a> <font size="-3"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamyskis_5b40.html" title="User talk:Jamyskis">Whisper</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jamyskis_a771.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jamyskis">Contribs</a></font> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title="Germany"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="Germany" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 08:01, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The level of vandalism is not high enough to consider protection. We usually don't semi-protect this article because the issues are usually borderline - extreme POV pushing is a content dispute, not vandalism. Futher, there is no "permanently semi-protect" at this time. George W. Bush is the closest thing we have, and it is vandalized on the order of once a minute when un semi'd. In other words, no. Does not even meet the level of vandalism required to semi, let alone consider keeping it semi-protected. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 10:19, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know the issues with 84 are more content dispute than anything, I usually see vandalism regularly cropping up on here, and it seems we spend so much time dealing with extreme POV issues and vandalism that little is managed these days. Still, given the circumstances that semi-protection should be used in according to the Wikipedia guidelines, I see your point. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamyskis_2c95.html" title="User:Jamyskis">Jamyskis</a> <font size="-3"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamyskis_5b40.html" title="User talk:Jamyskis">Whisper</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jamyskis_a771.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jamyskis">Contribs</a></font> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title="Germany"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="Germany" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 11:09, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, but I don't know if you noticed that the edits changed. Maybe you forgot to look? (I didn't put revert the last time.)

<dd>Sorry if I assumed incorrectly, but the anon's reverts were in exactly the same style as yours, and contained the same material. There is no consensus to alter the community's decision to not include links to shock sites.
