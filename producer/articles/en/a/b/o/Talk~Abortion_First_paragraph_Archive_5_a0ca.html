<dl>
<dd>I've added expulsion, in response to Killa's objection over murder; while it is certainly strong language... a basic human right is also strongly worded and placed last. Making the paragraph ultimately sympathetic to abortion, yet making it crystal clear what the opposing views are. As to wordiness... dunno how to fix that, but I think Ann's proposal does the trick and flows well. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 14:48, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's a significant improvement over what we've got now.

<dd>Actually - a minor point - the opening sentence is slightly ambiguous with "its death" - the death of the nearest singular noun, the womb?

<dd>Actually, I'd strike the entire last line, starting with "Opponents consider...". Completely unecessary to put Abortion debate in the intro to Abortion.

<dd>Unlinked political; doesn't add anything. Actually public should be added too; as that is what differentiates the debate now and the debates that happened in centuries past among politicians/philosophers. No... I got it, replace both with mainstream! Moved "Various" sentence up to the first paragraph; as its ackward in the bottom one. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 18:00, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Moved female up in the sentence to resolve grammar thing; perhaps ultimately female should just be deleted... as embryo and fetus are linked. I think it could be fair to assume a person knows what a fetus is. Perhaps removing it, and putting woman in the "commonly" sentence would be best? - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 18:06, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Female sounds really strange. If anything, it should be <a href="../../../u/t/e/Uterus.html" title="Uterus">uterus</a>. I think you are slightly misrepresenting the medical definition. It isn't that the medical definition's main purpose is to ignore LTAs. It's that the medical definitions includes miscarriages but not stillbirths (and a case can be made that LTAs are technically not abortions(1), even if they are an induced abortion(2) procedure [considering two different definitions of the word abortion]). The common definition never includes miscarriages. I think it is pushing it to have 'death' in there twice. As it stands, there are 3 definitions of abortion. The 1st definitions stemming from the OR of WP editors trying to be "neutral". Then an explanation of the POV definitions [(1) and (2)], except, as I said, the medical definitions isn't exactly explained that well.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think a solution might be to just give the common definition first, then comment on the medical definition and miscarriages. something like "Abortion commonly refers to any induced procedure that aims to terminate a pregnancy through chemical, medical, or other means. Abortions procedures are contrasted with live births in that abortions result in the death of a fetus/embryo. Medically speaking, the word abortion refers to any premature termination of a pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestation. This includes miscarriages which are technically called spontaneous abortions" etc, blah blah. I feel that these are the concepts that should be presented in the definition. The order and wording can be debated, but I think when we start to change the basic facts, or introduce different concepts, we start to loose sight of our sources.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 22:35, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The wording of this seems a bit of a mess - does no-one else find the sentance about spontaneous abortions odd? ([Abortion] can occur spontaneously, in which case it is referred to as a "spontaneous abortion" (or <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a>))</dd>
<dd>Slim introduced it as the correct medical term I believe, but in my experience and a search of pubmed returns 25,785 results for 'miscarriage', and 'spontaneous abortion' 13,491. This suggests a split in the medical community, and in colloquial usage I've only heard 'miscarriage' used. This might be different across the world, but the current explanation seems clunky.</dd>
<dd>Might not this suffice: [Abortion] can occur spontaneously, in which case it is referred to as a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a>,..</dd>
<dd>Which links to an article which in the first sentance introduces both terms?</dd>
<dd>Secondly the addition of the 'various methods' sentance to the end of the first paragraph seems to reiterate what is said immediately before it. I feel this was better off in the second paragraph.</dd>
<dd>Besidses those, I prefer this version to the current version and would support an upgrade (although so far the latest proposal by AndrewC is my favourite). Hopefully something can come from these pages! |→ <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaully_efd5.html" title="User:Spaully">Spaully</a>°<a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpaully_5e32.html" title="User talk:Spaully"><i>τ</i></a> 00:25, 22 April 2006 (<a href="../../../g/m/t/GMT_24fe.html" title="GMT">GMT</a>)</dd>

<dd>Changed the 2nd death to "terminates"; merged historical sentence, female &gt; uterus. Put in Andrew c "Medically speaking, moved commonly first and moved "20th century" to be with "historical" mention. Better flow. Replaced second refers with "defined as".

<dl>
<dd>Hmmmm... didn't we want to avoid the word "pregnancy"; as it is non-specific and may not be terminated with selected reduction etc. Or is having "a" in front sufficient to clarify a singular pregnancy is being terminated.

<dd>It's not perfect in my eyes (and I have a feeling I am very hard to please on this topic,&#160;:P), but I think it works. I personally see no problem with the word "pregnancy" because selective reductions are not "common" and you state specifically that you are talking "commonly". Furthermore, 'temination of pregnancy' is used by a majority of the cited definitions. My only concern would be what Severa raised awhile back about giving undue weight to viable/LTA. Her suggestion was to just say along the lines of "Abortion commonly refers to <i>any</i> induced procedure that aims to terminate a pregnancy of any gestational age".--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 02:04, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, in the first sentence it seems odd to split "removal of an embryo" with "from a uterus". I would rearrange the order of the sentence. And about 20, I will look through the cited sources and dig out the ones that specifically say 20. I was leaning towards "non-viable" but other editors took issue with that word. The definitions that reference 20 all would fall under non-viable, but the definitions that reference viability do not necessarily work if we say 20 (if that makes sense).--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 02:18, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm just saying whether 20 should be written numerically "20" or spelled out "twenty". Usually for small quantaties the latter is preferable stylistically. I acknowledge the split, I rearranged, but the reason I did it the other way was because GTB noticed "its" refers to the last thing mentioned; which would be "uterus" now. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 02:24, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, and I hate to be a pain in the neck, but the more I read it now, the more it sounds that way to me.

<p><b>SlimVirgin version:</b></p>
<p>An abortion is the expulsion from a woman's uterus of the products of conception, a process caused by, or resulting in, the death of an embryo or fetus. This process can occur naturally, in which case it is called a sponanteous abortion or miscarriage, or it can be caused deliberately by trauma, or by chemical or surgical means, where it is called an induced abortion. The word "abortion" is commonly used to refer to induced abortion alone.</p>
<p>The ethics of induced abortion are the subject of intense political debate in many parts of the world. Those who oppose allowing women to seek abortions usually consider the embryo or fetus to be a fully human person from the moment of conception, and therefore regard induced abortion as morally equivalent to murder. Proponents of allowing induced abortion prioritize what they see as the right of women to control their own reproduction, and consequently regard access to safe, legal abortion as a basic human right.</p>

<dd>Looked at SlimVirgin's version and added "natural", "artificial", "ethics" to the definition. Removed "mainstream" that's debatable and infrequent mainstream subject. If we were to include a synopsis of the debate maybe it would look like this? Although I understand we don't want the lead to be overtaken by the debate, it seems approriate to its weight and notability. It also clarifies this is about women; as I've consciously have removed women from the 1st paragraph. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 05:13, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I originally had uterus that way, and I do consider it to be the least awkward way to express it; the problem is it implies "the uterus" belongs to the embryo of fetus, so that forces it further down the sentence. "gestational week twenty" is strange, as I rarely see the word "gestational" and all the medical texts I've read specify the timeframe then follow it up with "gestation". And if I understood Andrew c correctly, the medical definition of "abortion" encompasses spontaneous abortion too; not just induced abortion. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 03:26, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, good points as usual. Regarding the uterus, I too considered both versions and personally find your original version more encyclopedic in that it does not mention embryo/fetus twice. Leaving it in for now, feel free to change. Gestational week twenty - agree, changing it back. One question - we now have "before week twenty" - shouldn't that be up to/including (i.e. before week 21)? Re medical def: right again, but version 4.3d has other (worse I think) problems in the sentences <i>The word "abortion" is commonly used (...) twenty weeks of gestation</i> in that a "perfect" copyedit would require the repetition of the full defs in these sentences, including the word death in the final sentence. The former is awkward, the latter awkward and loaded so to be avoided. My solution was mainly the better of two evils in the simple context of a copyedit - i.e. without adding, changing or removing the meaning/intent of 4.3d. Having said that, the change you're suggesting is quite simple so I've made it in version 4.3f ("all abortions" instead of "abortion"). <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 13:17, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have a slight preference for "the" in encyclopedic definitions, mainly because it indicates a single/specific item whereas "a" is more ambiguous - it can e.g. also mean one out of several/many.

<dd>Why do we seem to be sticking to 'before twenty weeks'? I have yet to see compelling reasoning as to why that is better than '<a href="../../../v/i/a/Viable.html" title="Viable">viable</a>', which is explained on the linked page, and is more correct and is supported by more medical definitions. Using '20 weeks' is just a way of (roughly) quantifying the concept of viability, so does not solve any issues with using such a definition. I would suggest for the last two sentances:
<dl>
<dd>Generally "abortion" refers to induced abortion at any gestational age; however, medically speaking abortion is defined as any termination before the fetus is <a href="../../../v/i/a/Viability.html" title="Viability">viable</a>.</dd>

<dd>In regards to viable: Homestarmy and a few others objected to the word "viable" (even though it was used by a number of our cited sources). If you scroll up the page a bit, you can see that discussion where we compromised on an actual gestational age (also supported by some of our cited sources). I personally prefer viable, but I was willing to compromise in order to attempt to save my proposal. Being a cynic, I think that we should just use my proposal because the people who voted reject, but didn't come and try to reach consensus or offer a counter proposal, shouldn't have a say in the matter. If you are going to vote against something without trying to make it better or offer an alternative, what does your vote do, besides impede progress? (and there were a few people who voted reject and did discuss here on talk. I feel that some minor changes discussed above could sway their vote to approval, at least until something better comes along). My problem with all these 4.x proposals is that not many people are helping out with this process. Hardly anyone who voted reject is here. So we may feel like we have another proposal that everyone here can agree upon, but for all we know, some editors who do not care about helping out on the talk subpage could come along and vote reject again.

<dd>Fully agree with KillerChihuahua. Also, the part after "world." has many problems (I've listed a couple of them, and a possible solution, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAbortion%2FFirst_paragraph&amp;diff=49431917&amp;oldid=49410276" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAbortion%2FFirst_paragraph&amp;diff=49431917&amp;oldid=49410276" rel="nofollow">here</a>) so I won't support it anywhere in the article, least of all in the intro. I would support something like it if the problems had been solved. Nevertheless, I think it would be best to wrap up paragraph 1 and try to get it past previous poll participants before taking on paragraph 2.

<dd>Replying to <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a>, the 20-week definition is just that - a definition - so it isn't a question of its accuracy so much as a question of how accepted that definition is.

<dd>Str1977: Please take a look at our cited sources (somewhere in archive 18) and the footnote in my proposal <a href="../../../a/b/o/Talk%7EAbortion_First_paragraph_9d59.html#One_more_time.2C_drive_for_improvements" title="Talk:Abortion/First paragraph">here</a>. Just because you do not feel that a definition meets your personal standard of what is "accurate" is not a valid excuse to ignore our sources. To be NPOV, we need to simply report our sources, not <b>judge</b> our sources. Medically speaking, a miscarriage is a type of 'abortion', but no one, in common parlance, uses abortion in the manner. Similarly, 'abortion' is technically defined as a termination of pregnancy before the fetus is viable. Keep in mind that there is a difference between what we commonly call the "induced abortion procedure in humans" and what medical dictionaries generally define as "abortion". Two different meanings, two different contexts, two different POVs (hence my two definition proposal weeks ago). Additionally, "late-term abortion" is not a medical term. Search through the literature at pubmed, and you will be pressed to find 'abortion' in reference to third trimester procedures, (though it is there occassionally because of the common use of the word). Finally, the number of abortions that occur at a gestational age when the fetus is viable is around .08% (around 1,000 a year). We need to avoid giving this topic undue weight in the opening paragraph.

<dd>Adopting AvB's 2nd paragraph suggestion, but removed "political"; also changed "any termination" to "a termination" in 1st paragraph. I would like either "ethical" or "moral" to be removed as they are redundant and slows the flow. I feel "In the 20th century" should be removed as well; as it is possibly presumptious to consider modern debates in the media to have marked the beginning of "intense" debate on this subject. (I would still feel that way if "political" was still there, as I can visualize political giants debating this issue prior to the dark ages, let alone the 20th century.) - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 02:27, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I remember correctly, the "political" preface was introduced to put the "in the 20th century" bit into context. The majority of the coverage of the debate in this article pertains to debate from the 20th century onward and the majority of debate in this time frame was political (well, at least, it's certainly a lot briefer than the more accurate, "intense political, social, medicial, economic, religious, spiritual, and psychological debate"). If you get rid of one, you might as well get rid off both, because the two are something of a matched pair.</dd>

<dd>In the UK it is normally not known as abortion but as a termination. Medically it is invariably referred to as such. Does the US medical profession use the word abortion as a technical term? I'd be quite surprised if they did. Also it should IMO be removal or expulsion, not the other way round (it reads better). Why don't we use the formal definition from an accepted medical text? At least some texts define abortion as artificial termination of a pregnancy before the fetus is viable; that is less loaded than talking about "the death of the fetus". At least some terminations are precisely because the fetus stands little or no chance of independent viability. Of course, there is the fundamental problem that abortion is mainly a political, not a medical debate. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 16:46, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, this article is rather US-centric. As such it can't leave out the POV of a large minority who believe termination is murder from day one (conception). The paragraph one discussion is an attempt to create a introduction that will be acceptable to all parties. To be frank, I am moving towards the opinion that it will prove impossible to create a common text and that the article needs to describe the main POVs separately. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 19:29, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For precisely that reason - that the debate is political - I think it would make sense to tackle the controvery in a much more head-on fashion than we've been discussing. The two sides of the debate don't even agree on the definition, and yet we state the definition before we admit there's a debate, thus supporting one side's definition. I don't have an exact set of words that does what I'm thinking of, and I'm not trying to stymie progress on this V5.0, but I really think the best solution is to confront the controversy <i>more</i> directly. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 16:51, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>GTB: I agree. Perhaps we could start from something like <b>Abortion</b> is a vernacular term for termination of a pregnancy. It is usually understood as meaning a medical intervention to remove an embryo or fetus, generally before the fetus becomes viable, although it may be used to describe certain miscarriages (<i>spontaneous abortion</i>), and in some cases it may be conducted in the third trimester of pregnancy by which point the fetus may be viable, known as <a href="../../../l/a/t/Late_term_abortion.html" title="Late term abortion">late term abortion</a>. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 18:07, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was thinking more head-on. Let's see....
<dl>
<dd><i>An <b>abortion</b> is a type of termination of a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a>. The definition of abortion is not universally agreed upon. From a medical perspective it is variously defined as XXXXX, YYYYY, or ZZZZZ.&lt;/ref, etc.&gt; From a legal or moral perspective, some define an abortion as any procedure resulting in the death of an embryo or fetus.&lt;/ref&gt; Others dispute the validity of this definition.&lt;/ref&gt;</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That's more of a template for a suggestion than an actual suggestion, and I don't mean by introducing it to take away from the idea that 5.0 should go live if it nobody explains why it isn't better than the status quo.

<dd>I think it actually does. But note that this may well lead the "average" reader to expect an article that separately describes the various POVs, e.g. giving worldwide statistics of these views. Creating an article lead along these lines is not, perhaps, a light step to take, letting the genie out of the bottle so to speak. But I'm by now more than halfway convinced it's the way to go, also in connection with a developing general appreciation of the scale related watershed period I think Wikipedia is going through these days. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 19:56, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An <b>abortion</b> is the removal or expulsion from the <a href="../../../u/t/e/Uterus.html" title="Uterus">uterus</a> of an <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryo.html" title="Embryo">embryo</a> or <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetus</a>, resulting in or caused by its <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a>.

Generally, "abortion" refers to induced abortion at any <a href="../../../g/e/s/Gestational_age.html" title="Gestational age">gestational age</a>; medically, it is defined as a termination before twenty weeks of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a>.</p>
<p>There have been various methods of inducing an abortion throughout <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_abortion.html" title="History of abortion">history</a>.

<dd>Implemented my tweaks, JzG's "removal or expulsion" (which forced me to switch "resulting in or caused by") and SlimVirgin's suggestions. Then Ann's and Spaully's suggestions complimented each other along with Killa's support; so "pregnancy" is a must have that got lost in the shuffle... and removes repetition to boot! Unless of course its "unmedical", then we can put back <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">gestation</a>.</dd>

<dd>I still have a problem with the death part. Most terminations are conducted before the foetus is viable; while some may consider that the word death is appropriate in this context, I would be hesitant to suggest that this is a majority view in the world let alone a consensus view. As an aside, I was informed with great solemnity by a fundamentalist that the contraceptive pill is equivalent to a murder a month. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:32, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I concur for the most part, especially with the viability part... but only in respect to miscarriages; since the fetus wasn't meant to develop to begin with. So saying it "dies" is innaccurate as its a "false start" so to speak, however it is in keeping with how abortion is used commonly and acknowledges the seriousness of this issue in non-technical summary style wording. Even though the wording may not be the majority <s>view</s> wording; that is dictated by political correctness and polarization around abortion and not an accurate reflection of this issue. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 15:07, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see this as much of an improvement on the current version. It does fix some minor wording issues, but it introduces some others. It does nothing to address the "death" issue raised by many (and still concerning to a few new editors as well, as seen by a number of comments above). It removed the awkward mammal sentence with an awkward sentence about the 'medical' definition. I do not really consider this a new proposal, just a few minor changes to what we already have. All that said, I'd support making these changes, but feel it does little to solve the conflicts that brought about this subpage months ago. Furthermore, I still feel the medical definition is being explained poorly (as my first comment stated a couple of screens up). I feel that you cannot just strip out miscarriages from the medical definition, because that seems to suggest that the only defining aspect of the medical definition is the viabilitly clause. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 13:33, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I want the medical explaination expanded a bit too. Okay, can you really convince anyone that "viability" is the majority definition in the medical community. I know you have many sources; but who is the authority on these bioethical matters? A university? A doctor? A medical association? I suppose its all of them combined. And how do pro-life doctors define it? (PS: I added miscarriage to medical definition)</dd>

<dd>Just as a matter of interest, what would be wrong with starting along the lines of: <i><b>Abortion</b> is a lay term for the medical termination of a pregnancy.</i> The fact that the pregnancy is terminated says everythign we need to know about the fate of the foetus. In the UK I am pretty sure there are recorded instances of foetuses delivered alive following terminations in the third trimester (around 24 weeks) demonstrating independent viability and being saved. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:19, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some editors really dislike the word "termination" because they feel it is a euphemism. I happen to disagree with them, but the argument has still been made. Also, in the U.S., there are a very small number of abortion procedures after viablity that still result in the death of the fetus. Either something is given to the fetus to cause death before the procedure, or the actual procedure kills the fetus by 'ripping it apart', or 'sucking its brains out'. Therefore, because of this very small minority of abortion procedures (that technically aren't "abortions"), many editors have expressed that they feel the main goal and purpose of an abortion procedure is to get a dead fetus (as opposed to simply terminating a pregnancy. They claim that a livebirth also, technically speaking, terminates a pregnancy, despite the medical literature using terminate with another connotation that is akin to abort). Also, the third trimester starts at the 28th week.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 14:01, 2 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's no more a euphemism than carcinoma, deceased, fracture or any other medical term. Termination of pregnancy is precisely technically accurate. The death thing is also bugging me; it seems that we are being asked to state that abortions result in death because one particular controversial procedure, used in a very small minority of terminations, specifically requires the foetus to be rendered lifeless. That seems to me to be undue weight. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 14:26, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Don't get me wrong, I agree 100% with you. I'm just trying to update you on the other side's position (that can be found in the archives pages).

<p>Termination is a great word and does follow the technical verbiage already adopted in the first sentence. But, we adopted "embryo/fetus" because they were more accurate and straight forward words. In the case of death; it is more straight forward and simple (but of course with emotional/political baggage), so I agree termination is preferable especially with miscarriages for accuracy. (however consider this hypothetical, we become so advanced in the future; a miscarrying pregnancy can be removed, put in an artificial womb and saved... point being its viability can be merely a reflection of our ability to save it) There is however a nuance and tone that death provides that I consider appropriate. Others disagree, mostly I believe that is because they have grown use to their carefully selected verbiage on the issue.</p>
<p>While they are correct death is pro-life angled, "fetus" is pro-choice angled. Pro-lifer's have a point in that abortion isn't simply a neutral medical procedure. This is a matter of compromise; but moreover it is a fundamentally important balancing act of tone and mutual respect for points of view. I am implementing all the above changes to Version 5.2 and reverted 5.1 to its original wording; I'll ask some users if they are acceptable and will implement the new lead when I get satisfactory feedback. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 15:45, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, "usually" needs to go. If anything, the "20 week" part needs to go and be replaced with "non-viable". I still think we need to address the "death" issues that have existed for months, and have recently been brought up again by JzG. I don't like "Generally". I would prefer commonly or in common paralance or something referencing the fact that this is a popular definition. On top of that, I think we should say "the induced abortion procedure" not just "induced abortion". Slightly unrelated, for some reason, I can't help feeling like G&amp;E did months ago when there was a perceived consensus for my proposal. Should we make a poll and take it to the main talk page, or just assume that everyone's silence is support? I still think that this version is only marginally better than the last, and doesn't address the big POV issues that started this whole section. But if I am the only one concerned, I'm not going to push anything.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 00:57, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't like common parlance anymore; I'll change generally to commonly right now though. Good call. I'll be bold and remove "usually". Tweaked your proposal to link to LTA properly. I have no trouble adding the LTA mention as you have it; if you think it doesn't add undue weight. Were you able to successfully rebut arguments of "rare" being a POV/OR word?</p>
<p>I'm also unsure how adding "procedure" clarifies anything. The first instance could be inaccurate (not all are "procedures") and the second while more appropriate just says "induced procedure", what is that? And I just don't see the medical definition needing it to be a procedure. Trauma and abortificients cause induced abortions prior to 20 weeks, but I doubt they are procedures. Right?</p>
<p>As to "death" I'll argue anyone to the ground on that. I simply have not heard of anything (apart from "termination") that comes close to replacing it. The only rationale I can come up is we use neutral terminology in the rest of the first sentence; why not carry that to the end. For some reason all the "issues" we've had over it, actually makes me think it was the correct decision. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 02:11, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry it took my awhile to get back to you. I never convinced the few objectors that "rare" was an acceptible term. They argued that any statistics coming from AGI were biased, and that anything over 1,000 (even if it is under 0.1%) is not "rare". But, they didn't convince me abortions on viable fetuses weren't "rare" either, so its a stand off. We could always add it and let other editors change it, but that may lead to an edit war. I think that "procedure" is a very important aspect of the common definition. When someone says "I had an abortion" they mean that they had an induced abortion procedure. If someone is in a car accident and loose their baby, they may say they miscarried or something else. Abortion is not the common word here. Medically speaking, the fetus was aborted, but commonly and abortion (i.e. induced abortion procedure) did not occur. But I won't push it too hard.</dd>
<dd>As for "death", I think this is a very touchy subject. We have a large number of definitions that do not mention death. Because the debate is framed around life vs. death, death is in particular a sticky word. And furthermore, it seems unnecessary to mention death. Meat causes death, but why is this word not mentioned in the first sentence of that article? Chemotherapy causes the death of cancer cells, why is this not mentioned in the first sentence? The reason why death is so important, is not because someone may accidentally think the word "abortion" is refering to a live birth, but within the context of the greater debate, framing a fetus' death is closely associated with arguments for personhood. I think this is shown by some individuals wanting to qualify death with "cellular" or wanting to change "fetus" to "products of conception", and other individuals strongly opposing this because it is the fetal death that is significant to their POV, not the death of cells, or the death of the placenta (which scientifically 'die' just as much as the fetus). My biggest concern is that abortion can obviously be defined without referencing death, and including death seems superfluous and arguable borderline POV pushing.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 00:40, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see where you're going with on procedure, and I was about to add it. But then I looked at the Wikipedia definition for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procedure.html" title="Procedure">procedure</a>. As its defined as treating "disease" or "injury" in the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgery</a> lead; I think this could cause more problems than it addresses. I gave Google a quick look and both PubMed and Pro-Life doctors refer to it as a procedure, so I'll go ahead and put it in; but I won't link it as I had planned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed "death" sucks, but as I mentioned prior "fetus" and "embryo" suck for pro-lifers, and it can be maintained that terminology is borderline POV pushing for pro-choicers. Death provides the balance I think is required and essential. I had already come up with a potential solution, which is putting back the paragraph about the debate which mentions "murder" and "women's rights". This allows strong language from both perspectives and makes the mention of "death" less necessary in the first sentence. Without a solid pro-life perspective in the lead, death is staying, as it is sympathetic to the other perspective on abortion. Not only that, but death is more encyclopedic (in some respects) than "termination".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What irks me about "death", isn't the fact its pro-life language etc. etc., but that pro-lifers insist it has to be in the first sentence. As I don't see it as a necessity but rather editorial decision on our part it does bother me it has been forced there.

<dd>Ackoz is correct. Suggest:</dd>
<dd>An abortion is the removal or expulsion from the uterus of an embryo or fetus, resulting in or caused by its death. This can occur spontaneously as a miscarriage, or be artificially induced through chemical, surgical or other means. Commonly, "abortion" refers to an induced abortion procedure at any point in the pregnancy; medically, it is defined as a miscarriage or induced termination before twenty weeks gestation, which is considered nonviable. The exception is a "missed abortion" in which the embryo or fetus dies but is not expelled. Missed abortions are usually followed by spontaneous abortions.</dd>

<dd>Well, it fits - the term itself is in decline, and our own Missed abortion is a redirect to Miscarriage, because almost always a missed abortion is followed by a spontaneous - but not always, in which case a surgical abortion is called for. And I can dig up a source for that but currently (here on talk) I am speaking from personal knowledge - my grandmother had a late in life pregnancy which resulted in a missed abortion, and they had to do the surgical version on her. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 20:42, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think cause by its death still covers missed abortion. Granted it occurs in two stages and involves natural and artificial elements... but it was initially "caused" by the death of the fetus, then required further intervention to "remove" it. I'm unsure we need to spell that out, just as mentioning late-term abortions in the lead isn't a "must have"; one can infer it from the Commonly definition. Likewise, although missed isn't mentioned, the first sentence is structured with or's so that "removal of the fetus caused by its death" is one way to read it.

<dd>Well, we could also write something along the lines of "aimed at" or "intending" - which then makes clear why a "missed abortion" is "missed" or a "failed abortion" is "failed".

<dd>That would be applicable in the case of a failed abortion but not a missed one. In a missed one, the pregnant woman has every intention of carrying the pregnancy to term and delivery (or at least has done nothing otherwise) but the embryo or fetus dies within her.

<p>You could've searched it yourself. Let's use the official WHO (World Health Organisation should be a trusted source, oder?) definition of abortion:</p>
<p>Abortion is termination of pregnancy (expulsion or extraction of embryo/fetus) before 22 weeks of gestation or below 500 g weight of fetus.</p>

<p>Yes .. and we can use the whole definition (even with the expulsion or extraction) as the main idea of the definition is "termination of pregnancy", and missed abortion is a terminated pregnancy. <a href="../../../a/c/k/User%7EAckoz_4ac0.html" title="User:Ackoz">ackoz</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg_c483.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cb/Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg/20px-Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg_c483.html" /></a> 21:24, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, nothing you've said here adequately addresses the reasons we had the intro the way we did. Namely, you're choosing, like medical sources choose, to frame the defintion of abortion in a way that assumes the pro-choice side of the debate. To define abortion as WHO does is to grant that the pro-life side is just wrong, and that abortion is <i>not</i> a life and death issue, fundamentally. I'm not a huge fan of the other version, which essentially grants the pro-life side the opportunity to frame the debate, but I was hoping to do some work on the to-do list before resurrecting that particular dead horse. Nevertheless, here we are. The definition you're suggesting is POV, <i>and</i> you're ignoring, not even deeming worth reply, the months of reasons backing up the version you don't like. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 22:31, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You rang? 500g vs. 20 weeks vs. viablity. They all relate. It is extremely rare for a fetus to survive outside of the womb before 20 weeks gestation. It is rare for a fetus under 500g to survive. Because not all pregnancies are the same, there is not one single thing that you can point to and say "ah ha, if we took the fetus out now, it would survive". This is why I prefer the more vague term "viable", even if it isn't as precise as a numerical criteria, or combination there of. Anyway, I think fetal deaths under 500g are not considered neonatal by some definitions. It's all about relatively arbitrary categories for statistical purposes. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 04:20, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well said, but is 500 grams part of enough medical definition(s), and if so do you consider it notable enough for inclusion in the abortion lead?

<dl>
<dd>It seems to be part of a substantial proportion of the medical definitions we've seen here. The thing with medical definitions is, as Ackoz has reminded us, they're more "diagnostic criteria" than definitions. Medicine allows for some grey area and doesn't worry too much about it. In general, if it's before viability, usually taken to be around 20 weeks or 500 grams, then it counts. If it's borderline, then you make a judgement and call it something. Doctors are comfortable with that kind of "definition" because they're neither philosophers nor mathematicians. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 06:53, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ackoz, you have no idea what my personal beliefs are. Let's not bring those into it. Your assertion that WHO has nothing to do with pro-life or pro-choice is... questionable. I don't happen to think that the current version is ideal, but... have you read the backlog? Wikipedia is not a medial sourcebook, it's written for a general audience. It's important to include the medical definition, but that doesn't mean we pretend it's the only one. For a lot of people, abortion is defined differently. There is not universal agreement that WHO's definition is the only valid one. There is a widely held belief that WHO's definition is an exercise in euphemism. We can't just steamroll that notion under the carpet. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 22:41, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Just to make a terribly outrageous proposal, but why not simply use my two definition version as a more stable, but still temporary place holder for the illusive white whale of a "perfect" opener. I feel that the 2 definition version deals with the POV issues better by not attempting to create a so-called 'neutral' definition that neither side seems to be able to agree upon. The biggest concerns were that G&amp;E and patsw didn't think the scientific POV was 'accurate', and AnnH thought putting the scientific view first was giving it too much prominence. Maybe these issues can be tackled another day, but we could ease a number of the "death" concerns with my version (that still includes the death POV). I only bring this up because we have a version that a large number of editors have had their hands in, so we may not need to start from scratch for the 4th time. But I agree strongly with GTB that too much time has been invested in these few phrases when there IS still a to do list. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 04:28, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All I needed at the time was a solid rationale that put the medical definition first in an encyclopedia (addressing AnnH's concern) and I would have gone with it. I asked for help on that and didn't get much, so I dropped it rather than trying to come up with and enforce something on my own. We do have the two definitions, the only potential problem I see is "death". No solution I've seen will resolve that any time soon. As to pro-choicers feeling entitled to removing an injustice; simply because of a word that has political connotations in their eyes... ain't a compelling reason to change the lead.</dd>

<dd>Anyway, yes... new bold editors engaging in edit wars needn't concern the entire abortion article; unless we feel the need to re-engage in another circus... soooooo, for the record I'd support Abortion/First paragraph now that I've tweaked out mass media and put in the new stuff that is agreed upon in the current lead. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 05:45, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmmmm... but I still see nonviable as a problem, as you just pointed out above there is no solid criteria for that. But I have stated to Homestarmy's objections that viability doesn't need to be foolproof in order for medicine to include viability in its definition.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">WHO Intro</span></h2>
<p>GTBacchus, I am not interested in your personal beliefs. I already participated in the discussion KillerChihuahua pointed me to. I have read enough. Read the article <a href="../../../w/h/o/WHO_9ed1.html" title="WHO">WHO</a>. In healthcare in general, ther is no bigger autority on Earth. Moreover, the definition I proposed is the "codified" definition of abortion in most of the countries I know about - it is used to create statistics of mortality and birth-rates etc., and is unified because the data must be comparable. So now we have two definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official definition of abortion, as used in legal systems and by health care providers worldwide.</li>
<li>A result of a long discussion of Wikipedia editors, who are mostly unqualified and pushing their POV in either pro-life or pro-choice direction. A hybrid. The intro doesnt't even contain factual information about the 500 g limit - which defines abortion (i.e. the article as it is now is factually inaccurate). One of the problems with editors of wikipedia is, that they think that the consensus they reach in their petty little arguments represents the ultimate wisdom.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>I suggest that we change the intro to contain the "WHO" definition.</b> <a href="../../../a/c/k/User%7EAckoz_4ac0.html" title="User:Ackoz">ackoz</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg_c483.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cb/Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg/20px-Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg_c483.html" /></a> 23:07, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia, as RoyBoy says, isn't a medical sourcebook. Abortion, it turns out, is not <i>just</i> a medical procedure. It's also a controversial social and religious issue. In that context, the medical definition is irrelevant to many, for whom the only important thing is whether or not a developing human is being killed. If abortion only means pre-viability, then "abortion opponents" shouldn't have any problem with so-called "late-term abortions", right? I'm not even certain the medical definition is the most widely used one, which doesn't make it wrong, it just doesn't get a monopoly in the intro. <a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 07:02, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is the WHO definition still an issue? If so, it may help to know that their definitions are mainly intended for statistical (reporting) purposes (see <a href="../../../i/c/d/ICD_10d0.html" title="ICD">ICD</a>). The purpose of these definitions is NOT to inform the lay public on the nature of the disease/condition/intervention in question. Also, the ICD is only legally binding in connection with (inter)national stats etc. of countries that have adopted it. Obviously it isn't legally binding for an encyclopedia in general, let alone in an article mainly describing induced abortion. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 00:37, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In a medical sense, the word abortion refers to any pregnancy that does not end in live birth. In the debate, however, abortion is almost always used to mean "induced abortion," as contrasted to "spontaneous abortion" or "miscarriage".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>While it is more neutral, this prose is less straight forward "does not end". Also describing something by a negative is unencyclopedic IMO... unless of course that is how it is actually defined; and the medical def. seems conspicuously non-specific. The second sentence is great. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 18:37, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Uhm, abortion <i>is</i> defined in contrast to carrying a pregnancy to term, so that's perfectly normal. Note, however, that there is no D word here, yet it's quite clear and accurate. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 04:36, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My comment on "actually defined" was in regard to its medical definition; and that may be how medical sources define it. I understand you regard the sentence as better than our current first sentence; and something like it should be adopted so that we can avoid death.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I contend it is less clear as it specifies what abortion is not, rather than what it is. This approach wasn't used for that reason... "not a live birth" defines abortion, but it does not explain it. With that description it can allow the fetus to be absorbed by the mother and be called an abortion; while that doesn't occur of course, not defining what abortion actually is doesn't help one understand it. I agree its accurate and appropriate for a sub-page on abortion. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 06:20, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It would be fairly useless to define an aardvark as an animal that is not an elephant. After all, there are more precise, positive definitions available. In contrast, we define an axolotl as a salamander that, even when sexually mature, does not leave its larval stage.</p>
<p>The question, then, is whether abortion is more like an aardvark or an axolotl. I suggest the latter. The hint is that abortion is a catch-all for any pregnancy that is not carried to term, for whatever reason. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 06:26, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, I should have tweaked "doesn't help one understand it" to "doesn't clearly encompass it". I agree it encompasses and defines abortion, but what it comes down to, is using "not live" or "not born" or "not carried to term" is less clear and not summarized; and especially using positive words like "live" to describe a termination simply isn't the right direction and swings the first paragraph pro-choice. If anything the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_in_the_United_States_e65c.html" title="Abortion in the United States">Abortion in the United States</a> lead should be tweaked first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, "death" biases the first sentence to pro-life; however not decidedly so. Many pro-choicers disagree; but I believe that is occuring because they have gotten use to their own politically correct verbiage on the issue; and have a real distaste for pro-life's reliance on such emotive language. Wikipedia doesn't rely on it, just uses it when appropriate; this cultural war of words needn't dictate acceptable words. There is of course good reason to not like "death", as fetuses that miscarry had no chance at a full life as they were non-viable (although its still technically correct that it dies); hence my growing preference for "termination"... although terminations failing is its a big word; not something we want a lot of in a lead and/or defining sentence. (in the medical definition context its appropriate)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Death" remains clearer and shorter (more encyclopedic) than "does not end in live birth", while "termination" is more neutral. The United States lead doesn't change that in my opinion, rather that lead is a very subtle reminder of western countries cultural war of words... as does the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion</a> lead, although more overt of course. Which is not ideal, but okay given the rest of the lead is sympathetic and neutral to abortion. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 18:18, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only problem I have with the dreaded "D" word is that for humans in most countries in the world there are specific legal definitions for life and death requiring registration and (usually) certificates. By using the word "death" here it effectively accepts the position that life begins at conception which is not accepted legally or by many people. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 16:26, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's part of the unfortunate baggage of the "death" term. Death isn't merely biological, it is inherently a legal status. Consider that a person can be declared legally dead after being missing for a few years. More delicately, consider that someone considered dead in one jurisdiction may be considered alive in another. This is not a mere triviality: remember Terri Shiavo? "Death" is not only legally and emotionally encumbered but controversial. Contrast this with the neutral, medical "does not end in live birth". <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">User:Alienus</a> 17:07, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The problem however is, Sophia and Ali, that if we leave out the D word because of your baggage concern we might prevent any POV deductions on one side but start up POV deductions on the other side ("no problem with abortion) and also misstate biological reality, namely that death occurs. "Legal" death is another matter and the declaration of someone missing to be dead does not, as you will undoubtedly agree, kill that missing person, if still alive. The Terri Schiavo case is completely off topic, as she was both biologically and legally alive. Otherwise there would have been no legal struggle, no matter how anyone thinks about that issue. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 17:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, that's exactly wrong. The whole issue in the Shiavo case is that she wasn't alive. Sure, she had a heartbeat but her brain was fried. This is a fine example of two different meanings of death, and the legal mess that these differences cause. The phrase "does not end in live birth" does not have the baggage that "results in death" does, which is why it's preferable. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 19:33, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since we are talking about the d-word again, I'll restate my position. While a certain form of death does occur (obviously cellular death), other, more common uses of the word death are debated. Because one side thinks that the death of the fetus IS the defining aspect of abortion, it seems POV pushing to slip that aspect in. We have a large number of medical sources and dictionaries that can define abortion without using the d-word. I do not think that someone is going to come to wikipedia, have no idea what an abortion is, read our opening paragraph, and concluse that a premature birth or c-section is actually a type of abortion. My solution was to admit that there are POV in any definition, and to use two different definitions (medical vs. common, where the latter did use the D-word, just not in the lead). Finally, I think bringing up Schiavo is relevent because a significant portion of her brain was dead. It is a sticky issue, and death (at least one of the less common usages of the word) did apply. Similarly, a less common use of the word death obviously applies to an aborted fetus, but more common usages of the word are debated. Not being clear about what we mean by "death", or bringing that debate up in the first sentence seems to belong more to <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_debate.html" title="Abortion debate">abortion debate</a> than defining the actual procedure. If we can define <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemotherapy.html" title="Chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> without mentioning the death of the cancer cells in the lead, if we can define <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meat.html" title="Meat">meat</a> without refering to the death of animals in the lead, etc, I think we can define abortion without menting death in the lead. I think everyone agrees that the d-word does slant things towards a POV. (just as adding the death of animals in <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meat.html" title="Meat">meat</a> would tilt towards the vegetarian POV). --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 18:49, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The common definition of abortion is not universally agreed upon because of moral disagreements. Some define abortion as any induced procedure resulting in the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a> of an embryo or fetus.

<p><b>Comments:</b></p>
<p>Wikified and merged with version 5.2. The first paragraph should remain a straight forward definition; the moral quibbles aren't relevant to defining what an abortion is. Moved "moral" as it implies one is moral and the other is not; placed it at the beginning as a definition can be agreed, but the morality is at issue. Added "common" as the technical definition (1st paragraph) is not in dispute.</p>
<p>There are two problems with this version for me, putting termination (a technical term) in the defining sentence; and almost brings back the "debate of abortion" into the "abortion" lead. Although this time, we are focused on the definition of abortion itself... so might be alright. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 19:20, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We are on the same page with sidestepping, that's why you and I supported "death". But termination hasn't really claimed by any one side, although it is slightly pro-choice as a technical term; so seems to be the best word.

What I'm getting at is there actually isn't meaningful multiple definitions on what abortion is; rather there is multiple perspectives (morality) expressed as a matter of style rather than substance (objective description). Placing the controversy first doesn't seem encyclopedic, and could actually confuse the reader into thinking there is controversy over what an abortion actually is (rather than a controversy over the moral implications of an abortion).

<p>Ending eh... seems a poor word to use... as if the fetus was a story that is ending. Terminate is technical (hence pro-choice), already used in the lead, but I prefer it over "ending". The reason ending sounds wrong, is even though "termination" is technically part of its <a href="http://www.answers.com/ending&amp;r=67" class="external text" title="http://www.answers.com/ending&amp;r=67" rel="nofollow">primary definition</a>; it is hardly ever used in that context.

<dd>Alienus, technical language simply is not neutral, any more than emotive language is - one side sees it as a technical concept, not an emotive one.

<dd>Noted, but any language that situates abortion in technical (rather than emotional) terms is inherantly pro-choice. (after all, doctors who perform abortions use that word!) While I entirely agree its neutral, hence my preference for it, I cannot ignore the fact such language is considered POV by pro-lifers (removes moral considerations); similarly death is considered POV by pro-choicers (can imply personhood). However, since Wikipedia articles should indeed be sympathetic to its subject; termination is appropriate weight wise... at the same time despite appearances, I'm not in a rush to make version 6 live. Mainly because I'm concerned technical language is inappropriate for the defining sentence... then again we have embryo and fetus in the lead already; but termination could be pushing it for the first sentence. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 22:24, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The current live version seems the best one avaiable, since neither side with an agenda to push could feel that their POV is adequately represented in that version. While some (primarily those with pro-choice inclinations) may contend that including "death" in the first paragraph is biased, the same could be said by others (generally those with pro-life convictions) regarding the lead's use of "fetus". That said, the term "death", even if viewed as somewhat inaccurate, seems to be a more suitable description for what occurs to the fetus than a "termination" or "ending". The current version balances some perceived emotion with a healthy dose of reasoned text - why change it? By the way, kudos to everyone involved here for the sprit of co-operation and willingness to compromise.

<dd>Excellent point. I guess it depends on what definition of "embryo" you are using, but there has to be a way to clear that up. I always felt that "termination of a pregnancy" is a very very common phrase used in the cited definitions. However, some users objected because a) in the case of selective abortions (a minority for sure), the pregnancy isn't ended, just one (or more) of the multiple implants are removed and b) some users felt "termination" was a euphamism, although I was never convinced of this argument. Termination is used in the medical literature, in dictionary definitions, etc. Also, there are uses of the word "terminate" that connote negative things (terminator, exterminate, etc), so I don't see how it is used to 'soften' the reality of abortion. Maybe the next version could slip in "termination of a pregnancy" somewhere?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 00:14, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So is "termination of pregnancy" weighted--weighted towards sterility and a hiding of what takes place during an abortion. Would you rename the article "death" to "termination"? Would you say that terrorists "terminate" civillians? No. That's ridiculous. And POV. Again, we have a compromise here, between two competing and implacable POV's. The use of "death" is usually applied only to living human beings, which is why it isn't applied to cells and ova--and precisely why it <i>is</i> appropriate for this article, especially as we do not note in our definition that a human life, not a clump of random cells, is the object of an abortion. To adopt my definition would take the article too far to the pro-life POV; to adopt yours would take it too far pro-choice.</dd>

<dd>I haven't formed an opinion on the use of 'death' yet but I don't really agree with the argument you're using BCSWowbagger when you said "Would you rename the article "death" to "termination"?" It's not a valid parallel example - civilians are clearly fully formed individuals whereas there is no current concensus (and there won't be one here right now) on whether embryos/fetuses are in fact individuals. Still Cooper-42 should've obviously proposed the change on the Talk page. If there are others interested I think we should open it up for debate/vote? - I may have missed it but I didn't see a clear dissemination on the usage of the word 'death' in the archive you pointed out. --Artificialard 05:32, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was not trying to draw a direct parallel to the article. I was drawing a parallel to Cooper-42's argument, where he complained that we don't use "death" for cells, and trying to show that neither my parallel nor his were valid - cells are clearly not individuals and there is a strong consensus on that, so obviously we wouldn't use "death" for them, just as we wouldn't use "termination" for full-formed human beings. My point has been, and continues to be, that we have a compromise definition, that shares in language from both POV's in order to acheive the most delicate of NPOV balances. If we open death/termination up for a vote, I propose we do the same for "embryo and fetus" with "living human being," a motion that was proposed and struck down several weeks ago on the very POV grounds with which I am arguing. --<a href="../../../b/c/s/User%7EBCSWowbagger_cab9.html" title="User:BCSWowbagger">BCSWowbagger</a> 07:43, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah. A change of tactics, I see. However much we might like to pencil abortion into single categories that suit us best (and may make things easier to write), as a broadly-spanning encyclopedia, we can't just refer to it as a medical issue. If it did not cause the death of the embryo, no one would care about abortion; we have to acknowledge <i>why</i> people care in our lead paragraphs. That is, we must consider not merely the medical dimension of abortion, but also the ethical and moral dimensions in our opening. At least, that's the way I see it. Seriously, man, you may not mean to, but you are coming across as desperately pushing a POV in an attempt to bury this simple biological fact around which the entire abortion debate turns. Artificialard: thanks for understanding. If you come up with a good idea, I'd be glad to hear it, but I fear this one may be as impossible to fix as the famous WikiProject: Abortion Stub template. --<a href="../../../b/c/s/User%7EBCSWowbagger_cab9.html" title="User:BCSWowbagger">BCSWowbagger</a> 21:38, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having just "An abortion is the removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus from the uterus." would make the term abortion include c-sections and natural births. Talv: the fetus is definately alive the question is if that living thing is a person yet. After birth (and the umbilical cord is cut) the living creature is now an individual human. Calling it a person before birth is POV as is saying that it is not a person, saying that it is not alive is wrong. BCSWowbagger: I wouldn't say that "death" is only applied to "living human beings", death can be applied to any living creature (including a fetus), death can definately apply to horses,dogs, cats etc... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.97.4.189 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.97.4.189_3b26.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.97.4.189">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Hmm... true on all counts, Mr. Unsigned. I bow to your correction. --<a href="../../../b/c/s/User%7EBCSWowbagger_cab9.html" title="User:BCSWowbagger">BCSWowbagger</a> 21:55, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
