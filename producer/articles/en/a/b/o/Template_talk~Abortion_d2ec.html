<dd>It was originally listed as a form of medical ("chemical") abortion because, in the "Surgical abortion" sub-section of <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion</a>, the term is used to describe "an injection to stop the fetal heart" in four sources. However, until the article <a href="../../../f/e/t/Feticide.html" title="Feticide">feticide</a> is updated to reflect these sources, feticide probably shouldn't be listed as a medical abortion.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/o/Template_talk%7EAbortion_d2ec.html" title="Edit section: Abortion by Country">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Abortion by Country</span></h2>
<p>People looking for information about abortion in a particular country would find it very handy to have a link to the page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_articles_about_abortion_by_country.html" title="List of articles about abortion by country">Abortion by country</a> somewhere in this template. The link is in the "See also" section of the article. but needless to say that section is tucked between the references and the main body of the article, and is difficult to find. This template does have a link to "Abortion by country" but it is oddly listed under the "Law" heading, and if someone does click on it then they will be confused that countries are not listed.</p>
<p>If a person is looking for the Canada article on abortion, for example, it is not listed. If they click on “Abortion in the Americas”, then the Canada country article still is not listed. This is bound to be very frustrating.</p>
<p>Therefore, I suggest to replace the link at “Abortion by country” with the list of articles about abortion by country. Thus, Wikepedia users will be able to speedily find the article about abortion in Canada or any other country. If they desire further information about abortion by country, then they can click on the link at the bottom of the list of countries, titled “abortion by country.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the heading “law” is inappropriate regardless of where “abortion by country” links. The stuff under “abortion by country” is not limited to “Law.” Therefore, I suggest changing the “law” heading to “Nations and Laws.” Ferrylodge</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it looks like Severa beat me to it, and changed the link. It's much better now. I have also modified the heading.<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerrylodge_0ba1.html" title="User:Ferrylodge">Ferrylodge</a> 00:37, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The heading "Nations and Laws" was recently changed to "Law and Society." My main problem with this is that the link "abortion by country" is not about law at all. Moreover, we already have another heading that includes “Social Issues”, and so it’s unclear what the difference is between “Society” and “Social Issues.”</p>
<p>I would suggest changing the heading “Law and Society” to “<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_articles_about_abortion_by_country.html" title="List of articles about abortion by country">Countries</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_law.html" title="Abortion law">Laws</a>” while perhaps deleting the link to “abortion by country.” <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerrylodge_0ba1.html" title="User:Ferrylodge">Ferrylodge</a> (<a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerrylodge_6045.html" title="User talk:Ferrylodge">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ferrylodge_eb88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ferrylodge">contribs</a>) 03:19, 15 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

"Society" is a simpler, broader alternative to "nations" or "countries," as articles in the "Abortion by country" series don't only discuss things on the national level, but also on the societal/cultural level, as in sections on the abortion debate, public opinion, or religion (for example, the "Judaism on abortion" sub-section of <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_in_Israel_43bc.html" title="Abortion in Israel">Abortion in Israel</a>). -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 12:04, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my (limited) experience, abortion is only considered a form of "birth control" if it is elective, rather than therapeutic or spontaneous. I agree "birth control" should be linked somewhere in the template, but the template currently suggests that all abortions are used as a form of birth control, doesn't it?<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerrylodge_0ba1.html" title="User:Ferrylodge">Ferrylodge</a> 05:05, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Birth control" encompasses everything from barrier methods, IUDs, spermicides, hormonal contraceptives, sterilization, natural family planning, to abstinence. It doesn't make sense to categorize "birth control" as a form of abortion. Abortion is/can/may be a form of birth control, but birth control cannot be a form of abortion. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 14:27, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good point, if we put "birth control" under "forms of abortion", "other", then it might imply that birth control is a specific technique of abortion. I suggest we instead put "birth control" under "social issues". "Sex-selective abortion" (for example) is already under "social issues", and sex-selective abortion can be performed in a wide variety of ways. Like sex-selective abortion, abortion for birth control involves the intentions of the person engaging in it. You do agree, don't you, that therapeutic and spontaneous abortions are not normally considered "birth control", right?<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerrylodge_0ba1.html" title="User:Ferrylodge">Ferrylodge</a> 17:05, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I have no objection if it is added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Abortion&amp;oldid=111584311" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Abortion&amp;oldid=111584311" rel="nofollow">like this</a>. However, inserting it at the top, as an assertion that abortion is generally a form of birth control, is not accurate, IMHO.<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerrylodge_0ba1.html" title="User:Ferrylodge">Ferrylodge</a> 18:36, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But, of course, Severa has reverted, with this edit summary: "You said I'd had support for my change, and yet you have no support for yours. Why is for you to go ahead but not me? Absence of response is not an invitation to go ahead." I find this edit summary difficult to understand. Severa, when did I say that you "had support" for your change? More generally, do you have any disagreement with what I said in my previous comment, or are you reverting for some other reason that you have not as yet described?<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerrylodge_0ba1.html" title="User:Ferrylodge">Ferrylodge</a> 06:50, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Undent) Edit summaries are character limited and can't be changed so it's easy to make typos. It should have read "You said I'd had no support for my change" and "Why is it okay for you to go ahead but not me?" Basically, I'm in agreement with Andrew c: you can't revert other people's edits, demanding that they be "discussed" first, but let your own edits pass without discussion or approval. Fair is fair. Wikipedia does not operate on a double standards. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 07:46, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Severa, when did I ever refuse to discuss something that you wanted to discuss? When did I ever object to an edit while refusing to even address the arguments in favor of the edit? The answer is very simple: never. You are violating the most basic principles of Wikipedia by reverting edits while refusing to address the arguments in favor of those edits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What edits have I ever made to this template that passed "without discussion or approval"? And even if I did make such edits, how could I possibly control whether some of them "pass without discussion or approval"? Why not try to explain why you disagree with the arguments presented above? It really doesn't impress me that you consistently agree with Andrew C. about everything. That is not an argument, and it is not an explanation.<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerrylodge_0ba1.html" title="User:Ferrylodge">Ferrylodge</a> 08:52, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In a earliar post, you stated, "<i>There is still not a consensus for adding “birth control” to [the top of] the template.</i>" However, there is still no consensus for adding a link to the article <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_control.html" title="Birth control">Birth control</a> anywhere else in the template, but you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AAbortion&amp;diff=111774121&amp;oldid=111617445" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AAbortion&amp;diff=111774121&amp;oldid=111617445" rel="nofollow">went ahead and made such a change</a>. You are not above being subject to your own standards, so, if there is no consensus to support your suggestion, then it is <i>not</i> acceptable to just go ahead forward with the change anyway. Forcing your change <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AAbortion&amp;diff=111776770&amp;oldid=111774666" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AAbortion&amp;diff=111776770&amp;oldid=111774666" rel="nofollow">a second time</a> was uncooperative, it flew in the face of your request for discussion, so, yes, you were edit-warring. You'll also note that I reverted to a version of the template without any mention of birth control. If I'd reverted to the "Part of the birth control series" version, then, yes, I'd have been edit-warring, because I would have been trying to ensure that my version came out on top, but by reverting you I was simply sending us back to the drawing board and ensuring that your edits are subject to the same standard of consensus (<a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a>) as mine. After all, fair is fair.</dd>
<dd>Actually, I don't care either way whether <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_control.html" title="Birth control">Birth control</a> is linked in the template, I just don't believe it is appropriate for it to be linked in the "Social issues" section. The connection between between abortion and birth control, as a social issue, is tangential at best. You might as well link to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Security_fb66.html" title="Social Security">Social Security</a> as being an issue in the abortion debate, because one editor above suggested that abortion has had a negative impact on Social Security, or to link to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarchy.html" title="Patriarchy">Patriarchy</a>, because it has been said that opposition to abortion often stems from a patriarchal mindset.</dd>
<dd>I once objected to the inclusion of the article <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion</a> in <a href="../../../b/i/r/Category%7EBirth_control_861e.html" title="Category:Birth control">Category:Birth control</a>, because I understood "birth control" to be strictly a synonym of "contraception", and, thus, the suggestion that abortion was a form of birth control (that is, contraception) was inaccurate and played into the hands of the individuals that argued "abortion should not be used as birth control" (see Talk:Abortion, <a href="../../../a/b/o/Talk%7EAbortion_Archive_21_0eae.html" title="Talk:Abortion/Archive 21">Archive 21</a>). I took the fact that both <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Goodandevil</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a>, editors on completely opposite sides of the abortion fence, disagreed to be an indication that I had been incorrect. Abortion is objectively considered to be a form of birth control, if "birth control" is defined as efforts to limit both pregnancy and birth, as it is at <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_control.html" title="Birth control">Birth control</a>. It doesn't make sense for one article to adhere to one definition, and another to a different one; Wikipedia should strive towards consistency. When people suggest that abortion should not be used as birth control, what they really are saying is that is that they think it shouldn't be about convenience, or used as a quick fix. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 10:50, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>[edit conflict]Ok, reviewing the edit history. Feb 22nd, Severa added "Part of the birth control series" line. That stood for basically a week. Then on the 27th, Ferryodge came to talk and made a case to move the BC link. 9 hours later, Severa responded making a case for not moving the link and 2 and a half hours later Ferrylodge responded with a new proposal to move. Everyone seems to be getting along and acting civily. Good work everyone so far. Roughly 20 hours after Ferrylodge's last post, and with no replies in support or opposition to the last change, Ferrylodge edits the article to impliment the proposal. An hour later it is reverted to Severa. Half an hour, Ferrylodge reverts (in a sloppy manner that erases some neutral edits, but no big deal there) back before BC was even in the template (this was a good move because neither side had support for their edits). Severa replies on talk. Still everything looking fine. An hour and a half after Severa's last reply on talk, Ferrylodge replies. 12 hours go by with no reply, so Ferrylodge insterts the BC link back into the article, which gets reverted 5 minutes later. 18 minutes, and Ferrylodge reverts back, an hour later, Severa reverts where the article has since stood. The talk page discussion falls apart. Both parties get off topic and start attacking each others editing behavior.</dd>

<dd>It seems like Ferrylodge is operating under 'silent consensus'. If no one responds to him, it must be assumed that he has support for his changes. However, on two occassions, he only waited 12 hours from mentioning something on talk to making the change. People sleep, people live in different time zones, people work, and people are not always in front of a computer. If you are in a content dispute you should be more patient, give editors more time to respond, and simply DON'T edit the article in a controversial way while the dispute is ongoing. This means, wait for everyone to agree on the change. Everyone must work together. If two people can't agree on something, get a RfC or 3rdO, or go to a high profile, topical article and ask for editors to throw in their 2 cents. You two were working well together in the beginning. Ferrylodge just jumped the gun (which in itself isn't a big deal). I guess both parties got defensive and impatient and were revert happy. I suggest neither party edit the article in regards to the BC link until we all agree on something here on talk. If it takes 2 weeks, so be it. Our reader will have to live without the link for the time being.</dd>

<dd>All that said, I agree with both sides, but I'm leaning towards Ferrylodge. The issue on whether abortion is a form of birth control has been debated in the social realm. On top of that, spontaneous abortion isn't really BC, and non-elective abortion may also be seen as not BC. On the other hand, a link to the BC article in the "debate &amp; social issues" section isn't helpful because the article doesn't discuss this debate or social issue. It has a fairly bland quick summary. So the article "Birth Control" isn't part of the "abortion series". And also, in common language, "abortion" refers to the induced procedure, not miscarriges. So as you can see I am torn and can't help settle this. So I will for the time being support a version that does not include the BC link at all.-<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 16:19, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Like I said, I don't have a preference either way regarding inclusion or exclusion, I only think that a link doesn't belong under "Social issues," and that this probably isn't a matter worth devoting a stubstantial amount of discussion. MamaGeek's suggestion was a good one and I thought I'd have a go at trying to implement it somehow. I hoped that making abortion-related articles a subset of the birth control <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_series_3a8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Article series">article series</a> would create an association that might draw more of the people who edit articles related to birth control to help build the articles related to abortion. There's certainly a precedent for these kinds of connections: see <a href="../../../t/o/r/Template%7ETortLaw_cd6a.html" title="Template:TortLaw">Template:TortLaw</a>, "Tort Law: Part of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_law.html" title="Common law">common law</a> series," or <a href="../../../s/e/x/Template%7ESexual_orientation_45f1.html" title="Template:Sexual orientation">Template:Sexual orientation</a>, "Sexual orientation: Part of sexology."

<dd>Generally speaking, this is not a big deal. Also generally speaking, I think it is bad practice to revert an edit before the reverter is ready to explain the reason for reverting. If a reverter reverts before being able to defend the reversion, it (1) gives the impression that the reverter is not interested in anything that has been said in defense of the edit, and (2) does not give the reverter an opportunity to consider the matter thoroughly. IMHO. Perhaps there is a Wikipedia policy on this somewhere, but it seems like common sense.<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerrylodge_0ba1.html" title="User:Ferrylodge">Ferrylodge</a> 19:01, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the "Surgical - rarely performed" sub-heading as space is limited now that there are columns under the "Forms of abortion" heading.

<p>You did a great job on the formatting, I found the two-column approach interesting. However, in implementing it, I think some important info was lost and some dubious info was added. I reverted some of the changes; here's what I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it's important to point out that <a href="../../../s/u/c/Suction-aspiration_abortion.html" title="Suction-aspiration abortion">Suction-aspiration abortion</a> and <a href="../../../d/%26/e/D%26E_8075.html" title="D&amp;E">D&amp;E</a> make up the vast majority of abortion procedures in the world. Without pointing that out, it's not clear that the other forms are very rare. When you created two columns, that info was removed. Now, when compared to the number of abortions performed in the first trimester, abortions in the second and third trimesters are performed very infrequently. I realize that <a href="../../../s/u/c/Suction-aspiration_abortion.html" title="Suction-aspiration abortion">suction-aspiration abortion</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilation_and_evacuation.html" title="Dilation and evacuation">dilation and evacuation</a> are listed first as of now, but in the future, someone might decide to alphabetize the types of abortion, and the distinction would be lost. If not this way, let's find a way to preserve the distinction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is no mention of <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortifacients.html" title="Abortifacients">Abortifacients</a> in the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical.html" title="Medical">Medical</a> abortion article, so the former should not be listed under the latter.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I missed any other changes, please let me know. I also added <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misoprostol.html" title="Misoprostol">misoprostol</a> to the Medical abortion section, and created a "circumstances" section for "feticide" and "selective reduction" as these aren't really "forms" of abortion. Looking forward to your feedback! <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoie_de_Vivre_996f.html" title="User:Joie de Vivre">Joie de Vivre</a> 18:54, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look at the other templates listed in my post above, like the ones on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">Homosexuality</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, and see how they do not attempt to convey detailed information about the subjects that are linked. Navigation boxes are for linking together articles; detailed information belongs in an article. While it's one thing to arrange the types of abortion into surgical, medical, and other, that is done to give the template structure and order. Trying to have so much information conveyed by the template is overwhelming. It's the same story as at <a href="../../../a/b/o/Image%7EAbortionLawsMap.png_6b0f.html" title="Image:AbortionLawsMap.png">Image:AbortionLawsMap.png</a>, where a couple of times U.S. or Australian states have been added, but were removed because trying to convey that level of information in a map is too overwhelming visually. When I was originally toying with the two-column system, I tried having rarity of an abortion method noted with an asterisk, as in, "D&amp;X*", and at the bottom of the second column there was "<small>*Rare</small>" — so that's what I've readded to the template. I also added a text warning to the code asking that people not rearrange the surgical abortion methods alphabetically.</dd>
<dd>The inclusion of <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortifacient.html" title="Abortifacient">Abortifacient</a> is based upon <a href="../../../b/i/r/Template%7EBirthControl_811f.html" title="Template:BirthControl">Template:BirthControl</a>, where it is linked as "Herbal/Drug," so I have relinked to it in the template under that title. The definition provided in the opening of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_abortion.html" title="Medical abortion">Medical abortion</a> is as such: "<i>A medical abortion is a type of non-surgical abortion in which a drug is used to induce the abortion.</i>" Thus, it makes sense to link to herbal/drug-induced abortions under "Medical," rather than "Surgical."</dd>
<dd>I removed the link to <a href="../../../f/e/t/Feticide.html" title="Feticide">Feticide</a> as the article now deals primarily with the criminal act of injury caused to a fetus as a result of an attack against a pregnant woman, and not a method of abortion, as it once did. As for the "Other" heading, I know it is an awkward catch-all, but, basically, it was intended as a place into which to sort forms of abortion that were not specific methods but rather broad categories which could include more than one method (i.e. <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selective_reduction.html" title="Selective reduction">selective reduction</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Late-term_abortion.html" title="Late-term abortion">late-term abortion</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-induced_abortion.html" title="Self-induced abortion">self-induced abortion</a>).</dd>
<dd>Also, your reversion removed the important distinction between induced abortions and spontaneous abortions, which was added as a result of discussion above. Hope my reversion and changes manage to address some of the concerns you've raised. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 01:05, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Alternatively, the template could be removed from the feticide page, but I think the better solution would be to restore feticide to the template.<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerrylodge_0ba1.html" title="User:Ferrylodge">Ferrylodge</a> 06:56, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to the Feticide article, "feticide," as a term, can apply to basically any action which results in the death of a fetus, from physically assaulting a pregnant woman to an induced abortion. At least <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selective_reduction.html" title="Selective reduction">Selective reduction</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-induced_abortion.html" title="Self-induced abortion">Self-induced abortion</a> are, in some way, limited in definition, the former refering to an abortion intended to reduce the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy, the latter to an abortion induced by oneself. Feticide, on ther other hand, refers to no particular method of abortion, and, moreover, does not even specifically refer to just induced abortions. I think it's too broad a term to be useful in a template about abortion. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 03:47, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Feticide is not a form of induced abortion, so it doesn't belong there on the template. The term itself has many meaning: a legal term to refer to an abortion or caused death of a fetus without the mothers permission, or a medical term synonymous with abortion (or the process sometimes used in a late-term abortion to kill a fetus before the procedure). The article itself is only slightly larger than a stub and doesn't give much information on the topic related to abortion (focusing mainly on the legal aspect). So the one paragraph related to abortion I personally do not believe is notable enough to include a link on the template. Think of all the articles on wikipedia that have one paragraph on abortion. Why does feticide deserve a link anymore than those? I support removing the link, but would not oppose it being restored to the 'law and society' section if a majority arises to restore the link.-<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 01:42, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The vast majority of dictionaries explicitly define "feticide" in terms of a "fetus". Very few mention anything about an embryo. That goes for medical dictionaries as well as other dictionaries. So, feticide, is mainly about a very specific type of induced abortion.</dd>

<p>Can we try to avoid ping-ponging between versions of this template? Every time you make an edit to this template, it has to update the template across every single page it is featured on, which amounts to a lot of server strain, especially if you're making several edits consecutively. I'd hate for this template to end up protected like <a href="../../../l/g/b/Template%7ELGBT_b2d6.html" title="Template:LGBT">Template:LGBT</a>, but, maybe that's what the situation calls for, because everyone is essentially working against each other and there's really no sense of cooperation at the moment (also, protection might be a good preventative measure, as I'd imagine this is a high-risk template). I've tried to accommodate as many concerns as I reasonably can, but, in terms of the two-column arrangement, I'm putting my foot down, because it's a lot neater and more streamlined than the previous version. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 22:37, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>FWIW, I think the two-column format is fine. However, I would appreciate if "feticide" would be reinserted into the template where it had been for quite a while. I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Abortion&amp;oldid=112518982" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Abortion&amp;oldid=112518982" rel="nofollow">reinserted it today</a>, but that has been reverted (without explanation).

<p>No reason to have something like "paternal rights" in one section and "fetal rights" in another.</p>
<p>The section on "Law and Society" can be moved to the top. It is probably of more interest than technical details about the various different forms of abortion.<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerrylodge_0ba1.html" title="User:Ferrylodge">Ferrylodge</a> 16:51, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Joie, you haven't given any explanation why "paternal rights" should be in a different section from "reproductive rights", <s>or why "fetal rights" should be deleted from the template. Is it because you don't personally believe in fetal rights?</s></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You have made a lot of changes in the template today. I'd like to put "abortion by country" near the top. "Abortion by country" is <i><b>not</b></i> just about law. For example, the table of contents for <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_in_the_united_states.html" title="Abortion in the united states">abortion in the united states</a> includes lengthy sections on statistics and public opinion. Moreover, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_articles_about_abortion_by_country.html" title="List of articles about abortion by country">abortion by country</a> will be of interest to many people, and that is another reason to make the link more prominent in the template. Putting the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_articles_about_abortion_by_country.html" title="List of articles about abortion by country">abortion by country</a> link near the top is a small thing, and it should not be controversial.</dd>

I don’t think another template is necessary, because the searching would be easier if the link to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_articles_about_abortion_by_country.html" title="List of articles about abortion by country">abortion by country</a> is placed near the top of the existing template.<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerrylodge_0ba1.html" title="User:Ferrylodge">Ferrylodge</a> 20:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just out of curiosity, I wonder if Severa would be kind enough to explain where the notion about Wikipedia "server strain" comes from. Is there some Wikipedia policy or guideline that warns about causing server strain? Does editing the abortion template really threaten to incapacitate the Wikipedia servers?</p>
<p>And since Sereva has again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AAbortion&amp;diff=114951521&amp;oldid=114887709" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AAbortion&amp;diff=114951521&amp;oldid=114887709" rel="nofollow">reverted my edits</a> without the slightest explanation, would she please explain why "fetal rights" and "paternal rights" and "reproductive rights" should not be grouped together in the same section? I know that explaining yourself is a drag, but really it would be appropriate for you to explain your reversions instead of behaving as you do. Over and over again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Severa/archive6#Please_Explain_Reverts" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Severa/archive6#Please_Explain_Reverts" rel="nofollow">I have asked Severa to explain her reverts</a>, but to no avail.</p>
<p>The only other change to the template that I requested was putting "Abortion by Country" at the top. Another editor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_about_abortion_by_country" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_about_abortion_by_country" rel="nofollow">agrees with me</a> that the list of articles by country should be made more accessible.

I already explained my rational for reverting in my edit summary. I have repeatedly requested that editors refrain from making back-and-forth changes to this template and engage in discussion instead. Ping-pong editing is not cooperative, as all editors involved are essentially working against each other, and thus it isn't productive. It wasn't my intent to comment, only to attempt to mediate the dispute between yourself and Joie de Vivre, by redirecting you both to Talk. Please keep proposals to the "drawing board" here on Talk by discussing changes and reaching a <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a> before making changes. I've already explained server strain above — but, basically, this template is copied to a large number of pages across Wikipedia, and each time you make a change to the template, that change must be carried out across all of those of pages, causing server strain, especially if the template is changed a number of times consecutively.</dd>
<dd>The user on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_articles_about_abortion_by_country_65af.html" title="Talk:List of articles about abortion by country">Talk:List of articles about abortion by country</a> was in fact proposing the creation of a separate "Abortion by country" template, like the European one featured in <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_in_Finland_d101.html" title="Abortion in Finland">Abortion in Finland</a>, so you cannot infer support for your suggestion from that post.</dd>
<dd>The grouping of articles under the "Law" heading is based off of <a href="../../../a/b/o/Template%7EAbortionLaw_4722.html" title="Template:AbortionLaw">Template:AbortionLaw</a>. There are several kinds of legislation, including <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscience_clause_%28medical%29.html" title="Conscience clause (medical)">conscience clauses</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minors_and_abortion.html" title="Minors and abortion">parental involvement</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Paternal_rights_and_abortion.html" title="Paternal rights and abortion">spousal notification</a>, "<a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_protection_of_access_to_abortion.html" title="Legal protection of access to abortion">buffer zones</a>," etc. As adding <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetal_rights.html" title="Fetal rights">Fetal rights</a> to the "Law" heading harmonizes this template's organization with that of Template:AbortionLaw, this change is acceptable, but I do not see a basis for adding <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reproductive_rights.html" title="Reproductive rights">Reproductive rights</a> to the "Law" heading, as the article discusses mainly a philosophic concept, and not laws. "Social issues" is basically a catch-all for everything that wouldn't fit in the template otherwise.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, there is no consensus for the other suggestions. Please build consensus in support of these proposals before making those changes to the template again. Thank you. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 08:18, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, and to answer your question, <a href="../../../h/r/t/WP%7EHRT_89de.html" title="WP:HRT">WP:HRT</a> is the policy which pertains to minimizing edits to high-use templates in order to cut down on server load (see the new thread "HRT" below). -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 17:45, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Severa, the edit summary for your revert was as follows: "Layout looks awful and isn't logical. Self-induced isn't a circumstance. Take it to Talk and keep it there until you reach agreement. Editwars on templates are counterproductive + cause server strain."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Where did your edit summary give any reason for splitting fetal rights, reproductive rights, and paternal rights into separate sections, as dictated by your revert? Where did your edit summary give any reason for moving "abortion by country" downward in the template, as dictated by your revert? Why are you forcing me to beg for an explanation every time you revert? Over and over again I have had to ask you to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Severa/archive6#Please_Explain_Reverts" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Severa/archive6#Please_Explain_Reverts" rel="nofollow">explain your reverts</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, the explanation that you have finally given is extremely unpersuasive. The abortion law template currently has a link to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Paternal_rights_and_abortion.html" title="Paternal rights and abortion">Paternal rights and abortion</a>. Yet, you revert my edit that places “paternal rights” in the abortion law section (where "reproductive rights" is already located).</dd>
<dd>Are you simply going to revert every edit I make to this template without explanation (forcing me to beg for an explanation), and then respond with an explanation that actually argues for my edit instead of against it?<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerrylodge_0ba1.html" title="User:Ferrylodge">Ferrylodge</a> 22:54, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this template's main failing is that it is trying to serve too many functions at once. Perhaps it would be best to break it into more specific, individual templates, such as Template:AbortionMethods, <a href="../../../a/b/o/Template%7EAbortionLaw_4722.html" title="Template:AbortionLaw">Template:AbortionLaw</a>, and Template:AbortionDebate. This template could then link to the main articles in the abortion series — <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_debate.html" title="Abortion debate">Abortion debate</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_law.html" title="Abortion law">Abortion law</a>, and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_abortion.html" title="History of abortion">History of abortion</a> — while the specialized templates could link to all of the relevant sub-articles.

<p>1) "Methods of abortion" is per <a href="../../../m/e/t/Category%7EMethods_of_abortion_398b.html" title="Category:Methods of abortion">Category:Methods of abortion</a>. This category lists medically available abortion methods. It does not make sense to put "self-induced abortion" i.e. "shoving a coat hanger through the hole in the cervix" in this category, nor does it make sense to put "abortifacients" i.e. "toxic substances" in this category, any more than it would make sense to put "falling down the stairs" in this category. Created a "Related" section at bottom since "Circumstances" seems to irk and "Social issues" doesn't fit <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">Miscarriage</a>.</p>
<p>2) A main reason that "History" is at the top is that it is a top-level category with no subcategories, so putting it in its own grey bar would look odd. Also, it is a globally encompassing topic. "Abortion by country" should not be placed in the same area. It belongs in "Law", because countries are legal entities and the differences between how abortion is handled in different countries is a matter of law.</p>
<p>3) Agree with Severa re: placement of <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetal_rights.html" title="Fetal rights">Fetal rights</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Paternal_rights.html" title="Paternal rights">Paternal rights</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoie_de_Vivre_996f.html" title="User:Joie de Vivre">Joie de Vivre</a> 16:03, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"<i>Template transclusion has a range of costs and benefits. One cost is that whenever a template is edited, that not only updates the template, but every page that transcludes the template. This means that the squid and parser cached versions of that page are invalidated, and each of the pages must be regenerated by the parser when they are next viewed. This involves significantly more resources than displaying the page from the cache. For example, if template A is transcluded in 100 articles, then editing A effectively changes all 100 articles (plus the template). A high-use template should be edited only if there is a clear need.</i></dd>

<dd>Joie, I think that the link to "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_articles_about_abortion_by_country.html" title="List of articles about abortion by country">Abortion by Country</a>" should be at or near the top. People want to get abortion info for the country where they live, and that would be easier with the "Abortion by country" link at the top. The info available via this "Abortion by country" link goes way beyond legal info, and also includes info about public opinion, and abortion statistics for each country.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also think the links dealing with "rights" (i.e. reproductive rights, paternal rights, and fetal rights) should be grouped together, preferably under the "law" heading.</dd>

<dd>I'm glad that feticide is back in the template, and think it should remain in the template where it has been for a long time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Additionally, since you want to get this template unblocked, you presumably have changes that you would like to make, and I'm curious what those are.<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerrylodge_0ba1.html" title="User:Ferrylodge">Ferrylodge</a> 23:39, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In case you are wondering, I am waiting for Severa to get back... they had a lot to say on the topic. <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoie_de_Vivre_996f.html" title="User:Joie de Vivre">Joie de Vivre</a> 16:37, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
