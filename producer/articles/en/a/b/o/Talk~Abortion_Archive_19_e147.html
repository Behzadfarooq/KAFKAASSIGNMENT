<ul>
<li><b>Opening paragraph:</b> Done.</li>
<li><b>Definitions:</b> A few issues remain to be addressed. However, for the most part, the current outline is good.</li>
<li><b>Incidence:</b> Done. However, the table remains to be reinstated, following changes which need to be made to it. These are addressed in the thread "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Abortion/Archive_17#Clarrify_the_percentages.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Abortion/Archive_17#Clarrify_the_percentages.3F" rel="nofollow">Clarify the percentages?</a>" in Archive 17.</li>
<li><b>Forms of abortion:</b> Partially-completed. See individual sections for more.
<ul>
<li><b>Spontaneous abortion:</b> This really hasn't been touched since the first Progress Report.</li>
<li><b>Induced abortion:</b> Addional sources and information needed for all sub-sections ("Surgical abortion," "Chemical abortion," and "Other means of abortion")</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Health effects:</b> Still needs a reorganization and sourcing. The "Suggested effects" sub-sections ("Breast cancer," "Fetal pain," "Mental health"), however, are largely complete.</li>
<li><b>History of abortion:</b> Done.</li>
<li><b>Social issues:</b> Partially-completed. Does anyone have any ideas for futher issues needing coverage?
<ul>
<li><b>Effect upon crime:</b> Done.</li>
<li><b>Forced abortion:</b> This section needs to be sourced and written. This is an idea that's been kicking around since "Abortion related to the disabled community" in Archive 12.</li>
<li><b>Sex-selective abortion:</b> Done.</li>
<li><b>Unsafe abortion:</b> Done. However, I wouldn't mind adding regional information, such as that presented in the sources listed at "Next on the Agenda: Unsafe Abortion" in Archive 15.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Abortion debate:</b> The current version is pretty good. Suggestions?
<ul>
<li><b>Public opinion:</b> Polling data from additional countries is <i>still</i> needed. Any volunteers?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Abortion law:</b> Done.</li>
<li><b>Historical perspectives:</b> Recent edits have suggested that there are issues with the "History of abortion" section. The current version focuses almost entirely on the history of abortion procedures and fails to cover the debate. Perhaps a "Historical perspectives" section could be created under either "Abortion debate" or "History of abortion?"</li>

<li><b>Abortion pictures:</b> This subject is remarkably void of actual pictures. Earlier posts have suggested that any actual picture showing the products of abortion would be a "shock picture" or "pro-life" biased. It is absurd to consider such a picture for either side if the picture is the simple result of this subject. At least have a medical diagram like that famous partial-birth one. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.83.12.24 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__64.83.12.24_db0d.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 64.83.12.24">contribs</a>)  14:00, 24 March 2006.</small></li>

<dd>The images currently on the page should be medical images. The ones we have now are all of tangential issues. The MAIN purpose of the article is to make one familiar with what abortion is, and a secondary purpose to inform the reader about other things associated with abortion. The photos now present are a poor use of images for an article about a medica procedure. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Good</a> 06:57, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This is exactly what I'm saying. A medical article needs medical pictures. An ancient engraving, or even some chemical composition is really quite...meaningless. Abortion is about the removal of a fetus. It defies reason to suggest that the article doesn't need at least one picture (or at least a diagram) of a fetus being extracted or of a fetus that has already been extracted.</dd>

<dd>Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures. The most common pressures include prevention or rejection of other <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_control.html" title="Birth control">contraceptive</a> methods, attempting to avoid <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disabled.html" title="Disabled">disabled</a> people, preference for children of a specific <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex-selective_abortion.html" title="Sex-selective abortion">sex-selective abortion</a>), disapproval of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_parent.html" title="Single parent">single mothers</a>, insufficient economic support for <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family.html" title="Family">families</a>, or efforts toward <a href="../../../p/o/p/Population_control.html" title="Population control">population control</a> (such as <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>'s <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-child_policy.html" title="One-child policy">one-child policy</a>). All of these may be the result of either personal fear or force. In many areas, especially in <a href="../../../d/e/v/Developing_country.html" title="Developing country">developing nations</a> or where abortion is illegal, women sometimes resort to "<a href="../../../b/a/c/Back-alley_abortion.html" title="Back-alley abortion">back-alley</a>" or <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-induced_abortion.html" title="Self-induced abortion">self-induced</a> procedures.

<dd>Well, "attempting to avoid disabled people" is clearly the wrong phrasing. That sounds like crossing the street so as not to walk by the guy in the wheelchair.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Priorities</span></h2>
<p>The Progress Report rots above 20 "death" discussions. The to-do list collects dust because all of our manpower is dedicated to circular debates and POV-coddling. Any effort toward productive work (see "Complusory abortion") is quickly snuffed by the "death" talk. What can I say, I've been editing here almost a year, and I still don't know anything about priorities. I'll tie up a few loose ends, but, then, I'm done here. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a></p>

<dd>I agree with your sentiment, and apologize for briefly getting caught up in debate as opposed to progress. I personally appreciate all of your hard work and time you have put into this article. Abortion is a very touchy issue for many people, and I feel there are always going to be POV warriors trying to make things their way, instead of encyclopedic. But you can't make people stop being passionate about this issue. I've tried to avoid the debates for the past couple days, and now am waiting for the steam to blow off before contributing again. I hope you decide not to leave us, because seriously, your work and input does NOT go unnoticed.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suicide rates revisited.......</span></h2>
<p>I know that the Finland study on suicide rates was discussed a fair bit here a while back - is it worth putting into the article their claims of an increased risk of suicide of 650%? That seems fairly significant to the study.....I know one of the biggest objections to having more information in this regard has been the claim that it is due to existing conditions at the time of the abortion that increased risk of depression, etc. occurs - but I found a citation of</p>
<p><i>Morgan CM, Evans M, Peter JR, Currie C. Mental health may deteriorate as a direct effect of induced abortion.

<p>which stated that <i>A record-based measure of suicide attempts before and after abortion has shown that the subsequent increase in suicide rates among aborting women is not related to prior suicidal behavior but is most likely related to adverse reactions to the abortion.</i></p>
<p>Also included was a citation of</p>

<p>that found that <i>higher suicide rates subsequent to abortion persist for several years and are highest for younger women.</i></p>
<p>Also, in a letter published to the British medical journal by Reardon <a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/329/7476/1205" class="external autonumber" title="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/329/7476/1205" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> - he states that:</p>

And they wonder why they should be selected when their little siblings were selected to die … which is precisely what happened to the people from the Holocaust. Why were they selected to live and some of their friends, relatives, and family were selected to die? And it leaves this deep sense of guilt. And that is a difficult, difficult thing to treat, because it is so deeply embedded. And of course with that is how can you trust your parents? Are they capable of killing you too? They killed one of your little siblings. And then it comes down to one of the deepest fears of all children, which is my parents might kill and eat me. And of course you see that in children’s stories like Hansel and Gretel, the wicked witch is going to put them in the oven. In various cultures, in various parts of the world all have deeply embedded this very deep fear that children have that their parents might kill and eat them. And of course abortion comes very close to that. And so it creates an enormous distrust of your parents. And if you can't trust your parents then it is likely that you are not going to trust parent-like figures: teachers and everybody… priests. How can you people like that who take life, innocent life, or don’t protect it as much as they should?</i></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">FYI: Media Abortion Bias Source</span></h2>
<p>I have often posted here that the media (at least the US media) generally embrace abortion as a solution that should be available to all pregnant women. I note this simply to assist us all in realizing that data indicates that the media (journalists and entertainers) viewpoint does not reflect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion#Public_opinion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion#Public_opinion" rel="nofollow">popular opinion</a>.

According to this research, at least 96% of persons in these media favor abortion as a solution to unwanted pregnancy. I am looking for similar research regarding academics and will post it if I find it. It should make us all take pause before simply considering media-generated information as neutral sources.

<dd>Media bias can be an issue; in fact bias in general can be an issue. This is one reason we tend to really examine sources. We have over 70 references and not all are from the media. That said, "media bias" is often mis-used and over-used, and is frequently used to shore up a position when the position is tenuous.</dd>
<dd>The term "anti-abortion" has been discussed and rejected previously on this talk page, precisely because "pro-life" is more commonly used. However, to characterize "anti-abortion" as "made-up" and inaccurate is missing the point; if there are two positions, those who believe abortions are wrong and those who believe abortions are ok, then some consider a <i>less</i> biased way of describing them is "pro-postion" for both, or "anti-position" for both. And "pro-life" is actually a misnomer; most abortion opponents are also in favor of the death penalty. However, if we speak of "pro-choice" we must speak of "pro-<i>something</i>" to avoid the percieved inherent bias in having one side be "pro" and one "anti". Although of course there are other debates where that is a non-issue for both sides - I don't recall anyone suggesting that the death penalty be so described (pro- and anti- is the usual way of describing, and no one seems to feel that is an inherent implied bias.)</dd>

<dd>Pro-lick, your analysis is a bit off. The non-Media executives are NOT claimed to be representative of the general population in this research. I simply point out the facts one can garner from this study: those who control MEDIA content are <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0377/is_2001_Spring/ai_73368520/print" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0377/is_2001_Spring/ai_73368520/print" rel="nofollow">97% in favor of abortion</a>. This is much higher than the views of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion#Public_opinion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion#Public_opinion" rel="nofollow">general population</a>. From the research article: <i>"The sample of journalists mirrors that from the earlier study, including reporters and editors at major national newspapers, news magazines, and wire services. Finally, the Hollywood sample includes the writers, directors, and producers of recent top-grossing films and highest-rated television shows"</i>). Logical conclusion: those who control the media have a pro-abortion bias that does not mirror society.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For those who have trouble following the relevance of the various groups in the study: The study simply included the NON-MEDIA execs as a control group of highly educated leaders to compare to MEDIA leaders (in order to see if it was simply education or leadership that might explain the views of educated leaders). After all, the CEO of Exxon Mobil or General Motors do not generally impact public opinion on social issues such as abortion - however the MEDIA does impact such public opinion. In this case, the study revealed that it was not simply education or leadership that correlated with the leaders' views, but the type of industry the educated leaders worked in - MEDIA (journalism and Hollywood) leaders favored abortion almost to a man, whereas non-MEDIA leaders tended to be more "conservative" but were not quite as monolithic on abortion. The point to underscore is that MEDIA (news/hollywood) influences public opinion, and MEDIA leaders are monolithic abortion supporters, whereas the general population do not monolithically support abortion. And my point has been deonstrated as based in analytical research: media information about abortion must be viewed with caution as the industry is led by monolithic abortion supporters.</dd>

<dd>Agreed. FWIW, when I researched the use of the word <i>feticide</i> I noticed that the few Pubmed refs to <i>foeticide</i> all came from India (usually referring to the "female foeticide" practice). By the way, the latin word <i>fetus</i> is actually older than the UK and the US combined. When in daily use it had numerous meanings, such as pregnant, giving birth, or progeny. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 15:58, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The latin word 'fetus' did not originally however refer exclusively to what we now think of as a foetus, it seems to have originally meant "offsrping" or "young one" and was adopted with a different meaning later, it seems only 100 years or so before the variant arose.</dd>
<dd>It's age as a variant makes it as correct as 'aluminum', given the scientific community is against it but there is widespread (almost exclusive in their respective countries) use.

<dd>Possibly. Fetus was, so far as I can determine, first spelled foetus as a pseudo-hellenization of the spelling in the 18th century. As Avb correctly notes above, the word has a latin origin - hence the hellenization (Greek spelling) is incorrect. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 16:03, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Foetus is <i>the</i> acceptable British spelling, (c.f. <i>Shorter <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>, Fifth Ed., 2002, p 997), and derives directly from the Latin word, spelled in the same manner (c.f.,</i> Cassell's Latin Dictionary, 1968, pp 252). The word has no predecessor from any other language, i.e., it is not from Greek, where had it been from Greek, the "ph" (Φ} would have been retained as the sound of "ph" and "f" were not, at that time, equivalent (in fact the "ph" was an aspirated "p", as in "p-huh"). Additionally, the word has no provable link to *PIE. The "foetus" spelling is slightly older, with the "oe" representing a diphthong with the sound founf in "b<i>oy</i>", however, this sound was not in imitation of the Greek dipthong found in "οι", which had a similar sound, but rather the "oy" sound is one of the first of the *PIE diphthongs to develop. I hope this clears up this issue. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 16:46, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the absence of any comments or refutation of the many medical sources that use the alternate medical definition, I have edited the article accordingly.

<dd>I have to agree with G&amp;E - he does have medical sources, that have nothing to do with pro-life organisations, identifying pregnancy as starting at conception. Even the pro-life associations - being associations of doctors, their alternate definition can correctly be identified as medical.

<dd>I have not been able to find a specific term - there may not be one. The WP article on <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertilization.html" title="Fertilization">Fertilization</a> states: "The time from actual fertilisation (sperm and egg unite in the Fallopian Tube) until implantation, a period of about 7-10 days, is ignored" (under Fertilisation in mammals/Human fertilization) and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_fertilization.html" title="Human fertilization">Human fertilization</a> has a good bit more, but it ends prior to implantation, as one might expect. <a href="../../../i/m/p/Implantation.html" title="Implantation">Implantation</a> is a redirect to <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">Pregnancy</a>. I have of course looked outside WP, but this seemed a good place to start, as other articles here might have references. Gestation is "the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside a female viviparous animal." Not sure how much help that is. Where were you thinking this term would be useful? <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 22:50, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sorry, forgot to answer q2. Gestation is another one of those terms - although apparently (and I have not made an exhaustive study) gestation is generally considered to begin with fertilization not implantation. Some sources give it as a Term to Avoid, as it is also used to describe post-implantation develelopment of the embryo. And I <i>know</i> that wasn't much help. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 22:57, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1. What is the term for this period?</p>

<dd>For the embryo, it is preimplantation development, such as cleavage.

<p>2. Is a woman gestating during this period?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The woman isn't doing anything during this period. It isn't until after implantation and the blastocyst starts releasing hCG do changes start occuring in the woman. Like I said, IVF fails 20-30% of the time. Putting an embryo inside of a woman does not automatically make her pregnant. A handful of pro-life doctors having opinions otherwise doesn't make these women any more pregnant.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 01:13, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(BTW, in case you don't know, the strength of the evidence "well established" is an <b>internal assessment</b> by the NCI; rather than an international or even national standard) The NCI is influencial, yes, authoritative, nope. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 18:38, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As to a rewriting, I don't see that happening; and is completely unnessisary. But your objection does remind me of a similar objection from another editor with whom I've collaborated... it does hit home the need for context; my thinking has been to tease them with an ambiguous opening so they will feel the need to read the article so they could be better informed on the subject. But I guess that's a little foolhardy of me; perhaps adding "The ABC hypothesis currently has little support in the medical community." or alternatively "Most in the medical community are skeptical of the ABC hypothesis; and it is seen by pro-choice observers as pro-life propoganda." to the end of would do the trick? You could propose changes; but again a full rewrite, I'm unsure how that's required. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 07:47, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It should highlight the <i>consensus</i> view of authorities on the subject, no?

<dd>Rubbish. <b>Some</b> consider it fertilizer, many are non-committal/skeptical and a few support the hypothesis. Such polarization and black and white notions are rare in scientific research; but you would actually have to delve into the research to comprehend that. Positive results exist which are far removed from Brind; and some positive results were acquired without using interview-based studies. By the way many interview-based studies have not been discredited; rather allegations of response bias etc. have been leveled. And some of those flaws are indeed valid; the problem is no one has bothered to see if they had a statistically significant impact on the studies in question. But for people pre-disposed to thinking the ABC link is a myth, mere allegations is enough to remove them from consideration. Doesn't sound terribly scientific to me. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 01:45, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(do a find on self-contradictory) Don't even attempt to present yourself as knowledgeable on this subject; I am way ahead of you. The article explains how (at least on the self-contradictory point, which is what it focuses on; since someone else removed the entire quote a long time back), they are being disingenuous rather than corrective. I'd encourage you to try and find Brind's response; but then again if you're not interested in that; then you've only done half the work necessary to actually know what you are talking about. (If you are not prepared to look at both sides, then don't consider yourself ready to edit controversial articles) If you need clarification on things, try something different, actually ask me about it. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 01:45, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not presented as the <b>majority</b> or <b>authoritative</b> in the least, the wording specifical names him (an individual rather than an organization) and his objections.

(and actually, specifically regarding his comments about the NCI workshop, I'm unaware of any reputable source that repeats them; but he is an expert and he was at the conference)</dd>
<dd>As to the Danish authors; that is also notable, but the section in the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html#Breast_Cancer" title="Abortion">Abortion#Breast Cancer</a> sub-section is a summary of the entire subject. Putting the back and forth of that specific discussion is unnessisary, too detailed and begins to bloat the section; which again is meant as a summary. On this specific line of questioning, <b>I apologize to you Pro-Lick</b>, it was a reasonable concern to raise. But to not put the back and forth of the Danish response and Brind's response wasn't an oversight on our part; but an editorial decision. You simply cannot put that quotation without further explaination and rebuttal; but again that's a lot of information that simply does not belong in the lead.

<dd>Screening for breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in the United States; the risk of developing breast cancer increases from 1:25 at age 40 to 1:8 at age 80. In addition to age, other factors that determine a woman's risk for breast cancer include age at menarche, age at first full-term birth, presence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, family history of breast cancer, and presence of high-risk benign breast pathology. For those at low risk, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends routine mammography every 1–2 years for women in their 40s and annually thereafter. This is in addition to annual clinical breast examination. The USPSTF recommends routine screening every 1–2 years, with mammography alone or mammography plus annual clinical breast examination for women aged 50–69 years. Mammography interval is still controversial ( Table 1-16). For asymptomatic women between the ages of 50 and 69 years, the data support a 30% reduction in breast cancer mortality associated with annual or biennial mammography and clinical breast examination. Controversial data demonstrate a 20% reduction in breast cancer mortality associated with annual mammography among women between the ages of 40 and 49 years. The problem of comorbidity in women older than age 70 complicates data supporting screening recommendations for this cohort of women. Although strong evidence supporting mortality reduction from breast self-examination is lacking, breast self-examination is recommended as a screening modality for breast cancer beginning at age 25.</dd>

<dd>While Brind is of course not respected in most medical circles; I'm curious as to how him being mentioned or not in a specific textbook makes him "respected" or "not respected". Is this supposed to be a joke; is this your idea of "research"? Does this mean every doctor <b>not</b> mentioned is therefore not worth listening to? And why would a hypothesis be mentioned in a medical textbook, who's editorial focus is likely on established concepts. Am I to assume from all of this you are student? Because that would put all of this hassle, bravado and "taking on the world" into context.

I had found a report online a few days ago that might be useful to this section - it mentioned the US NCI criticized the 1999 Denmark study's methodology (so I would assume this study did not play a major role in the 2003 decision?). If anyone finds a similar reference, it would be important context in the article to say something like "In 2003, the US NCI (despite criticism of the 1999 Denmark study) blah blah blah...." As it stands, the article seems to indicate the Denmark study was one of the influences upon the 2003 decision......another study that will be interesting to see the results of - if you type in abortion breast cancer on the NCI search, you will see a grant request for a study in China using their medical records, by Dr Lu (I think that was his name).....I checked out his web site, and reviewed some of his other studies - interesting stuff.

<dd>Since hypotheses are unproven, it shouldn't be a problem to state it's unproven. Controversial actually can imply something true that is not generally accepted. Of course, if you prefer, we can leave the 1st sentence and I can add sentences like this: “In scientific terms, ABC is as disproved as a hypothesis can be.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">BC Preventing Implantation</span></h2>
<p>I take issue with this paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Methods of birth control that prevent implantation, such as emergency contraception, are not considered to be abortion; however, emergency contraception is generally considered equivalent to abortion by those who believe that human life begins at conception.</dd>
</dl>
<p>According to the EC page, there is a big controversy over the actual mechanism. Because there is no evidence to show that EC actually prevents implantation, I believe it is misleading to suggest otherwise on this page. How can we reword this section? Are there any known methods of BC that actually prevent implantation that we could list instead? --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 23:57, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not that there is no evidence - it is that there are no case studies on frequency, which is a bit different.

<p>The ACOG eh? This is from ACOG Practice Bulletin. Clinical Management Guidelines for Obstetrician-Gynecologists, Number 69, December 2005</p>
<dl>
<dd>Earlier studies documented histologic and biochemical changes in the endometrium after administration of the combined regimen, suggesting that emergency contraception may alter the receptiveness of the endometrium and inhibit implantation of a fertilized egg (6, 18, 22–24). However, several more recent studies have not supported these findings (16, 19, 21, 25–28), and the endometrial changes that have been observed may not be sufficient to prevent implantation. ...</dd>
<dd>Emergency contraception is sometimes confused with medical abortion (32). However, whereas medical abortion is used to terminate an existing pregnancy, emergency contraception is effective only before a pregnancy is established. Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy during the 5 or more days between intercourse and implantation of a fertilized egg, but it is ineffective after implantation. Studies of high-dose oral contraceptives indicate that emergency contraception confers no increased risk to an established pregnancy or harm to a developing embryo (33).</dd>

<dd>How familiar are you with the biology involved? Your ACOG quote is interesting in that it says that prior to "implantation of a fetilized egg" the pills can effectively "prevent pregnancy" (which of course ends up killing/destroying that fertilized egg), and then inexplicably concludes that the pills pose no risk to "a developing embryo". Yet countless <a href="http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3225" class="external text" title="http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3225" rel="nofollow">medical and biological references</a> are clear that a "fertilized egg" prior to implantation is a developing embryo! Its precisely this sort of non-sensical euphemistic and political tiptoe-ing that makes the ACOG look like it has a pro-abortion dog in the fight. If a fertilized egg is destroyed, then a developing embryo is destroyed. So how much trust can one put in anything ACOG publishes when such an obvious error is in one of its bulletins? Here, ACOG should have just stuck with its party line about implantation and not tried to toptoe any further. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Good</a> 19:14, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Emergency contraception (EC), which prevents pregnancy after unprotected sexual intercourse, has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy and thus the need for abortion. EC is, however, frequently confused with induced abortion, making the method unavailable for millions of women for religious and/or political reasons. In this paper we discuss available data on the mechanism of action and efficacy of the current accessible methods. The main mechanism of action, of emergency contraceptive pills, is to postpone or inhibit ovulation, while the insertion of a copper IUD prevents implantation.</dd>

<dd><i>The mechanism of action of contraceptive method is essential for the development of new methods. It also influences cultural and individual acceptability of a contraceptive method. Modern hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine contraceptive devices have multiple biologic effects. Some of them may be the primary mechanism of contraceptive action, whereas others are secondary. For the combined oral contraceptives and progestin-only methods, the main mechanism of action are the inhibition of follicular development, ovulation, and as consequence, corpus luteum formation. Further, it is also involved in the alteration of the cervical mucus that inhibit sperm penetration. For hormonal methods, particularly the low-dose progestin-only products and emergency contraceptive pills have effects on the endometrium that, theoretically, could affect implantation. However, no scientific evidence will indicate that prevention of implantation actually results from the use of these methods. Once implantation has taken place, none of these methods are effective and pregnancy proceeds normally. The precise mechanism of IUDs remains unclear because of difficulties in carrying out relevant investigations in humans and the limitations of extrapolating findings from animal studies. However, several studies evidenced that IUDs exert their primary effect before fertilization, by impeding the ascent of sperm to the fallopian tubes or by reducing the ability of sperm to fertilize an ovum.</i> <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 20:52, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>G&amp;E: Now you want to argue over the definition of embryo? Just because an article doesn't use your definition of embryo, does not mean the study is any less valid. I mean, just look at the second link your provided us above: "After the egg is fertilized by a sperm and then implanted in the lining of the uterus, it develops into the placenta and embryo, and later into a fetus." <a href="http://www.answers.com/embryo&amp;r=67" class="external text" title="http://www.answers.com/embryo&amp;r=67" rel="nofollow">Embryo</a> can mean two different things, you know?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 21:20, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is it that you missed? The ACOG bulletin excerpt talks about the pills destroying a developing embryo at any time during the 5 days prior to implantation - there is NO dispute that at 4 or 5 days after fertilization the entity is an embryo - or that such an embryo is already developing. So, ACOG's conclusion in the same bulletin excerpt that these pills do not cause any harm to a developing embryo is simply ridiculous and, again, exposes ACOG's pro-abortion advocacy (or medical ineptness - but we can assume they are NOT inept). <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Good</a> 05:50, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So to answer my question about wanting to argue over the definition of 'embryo', the answer is yes? When you say there is "NO dispute" were you taking into account definition 2b from answers.com and the definition you linked to that I quoted? Furthermore, I found no evidence that the ACOG bulletin said "the pills destroy a developing embryo". In fact, the part I quoted specifically said "However, several more recent studies have not supported these findings, and the endometrial changes that have been observed may not be sufficient to prevent implantation." So if any of these points are wrong, then yes I have 'missed' something. However, I feel like I have been dragged into an argument. Can we focus more on the issue I raised in regards to the article. I have edited the EC section, and other editors have revised my edits. Do you have a problem with how that section is currently worded? I personally do not like the term "believers" as a noun. "Those who believe" sounds better to me. Also, I'd rather have the more general <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hormonal_contraception.html" title="Hormonal contraception">hormonal contraception</a> page linked to as opposed to singling out EC. However, these two suggestions were changed by other editors. I feel the current wording is an improvement, so I'll give it my nod if it looks ok to you (and everyone else).--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 06:29, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As a side note - all of the quotes, including the article you mention from the AMA, are referring to hormonal EC. The primary method of contraception of the copper-containing IUD (also used as a form of EC), from the majority of sources I read, stated it works primarily by preventing implantation.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 08:05, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

At best it only has a grain of truth, such conspiracy theories are lazy thinking. (For example, did it occur to you any monies gained could be to offset money put into the website etc. Last time I check Planned Parenthood didn't run on good intentions; everyone needs money to put back into the things they are passionate about.)

<dd>Quite. Brind doesn't chalk it up to a conspiracy per say; but rather resistance to open consideration of the idea; as it does indeed have political pro-life taint. By the way, he was at the NCI workshop, you were not. I'm unsure what aspect you are referring to as unverifiable; but I would point out his meta-analysis on the subject was deemed to have "no methodological shortcomings and could not be disregarded." <a href="http://www.nelh.nhs.uk/guidelinesdb/html/fulltext-guidelines/inducedAbortion-4.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nelh.nhs.uk/guidelinesdb/html/fulltext-guidelines/inducedAbortion-4.htm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> As to the science, I know damn well its available since I've read the original studies and the follow up letters and discussions in journals; and have used that material to write the ABC hypothesis article. I'd suggest you do the same prior to labelling things as "myths" based on a mediocre Google search.

<p>Interestingly enough, a doctor uses "baby" or "fetus" depending on whether the mother plans to keep the child or not. "Baby" helps a mother bond, while "fetus" helps prevent a humanization. I've read a few articles from the medical community in this regard, as well as hearing anecdotal evidence from doctors - I'll see if I can't dig up those articles.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 16:29, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Alternative to Abortion?</span></h2>
<p>Out of curiosity, has embryo freezing ever been discussed as a possible alternative to abortion? According to certain entries in Wikipedia, a human embryo can survive being frozen via <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryonics.html" title="Cryonics">cryonics</a> and being thawed out later. Also see <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryo_space_colonization.html" title="Embryo space colonization">embryo space colonization</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_vitro_fertilisation.html" title="In vitro fertilisation">in vitro fertilisation</a>; in fact, it looks like embryo freezing is commonplace in cases of in vitro fertilisation already - see <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_vitro_fertilization.html#Embryo_cryopreservation" title="In vitro fertilization">In vitro fertilization#Embryo cryopreservation</a>. So, to rephrase the question: rather than abortion, has anyone considered removal of the embryo, placement in cryonic suspension, and storage in a (Earth-based) facility as a possible compromise? --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrasswatchman_8b03.html" title="User:Brasswatchman">Brasswatchman</a> 20:07, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>On the abortion page, early in 2001, some advocates had used the page to exchange rhetorical barbs, being unable to agree about what arguments should be on the page and how the competing positions should be represented. What was needed--and what was added--was an in-depth discussion of the different positions about the moral and legal viability of abortion at different times. This discussion of the positions was carefully crafted so as not to favor any one of the positions outlined. This made it rather easier to organize and understand the competing arguments surrounding the topic of abortion, which were each then presented sympathetically, each with its strengths and weaknesses.</i></dd>

</dl>
<p>Here is another <b>[2]</b>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">Pregnancy</a> is often defined by doctors as beginning at <a href="../../../i/m/p/Implantation.html" title="Implantation">implantation</a>. Another definition used by doctors places the beginning of pregnancy at <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertilisation.html" title="Fertilisation">fertilisation</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And another <b>[3]</b>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">Pregnancy</a> is often defined by the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">medical community</a> as beginning at the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Implantation.html" title="Implantation">implantation</a> of the <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryo.html" title="Embryo">embryo</a>. Some medical professionals consider pregnancy to begin at <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertilisation.html" title="Fertilisation">fertilisation</a> (also called conception).</dd>
</dl>
<p>And another from a few months back, <b>[4]</b>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Pregnancy is defined by the medical community as beginning at the implantation of the embryo. A pregnancy that terminates early, but where the fetus survives to become a live infant, is termed a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premature_birth.html" title="Premature birth">premature birth</a>. A pregnancy that ends with an infant dead upon birth, due to causes including spontaneous abortion or complications during delivery, is termed a <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stillbirth.html" title="Stillbirth">stillbirth</a>. Medically, the use of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contraception.html" title="Contraception">contraception</a> (including <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_contraception.html" title="Emergency contraception">emergency contraception</a>) is not considered to be abortion; however, there are those who believe pregnancy should be measured from <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertilisation.html" title="Fertilisation">conception</a> and consider emergency contraception to be a form of abortion.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So what does everybody want in that paragraph? G&amp;E didn't like [1] because of the American bias. However, I believe using references is on the right track. Some users want to make it clear that one definition is widespread, and the other is a minority position, and other users want to present the definitions as equal 'alternative' definitions. According to NPOV, we should include all positions, but convey who believes what and in what propotion. Therefore, [2], the current version, and [3] are misleading and weasely. Can we work this out and agree to something? Any new proposals or compromises?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 16:37, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Do we have some references to WHO or other such organizations' definition of pregnancy, etc.? That might make [1] more agreeable.

<p>It is documented that the definition of pregnancy was manipulated for political reasons - to advance contraceptives and IUDs by making them legal. And the only peer reviewed research that has attempted to discover what doctors actually consider to be the start of pregnancy revealed that half of the ob/gyns reject the ACOG definition. And it is documented that of those states that dfine pregnancy, most define it as beginning at fertilization. And it is documented that AGI admits that defining pergnancy as beginning at fertilization is widespread. Have you not read any of what's been posted? I will say that one positive development is that at least there is no longer any dispute (due to the copious references listed) that the definitions are both medical ones! <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Good</a> 19:44, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Can we work on consensus in regards to this paragraph? You have brought up the political manipulation/definition theory before. One kind editor actually got the source you cited and hand copied the text here for everyone to read. It doesn't seem like many people accepted what you were saying the source said. Do you have another source to back up your position? Next, you are critical of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reference because it is too American, but then you cite "the only peer reviewed research that has attempted to discover what doctors actually consider to be the start of pregnancy ", which only deals with one state, if that. Next, can you document the state's legal definitions? Next, I think the issue here is that different definitions are used in different contexts. We need to convey who and when these definitions are used, as opposed to saying they are equal and interchangable. For example, when someone says that 20-30% of IVF attempts result in pregnancy, they are not using your 'alternative' definition (because 100% of IVF attempts result in 'alternative' pregnancy). Finally, can we work together to create a paragraph that we call agree on?

<p>It was shoehorned into the beginning on the "Mental health" sub-section thus interupting its logical flow. It might be an example of quote-mining, it might be taken of of context, so we should verify that the source supports the conclusion first. And, besides, this addition is redundant with information already in the article (and, thus, could be seen as "padding"):</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Other studies have suggested a link between the elective termination of an unwanted pregnancy and an improvement in reported mental well-being.

<dd>Yes, and if you read the APA briefing paper you'll find that they conclude:
<dl>
<dd>Abortion is a safe medical procedure that carries relatively few physical or psychological risks and that yields positive outcomes when the alternative is unwanted pregnancy (Adler, Ozer, &amp; Tschann, 2003).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The obvious question is why is this not reflected in the section? Instead, it's written up like there's serious doubt about the consequences and most of the weight is on relatively insignificant studies.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 06:17, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is! From the current Mental health section: "Other studies have suggested a link between the elective termination of an unwanted pregnancy and an improvement in reported mental well-being. Elective abortion may reduce the occurrence of depression in cases of unwanted pregnancy..." There is doubt, and, for good or ill, NPOV dictates showing the other side without giving it undue weight. Do you have any recommendations for additional studies and how they might be incorporated? -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 07:50, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Book: <i>Johns Hopkins Manual of Gynecology and Obstetrics</i> 2nd edition (May 2002): 2 screenings. 1 for hypertension. 1 for depression. Let me know where it mentions abortion in any way.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Screening for hypertension</i>
<dl>
<dd>A. Hypertension is defined as a systolic BP of 140 mm Hg or greater, diastolic BP of 90 mm Hg or greater, or requirement for antihypertensive medication. The objective of identifying and treating high BP is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and associated morbidity and mortality. Hypertension is present in an estimated 43 million Americans and is more common in African Americans and older adults. Hypertension is a leading risk factor for coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, ruptured aortic aneurysm, renal disease, and retinopathy. These complications of hypertension are among the most common and serious diseases in the United States, and successful efforts to lower BP could thus have substantial impact on population morbidity and mortality. See Table 1-15.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>TABLE 1-15. CLASSIFICATION OF BLOOD PRESSURE FOR ADULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FOLLOW-UP</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>B. Periodic screening for hypertension is recommended for all persons 21 years of age or older. The optimal interval for BP screening has not been determined and is left to clinical discretion. Current expert opinion is that adults who are believed to be normotensive should receive BP measurements at least once every 2 years if their last diastolic and systolic BP readings were below 85 and 140 mm Hg, respectively, and annually if the last diastolic BP reading was 85–89 mm Hg. Hypertension should not be diagnosed on the basis of a single measurement. Elevated readings should be confirmed on more than one reading at each of three separate visits. In adults, current BP criteria for the diagnosis of hypertension are an average diastolic pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater or an average systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater, or both. Once hypertension is confirmed, patients should receive appropriate counseling regarding physical activity, weight reduction, dietary sodium intake, and alcohol consumption. Evidence should also be sought for other cardiovascular risk factors, such as elevated serum cholesterol level and smoking, and appropriate intervention should be offered when indicated. The</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>decision to begin drug therapy may include consideration of the level of BP elevation, age, and the presence of other cardiovascular disease risk factors (e.g., tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia), concomitant disease (e.g., diabetes, obesity, peripheral vascular disease), or target-organ damage (e.g., left ventricular hypertrophy, elevated creatinine level). Antihypertensive drugs should be prescribed in accordance with recent guidelines and with attention to current techniques for improving compliance. Please refer to a medical text for complete instructions for evaluating and managing hypertension.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Screening for depression.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Major depressive episodes affect 20 million American adults yearly. The lifetime risk for women of developing a major depressive disorder is 10–25%; depression is two to three times more common in women than in men. However, nearly 80% of cases of depression are undiagnosed. Factors that may predispose women to depression include perinatal loss, infertility, or miscarriage; physical or sexual abuse; socioeconomic deprivation; lack of support, isolation, and feelings of helplessness; family history of mood disorders; loss of a parent during childhood (before age 10); history of substance abuse; and menopause.</dd>
<dd>A. The following are the criteria for diagnosing a major depressive episode. At least five of the following nine symptoms must be present for at least 2 weeks</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>to fulfill the definition of major depressive episode, and at least one of the symptoms must be either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. The symptoms must represent a change from the patient's previous level of functioning.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day</dd>
<dd>2. Markedly decreased interest or pleasure in activities</dd>
<dd>3. Significant appetite or weight change</dd>
<dd>4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day</dd>
<dd>5. Observable psychomotor retardation or agitation nearly every day</dd>
<dd>6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day</dd>
<dd>7. Feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt nearly every day</dd>
<dd>8. Diminished ability to think, concentrate, or make decisions</dd>
<dd>9. Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide</dd>
<dd>B. Diagnostic categories</dd>
<dd>1. Major depressive episode. One episode; symptoms may develop over days to weeks and may be either experienced by the patient or observed by others.</dd>
<dd>2. Major depressive disorder. One or more major depressive episodes.</dd>
<dd>3. Dysthymic disorder. Chronically depressed mood on most days for 2 or more years, plus at least two of the symptoms from the list defining a major depressive episode.</dd>
<dd>4. Depressive disorder not otherwise specified. This category includes such diagnoses as premenstrual dysphoric disorder.</dd>
<dd>C. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine use of standardized questionnaires to screen for depression in asymptomatic primary care patients. Clinicians should maintain an especially high index of suspicion for depressive symptoms in those persons at increased risk for depression (see earlier). There are many screening tools available to help identify patients who are most likely to be depressed; these tools are designed to rate the severity of depression. Screening is recommended when depression is suspected. Commonly used patient self-report screens that are symptom-oriented include the General Health Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Symptom Checklist, the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, and the Zung Depression Scale. If scores are above a predetermined cutoff, patients should have a more comprehensive evaluation for depression.</dd>
<dd>D. Treatment. Treatable causes of depression should be identified first; for example, depression may be related to menstruation, pregnancy, the perinatal period, or the perimenopausal period. There can also be a relationship between depression and medications such as birth control pills or agents used in hormone replacement therapy (particularly the progesterone component).</dd>
<dd>1. Psychosocial treatment. Commonly used therapies include psychotherapy to correct interpersonal conflicts and to help women develop interpersonal skills; cognitive-behavioral therapy to correct negative thinking and associated behavior; and couples therapy to reduce marital conflicts. For patients with mild to moderate depression, psychosocial therapies may be used alone, or they may be used in conjunction with antidepressant medication.</dd>
<dd>2. Pharmacologic treatment. A large percentage of women experience significant improvement or even complete remission with medication. Factors to consider for treatment with medications include severe symptoms, recurrent episodes (two or more prior episodes), chronicity, presence of psychotic features such as hallucinations or delusions, presence of melancholic symptoms, family history, prior response to medication, incomplete response to psychotherapy alone, and patient preference.<i>--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPro-Lick_c6f2.html" title="User talk:Pro-Lick">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pro-Lick_c441.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pro-Lick">contribs</a>) 05:13, 25 March 2006.</i></dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Kyd's suggested version</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pregnancy is standardly defined in medicine and law as beginning at implantation. Others, including some medical professionals, differ in placing the start of pregnancy at fertilisation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Medically, the use of contraception is not considered to be abortion. However, some methods of birth control, such as IUDs and hormonal contraception, may prevent implantation.

<dl>
<dd><b>Problems with Kyd's version:</b>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>It refuses to acknowledge there is another purely medical definition</li>
<li>It discusses law under a section that states that it is a discussion of medical terms</li>
<li>It mischaracterizes the status of legal definitions (law is all over the place as to when a pregnancy begins)</li>
<li>It disregards a study that suggests that %50% of US ob/gyns don't accept the ACOG defintion</li>
<li>It ignores even the radical pro-abort &amp; pro-contraception AGI's admission that there is widespread acceptance of the idea that pregnancy begins at fertilization</li>

<p>I didn't write the second paragraph; I merely moved the pregnancy definition discussion to a more appropriate place. Don't ask someone to resolve so-called "Amerocentrism" involved in quoting the ACOG and then criticize the result. You have conveniently failed to address the fact that your version violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOVUW</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>.

<dd>I'm sorry.

As for the rest, "containing a developing embryo, fetus, or unborn offspring within the body," is far too ambiguous to support from-fertilisation as a <i>medical definition</i> (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOVUW</a>). -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 07:17, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kyd, you would have more credibility if you would simply admit that there is not unanymity withint the medical profession on this issue. Repeating your mantra does not make it true. Yes, the abortion and birth control lobby succeeded in gaining wide acceptance for their politically motivated 1960's redefinitions. But that success was not universal - and the traditional definition is still widely accepted. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Good</a> 08:01, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think its fair and necessary to NPOV to explain both definitions, however to avoid misrepresentation and weasel words, we need to explain WHO exactly is advocating these definitions. I think your last 4 links make is clear who represents the 'alternative' view. I also believe the citations Kyd and others have found in regards to the 'widespread' definition make it clear who represents the 'widespread' definition. Your version deletes this information and instead says "medical community vs. some medical professionals" which is misleading and weasely. (also, the MedicineNet.com definition only works for your argument if you use a specific definition of 'embryo'. I have pointed out to you in your own definitions where 'embryo' can refer to the product of a blastocyst that ISN'T the placenta. I believe MedicineNet is refering to this, because "This condition can be indicated by positive results on an over-the-counter urine test, and confirmed through a blood test, ultrasound, detection of fetal heartbeat, or an X-ray." only applies after implantation.) On to your criticisms of Kyd's version. Legal status of the definition: our sources say it is a legal definition, and this is applicable international, however to balance out this POV, we can always add a clause to the 'alternative' definition about certain states feeling otherwise. I asked if you could cite me some of these states, or maybe provide a link to this information. Next, I think it is significantly POV to be pushing your 50% statistic that only considered the view of 96 doctors in one southern city. You are also cherry picking the AGI info. Yes they say "widespread" but they also say every other point included in Kyd's version that you object to. Next, how is the BC section POV? It is clear that nearly all sources that are not pro-life do not consider BC to be abortion. Do we need to clarify this issue more to make it clear who thinks what?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 14:18, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the article SHOULD explain both definitions - especially the history that pregnancy used to begin at conception, and this concept was changed in the 1960s by birth control advocates (and there has been even more recent manipulation by trying to change the definition of conception to also be at implantation rather than the moment of fertilization). Paper over this reality hides the most important factor that explains why there is even a dispute as to the meaning of pregnancy. There once was a universal definition, and for political reasons, a new definition was invented; many still reject the new politically motivated re-definition precisely because it was developed not for scientific reasons, but political ones. Hiding this from the article is silly. I am all for total transparency. By the way, do you find it significant at all that Dr. Spinnato (not known as an acitivst, and actually highly regarded by his peers as an OB/Gyn and professor) discovered that in his own local community half of his peers did rejected the politcal ACOG redefinitions? How can one simply discount his research? Interestingly, despoite his findings and his status in the profession, the ACOG ignored his research (why do you think that is?) <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Good</a></p>

Next, I find it strange that you remove kyd's version for this reason: "- removed American-centric explanation." and then keep citing a study that only looked at 96 individuals in one southern US city. Finally, can we focus more on the specific wording proposals for this section?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 00:05, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-abortion_syndrome.html" title="Post-abortion syndrome">Post-abortion syndrome</a> (PAS)</span></h2>
<p>Any one here want to police the PAS article?</p>
<p>It seems to be a lost dog of an article without much scrutiny where the pro and anti side take turns POVing it.</p>
<p>Pro-lick, who seems to be familiar around here (for all the wrong reasons), is making it a mess (by trying make it a debate about the psychological consequences). I've noted he was blocked once already (according to <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPro-Lick_c6f2.html" title="User talk:Pro-Lick">his talk</a>). Also, he seemed to be hostile to comments I left him on his talk<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pro-Lick&amp;diff=45223999&amp;oldid=45222118" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pro-Lick&amp;diff=45223999&amp;oldid=45222118" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>--- he removed them, which also seems to be a pattern.</p>
<p>Any case, I'm not sure about what to do about PAS... and I'm not keen on policing it. On the one hand I think it would be good if it were merged into abortion-- 'cause it would get greater scrutiny. On the other hand, I think the article... is nice the way it is (in that it doesn't get lost in the larger debate). That said, it seems everyone wants to make the PAS article into a debate about the psychological consequences (if any)-- which I think it isn't. I see it as simply the larger medical community's current take on things. As I stated before-- the objectives of the article (as I see them) are:</p>
<ol>
<li>define the term,</li>
<li>present the view of the mainstream medical establishment on the issue and</li>
<li>place it in the context of the larger debate about abortion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like most things in abortion-- this article has seen a good deal of debate-- there was a request to delete <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Abortion_trauma_syndrome_1506.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Abortion trauma syndrome">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Abortion_trauma_syndrome</a>... which ended in a re-name and a battle about one particular external link <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EVerifiability_Religioustolerance.org_4835.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Verifiability/Religioustolerance.org">Wikipedia_talk:Verifiability/Religioustolerance.org</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/p/User%7ENephron_555e.html" title="User:Nephron">Nephron</a> <small><a href="../../../n/e/p/User_talk%7ENephron_679d.html" title="User talk:Nephron">&#160;T</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nephron_3dab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nephron">C</a></small> 07:22, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it would be a good thing to start compiling information on various societies social views...as the article indicates, it may not be not really representative of a world view.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How the BBC reference pages address these issues</span></h2>
<p>Here we can see how the BBCs online reference pages, with a global secular outlook, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/abortion/medic_method2.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/abortion/medic_method2.shtml" rel="nofollow">tackle the notion of abortion and contraceptives and when pregnancy</a> begins. They do a good job. I think it can help editors re-think what a neutral view on these issue looks like. Here <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/abortion/legal_when2.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/abortion/legal_when2.shtml" rel="nofollow">is another BBC link with similar</a> discussion. The BBC also <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/abortion/medic_select1.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/abortion/medic_select1.shtml" rel="nofollow">uses the term unborn child in its abortion reference</a> pages. I hope folks will not argue that the BBC editorial stance is anything but secular and global. I post this simply to make it clear that such terms are in common use in context's similar to wikipedia articles. The global and secular BBC also uses the term <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/abortion/relig_female.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/abortion/relig_female.shtml" rel="nofollow">feticide</a> in its reference pages. The secular and global BBC's reference pages also note that there is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/abortion/embry_viable1.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/abortion/embry_viable1.shtml" rel="nofollow">"no agreement in medicine, philosophy or theology as to when life really begins."</a> The BBC sexual health reference section notes that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/relationships/sex_and_sexual_health/contr_emergcontr.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/relationships/sex_and_sexual_health/contr_emergcontr.shtml" rel="nofollow">IUDs and certain contracpetive pills function by "stopping an egg settling in the womb."</a> Even the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/relationships/sex_and_sexual_health/contr_combpill.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/relationships/sex_and_sexual_health/contr_combpill.shtml" rel="nofollow">plain old pill "stops an egg from settling in the womb."</a></p>

<p>Hi, Evil. Do you have any RECENT studies concerning the possibility of hormonal contraception preventing implantation? It's long been speculated that it might do so, but I don't know of any clinical support for the claim that it does. While the BBC is generally reputable, it is not as relevant as primary sources. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 17:30, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Again, I simply point out that the BBC addresses these issues and does so using many of the terms that some editors here continue to claim are pro-life terms. The BBC is not pro-life. There is less reason to change the medical definition of pregnancy to implantation than to conclude that pills don't prevent implantation. So lets not start that game. No one has explained any medical reason WHY pregnancy got a new definition in 1965, just that it happened. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Good</a> 20:05, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You ignore me everytime I say this: Putting a fetilized egg into a woman is NOT good enough to make her pregnant. IVF fails 70-80% of the time. Pregnancy only begins IF the blastocyst IMPLANTS. Furthermore, you can fertilize eggs outside of a mothers womb and it does not make the 'test tube' pregnant. There are no biological changes in the mother until implantation. You cannot test for pregnancies until after implantation. Next, you have only cited ONE source (that I know of, forgive me if I missed any) in regards to your hypothesis that the definition of pregnancy changed for political reasons (meaning the definition is otherwise completely arbitrary, contrary to the stuff I said above). GT went and got the referenced source and copied and pasted it here and it doesn't seem to prove your argument. While I respect your right to have your position, I feel your hypothesis needs to be left out because it is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Work on getting sources and we can talk about this then. (note: I agree we should mention both definition in the article, and who specifically uses them. What I am arguing against is including your claim the definition was redifined in 1965 for political reasons. Furthermore, why should this article be the place to duke this out, when your information isn't even on the main <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> article)--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 23:52, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note: "<b>They may act by...</b>". When this section was still in the article, I had changed the wording to say "may". I provided sources and medical papers that said "<i>several more recent studies have not supported these findings, and the endometrial changes that have been observed may not be sufficient to prevent implantation.</i>. My original problem was that the orignal wording which said "Methods of birth control that prevent implantation, such as emergency contraception". So why are you posting these sources?

<p>The original version "covers all bases," and, thus, I believe it should be kept. Some women will regret abortion, or be pained by it, as many come to regret decisions such as dropping out of high school or having an extramarital affair.

<dd>Obviously some women are going to be unhappy about having an abortion. In fact, even those relieved by the termination of an unwanted pregnancy may well be unhappy that they got pregnant in the first place and had to have an abortion. This isn't the issue. The issue is whether there's some sort of PTSD-like syndrome associated with abortion. It has been claimed by anti-choice advocates to exist, but there's no credible evidence and we have to make that clear. Perhaps we can split the difference between these two paragraphs. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 04:25, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
