<p>I think that indeed we should let the facts speak for themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is, one the one hand, the cited point of view that the French government repressed unduly the expression of Falun Gong and Tibetan demonstrators, and that this shows that the French government is an accomplice of the repression that China wages on Falun Gong and Tibet.</li>
<li>On the other hand, it is also a demonstrable fact that the same kind of security measures was implemented against anti-Bush demonstrators, while France was at odds with the US.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can of course let the reader make his or her deduction from this point. But I do not think that it is neutral to cite allegations while not providing factual context.</p>
<p>Similarly, it was alleged that the French government cracks down on Falun Gong. On the other hand, it is a fact that Falun Gong freely demonstrates in Paris in all places where there is a Chinese community. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 16:56, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, to give the devil his due, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a> indicates that there was a provision involving "mental manipulation" in early drafts of the law that was later removed. If this is true, the story may be based on those early drafts rather than the final result.

<dd>That is why I inserted a caveat that the articles contained counter-factual information on the law, but some other user thought that this was inappropriate.

But the idea that we shouldn't mention a single word about those external links <i>telling untruths</i> about the very content of the law, because that would "taint the neutrality" of the article, is frankly ridiculous. If that kind of critique can be "pre-empted" by pointing out that not everything it claims is in the law is in the law, it's the kind of critique that is <i>better pre-empted.</i> -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:43, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>This is not so different from most other democratic governments, but the French took it a step further, insisting that citizens have no officially sanctioned ethnic or religious identity. Such a viewpoint is arguably non-discriminatory or, more precisely, equi-discriminatory. Yet societal stress on forced homogeneity, coupled with the exclusion of religious symbols and practices from all public places and discourse, led to feelings of oppression by people of faith within France.</i></p>

<p><i>Critics requested the dissolution of the MILS as its very purpose, "to fight against sects," is an affront to the French Constitution which guarantees the religious neutrality of the State and the principle of separation of Church and State. They also argued that there is a need to repeal of any discriminatory law containing the word "cult," "sect," "cultic," or "sectarian" as laws should not specify groups as "sectarian" or "cultic" as, in a democracy, all individuals and groups should be treated equally and in the same manner.<a href="http://www.coordiap.com/Gtemo01.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.coordiap.com/Gtemo01.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></i></p>

<p>A number of links to groups critical of the policies outlined in the article were added (many of them by anonymous users). While I think that it is very interesting to hear the point of view of people opposed to the law, I think that these additions would be of greater interest if one attributed to specific, identifiable, groups.</p>
<p>Anybody can found a group (or even <i>be</i> a group, all by himself or herself) and have a web site. The same group can run several web sites. In accordance to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> policy, we must</p>
<ul>
<li>clearly identify the sources of opinion</li>
<li>assert the representativeness of sources of opinions.</li>

<p>To quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>We should not attempt to represent a dispute as if a view held by only a small minority of people deserved as much attention as a majority view. That may be misleading as to the shape of the dispute. If we are to represent the dispute fairly, we should present competing views in proportion to their representation among experts on the subject, or among the concerned parties. None of this, however, is to say that minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The opinion of major, identifiable groups such as the International Federation for Human Rights, <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a>, or of institutions such as the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Court_of_Human_Rights_5e56.html" title="European Court of Human Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a>, is obviously more relevant to the discussion than the opinions of a unknown groups.</p>
<p>I note that many of the recent additions do not carry much meaningful factual information, apart from the information that a certain group disliked the About-Picard law. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 20:55, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In applying your quote from <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>, France is clearly isolated in the pursuit of these policies and legislations.

<dd>"Clearly isolated"? It does not seem clear to me, at least with respect to legislation. What does the About-Picard law essentially say? That, under some circumstances, you can prosecute an organization, even a religious one, for crimes committed by its management during the course of activity of the association. Now, let's look. There have been a number of well-publicized cases in the United States where people who had (at least allegedly) been raped or sexually abused by Roman Catholic priest have successfully sued the organizations of the Roman Catholic Church, to the extent that some of these organizations are now experience dire financial problems.</dd>
<dd>So, it seems to me that if we stick to facts, the United States already has similar legislation. I'd be happy to hear more about those US Catholic cases.</dd>

<p>Interestingly, David, you have reverted my edits and immediately after that you blocked me from editing that article (on a different IP I have used for years), for the only reason that the edits where challenging the position you hold in this subject. In my opinion this should be considered a misuse of your sysop powers. You do not even have an email address available to forward a complaint. I have complained to the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Wikipedia%7EStewards_2900.html" title="Wikipedia:Stewards">stewards</a> about your behaviour.</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, you are inadequately representing my position. I blocked IP address 168.143.113.125 (vortex.anonymizer.com) for the reason that there is a <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Anonymous_and_open_proxies" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">standing policy</a> that anonymizing proxies should be blocked. I quote:</dd>
<dd>'<i>Administrators are permitted and encouraged to IP-block anonymous proxies indefinitely. [...] <b>Such blocks are routine and uncontroversial.</b></i></dd>
<dd>I first discussed the matter on IRC with other sysops. Nobody raised any objection. I then applied a "routine and uncontroversial" standing policy.</dd>
<dd>Second, a valid email address is registered in my user preferences (but maybe there's a glitch in the software that prevents it from being used). Furthermore, I edit under my real name, and my user page has links to my "official" work home page, which explains how to contact me. A Google search would have given you the same.</dd>
<dd>Thus, I consider your complaints unwarranted, and libellous. Please complaint to stewards that you were blocked for using an anonymizing proxy, against the normal Wikipedia terms of usage. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 08:55, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your attempt to coverup your blatant abuse of sysop privileges is appalling. Case in point, the only reason you blocked my IP was because the edits I made were not of your linking. This is the sequence of events
<ol>
<li>I added <b>numerous, substantial and well researched</b> material to the article;</li>
<li>You were unhappy about these edits, so you popped-up your console and did a WHOIS on my IP;</li>
<li>Upon discovering it was an anon proxy, you found an easy way to silence me: <b>revert, delete my edits, block</b>;</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Your blocking was warranted by WP policy, but the manner and the motives for the block were not.</dd>
<dd>Note that your act was futile, as you have not silenced me. On the contrary.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I intend to pursue this all the way up to the arbCom if necessary And please do not change the link from the peer review. Let other editors know of this dispute as it is at the core of the peer review request.&#160;::--38.119.107.72 16:37, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You are cordially invited to go to the ArbCom if necessary. Let me point out to you that I discussed the matter with some members of the ArbCom on IRC prior to blocking the whole anonymizer.com range that I noticed because of you.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, I did not delete your edits, which were largely copies and pastes from sites belonging to various pressure groups, except in cases when they were opinion pieces that could not be attributed to a precise group. I actually even did a part of your "research", by adding the name and URL of some of the text that you copied.</dd>
<dd>So, please avoid <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel words</a>, and attribute criticism to whom uttered it. Then, we will be able to discuss the relevance of it.

<dd>Right. There is a difference between, for example, criticism by OSCE, and criticism from Church of Scientology officials invited at an OSCE-sponsored meeting.

<dd>You can cover biased statement by using such official-looking attributions. There is a craze by some to find attributions for every line of every article. Not only it makes for confusing articles, unaccessible to the common reader, as playgrounds for specialists only, but also it smacks of lawyers' ploys. Attributions, playing on the notoriety of the attributtee, and presented to support a thesis, sometimes stink as just maneuvers.</dd>
<dd>I suggest that all quotations and attributions should be kept out of the main texts, and become footnotes, for the specialists to play and have their solitary pleasures. This is my theory, "always isolate the side mess from the main mess". You are welcome to quote it and attribute it to me, or to the International Organization and Court of Greenfinch Rights on Attributions and Quotations;-)) --<a href="../../../p/g/r/User%7EPgreenfinch_6111.html" title="User:Pgreenfinch">Pgreenfinch</a> 08:36, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From the first look, the article gave the impression that there had been many parties very concerned about entering their specific POV without any regard for the article as a whole. Also the part about government and religion was very much written from an US view without considering history and present of France. I rewrote this part almost completely and moved some texts which belong further down.</p>
<p>I also added quite some points on the government activities - Vivien report, contents of Gest-Guyard report (yes, it has some contents besides the cult list in the appendix).</p>
<p>There is something more needed about the MILS except that Vivien was criticized.</p>
<p>I will also go over the critique part, and condense it to specific points criticized and relevant parties. In the end a summary para of who else has "been against it" without specifics.</p>
<p>And I'll add some positive views from France and abroad as well. <a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 07:09, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

A stragely political coalition, IMO. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">ZappaZ</a> <a href="../../../y/i/n/Image%7EYin_yang.svg_27c4.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Yin_yang.svg/12px-Yin_yang.svg.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" longdesc="../../../y/i/n/Image%7EYin_yang.svg_27c4.html" /></a> 23:56, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How does the new left come in? Just look at all the parties involved (Chirac center-right, About center-right, Picard center-left, Jospin socialist. The only major political force not involved was the nationalist far right.</dd>
<dd>Anyway this is no strange coalition in Europe. European Christians generally don't share the US idea that real Christians must be on the right wing in politics or else they are no real Christians: in Switzerland there is a center-right Catholic party and a center-left Catholic party (and the bishops conference agrees at times with one and at times with the other and at times with both), a center-left Evangelical party and a conservative-right Evangelical party (and minority Evangelicals play a role in both). Generally, European Christians agree more with the socialists regarding human rights, environment questions, and social relief and more with the conservatives regarding family values or life ethics (the parties they least agree with are liberals and right-wing nationalists). --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 07:30, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Note: Whether Jospin is a socialist is a whole question in itself. He famously declared that "the State cannot do everything" about some socioeconomic issue.</dd>
<dd>Irmgard is right: the About-Picard bill was passed with broad bipartisan support, and Nicolas About is center-right (<a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_for_French_Democracy_3e14.html" title="Union for French Democracy">UDF</a>). It is thus very misleading to attribute the French policies regarding "cults" to "left-wing" governments. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 21:14, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just finished a full copyedit which dealt with minor matters mostly but also eliminated "incorporation", which I believe is a legal "fausse amie" in this context.</p>
<p>US "incorporation" is a very narrow thing, even legally and certainly in the non-legal public imagination: in the US a corporation is, only, a commercial business enterprise, or at least this is the non-legal popular view -- we have a great deal of corporate law, but tax law really is what defines our corporations -- i.e. even a 501c3 taxfree corporation often is considered something different from a C corporation, in the popular press.</p>
<p>The French idea is more broad, I believe, and is associated with ideas of public accountability -- workers' control and the rest -- which are not present in US law. I don't know that US churches, for instance, are in fact incorporated in the US: or if they are, they are so for very limited purposes having to do more with tax and other business activities than they are with limited liability. And limited liability is your issue here.</p>
<p>So I believe the French situation is better described as involving "organizations": too-general of a term, I realize, but in the French context as read by an American restricting all of this to only "incorporated organizations" would be too narrow. A lot of the outfits being chased by / interfered with by About-Picard are not formally-incorporated in the sense that IBM Corp. is -- and Americans think nearly exclusively of the latter, I believe, when they think of "corporations". So I eliminated the hard legal language which appeared to restrict About-Picard to only those, here, and called the target simply "organizations".</p>

<dd>"Incorporation" does not exist in French in that meaning. Furthermore, only major companies have anything like "public accountability" or "workers' control".</dd>
<dd>The thing is, if you run a church or anything with several people, it is much easier if a formal legal entity owns the buildings etc. French <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_entity.html" title="Legal entity">legal entities</a> can take several forms — civil societies; corporations; 1901-law associations; 1905-law <i>associations cultuelles</i>... <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 08:11, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the "Application of the law" section is a reference to a fine denominated in French francs. But the fine was imposed in 2004, after France's adoption of the euro in place of the franc. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeoO3_4e6d.html" title="User:LeoO3">LeoO3</a> 15:55, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
