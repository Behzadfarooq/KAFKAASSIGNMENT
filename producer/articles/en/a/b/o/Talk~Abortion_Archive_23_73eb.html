<h2><span class="mw-headline">Survey Public opinion</span></h2>
<p>I found this: A Times/Populus survey carried out among 1,504 people in November 2004 found 38% of Britons believed abortion should always be legal, while a further 36% said it should be "mostly legal". Almost a fifth of those asked believed abortion should be mostly illegal, with just 4% believing it should be illegal in all circumstances. There was little disparity between the views of men and women, but Labour and Liberal Democrat voters were marginally more likely to support abortion than Conservative voters.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Neutrality of pictures in article</span></h2>
<p>I think the two pictures displayed alongside the "Abortion Debate" headline within the article are a bit ridiculous. The one displaying pro-life supporters shows young men and women holding a silent vigil, whereas the pro-choice representation shows older people rallying and picketing obnoxiously. Its also worth pointing out that the rally picture is of a much lower quality.</p>
<p>While the details are not really that relevant (the fact that one picture contains attractive people in their mid-20's and the other is a badly compressed image of 30-40 year-olds) the subjects' activities are. Specifically, the fact that the pro-life protest is shown as modest and subdued whereas the pro-choice protest is depicted as obnoxious and fervent. The fact is that plenty of distasteful picketing occurs on both sides (see <a href="http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2003/0301/protest0121.jpg" class="external free" title="http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2003/0301/protest0121.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2003/0301/protest0121.jpg</a>) and that silent and subdued protests are far and few between when it comes to topics this fervently debated.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the implications within the two pictures are far too obvious. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.28.191.109 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.28.191.109.html" title="User talk:71.28.191.109">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.28.191.109_21bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.28.191.109">contribs</a>) 19:21, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>The article can only contain images which are licensed for use on Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../i/u/p/WP%7EIUP_e163.html" title="WP:IUP">WP:IUP</a>). In short, those images not eligible for copyright, with an expired copyright, or which the copyright holder has given us permission to redistribute. The selection of abortion-related photographs and diagrams is rather thin, although I have compiled them into a category, <a href="../../../a/b/o/Category%7EAbortion_images_e247.html" title="Category:Abortion images">Abortion images</a>. There is an image of an <a href="../../../p/r/o/Image%7EPro-life_protest.jpg_80a1.html" title="Image:Pro-life protest.jpg">older pro-life crowd</a> as well as <a href="../../../r/o/e/Image%7ERoevwade.jpg_de12.html" title="Image:Roevwade.jpg">Gloria Feldt and Rep. Albert Wynns</a> at a pro-choice rally. Of these four pictures of abortion advocacy, all were taken in Washington, D.C., so there's definitely a thematic contrast between them all. The current pro-choice image might be grainy, but, compositionally, with the Washington Monument so central, I think it's great. It juxtoposes very well next to the great composition of the image of pro-lifers before the steps of the Supreme Court. I think the "obnoxious and fervent" complaint has more to do with scale: the pro-choice photograph was taken at the <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_for_Women%27s_Lives_de62.html" title="March for Women's Lives">March for Women's Lives</a> while the pro-life one appears to be a smaller scale demonstration staged solely by <a href="http://bound4life.com" class="external text" title="http://bound4life.com" rel="nofollow">Bound for Life</a>. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 21:49, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Similarly, why are there no pictures of abortion procedures, or of foetuses that have been aborted? That would surely help to clarify the debate, educating people as to why there it is a controversial subject.

<dd>I don't know what you mean by "shock images". Surely the last people who would argue that images of abortion were "shocking" would be pro-abortion people! After all, they don't believe that foetuses are people, and they think that abortion is acceptable! And from a pro-life perspective, such images would illustrate what they are fighting against! So how could anybody, in all intellectual honesty, object??<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERos_Power_4a2c.html" title="User:Ros Power">Ros Power</a> 19:06, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would object on the basis that the pictures informative value is trumped by their sheer grotesqueness. Yes, the procedure isn't pretty, however neither is a cesarian section, or a pap smear, yet these are equally safe and commonplace surgeries or procedures. The aversion to placing a picture of an aborted fetus is not based on the fact that it represents some truth people want to conceal; rather, it is an uneseccary exposure to something that is already the known ugly truth. Someone might say the same thing towards a picture of an alley in Calcutta of dying and starving children due to overpopulation, yet this is an appeal to emotion rather than a representation of information relevant to the article. 71.28.191.109 05:28, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the contrary, Ros, the only reason for adding such images would be ideological bias. Shock images, whether "pro-life" or "pro-choice," serve little to no informative purpose. Anything that can be depicted visually is better written in descriptive text. Thus, their only function would be argumentative, and this is not the role of an encyclopaedia. Other than being uninformative, it is my opinion that such images would <i>detract</i> from the quality of this article, by lessening its stringent adherance to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. Frankly, the "but other articles do it" defense doesn't hold water. I cannot say whether graphic images at Gonorrhea, Feces, or Anencephaly add informative value to those articles, but, I don't edit them and so I will leave it to the Wikipedians who do to determine what is appropriate there. Also, most of the afforementioned articles do not share Abortion's hot-button pedigree, so there is little comparison between other articles' use of graphic images and this one's failure to do so. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 22:03, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree that they would not be informative. Many people are acutely unaware of the basic humanity of the aborted child - that is ignorance - an ignorance I too once possessed. Many women are shocked after an abortion to see their child's head and limbs in a metal dish. Surely the whole point of Wikipedia is to inform, enlighten and educate? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERos_Power_4a2c.html" title="User:Ros Power">Ros Power</a> 11:04, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(reset indent) Now we are shifting into territory which is completely counter to NPOV. It might be one thing to argue in favour of shock images from a purely medical standpoint, but, your argument above only proves why such images should be precluded. There is no way that the presentation of such images could ever be considered neutral in the context of abortion. The role of Wikipedia, as an encyclopaedia, is to provide factual information; it is not to attempt to influence personal opinion. Let's leave that to advocacy groups, who probably do a better job in general, anyway. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 11:51, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think both sides of the debate here have very good points, and I would like to see what Ros might come up with. Just because Ros has a blatant anti-abortion bias does not mean that his argument has no value. If a picture that accurately represents an abortion - or perhaps one being performed (he does mention abortion procedures in his first post)- can actually be agreed upon by a majority as something worthwhile, I don't see a problem with it being added. After all, wiki is about information. If there is a crowded street in Calcutta with starving children, although it contains "shock value" to see it, it's the truth, isn't it? It's not ROS' fault that the truth IS shocking, and his suggestion shouldn't necessarily be shot down for it.</dd>

<dd>And in regard to the two pictures already up in the abortion debate section, although the editor wanted a "better quality" picture for the pro-choice representation, one could also argue that the pro-life representation contains about three people, while the pro-choice one is a sea of people. So I think they're fair as they are.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanselmdoc_839f.html" title="User:Stanselmdoc">Stanselmdoc</a> 19:23, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(reset indent) Sorry I only violate the NPA when I think the discussion is effectively over. I thought so but this is not the case. Would you place a photo of a person during the Whipple operation to the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pancreatic_cancer.html" title="Pancreatic cancer">pancreatic cancer</a> article? Of course you wouldn't people are not used to seeing blood and bowels and liver and burned and cut tissues .. such an image could distract people and prevent them from taking the operation that could perhaps be life-saving for them. Just because they are not used to something.</p>
<p>As people are not used to seeing blood and cut heads and limbs etc, that doesn't mean that cut heads and limbs are evil? You get it? Ever? I doubt it .. The information in showing blood is zero, it's only emotions you are playing with.</p>

<dd>You've successfully confused me. Is your sentence <i>As people are not used to seeing blood and cut heads and limbs etc, that doesn't mean that cut heads and limbs are evil?</i> a question? But that's not my point anyway. My point was, surely EVERY picture of an abortion procedure isn't "too graphic" to handle. Ros mentioned TWO kinds of pictures - dead fetuses and abortion procedures. Then everyone harped on the dead fetuses idea and completely ignored the possibility that there might be a picture around of an abortion procedure taking place that might actually be tasteful. Forgive me for maintaining faith in the internet. Oh, and forgive me for "playing with emotions" as well. Not my fault abortion IS an emotional subject. I'd like to hear from ANY woman who has felt no emotion in regard to having an abortion. Be it horrified emotion, or a good emotion. So don't accuse Ros and me of "bringing" emotion into a previously "unemotional" subject. Perhaps the medical procedure has no emotion, and may be presented in such a way. Oh wait...isn't that the kind of picture I suggested? Thought so.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanselmdoc_839f.html" title="User:Stanselmdoc">Stanselmdoc</a> 14:18, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Should not have been a question. You know it, so stop kidding me. I am not accusing you of bringing emotion into an unemotional subject. I am accusing you of inability to perceive, that allowing emotions in the article is not a good thing for an encyclopedia. I am opposing using pictures of blood, cut limbs, resected bowels, resected pancreas etc in any article here. How would you imagine a picture that would be "descriptive" of abortion? A woman in gynecological position with some tubes inserted in her vagina? Yep that would be informative. But better described in text than illustrated by a picture. --<a href="../../../a/c/k/User%7EAckoz_4ac0.html" title="User:Ackoz">ackoz</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg_c483.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cb/Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg/20px-Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg_c483.html" /></a> 18:14, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hahaha I think you think I'm smarter than I am. I really was confused and really didn't know it wasn't a question. But thank you for clearing it. I'm not imagining anything being "descriptive" of abortion. I haven't mentioned anything about even having found pictures that I would suggest putting up in the article. I'm saying that IF there are pictures like that, why can't Ros search for them? We agree on the same thing, I'm opposed to having pictures that are unhelpful as well. My problem is that everyone seems to want to stop Ros from trying to find a picture that IS helpful. Granted, his idea of helpful is probably different from others. But that doesn't mean he shouldn't be allowed to try. You never know, he might get lucky and find something that we all agree on.

<p>We need to be perfectly clear in terms of the sort of images we are discussing for potential inclusion in the article. A shock photo, whether of the pro-life or pro-choice variety, would be unencylopaedic and POV. There is, in fact, a photograph of the body of a woman who died of an illegal abortion which is occasionally trotted out in pro-choice literature, so it's not as though we're only discussing the exclusion of the aborted fetus pictures used in pro-life activism — the rule works both ways.</p>
<p>Are we, on the other hand, discussing medical diagrams? It needs to be stressed, then, that many apparent "medical diagrams" of abortion were in fact commissioned as propaganda. Also, photographs of an abortion procedure, as described by Ackoz, would be so ambiguous as to be suggestive of almost any other gynecological procedure. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 22:44, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But you are, Severa, absurdly asking for the suppression of any image of the key focus of this aticle - the most common of all surgeries - first trimester abortion. Your pretense at neutrality by noting that a shock propaganda photo of a dead mom (a very rare victim of a botched illegal abortion) is also prohibited (to suggest the "rule" is balanced) is extremely transparent. Of course all good wikipedians know that the wikipedia solution has always been "if it ain't available on google, then it won't appear in the article." The NAF diagrams are the same as others you can find (see below). You must not be very well-versed in clinical abortion to make such odd statements about what an illustration of abortion would look like. Like most sugeries, it is ugly because it is bloody. But that is no reason to suppress the information (censor it). Go ahead, <a href="http://www.nafresources.org/NAF/appuploads/EarlyVacuumAspiration%20NAF%20EarlyOptions%202005.ppt" class="external text" title="http://www.nafresources.org/NAF/appuploads/EarlyVacuumAspiration%20NAF%20EarlyOptions%202005.ppt" rel="nofollow">register for free and download the powerpoint diagram from NAF here.</a>and then compare it to <a href="http://catalog.nucleusinc.com/enlargeexhibit.php?ID=11041&amp;TC=&amp;A=2" class="external text" title="http://catalog.nucleusinc.com/enlargeexhibit.php?ID=11041&amp;TC=&amp;A=2" rel="nofollow">the one here.</a> And by the way, the medical illustration of partial-birth abortion that is all over the internet <a href="http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/ProfBowesonPBAdrawings.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/ProfBowesonPBAdrawings.pdf" rel="nofollow">was medically verified by an eminent professor as an accurate depiction of abortionist Martin Haskell's procedure</a>. Stop with the tripe about propaganda. Get off the censorship soapbox. Aborting a fetus is ugly, no mater how you slice her. An abortion advocacy bias is the primary basis for keeping professional medical illustrations of abortion out of the article. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.215.219.html" title="User:84.146.215.219">84.146.215.219</a> 05:14, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Abortion is a common surgery. Why would images of such a common surgery be suppressed, if not to hide what it is? How is bringing what it is to light in any way biased? A bias for more information is what wikipedia is all about. A bias to hide relevant information is sinister - and what wikipedia is NOT all about. The strong desire to keep images of what an abortion is hidden speaks volumes about those who possess it. The strong desire to make such images available to more people (rather than suppressed) is to be lauded by all who favor enlightenment and decision-making based on fully informed decision-makers. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.204.113.html" title="User:84.146.204.113">84.146.204.113</a> 14:27, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think it's fair to have one image of a few pro-life activists and another image of a huge crowd of pro-choice activists.

<dd>I think the issue is one of scale: the pro-life demonstration is by <a href="http://bound4life.com" class="external text" title="http://bound4life.com" rel="nofollow">Bound for Life</a>, a grassroots organization, while the pro-choice image depicts activists at the <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_for_Women%27s_Lives_de62.html" title="March for Women's Lives">March for Women's Lives</a>. Another user above expressed the concern that the younger age of the pro-life demonstrators in the photo makes the pro-choice cause appear less current. I don't think that the relevancy of an issue can be judged from the apparent turnout in a picture of an isolated protest. After all, "size isn't everything," and many gatherings are considerably smaller affairs than the <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_for_Life_6b7a.html" title="March for Life">March for Life</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_for_Women%27s_Lives_de62.html" title="March for Women's Lives">March for Women's Lives</a>. I think that it speaks to the dedication of those who are willing to turn up even if they aren't thronged by 100,000 others. Also, the current pair of pictures create a thematic juxtaposition, centred about two Washington landmarks. That said, my own personal concern for the pictures is the unintended Amerocentrism; it would be nice to to have capture an image of activists in the abortion debate in another country. Anyway, there's <a href="../../../p/r/o/Image%7EPro-life_protest.jpg_80a1.html" title="Image:Pro-life protest.jpg">an alternate image of a pro-life gathering</a>. It's certainly a larger crowd than that in the Bound for Life picture, and, hopefully, this would resolve your concern. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 21:11, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good job on these pictures, Severa. I think we could actually keep the current pro-choice picture with the hundreds of supporters, and maybe we could just change the pro-life one to a picture with more people. OR we could keep the small-scale one of the pro-lifers and change the pro-choice picture to something more small scale as well.

<dd>If we were to use the image of a smaller-scale pro-life demonstration, though, we could also switch the current picture of the large, American pro-choice march for the small, Irish demonstration. This would be killing two birds with one stone, as it were, because I mentioned earlier that I wanted to counteract the current "American bias" in the activist images and thus help to give the article a more global perspective. However, it appears as though that image has been uploaded on fair use grounds, so I'm concerned that copyright would be an issue. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 03:25, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Are pictures of protesters really necessary in the article? We all know what protesters look like: they span pretty much all ages, they sometimes go to events and important places, and they hold picket signs. You could add pictures of protesters to get the idea across of what their group is like, but then it'd make more sense to just include it in the text, except it doesn't really seem relevant to the article. <a href="../../../7/0/2E/User%7E70.66.9.162.html" title="User:70.66.9.162">70.66.9.162</a></p>

Does anybody think something like a Portal or Project page would be a good idea? We could use such a page to try and organize the articles that exist, merge things that ought to be merged, fill in any gaps that are apparent, and help keep track of articles that particularly need work.

<dd>Wow. Great work, GTBacchus. Thanks for going to all that trouble. Your idea for establishing an abortion-related portal is a great. I do what I can, here and there, but there are some articles which need attention, especially from experts in the subject. And, no, KC, not participating as much in this article as you used to doesn't make you a bad Wikipedian, although your presence here has been missed since you ran away from home.&#160;:-) Frankly, I've been doing the same of late, mostly because I've been concentrating on the abortion sub-articles instead. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 23:20, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, that's a positive initial response. Does any of us know how to code those boxes with "show" and "hide" links, where we could list all those categories and their articles in a tree that could open and close - do you know what I'm talking about?</dd>
<dd>I imagine a page with that tree on it, and then a big to-do list, with some large-grained tasks, like merging categories and articles, and starting new aritcles where needed, and some small grained tasks, like lists of abortion articles in need of copyediting, sourcing, etc.</dd>

<p>Yeah, great work GT! A portal sounds like a really good idea. I've always found it confusing to try to keep track of all the different abortion-related pages, and this will surely help a lot.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wrongful abortion</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../w/r/o/Wrongful_abortion.html" title="Wrongful abortion">Wrongful abortion</a> article has been dead in the water for several months, having been tagged for clean-up since September, 2005. This article is largely dependent upon a single journal article and I would thus consider it OR. I tried <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wrongful_abortion&amp;oldid=23144287" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wrongful_abortion&amp;oldid=23144287" rel="nofollow">overhauling</a> the article last year, but objections were raised, so I reverted the entire thing. Nothing has been done in the eight months since, and the complainer has had <i>more</i> than enough to to amend the article as they see fit, or to at least make suggestions as to how others might to do so. They have done neither. So, I suggest that the article be reverted to my version, and expanded upon, and that the "wrongful life" section be merged into the recently-created <a href="../../../w/r/o/Wrongful_life.html" title="Wrongful life">Wrongful life</a> article.

<p>User <a href="../../../a/s/w/User%7EASwann_fc60.html" title="User:ASwann">ASwann</a> moved the Alan Guttmacher institute link to the unbiased section. I moved it back, stating in the Edit summary that they are associated with Planned Parenthood. ASwann reverted and left a note on my talk page saying that they are not associated. We need to discuss this and get down to the truth of the matter. Here is my evidence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The founder, Alan Guttmacher, was "president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and a leader in the International Planned Parenthood Federation in the 1960s and early 1970s."

<li>In 1998, Congress gave Planned Parenthood and its affiliated organizations, the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the <b>Alan Guttmacher Institute</b>, $142,976,618 to support its domestic and international "family planning" agenda.

<dd>I've moved it too, but I won't move it back until we have consensus. As to the two points, Guttmacher himself died in 1974, so his current effect is nil. The Institute itself does research in large part, and at least in that context it <a href="http://www.jstor.org/journals/agi.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jstor.org/journals/agi.html" rel="nofollow">defines family planning broadly</a>. While it may have its own point of view, it doesn't engage in advocacy like Planned Parenthood does.

<dd>Yes, we shouldn't base our information on sources that are biased in the other direction. On the other hand, a quick glance <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/about/faq.html#4" class="external text" title="http://www.guttmacher.org/about/faq.html#4" rel="nofollow">here</a> shows no mention that there is currently any link between the AGI and PPFA, nor that there has been since 1977, when "the Alan Guttmacher Institute was incorporated as an independent, not-for-profit organization". They even get funding from the government for certain projects; I find it hard to believe that the current US government would be funding projects connected to PP. Although there was a connection at one time, that does not mean that the research put out by this institute currently is biased. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomarin_f0a3.html" title="User:Romarin"><i>rom</i></a><font color="green"><i><b>a</b></i></font><a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomarin_f0a3.html" title="User:Romarin"><i>rin</i></a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/m/User_talk%7ERomarin_fbee.html" title="User talk:Romarin">[<i>talk</i> ]</a></small> 21:22, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>While the link between between the Alan Guttmacher Institute and Planned Parenthood is, at best, outdated, or, at worst, mistaken, the following <a href="http://guttmacher.org/about/index.html" class="external text" title="http://guttmacher.org/about/index.html" rel="nofollow">statement of purpose</a> is found on the official Guttmacher Institute site:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The Institute's mission is to protect the reproductive choices of all women and men in the United States and throughout the world. It is to support their ability to obtain the information and services needed to achieve their full human rights, safeguard their health and exercise their individual responsibilities in regard to sexual behavior and relationships, reproduction and family formation."</i></dd>

<p>Also, there is reason to move <a href="http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/" class="external text" title="http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/" rel="nofollow">Abortion Statistics and Other Data</a>, given <a href="http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abriskeditorial.html" class="external text" title="http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abriskeditorial.html" rel="nofollow">this editorial</a> written by the site's owner. I thus suggest that we create a second disclaimer, such as, "The following statistical resources may be created by those with a non-neutral position in the abortion debate." Site such sites as the AGI and Johnston's Archive, unfortunately, fall into a grey area between purely neutral parties and clear-cut advocacy groups. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 23:18, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Done. Also, thinned out superfluous links.

Or should we slot it into the second section along with AGI and Johnston's Archive? I know "non-neutral" is sort of neologistic, but it's certainly less negative than "POV," or "biased."</dd>
<dd>I think also that think that we should also try to counteract the Amerocentric selection of links presented within the "non-neutral advocacy" section. Most of the organizations listed are American.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">External Links</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I'm new to Wikipedia and am still figuring out the editing process. I added what I thought were some appropriate external links to a few abortion related pages. They were quickly removed. The rationalle for removing the link I added to the "advocate" section of the main "abortion" page was as follows: "We cannot link every site with a position on Abortion". I agree, though I would argue that <a href="http://Abort73.com" class="external free" title="http://Abort73.com" rel="nofollow">http://Abort73.com</a> provides a more comprehensive and engaging defense of the "pro-life" position than any other site on the web. As such, its inclusion seems a fair and appropriate addition, providing a valuable resource for those wanting to better understand the pro-life position.

<dd>NPOV concerns would outweigh censorship concerns. Such images, within the context of abortion, would be more argumentative than informative, whereas graphic images in the vast majority of anatomy-related articles are able to serve an educational function because there is little to no ethical controversy tied to penises or vaginae (with the exception of, perhaps, circumcision and FGC). -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 16:35, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This seems to come up a lot. Personally, I'd have no problem with a graphic image showing a fetus aborted at two days of pregnancy, it would look something like this: .</dd>
<dd>However, the call for images on this article page is far too often a request for showing late-term emergency induced abortions/miscarriages, which reduces an extremely wide topic (Abortion) down to an extremely narrow one, and most often involves pictures which rely on anthrocentric appeals to emotion... oh, and BTW, we already have one picture of an induced abortion procedure being performed on the page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Angkordemon.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Angkordemon.jpg" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>&#160;:-) <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 01:51, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Calm down. You asked, we answered, someone thought it possible you were a troll and stated valid concerns. Perhaps Elliskev could have phrased his concern a wee tad more tactfully but you threatening to "report" him is not the best way to handle this. Always attempt to work with another editor first - a simple "it was a serious question and I appreciate the answer" would have gone a long way. A "call the cops" mentality is emphatically <b>not</b> helpful on Wikipedia. The "cops" are volunteers too, and have better things to do than protect every thin skinned person from percieved slights.

<p>The breast cancer and mental health sections seem relatively pointless. It says, "The hypothesis has not been verified and abortion is not considered an actual breast cancer risk by any major cancer organization." So if this is true, why in the world is it important enough to be mentioned here? Concerning mental health, it seems that that is also pointless. Many things that can happen to a person cause negative feeling. For example, getting HIV/AIDS must severely injure your mental health, but that article doesn't talk about it.

<p>I redid the translation now because the NLM one was incomplete (included only the header), and incorrect in that the warning was against abortions by trained midwifes (okusherka) and self-taught midwives (povival'naya babka), not doctors and nurses.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A picture of abortion.</span></h2>
<p>As was said above I realize this is already a touched upon issue and my comment is nothing new to the argument but I was wondering why is there no actual picture of an abortion/post aborted fetus on this page? The picture is only as POV as the messages following it as I've seen many proponents of abortion openly share them and declare they are worthless appeal to emotion in the context of abortion <i>debate</i>. Regardless, they're neutral outside debate and it's curious an entire article on ABORTION has no picture of such despite the fact they clearly exist. To further prove it is NPOV: I am pro-life and will openly admit I don't think people surfing this page, seeing the picture will honestly be changed by it. It just seems to stupid to censor content that speaks no message other then "This is an abortion.". It's a disservice to the type of informaiton Wikipedia is trying to provide.</p>
<p>I might as well address this point now: as I had said above the pictures of abortion are pretty NPOV to begin with. Pictures displayed matter-of-factly that somehow evoke pity or sympathy do not mean that they can't ever be displayed without sharing a point; they just draw upon innate emotions. Pictures of rape, war, genocide, and other serious world issues certainly are all very negative when looked upon but that doesn't mean they were posted by anti-war goers etc. and so forth. --<a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalv_be30.html" title="User:Talv">Talv</a> 14:56, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

NOBODY, and I mean NOBODY is asking for a picture. The reason nobody is asking for a picture, is that there is no controversy surrounding donkey shows, and there are no advocacy groups constantly publishing biased articles and detail depictions of it. The question is not that of appeasing you ("i'd be satisfied with very little."), it is of educating the public in a neutral, and removed fashion.

<p>On the contrary, Talv, it would do a disservice to the quality of this article to open the floodgates to shock photos. Also, please be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> to Ronobop, because it's not as if your point of view on the matter is unapparent. I'll stand by my argument that pictures of aborted fetuses or women dead from illegal abortion are uninformative. If there is a point to made about not "hiding" the visual outcome of a surgical procedure, I suggest you also voice your concerns at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_surgery.html" title="Cardiac surgery">cardiac surgery</a>, <a href="../../../h/y/s/Hysterectomy.html" title="Hysterectomy">hysterectomy</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastic_surgery.html" title="Plastic surgery">plastic surgery</a>, and <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_reassignment_surgery.html" title="Sex reassignment surgery">sex reassignment surgery</a>.

<dd>It was a disservice to Wikipedia for the abortion catergory of articles to ever be written: they've been nothing but controversy, but that's what you get. I remember the first time I ever read it on top was the "Neutrality" tag and then finally it was locked from editing and of course, I laughed expecting it.</dd>
<dd>I was being civil. I have been nothing but civil. I would argue Ronobop is being smarmy and sarcastic towards myself, on the contrary.</dd>
<dd>As far as you drawing my attention to other articles on Wikipedia I would argue that attempt is fallacious. I have no passion for such subjects, or knowledge and would probably never have even looked at them if you hadn't given them. While we're on the subject, yeah, I do think they all need pictures of the procedure, save for the ladder (I've seen pictures of most medical procedures. Sex change surgery remains to be one of the few I haven't. I know this is more then coincidence). The censorship is more then endemic, Wiki is after all uncensored where matters of sensitive or vivid content is concerned: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_disclaimer_8d69.html" title="Wikipedia:Content disclaimer">Wikipedia:Content disclaimer</a>, especially when you willfully look it up. --<a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalv_be30.html" title="User:Talv">Talv</a> 17:52, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>@Somnabot: I exist, and willfully am arguing for this. Therefore, you are incorrect. NOBODY is not arguing for this, SOMEBODY is. --<a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalv_be30.html" title="User:Talv">Talv</a> 17:55, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>EDIT: I will rescind my view to put a picture into the article. I respect the upkeepers of the article who, as far as i'm concered, are those active enough to check the Talk page. Of course I could always just edit it in, that's the type of power you have here but it would be edited out. If something becomes an edit war over an already good article, it isn't worth it.

<dd>Indeed, you have been nothing but civil, Talv, something that previous supporters of graphic depictions have never been. The eternally-fair Severa's initial comment was directed at Somnabot and Ronabop. To you, he gave merely a reminder, as your anger was becoming apparent and it appeared that you might cross the civility line. At least, that's my reading of the passage. Severa, obviously, speaks for himself. (Also, somebody above split my post in two and then slapped an &lt;unsigned&gt; template on my first paragraph. I don't know if that was accidental or what, but I want it made clear that I am not in the habit of leaving my comments unsigned.) &lt;end paragraph 1&gt;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for the precedent of previous surgical articles having/not having detailed depictions, I do find the argument persuasive. I took a look at the [[List of surgical procedures] and went through every operation, one by one. I have a detailed list on my computer, but, because it would be obnoxious to paste the entire thing up here, I'll just relay my results. Of the 47 articles labeled that were not labeled as stubs (and there were several that *should* have been so labeled, but were not, and are still included in the 47), 20 included detailed depictions of the related surgery, whether it be a medical diagram of the procedure, a diagram or image of the tumor/organ to be removed/destroyed, a photograph of the surgery in progress, or a photo of the result (e.g. a vagina after <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoridectomy.html" title="Clitoridectomy">clitoridectomy</a>, or a post-<a href="../../../a/m/p/Amputation.html" title="Amputation">amputation</a> human hand). So it would seem that nearly half of surgical articles already largely agree with Talv's position that these things should be shown. Whether that should apply to <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> is the question at hand here. Furthermore, I think we should make a distinction between shock photos and medically explicit depictions. We aren't out to shock our readers for the sake of it, but we <i>do</i> want to present <i>all</i> the facts in the most encylcopedic and illustrative manner possible. --<a href="../../../b/c/s/User%7EBCSWowbagger_cab9.html" title="User:BCSWowbagger">BCSWowbagger</a> 20:03, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is an interesting perspective, but this is not a surgical article, and "abortion" is not a surgical procedure. Dialation and Curretage *is* a surgical procedure. Dialation and Extraction *is* a surgical procedure. Dialation and Evacuation *is* a surgical procedure. Abortion, however, is a catch-all term, referring to spontaneous abortions (miscarriages) and elective abortions, pharmaceutical, surgical, and otherwise. We could load the article up with examples of each, or elect to have images of a D&amp;C procedure over at D&amp;C. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 02:58, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, BCS, that was I who added the "unsigned" tag. Someone is posting their messages within the comments of other users, or there is some kind of server error, so I felt it necessary to rectify the situation the only way I knew how: seperating the posts and adding an "unsigned" tag.</dd>
<dd>Specifically, I was reprimanding Somnobot's "quit whining" comment, which was patently uncivil, and Talv's "I can tell you have an agenda you're attempting to push" comment, which I found mildly, but inappropriately, accusatory in nature (see <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>). Ronabop's comment was snarky, but I didn't find it <i>particularly</i> uncivil, probably because I interpreted it as a generally sarcastic remark rather than a direct personal attack. If Talv felt insulted, though, I'm glad that Ronabop is willing to own up to making a mistake. If only past discussions on this forum could have demonstrated such a civil level of incivility.</dd>

<dd>Wow. I don't think I've ever seen so much civility in a Wikipedia abortion conversation. Not to mention one without any anonymous users TALKING IN CAPITAL LETTERS!!!!!1!!1! Severa, the &lt;unsigned&gt; thing is no problem. I assumed it was something accidental or miscommunicated, and so it was. As for abortion as a surgical procedure, Ronabop, I think it's clear that most of the article is about induced abortion, as is most of the debate over the issue. However, your point is cogent. I have already been looking for public-domain diagrams to add to <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilation_and_extraction.html" title="Dilation and extraction">dilation and extraction</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilation_and_curettage.html" title="Dilation and curettage">dilation and curettage</a>, though so far without success. Nonetheless, adding it to those other articles in no way prevents us from placing a more medically accurate image in the induced abortion section of this article. The question is whether that would be a good idea. It clearly follows a precedent, but not an overwhelming one. And the abortion article is very different in nature from other non-controversial surgeries. So it's really up to consensus, although I think, regardless of how we decide, it will be a point that will be brought up and re-evaluated periodically, as is healthy in any article of this nature. --<a href="../../../b/c/s/User%7EBCSWowbagger_cab9.html" title="User:BCSWowbagger">BCSWowbagger</a> 07:32, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Ronabop, I think it's clear that most of the article is about induced abortion, as is most of the debate over the issue.</b></dd>
<dd>I can agree with that (while also noting that the most widely used form of induced fertilized egg/blastocyst/fetus rejections are pharmaceutical, not surgical, in nature), but could that mean that the article is lopsided, or how we use pictures in the article is lopsided, or what? Mostly my sense of bemused irritation comes from folks who want to portray all natural, surgical, and pharmaceutical procedures similarly. A MVA <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manual_vacuum_aspiration.html" title="Manual vacuum aspiration">Manual_vacuum_aspiration</a>, with WHO (anybody know their copyright status?) pictures at [<a href="http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Manual_vacuum_P65_P68.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Manual_vacuum_P65_P68.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>], makes it pretty clear that even surgically induced abortions are fairly simple, and not even that interestingly graphic. To repeat a refrain, many who have asked for (and suggested) pictures are *not* asking for pictures of an abortion procedure, or process, they are asking for gore pictures of a dead human fetus, which is not what this article is about, subject-wise (Though it could be, if the article was renamed Human aborted fetuses). However, I can understand their motivations, in that they are wishing to "humanize" and "personalize", abortion, and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images. While seeing such things doesn't really bother me all that much (having fed a good 20-30 fetuses to coyotes in my life, and consuming at least a few hundred... life on a farm an all), I'm divided on how to present the subject, images, and article, properly in a NPOV manner. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 09:56, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure of your claim that pharmaceutical abortions are more prevalent than surgical ones. However, I agree with you about those who seek to portray all abortions in the same way (although it is *quite* possible to find quite graphic photos for most surgical procedures and the saline abortion method). I also agree that too many people are out to use the article to score political points, not to create an encyclopedia. (I dispute that this is a "functional" tactic, as you put it; for various reasons, it almost invariably backfires on the anti-abortionist who presents the image. Also, LOL at the rest of your post.) In any case, the point is moot until there is actually an imaged proposed for use here. I'm looking into a few that I think will meet our standards, and I'll be back with an update in the near future, I hope. --<a href="../../../b/c/s/User%7EBCSWowbagger_cab9.html" title="User:BCSWowbagger">BCSWowbagger</a> 01:31, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I tend to lean almost unilaterally toward <i>adding</i> pictures to articles (because it definitely makes them more appealing), I'm very much torn on this one. I would love to see if there IS a picture that would be usable for the article, but...to be honest, I don't think the "pictures of an abortion" have a place here. Those pictures are used relatively universally to prove a pro-life point. That doesn't mean that people shouldn't see them, but it does make it difficult to say they deserve a mention on an NPOV article. Maybe they could be on the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-Life_08e5.html" title="Pro-Life">Pro-Life</a> article or have a LINK to some at the bottom of this article, so that people could click there if they choose? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanselmdoc_839f.html" title="User:Stanselmdoc">Stanselmdoc</a> 18:50, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm late to the discussion, but how can you possibly take a picture of an abortion? <i>A fetus is not an abortion.</i> A picture of an aborted fetus might be useful in the fetus article, but not here.

<dd>How could you take a picture of an abortion? Ultrasound. Silent Scream did it (though there are *other* good reasons SS won't be used). However, I don't think that's a valid point. The article on <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amputation.html" title="Amputation">amputation</a> shows a hand minus two fingers. Should that picture be moved to the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hand.html" title="Hand">hand</a> article? I think not. Nonetheless, we seem to have acheived a consensus: more illustrative images would be a good thing, but "shock" pictures will not be accepted unless the article somehow directly concerns such images (e.g. in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-life.html" title="Pro-life">pro-life</a> article, perhaps). --<a href="../../../b/c/s/User%7EBCSWowbagger_cab9.html" title="User:BCSWowbagger">BCSWowbagger</a> 06:24, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
