<dd>I'm going to be blunt: this article had gotten stuck in a rut due to the constant bickering from all sides. We can't even come to a consensus about the very first sentence, much less anything else. In the meantime, so much effort has been expended on fighting each other that the article has been allowed to rot and editors have left in disgust. Pro's editing style may offend the over-cautious, but by being bold and being competent, he's fixed a lot of really awful sections. Fundamentally, he's moved this article into being based on evidence, not on bipartisan compromise. This is as it should be and I support it. This article needed a reboot, and now it's gotten one. I will vigorously oppose any attempt to punish Pro's efforts and return this article to its previous, decayed state. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 06:47, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even though I question DonaNobisPacem's motivation, I appreciate the RFC. I had already added RFCs in 2 different sections. I definitely don't mind more and differnt people than our present group. With any luck, they'll remind the parties involved that consensus is only an article content tool when used in determining what the majority of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> sources think, as is also made clear on the consensus page and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a>.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 07:00, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Are you arguing <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a> supports your position? Because I don't see that. The definitions and sources you have accumulated are all well and good; but the "viewpoint" the fetus dies from an abortion is held by the vast majority of people you actually understand what an abortion does. I've been busy recently but I do want to bring in more views on putting murder mention in the following paragraph allowing us to remove "death" or if both should be there. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 08:25, 27 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Undue weight is policy. The section topic is RFC. If you'd like to pursue the use of murder, do so in a different section. If you can show mentioning it is not undue weight, then I have no problem with it.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 08:57, 27 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not doubting undue weight in the least, I'm doubting your ability to apply it neutrally. Frankly the Encarta mention of "death" in their definition undercuts about <b>every single policy point</b> you've made here regarding death. The only one that <b>might</b> stick is consensus of sources; but I would again reiterate many sources don't have the same summary style goals we do. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 02:31, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One more time: the issue is not whether, in some technical sense, abortion involves something dying. Obviously and uncontroversially, it does. The issue is whether we should use a definition that specifically mentions "death". If we look at the definitions out there, it looks like they generally do not. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 08:29, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You see what Alienus just did Pro-Lick; said exactly what you are saying but in summary form; and not being confrontational. Just putting it out there for consideration instead of trying to force it on the article. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 08:41, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Opps forgot to answer Alienus. What is also generally true is the definitions "out there" are not encyclopedic. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 02:36, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Took me a while to spot this nugget; where the heck did original research come from?! This isn't about OR! Its about acknowledging most sources do not have the stylistic (summary) demands encyclopedias do; and no source I know of has the same editorial demands to take in all points of view; something we are forced to adhere to because of Wikipedia's open and transparent process. Taking a "consensus of sources" <b>does not cut it</b> for responsible editors who understand the need to frame the collective knowledge and P'sOV into a coherant neutral whole. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 05:18, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As shown by the edit logs, this is not the first time you've wondered off for several days after claiming you were tired of it all. Sorry, but I don't buy unsourced pleas for sympathy that are blatant requests for POV support. As for civil and NPA, take a look at the RfC they posted before you start suggesting I did anything that hasn't already been publicly accepted and unpunished.

<p>It seems like progress on this article comes to a halt when debate fills up the talk page. One thing that other controversial and active pages have done is to create topical subpages (see <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_56ae.html" title="Talk:Jesus">Talk:Jesus</a>). This way, all the debate can be in one place, and the basic talk page is left uncluttered for other 'priorities'.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sockpuppets</span></h2>
<p>As some of you may know, Pro-Lick was blocked yesterday for violating 3RR. During the block, several new users sprang up, and started reverting to his version. A user check has established that Pro-Lick is AbortMe, Cry Me a Shill, and Vote Machine Malfunction, all of whom began to edit during his block. He is also the previously-blocked user Halliburton Shill. Pro-Lick's block has now been extended, and the new sockpuppets he created in the last 24 hours have been blocked indefinitely. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 20:39, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, some of the edits were an improvement. Many more were not. The problem is not the source of the edits; the problem is that Pro-Lick added large sweeping edits, both "good" and "bad", "sourced" and "unsourced", in single edits without gaining any kind of support or consensus, violated 3RR, then used socks to evade the block. This is against WP policy. Violating 3RR then using socks to evade block is what he did, not making bad edits (in this context).

<dd>I have to agree with KC on this--Haliburton Shill/Pro-Lick was one reason I stepped away from the article. Bad-faith edit warring even with the best of intentions is more stress than I need ... and frankly, I can't state that his/her intentions were good with any degree of confidence. If it wasn't such a hassle, I would revert to the last edit before Haliburton Shill's "sock army" started the melee and evaluate any changes on the talk page. Even if every single edit done was a "good" edit, we have a situation where the end simply does not justify the means, (IMO, YMMV). <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 21:58, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Were these deaths the direct consequence of abortion-related medical complications? No. The study's authors mined the Finnish database and compared data on women who had undergone abortion, birth, or miscarriage within a year of dying for other reasons — evidence of <i>correlation</i>, if anything, but certainly not causation. It would thus be highly inappropriate to refer to this as the "abortion mortality rate." -<font color="darkgreen">Severa</font> (Kyd) <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">??</a> | <a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a> 09:56, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You can cateogrize it however you like.

<li>Events and issues favorable to abortion opponents are sometimes ignored or given minimal attention by the media.</li>

<li>Many news organizations have given more prominent play to stories on rallies and electoral and legislative victories by abortion-rights advocates than to stories on rallies and electoral and legislative victories by abortion rights opponents.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Columns of commentary favoring abortion rights outnumber those opposing abortion by a margin of more than 2 to 1 on the op-ed pages of most of the nation's major daily newspapers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Newspaper editorial writers and columnists alike, long sensitive to violations of First Amendment rights and other civil liberties in cases involving minority and anti-war protests, have largely ignored these questions when Operation Rescue and other abortion opponents have raised them.</li>

<p>This was discussed extensively in Archive 16. There is a practical concern for the size of this article, and, trimming the link list is a one of the easiest ways to avoid unecessary bloat. I, personally, would argue that images of cases of anencephaly serve a fascination with curiosities — in the sense of a 19th-century sideshow — moreso than medical education, but I don't edit that article, and I'm not familiar with the practices of its resident editors. Shock images, in the context of the politically-charged Abortion article, are more argumentative than informative. There's nothing that could be depicted pictorially which isn't already described far more accurately in the written text. -<font color="darkgreen">Severa</font> <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">??</a> | <a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a> 10:37, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You people should try being honest for a change. It is obvious that those who are against pictures in this article are simply against them because they support abortion and it hurts their cause. This is simply biased and dishonest, and all it does is reduce the credibility of the encyclopedia. I have heard that other articles, such as those related to genitalia, are "informative" enough to provide multiple photos (rather than drawings)...but this one's text is supposedly so good that pictures of protestors, ancient engravings, and Japanese shrines are more useful than pictures or even drawings of a fetus or the procedure. Over a million abortions a year..but it's a subject best described with text instead of shown. What a laugh.

<dd>That is why it is linked, and reverted your removal of "or from" to the lead; it is there to specifically cover spontaneous abortion. Termination in the live lead is referring to gestation, this version is referring to pregnancy. Unsure of the problem; could you please expand and clarify. Are you saying a terminated pregnancy needs to be removed? I'm pretty sure that innaccurate as many miscarriages terminate and then self remove (expel) themselves naturally.

<p>Including non-viability as a prerequisite for every abortion is clearly archaic. Perhaps the thought used to be that no doctor would kill a viable fetus. With the advent of partial-birth abortion and hysterotomy abortion, that is no longer the case. Most late term abortions are performed on healthy fetuses after 19 or 20 weeks, the point at which viability is now placed. And thousands of late term abortions are done each year in the US (they are not rare, they are atypical; annually in the USA there are 500 times more late term abortions of viable fetuses than lawful executions). These two medical definitions do not included viability:</p>

<p>It's getting confusing trying to decide whether to post here or on the subpage. The proposed opening leaves "death" out of the definition, but includes it in the first paragraph. Obviously, I'd prefer it in the definition, as the death of the fetus is the whole purpose of the abortion — if it doesn't die, then either there was a <i>birth</i> or there was a <i>failed abortion</i>. Nevertheless, I can live with this opening as a compromise.</p>
<p>Regarding the words "viable" and "non-viable", it is certain that the word "abortion", in common usage, refers to any time up to birth, even if it is not medically defined that way. Language is not a static thing that can be put in a box and left unchanged. "Presently" used to mean "immediately". Later it came to mean "in a little while". Now many people use it to mean "currently". If enough people use a word in a certain way, then the dictionaries update their definitions. So if "abortion" is generally used to refer to the process that takes place early <i>or late</i> in the pregnancy, we don't want to give the impression that every fetus deliberately killed by a doctor would have been incapable of surviving anyway. Nevertheless, I can live with the suggested opening, which says "medically defined", and then goes on to say that "in common parlance" the term is for viable ones also.</p>
<p>I think it's important that the article shouldn't try to downplay (by reducing it to a tiny sentence somewhere in the middle) the fact that the fetus <i>dies</i>, or that procedures commonly called abortions are also carried out on fetuses that would have been able to survive. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 09:42, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not comfortable with the mixing of singular and plural in <i>"an embryo or fetus, even viable ones"</i>, and would change it to <i>"an embryo or fetus, even <b>when viable</b>"</i>. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 09:42, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will add that if it didn't say "medically defined", I would object strenuously to the use of the word "nonviable", as it would be highly misleading. Even with the "medically defined", it's still less clear than I'd like, as the first sentence is the one that people notice most. But, as I said, I can live with it. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 10:27, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggested Effects Review</span></h2>
<p>As you may be aware, the Health effects section has been marked as "MAJOR REORG NEEDED. Entire section is argumentative, and biased". This was done before I became involved in the article, but I do find the description still accurate, though the section may be better than it once was.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html#Suggested_effects" title="Abortion">Suggested effects</a> is a subsection of Health effects. To start the review, I decided to take a peer approach and see how another encyclopedia covered the effects listed under "suggested effects".</p>
<p>I reviewed the MSN Encarta encyclopedia and found the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Breast cancer</b> - Abortion-breast cancer does not have its own article, nor is breast cancer mentioned in Encarta's abortion article or abortion mentioned in the breast cancer article.</li>
<li><b>Fetal pain</b> - Any type of pain related to the fetus does not have its own article, nor is it mentioned in Encarta's abortion or pregnancy articles. The pains of being pregnant are mentioned.</li>
<li><b>Mental health</b> - Post-abortion syndrome does not have its own article, nor is it mentioned in Encarta's abortion article. Nothing about depression or other mental disorders or syndromes is mentioned.</li>
</ol>
<p>To help us better organize and provide the proper weight to the suggested effects subsection, additional reviews and comparisons are welcome.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 17:29, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia has a <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Long_Tail_17f4.html" title="The Long Tail">Long Tail</a>; this is a decided advantage over traditional sluggish sources, like Encarta that need to be conservative with their topics and resources, and its a key part of what makes Wikipedia so popular. You bring up our coverage of secondary topics as though it is a bad thing; I assure you its a significant positive. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 18:18, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The goal of this has nothing to do with clipping Wiki's tail, nor to reduce coverage of secondary topics or to interfere with Wiki's popularity. If anything, I'd like there to be more coverage. The goal is to improve a section noted as "argumentative, and biased". In particular, to review and compare how the suggested effects that are emphasized and argued for (instead of simply described and linked to) are handled by other sources.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 16:21, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Acquiring the correct tone and weight is difficult for anyone; be it Wikipedia or outside sources with little transparency. But it is a laudable goal; if said sections are indeed as you describe. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 20:27, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would suggest that we consult the rules on undue weight, as they're fairly clear about this. The absence of coverage in a paper encyclopedia is not reason enough for us to omit coverage, but it may give us a hint about how <i>much</i> coverage a topic deserves, if any. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 17:33, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not really. I refer you to <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploding_animal.html" title="Exploding animal">exploding animal</a>. I would consider any coverage of said secondary topics certainly relevant; but the lack of coverage means precisely that; a lack of coverage. Inferring anything else is shooting from the hip, so to speak. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 20:27, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let me put it this way: If a traditional encyclopedia covers something, this is a fairly strong hint that we ought to as well, but if it doesn't, then we have to rely on our own judgement. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 20:36, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For convenience, the links below are to some previous reviews I did regarding how breast cancer risks are handled in medical publications:</p>

</ul>
<p>To summarize, 3 of the 4 do not mention abortion as a breast cancer risk, and the 4th considers it a false alarm.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 20:47, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The "major reorg" note predates any of the "Suggested effects" sub-sections (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion&amp;oldid=20713164" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion&amp;oldid=20713164" rel="nofollow">random edit</a>, dated August 10, 2005). If anything, it is the poor, neglected "Health effects" lead which needs review (or, more specifically, sources and a rewrite -- it's currently a mish-mash of disparate additions). -<font color="darkgreen">Severa</font> <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">??</a> | <a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a> 22:58, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With the exception of fetal pain, the content of the suggested effects subsection are there. It just isn't a subsection yet.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 23:15, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
