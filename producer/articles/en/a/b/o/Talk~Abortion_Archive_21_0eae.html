<h2><span class="mw-headline">Incidence Photo - Buddhists</span></h2>
<p>This is a photo that already is on the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_abortion.html" title="Religion and abortion">Religion and abortion</a> page. It is a photo of a religious ceremony and is only loosely related to the section. It is described in a way that is anti-abortion and links to a a religious article. Both the text and the article promote an anti-abortion view that their should be funerals for these fetuses. Of the photos on the page, anti-abortion photos already have +2 advantage. For these reasons, I think it violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> to add this photo.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 23:27, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Until such time as a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_abortion.html" title="Religion and abortion">religion and abortion</a> sub-section exists (and, granted, that might be a while, because no one is interested in paying the to-do agenda any mind, and I'm sick of taking it on single-handedly), do you have a better suggestion for where to put it? As for "anti-abortion photos," I honestly don't understand your rationale. This isn't a contest; it isn't we pro-choicers versus them pro-lifers. We're not keeping score. -<font color="darkgreen">Severa</font> <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">??</a> | <a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a> 23:50, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think I already answered your question about a better idea. Keep it on the religion and abortion page. Why reproduce it here if you don't even have consensus on a section you wish to add (but don't wish to put in the work for) where it might fit? That adds no consensus for adding the photo to the list of reasons why it should be removed.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 00:24, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another thing to consider, this article has been tagged for not having a worldwide view point. While this is only a small step, including information from other cultures (while possibly overlapping with religion) also helps broaden the international depth of the article. I believe this photo is significant in that it helps towards eventually removing the worldview tag. I also don't see how this cultural practice is anti-abortion, seeing as how it clearly does not prohibit abortion. Do a google search on it sometime. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 15:40, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The religious magazine article it links to describes it as something imposed upon the women, associates it with infanticide, and uses typical anti-abortion propaganda language like "souls of their babies" and "children". It cites an article called <i>Ill effects of abortion: Terrible harms are caused by the souls of aborted embryos to their own families.</i> The religion and abortion article section it links to: <i>Mizuko kuyo ... lit. "water-child memorial service"</i>. Child is neutral? Later, <i>soul of the fetus</i>, <i>believed to protect children</i>, and associating it with <i>infanticide</i>. It's only NPOV in terms of describing how the religion views it (and I'm not even sure of that, it may be just a small sect of Buddhists that are receiving undue weight relative to the majority). I think what this shows is that the world view tag is being employed as a distraction to insert POV, which means the NPOV tag will return shortly regardless of whether the world view is satisfied or not. Maybe it's just a lack of work ethic in seeking out international photos that actually provide incidence-related information.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 17:20, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>patsw seemed to be against the new opening proposal, but I could never really figure out his objections (I think it had to do with the d-word). You objected to one word in the proposal (nonviable). And AnnH reluctently accepted this version as a compromise. Everyone else that gave imput seemed to aprove it. It is not unanimous, but it is a majority. As I said, this version is at least more accurate than the previous version, so I felt that there was nothing wrong with having an almost unanimous version sit on the front page, as opposed to the problematic version that was previously there. Besides, now that it is out in the open, more editors will be able to contribute to it to make it even better.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 15:29, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1) The article shouldn't be protected in the first place. An admin unfamiliar with this article had a hair-trigger response. It should be unprotected immediately.</p>

<dd>Well, the protection is apparently because of that photo of the Buddhist ritual. Can we get some more editors to comment, and determine what the consensus is? Severa, Pro-Lick and others have commented in the section above. Myself, I can see both sides. Having the first picture in the article being a ceremony honoring the souls of the stillborn and the aborted <i>could</i> come across as prejucicial. On the other hand, we don't have any other images near the top, and this one does contribute to a more global perspective. Comments?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Agreed. Patsw, I'm in favor of a simpler word such as, ending or stopping or ceasing. I prefer simplicity provided it doesn't undermine accuracy.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 03:09, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From the <i>The Concise Oxford English Dictionary</i>: "terminate→ v. 1. bring to an end. • end (a pregnancy) before term by artificial means." And from the OED itself: "termination e. The ending of pregnancy before term by artificial means; an induced abortion." While we are at the OED, let's see what it says under abortion: "In <i>Med.</i> abortion is limited to a delivery so premature that the offspring cannot live, i.e. in the case of the human fɶtus before the sixth month." If we are going to quote a medical definition, I see no problem in using the terminology that is very commonly used medically. Terminate is not a euphamism. It is a proper term used very often in medical literature, and abortion definitions. We can dumb it down and take out the so-called euphamisms in the "common" definition (which is exactly what we did in my proposal).--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 03:41, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Concise Oxford English Dictionary</i> appears to define "termination" to include induced delivery, c-section, etc. which ends a pregnancy by artificial means with a <i>live birth</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The question I raise is whether the appearance of "termination" as being identified with "death of an embryo or fetus" as a euphemism is the end product of a 40 or 50 years of POV pushing that some want to ratify here as "neutral", and the neutral "death of an embryo or fetus" has somehow become POV pushing. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 03:58, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Where are we passing this off as neutral? By saying that the medical community technically defines a word in a certain manner, we are expressively stating a POV, and clearly saying who holds the POV. I fail to see the problem. There are TWO definitions from TWO POVs. The neutral aspect is that we are not playing favorites and saying which one is right or better. We are saying what the definitions are, and the context in which they are used. Why are you acting like we are covering up your POV? The new proposal clearly states <b>the death of an embryo or fetus</b>. What is the problem here? --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 04:41, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Patsw, this is why I made it a point a relatively long time ago to put together a list of commonly referencable definitions for the group (that, anybody could and still can add to).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A thought about the consensus process</span></h2>
<p>Alien and Prolific, just a note regarding "requirements such as verifiability and neutrality are not subject to vote or consensus". That was also my impression when I studied the policies some time ago. My belief in the concept was based on that assumption. However, I was wrong. I had not figured in the true importance attached to consensus on Wikipedia. I have since reached the conclusion that the consensus process is <i>assumed</i> to <i>safeguard</i> policy. And I do not like it one bit. Because in practice it means that consensus <i>trumps</i> policy. (I'd like to be proven wrong in this respect but I don't expect I will.) <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 10:49, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. As I understand it, policy is formulated by the Wikipedians and by its nature is based on <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">OR</a>, instead of verifiability. That means voting. But until that changes article content policy, the article content policy trumps all. The problem is getting that enforced when you have an article dominated by a POV that has no interest in verfiability or neutrality. That's probably why the consensus article makes it a point to highlight that as a problem. In practical terms, it means that an completely inaccurate article can exist for a very long time if it gets enough people behind it.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 15:32, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, this is about enforcement. But I think you are optimistic when you say that "the article content policy trumps all". I think it should, but it doesn't. The point made over and over again on WikiEN-L and in policy discussions is clear enough. The historical chain leading from "how can editors create a neutral encyclopedia", via <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010416035757/http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/NeutralPointOfView" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20010416035757/http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/NeutralPointOfView" rel="nofollow">NPOV (original formulation)</a>... <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>... <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>... <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>... <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>... <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">Undue weight</a>... and the Jimbo quote at <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">Undue weight</a>... always ends in: Consensus. The endpoint is consensus. Now I do acknowledge the importance of consensus. But I think the endpoint should be police, if the real world is anything to go by. Not to control the majority of generally law-abiding folks. But to keep the jerks from controlling content. And to keep the discussion sweet and simple; empower good editors to make progress without having to waste time. That's what I would like admins to do. To see to it that policy is being followed. But I'm afraid the main focus is on enabling editors to <b>reach consensus</b>. Even ArbComm will not engage in content disputes. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 16:42, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the end, there are no rules, just our interpretations of them. Consider the case where a dozen conservative Christian zealots act in concert to sway the consensus. If they decide to interpret <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> to allow this article to begin with "Abortion is the murder of an innocent pre-born infant", then that's what NPOV <i>is</i>, by definition. If this is seen by some as an example of a cabal trying to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> the article, the cabal can decide that this is not the case, and that's that. If people complain, the cabal can brand them <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">uncivil</a> vandals who edit against consensus and get them banned. If you think this is absurd, take a look at <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">Circumcision</a>, which is owned exclusively by pro-circ zealots who do all of these things.</p>
<p>The solution is to recognize that not all votes are created equal because not all voters are. When someone has a track record of ignorance or bias, their view on the matter should be discounted accordingly. Yes, the Pope is an expert on Roman Catholic doctrine, but he's also incapable of neutrality, so his vote (even if ex cathedra) is less valuable than my own.

<p>"NY Times can not be biased"? that article is specifically from the POV of a person who is apparently attempting to associate a nation where anti-abortion laws are not very well regulated with the pro-life movement in order to draw a conclusion that a nation led by a pro-life agenda will apparently "do bad" so to speak, am I missing something in that link?

<dd>Hi, Slim. I'm happy to have "areas of the world" changed to "parts of the world". I also agree the the bit about human abortion getting the most attention is a bizarre point to make, and would be quite happy to leave it out (or simply to say that this article focuses on human abortion). The problem is that there has been a long discussion about the word "death", with most editors feeling that it is an essential part of the definition. There have been attempts to remove that word, or to add utterly inappropriate qualifiers,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion&amp;diff=45495315&amp;oldid=45494959" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion&amp;diff=45495315&amp;oldid=45494959" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and there has been some edit warring. A few people argue that "death" is POV, as it implies that the fetus is human; others have argued that it doesn't imply that at all (a dog can die, a cell can die, bacteria can die). In my view, the POV is what the thing is that dies (a baby? a human being? a piece of tissue? a blob? a clump of cells? an unwanted growth on a woman's womb?), but that it <i>dies</i> is simply a fact, though an unpleasant one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We have discussed this at length on this page, and the arguments have been made that removing "death" and changing it to "expulsion" or "removal" fails to distinguish abortion from childbirth — even if it's premature childbirth. After multiple proposals and votes and much edit warring, there does seem to be a general agreement that "death" should be in the first paragraph. The question now is to whether or not it should be in the first sentence (which would be my preference). I feel we should have "death", <i>and</i> "expulsion or removal", but to have the latter without the former is leaving out an essential part of what an abortion is. If there's no death, then it isn't actually an abortion, but a live birth, or a <a href="../../../g/i/a/Gianna_Jessen_d47c.html" title="Gianna Jessen">failed abortion</a>. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 09:10, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree about "death" needing to be there, because clearly something that is alive is undergoing a procedure to stop it from being alive (that, indeed, is the point) so it would be obtuse to leave that out. But I don't understand why someone keeps restoring the bizarre mass media point, because it makes Wikipedia look silly.

<dd>I don't particularly want to get involved in the politics of this page, but the intro, whatever it says, has to be meaningful and intelligent. Problems with the one that was there (point a is still there): (a) The termination of a pregnancy isn't "associated with" the death of an embryo, as though the termination and the death are often seen at the same time but no one can work out why. The termination causes the death; (b) abortions don't occur spontaneously "in the form of a miscarriage" (as opposed to in some other form?): a spontaneous abortion is what non-medical people call a miscarriage. It's like saying a patella comes in the form of a kneecap; and (c) the biology and mass-media point is silly; what is the purpose of it? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:30, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't want to get involved in the controversial aspects of it, but it has to be accurate. A miscarriage is the colloquial term for a spontaneous abortion. One doesn't happen "in the form of" the other. One doesn't happen "as" the other. They are two names for the same event. And the mammalian point was reinserted.

<dd>This time the sentance on mammalian pregnancies was different - it was pointing out that this article focuses on human pregnancy. What's the problem in stating this? We all agree the previous sentance was odd.</dd>
<dd>On the point of miscarriage - the sentance you proposed was something along the lines of:
<dl>
<dd>Abortions can occur spontaneously, in which case they are called spontaneous abortions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Which to me sounds nearly as silly as the mass media comment. I think miscarriage and spontaneous abortion are synonyms, with pubmed returning 25,785 results for the former, and the latter 13,491. The medical community seems to use both, whereas colloquial usage strongly favours miscarriage.</dd>
<dd>I also notice that <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a> has never moved from this name, and has not been discussed. While that could partly be down to not recieving enough traffic, it does suggest this is not an obvious wrong word to use.</dd>

It's hard to get any kind of good writing established with this high degree of suspicion and sensitivity, but yes, I take your point and apologize for not rewriting the whole sentence.</dd>

<dd>If my memory serves me correctly, the text, <i>"All mammalian pregnancies can be aborted; however, this article focuses on the abortion of human pregnancy"</i> was born of a conflict in which a user was determined to change "fetus" to "human being." His reasoning, a strawmen which conflated genetics with personhood, went something like, "Well, if it isn't human, what is it? A cat?"

<p>Keeping track of prior consensus precedents and the logic behind them is not always easy. As with court precedent, sometime the precedents lead to things we never anticipated. In this case, it probably is legitimate to note the focus on human abortion. But simply mentioning that fact will make abortion supporters cringe. So we get the oddball sentence about mammalian pregnancies - which is later pointed out as somehow too weird for the article - which leads back to the fact that there does need to be some mention that the article focuses on people. The good thing about this is that all the debate drives home the realities that (1) the article does at times ignore wikipedia standards by backflipping and tiptoeing around the sensitivities of those who embrace abortion as a good thing for those who choose it, and that (2) any serious debate about abortion makes abortion supporters squirmy and defensive and reduces them to making <b>undeniably false claims such as</b>:</p>

<dd>I would imagine "practicability" in the sense of which methods can be or are used at specific durations in the pregnancy. Perhaps, this should be changed, due to the common understanding of "viability" as being synonymous with fetal survivability in the abortion lexicon.

I'd recommend the chart title, "<i>Practice of Induced Abortion Methods</i>," and the image caption, "<i>Gestational age may determine which abortion methods are practiced.</i>" I would also recommend introducing some kind of ruler along the bottom of the image, so to show the precise number of weeks, but if that's not feasible, it's great as it is! -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> | <a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a> 01:52, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

For example, I'd rather people get the impression that Dilation and curettage is practiced from the middle of the 1st trimester to the beginning of the 2nd trimester, rather than from the 6th week to the 15th week (as there's a lot of variation in practice). <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 05:22, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Adoption does not belong in "See also", it is unrelated to the subject at hand, immaterial, and is clearly only listed for political reasons. If an anti-vandalization measure is really necessary, then "Alternatives to abortion" should be created and linked.</p>

<p><i>I'm rewriting this in an attempt to adopt a calmer tone.</i> I find it highly questionable that a link to "birth control" was removed but "adoption" was not.

<dd>Wikipedia is a community-written encyclopaedia. Naturally, we are going to have to satisfy both pro-choice and pro-life interests. It's a difficult balancing act.</dd>
<dd>"Birth control" was a category; "Adoption" was under the See also list. Categories are organized indexes specifically related to the topic. See also, on the other hand, is more liked a "recommended reading" list; listed topics, like books, can be directly, or more generally related, but their chief function is to serve in directing the reader to material which might be informative or interesting given the current subject. Thus, there is more "wiggle room" in what you add to "See also." "Birth control" means contraception, and, thus, it would be inaccurate (and POV!) to categorize abortion as birth control. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 06:53, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Birth control does not mean contraception. Rather, contraception is one type of birth control, while abortion is another.

<p>See, where we differ is that I'm looking at this purely as a matter of proper definitions. Birth control is defined in terms of controlling birth, not just preventing conception.
