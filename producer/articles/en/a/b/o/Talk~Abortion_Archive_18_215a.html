<p><i>however, emergency contraception is generally considered equivalent to abortion by those who maintain a definition of pregnancy which is alternative to that of the medical community.</i></p>
<p>I am unclear why this phrase was changed from it's original (more correct) wording.</p>
<p>It is untrue that those who think that "life begins at conception" have an "alternate definition of pregnancy".</p>
<p>They may have an alternate definition of the beginnings of human life, but implantation is irrelevant. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Jkister (<a href="../../../j/k/i/User_talk%7EJkister_7340.html" title="User talk:Jkister">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Jkister_5d55.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Jkister">contribs</a>) 06:10, 2 March 2006.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>You said "It is untrue that those who think that "life begins at conception" have an "alternate definition of pregnancy"." Actually, that is the specific point: the definition you are discussing is the beginning of <i>pregnancy</i>, which the medical community defines as beginning at implantation. If one says that pregnancy begins at conception, then that is nothing less than an "alternative definition" of pregnancy. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 07:01, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If this is their true alternative definition, then women get pregnant and miscarry all the time, probably more often then they actually get pregnant (by the standard def.). I'll look for some numbers. See: <a href="http://www.pprsr.org/justforteens/howdoespregnancyhappen.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pprsr.org/justforteens/howdoespregnancyhappen.cfm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>
<dl>
<dd><i>Each month a woman's brain sends out hormones that cause changes in her uterus. At one point in the cycle, her body creates a potential home for the fertilized egg in the wall of her uterus. A woman can only become pregnant during the days when the uterus is ready. If the fertilized egg doesn't attach during this part of her menstrual cycle, it's all expelled from her body as part of her period.</i>
<dl>
<dd>If this is meant to suggest that fertilized eggs are expelled regularly from woman's body unless the uterus is ready, this is nonsense. Unless the uterus is ready, the fertilization never actually takes place, since the cycle of the ripening of the unfertilised egg is synchronised with the cycle of preparation of the womb. A fertilized egg can normally only catch the uterus "unprepared" if it is inserted artificially after fertilisation "in vitro". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.220.226.16 (<a href="../../../2/1/3/User_talk%7E213.220.226.16.html" title="User talk:213.220.226.16">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.220.226.16_1c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.220.226.16">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>I can't answer for "people that support this definition" in general, but I <i>can</i> say that pro-life Catholics (including myself) would regard a fertilized egg, flushed down the toilet while the mother has no knowledge of it's existence, as a unique human being with a soul, created in the image and likeness of God.

<dd>One distinction to keep in mind is that most people who believe life begins at conception believe there is life irrelevant of the egg's implantation onto the uterus, or if that egg was fertilized in a test tube -- they'd say there was still "life". By saying these people have an alternate definition of "pregnancy", we may be confusing the issue. Jkister 17:38, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I can certainly understand the distinction--I think all of us can agree that life begins at fertilization. The operative point here is that the article is specifically discussing the definition of pregnancy, not the beginning of life. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 17:44, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the operative point here is the definition of "abortion", and not "pregnancy" or "life". Those who oppose abortion do so not because it ends a pregnancy; they do so because they say it ends a life. Thus, anti-abortionists are likely to find the definition of "pregnancy" to be irrelevant; as if murder is excused just because the victim hasn't implanted him or herself in a uterine wall yet. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 18:25, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I can see the wisdom of that ... but that simply demonstrates that the pro-choice and pro-life contingents are not talking <i>to</i> each other--they're talking around each other. Maybe I'm being a bit too idealistic, but perhaps if we can at least get the two sides talking <i>to</i> each other on Wikipedia, we can come up with an article that both sides can agree with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The way I see it, if abortion is the termination of pregnancy, then we have to work within that definition. If abortion is the termination of a life, that's really going to create problems for communication. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 01:26, 4 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The pro-choice and pro-life contingents talking past each other? Never. The problem is that the pro-life camp sees abortion in moral terms, and the pro-choice camp sees it in medical terms. In moral terms, who cares whether it's a pregnancy? The point there is that an unborn baby with a soul is getting killed. In medical terms, it makes sense to distinguish a pregnancy from an unimplanted <a href="../../../z/y/g/Zygote.html" title="Zygote">zygote</a>, or whatever it's called, because they're biologically different. Agreeing to the other side's definition entails conceding too much, apparently. We should probably state outright in the intro that the definition of abortion varies depending who you ask. It's either the termination of a pregnancy, in the clinical sense, or it's legalized infanticide, and nice distinctions be damned. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 03:12, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I see where different definitions are coming in. The problem is--as Alienus notes--the shifting of the definitions then makes this much more an exercise in polemic than in knowledge. My preferred solution would be to stick to the denotations here at Wikipedia. While I oppose elective abortion, I've seen far too many rabid "pro-lifers" who would stoop to any rhetoric, bombast, or lie to "prove" their argument (and I have seen far too many pro-choicers do the same thing). Hopefully if we can stick to the facts and avoid the emotionally charged "trigger words," we can make a better article.

<dd>As I've said before, an ovum can be fertilized in a petri dish, but that doesn't make the dish pregnant; so, logically, pregnancy should be defined as beginning at implantation in the uterus. However, I think some people's equation of EC to abortion has more to with the special significance they place in conception. It is less, I believe, to do with how the medical community or anyone else defines the beginning of pregnancy. Perhaps the issue would be better approached from that vantage. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 18:51, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Except that both the sperm and egg cells are alive the whole time, so what does it mean to say life "begins" at conception? Logically, the intention is to suggest that fertilization marks the start of a new organism, but this issue is independent from pregnancy. I suspect the real point here is polemic, in that redefining pregnancy lets them call emergency contraception "abortion", making it sound much worse. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 00:20, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Woops - you have your facts wrong! Pregnancy was redefined as beginning at implantation in the late 1960s by savvy proponents of birth control who realized that they had to do so or else contraception would be considered abortifacient, and therefore against the law in most places.

<p>I'd just like to emphaize that pro-lifers' opposition to abortifacient contraception has <i>absolutely nothing</i> to do with any opinion as to when pregnancy begins. It is, as GTBacchus said, based on the belief that human life begins at the moment of fertilization. While I doubt if all doctors define pregnancy as starting at implantation, whether they do or not wouldn't change the way pro-lifers view the destruction of pre-implanted embryos, whether in a petri dish or in a fallopian tube. The point here is the belief that the embryo is a human being, not the belief that pregnancy does or doesn't begin at implantation. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 21:32, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, take the case of excess eggs in IVF. Frequently, some eggs are fertilized but are destroyed instead of being implanted. Since there's no implantation, hence no pregnancy, it cannot be called an abortion. Nonetheless, most pro-lifers oppose this aspect of IVF on the same basis that they oppose abortion; the claim that a fertilized egg must be accorded rights equivalent to that of a newborn. If multiple eggs do implant, doctors may sometimes perform a selective abortion to remove some of the embryos so that the others have an increased chance of making it to a healthy birth. Since this comes after implantation, it's entirely accurate to call it an abortion.</dd>
<dd>So whether it's officially a pregnancy doesn't affect their opposition, just whether they can call it an abortion. They might consider destroying excess fertilized eggs to be morally equivalent to abortion, but they'd simply be mistaken if they used the term "abortion" to refer to it. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 22:37, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've never heard of a case where pro-life people defined the destruction of IVF eggs as "abortion". The point of this section is that they consider it to be morally equivalent, not because they think that the petri dish or the woman is pregnant, but because they believe that the tiny embryo is a unique human being with a right to life. That's the whole point of this section, isn't it? To point out that that it would be wrong to have the article imply that they oppose abortifacient methods of contraception because they believe that the woman is pregnant when the embryo is in the fallopian tube. Some may believe that; some may not. They actually don't care where the embryo is, and they don't care what terminology doctors use to describe the state of having an embryo in the fallopian tube on the way to the womb: they just say, "don't kill it". <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 12:02, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well I agree that the point isn't that pro-lifers believe or disbelieve when pregnancy occurs but rather when life occurs. However, you keep calling emergency contraception an "abortifacient methodsof contraception." From the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortifacient.html" title="Abortifacient">abortifacient</a> wikipedia article:
<dl>
<dd><i>Emergency contraception (the "morning after pill"), such as Plan B or the Yuzpe regimen, is also considered an abortifacient by those who hold that pregnancy begins at conception, as it may prevent in some cases the implantation of an already fertilized egg. The same concern is sometimes even extended to regular birth control pills. Both American law and the medical community however make a firm distinction between contraception and abortifacients, and do not accept that emergency contraception is a form of abortion, nor do they accept that abortifacients are proper forms of contraception.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So at least <i>part</i> of the problem <i>is</i> definitional. We can't represent emergency contraception as an abortifacient because it isn't. Some people may see it as morally equivalent to abortion as they see them both as taking a human life, and that information <i>should</i> be included. However, it is factually incorrect to call something an abortifacient when it isn't terminating a pregnancy, but rather preventing one from beginning. &#160; ⇔ &#160; <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParallel_or_Together__1f4b.html" title="User:Parallel or Together?">| | ⊕ ⊥</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParallel_or_Together__26d2.html" title="User talk:Parallel or Together?">t</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parallel_or_Together__f6e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parallel or Together?">c</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Parallel_or_Together__2560.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Parallel or Together?">e</a>) 13:12, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In my opinion, there is still a difference in the definition of pregnancy involved. If pregnancy begins at the moment of fertilization of the egg in the body of the mother, then "emergency contraception" is abortion. If pregnancy begins at nidation of the egg, it is not. BUT: it seems misleading to the utmost to call "contraception" an action of which purpose is not to _avoid_ conception, but to interrupt the normal evolution of the already fertilised egg. This is a purely semantic concern - etymologically "contraception" is a means to avoid conception. Therefore, even "abortive contraception" is a misuse, tolerable only given that the adjective "abortive" makes sufficiently clear what it is ("abortive contraception" is not a contraception, just like false money is not money). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.220.226.16 (<a href="../../../2/1/3/User_talk%7E213.220.226.16.html" title="User talk:213.220.226.16">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.220.226.16_1c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.220.226.16">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Change of definition??</span></h2>
<p>In 1965, the American College of Ob/Gyns redefined pregnancy due to concerns of those doctors who were promoting IUDs and the pill. It was a political move - they realized the law and public opinion would not sanction ending life that already began, so they simply redefined the beginning of pregnancy. Here is a thoroughly footnoted resource that details the history (which, of course, the abortion supporters never discuss since they want to accuse those who prefer the former definition as making that definition up) signed by hundreds of physicians who support its factual contents. <a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:QjLp7jyw2DEJ:www.all.org/article.php%3Fid%3D10678+ACOG+Terminology+Bulletin,+Terms+Used+in+Reference+to+the+Fetus,+Chicago,+American+College+of+Obstetrics+ad+Gynecology,+No.+1,+September+1965&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:QjLp7jyw2DEJ:www.all.org/article.php%3Fid%3D10678+ACOG+Terminology+Bulletin,+Terms+Used+in+Reference+to+the+Fetus,+Chicago,+American+College+of+Obstetrics+ad+Gynecology,+No.+1,+September+1965&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.229.32.html" title="User:84.146.229.32">84.146.229.32</a></p>
<p>These statements (exceprted from the link above) support the idea that this re-definition in the 1960s was a manipulation for political, rather than scientific, reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>With biology such a stubborn thing, pill promoters turned to semantics for a solution. Swedish researcher Bent Boving, at a 1959 Planned Parenthood/Population Council symposium, noted that: "Whether eventual control of implantation can be reserved the social advantage of being considered to prevent conception rather than to destroy an established pregnancy could depend upon something so simple as a prudent habit of speech."</i> {Source for Boving quote: Bent Boving, "Implantation Mechanisms," in Mechanisms Concerned with Conception, ed. C. G. Hartman (New York: Pergamon Press, 1963), 386. Boving acknowledged (p. 321): "... the greatest pregnancy wastage, in fact, by far the highest death rate of the entire human life span, is during the week before and including the beginning of implantation, and the next greatest is in the week immediately following."}</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>The advice was not isolated. At the 1964 Population Council symposium, Dr. Samuel Wishik pointed out that acceptance or rejection of birth control would depend on whether it caused an early abortion. Dr. Tietze, of Planned Parenthood and the Population Council suggested, as a public relations ploy, "not to disturb those people for whom this is a question of major importance." Tietze added that theologians and jurists have always taken the prevailing biological and medical consensus of their times as factual, and that "if a medical consensus develops and is maintained that pregnancy, and therefore life, begins at implantation, eventually our brethren from the other faculties will listen."</i> {Source for quotes: Proceedings of the Second International Conference, Intra-Uterine Contraception, held October 2-3, 1964, New York City, ed.

<dd>I think we need to distinguish between two issues. First, was the definition of pregnancy in fact changed? Second, what was the reason for that change? Assuming for the sake of argument that the definition was explicitly changed as opposed to simply being clarified over time, there are still much more likely explanations that don't involve medical conspiracies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Consider in vitro fertilization (IVF), where the oocytes are fertilized in a petri dish, watched for a few days until they're at the eight-cell stage or at the blasocyst stage, and then the best candidates are transferred into the uterus to (hopefully) implant. Given this fine-grained level of control over the process, it's understandable that doctors might have to make more distinctions than they used to. Whereas "conception" might have applied to anything between fertilization and implantation, it's now used to refer specifically to implantation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This makes sense on a number of levels. For example, we don't need to speak of the petri dish as being pregnant. And pregnancy tests in fact check for implantation, not fertilization. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 19:07, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually its not very complicated. Pregnancy and gestation begin at the same time. Quite obviously, testubes can't be pregnant or gestate. When unnatural means are involved, the embryo can be created or moved outside of the womb. Once the embryo is placed in a womb, pregnancy and gestation begin. But the reality is that it is a documented fact that pregnancy was redefined and it was done with no medical basis. In fact, doctors date the beginning of pregnancy as the last day of a woman's last period. I am not sure why this is news to people. Apparently many of you really have never spent much time studying these matters. 84.146.242.45</p>

<p>KillerChihuahua is right. As a matter of practical fact, when pregnancy occurs in vivo, it's not something we can easily detect, so it's not something we can ask the woman about. We can, however, detect the end of a menstrual period, so it's a convenient bit of information we can use to calcuate the delivery date. This is a matter of simple pragmatism, with no bearing on when pregnancy starts. With IVF, we know the exact moment of fertilization (and can record it on video if we like), so there's no need to estimate based on menstruation.</p>
<p>As it happens, we <i>can</i> detect when implantation occurs, whether by IVF or the usual way, because it quickly leads to hormonal changes as the woman's body reacts to it. That is in fact how pregnancy tests work. What's interesting is that, with the popularity of rather sensitive pregnancy tests, women are now frequently detecting "chemical pregnancies", which are pregnancies that self-abort very early on. Previously, these would have gone undetected, except perhaps as "heavy periods", but now women are increasingly aware of just how common such brief, failed pregnancies are.</p>
<p>A related issue is that days pass between fertilization and implantation, and not all eggs that get fertilized ever implant. Again, women are more aware of this now because IVF forces us to recognize the distinction between the two events. After all, every failed attempt to get in-vitro fertilized eggs to implant is hugely expensive. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 22:51, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just to clarify, pregnancy does not occur when the embryo is placed in the uterus. If it occurs, which isn't nearly as often as many women would prefer, it does so within a few days, just as with a regular pregnancy. Just having an embryo in your uterus doesn't make you pregnant; it has to implant! <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 22:53, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Abstract: The purposes of this study are to assess the use of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' <b>(ACOG) definitions of conception (a synonym for implantation) and the beginning of pregnancy (at implantation)</b> in the clinical practice of its members and to explore the implications of differing definitions of conception and pregnancy onset for the process of informed consent. A survey was mailed to 112 members of the Louisville Ob/Gyn Society asking what definition of conception they used in their clinical practice and when they judged pregnancy began. A second mailing was sent to nonresponding members. Using logistic regression analysis, the responses to these questions were evaluated with respect to practice type, number of years in practice, and the ACOG membership. Responses were received from 86% (96 of 112) of the members. A total of 73% (70 of 96) (95% CI 69-77%) of the members indicated that conception was a synonym for fertilization, and 24% (23 of 96) (95% CI 21-28%) indicated that conception was a synonym for implantation (P &lt; .001). <b>Of the members, 50% (48 of 96) indicated that pregnancy began at fertilization</b>, and 48% (46 of 96) indicated that pregnancy began with implantation (NS). Regression analysis failed to demonstrate a significant relationship to type of practice, years in practice, or the ACOG membership for these responses. <b>Neither ACOG definition has been consistently adopted by its members whose definitions are more consistent with lay and embryologist definitions.</b> Potentially, the process of informed consent is jeopardized by these ambiguities. The ACOG is urged to reconsider its definitions. J. Matern. - Fetal Med. 7:264-268, 1998. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</li>

<p><b>In the actual article, the author notes that the ACOG created these new definitions in 1965 and 1972.</b> My edits are therefore undeniably factual, sourced from a peer reviewed medical journal, and this is not original research. My sense is that some of you will now try to move the goalposts. It is inevitable. I made an edit, gave sources, they were not good enough, so I provided undeniable proof of my factual information.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ABC Link</span></h2>
<p>Wikipedia has coined a term (<i>abortion breast cancer hypothesis</i>) that no one else uses. The article should use the terms that are most common and accurate. Many people talk about abortion and breast cancer. If you google the term <i>abortion breast cancer hypothesis</i>, you get 30 hits. If you google <i>Abortion breast cancer link</i> you get 27,000 hits. The way to fix this is to use the phrase "<i>abortion breast cancer link</i> hypothesis". It makes the point that the link is hypothetical, while avoiding a term that no one actually uses, and that was coined at wikipedia. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a></p>

<dd>Your position is that a wikipedia article must slavishly accept, as a standard term, one that exists only in another wikipedia article? I don't know how you would defend that idea. Patently bogus terminology invented by wikipedia editors who have obviously no clue about the common terms used when discussing the subject matter should be accepted by editors of other articles? My version not only linked to the correct article (that uses the bogus term), but also incorporated the actual term used by most people when discussing the topic, AND did not excise the notion that the whole concept is a hypothesis. Such is the kind of thing that you other editors who hate most of my posts so much should laud as a great attempt at compromise that respects the work of other editors AND eliminates an anomoly that ought not appear in a high quality article.

<p>I have no idea which term is more common outside of Wikipedia, but I agree with 136.. that the term most common should be used, and if another WP article uses another title, this article should be renamed.

<p>Originally I named it ABC debate, but then Tony Sidaway moved it to ABC hypothesis... as the link remains controversial and unaccepted by the medical community, to rename the article to ABC link might be presumptious. The popularity of the terms does not necessarily denote which is the most appropriate to use, merely which is most widely known/used. That term is used primarily by those who believe there is a link. The goal of the article is to explore the issue, not to assert a link. As such I think the name should remain as it is, with Link titles redirecting if necessary. I think it strikes a balance of accurately showing the status of the ABC issue, and not taking on pro-life verbiage. That could be a violation of WP:NPOV; as to the article title violating WP:NOR, meh, hypothesis is the status of the ABC link. It's an accurate reflection of reality. If there is consensus it should be changed I'd be happy to change it. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 04:51, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Therapeutic abortion</span></h2>
<p>The language describing birth defects unnecessarily and misleadingly narrows the types of birth defects or maladies for which therpeutic abortions are recommended. Morbidiity and fatality are sometimes associated with defects for which abortion is recommended as a "therapy" (odd - most therapies seek to improve the health of the person with the defect, but abortion simply kills the person and the defect at the same time). We need to change the language in the article. <a href="http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/upload/publications/251.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/upload/publications/251.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a></p>
<p>No 136, the passage defining "therapeutic abortions" was wrong to include "defects" of the fetus in the first place. Abortions for that reason are called "eugenic" or "embryopathic" -"therapy" means treating or healing a malady - aborting a "defect" fetus can hardly be described as healing this defect. Otherwise a gun shot is an 100% effective way of curing, say, malaria. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 17:01, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for fixing the error - I could not conceive of a true therapy (doesn't it literally mean that which heals?) that kills the one suffering from the malady. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a></p>

<p>I can't see how "eugenic" is POV, but if you don't like you can use "embryopathic" - anyway, my main point was that such an abortion should not be classified as "therapeutic", even if some try to include this. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 11:47, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It really depends upon which definitions one believes meet therapeutic qualifications. This varies from person to person, of course, so, in a sense, there's no "right answer" here. Explicity defining abortion in the case of fetal abnormalities as therapeutic, or excluding it as such, would both be POV. A little neutral prefacing could help resolve the issue:

<dd>I absolutely agree with Str1977. In no way can we call it "therapeutic" to abort a fetus because of defects. I can see how "eugenic" <i>could</i> be seen as POV, because the word has certain negative connotations. But I cannot see at all how <i>not</i> calling it "therapeutic" could be POV. Not calling it "therapeutic" is simply a question of avoiding inaccuracy. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 12:08, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also agree. Defects in the fetus do not threaten the mother's health. Therapy by definition HEALS. It is not therapy when we shoot a horse who breaks a leg. Likewise, it is not therapy when we abort the life of a deformed or diseased fetus. It is a quick and final solution to a problem, but therapy it is not.

<dd>There are congenital disorders which could threaten the woman's health, namely ones which would make vaginal delivery impossible, such as severe hydrocephaly or conjoined twinning. Many birth defects cannot be treated, much less cured, such as anencephaly. Even so, pregnancy itself involves health risks, so I suppose the question here is will those risks be balanced in the birth of a child with little to no chance of survival as they would in the birth of a healthy one? If the answer one gives is no, then abortion in the case of some congenital disorders could be considered therapeutic. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 01:24, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the wording of both Therapeutic abortion and the emegency conraception section are now excellent; they both provide accurate information on each.

And, though it may be the case that elective abortions (for which you have coined the neologism "non-therapeutic abortion") are more prevelant than therapeutic abortions, this is hardly part of the "definition" of abortion. &#160; ⇔ &#160; <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParallel_or_Together__1f4b.html" title="User:Parallel or Together?">| | ⊕ ⊥</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParallel_or_Together__26d2.html" title="User talk:Parallel or Together?">t</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parallel_or_Together__f6e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parallel or Together?">c</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Parallel_or_Together__2560.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Parallel or Together?">e</a>) 12:58, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thereapeutic abortions are a subset of elective. The article needs to make that clear.

<dd>Please do not create a section asking people to "weigh in" (meaning you want to gather consensus) and then continue to change it to your <i>proposed</i> version over the constant reverts of those who disagree. Let us discuss it first, and see if there is consensus. Given previous attempts that you have made, I don't think there will be, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't still try. To address your points above: therapeutic abortions are not a subset of elective abortions. That is a significant (i.e. 180 degree) change from the previous definition, which spelled out that an elective abortion is any abortion that is <i>not</i> a therapeutic abortion. And the article does mention that other people have a different definition of pregnancy... an issue which is still being discussed on this talk page it seems. &#160; ⇔ &#160; <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParallel_or_Together__1f4b.html" title="User:Parallel or Together?">| | ⊕ ⊥</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParallel_or_Together__26d2.html" title="User talk:Parallel or Together?">t</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parallel_or_Together__f6e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parallel or Together?">c</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Parallel_or_Together__2560.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Parallel or Together?">e</a>) 13:21, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>NIH (National Institutes for Health) is the source for the definitions of therapeutic and elective. NIH clearly explains that therapeutic is a subset of elective. Women CHOOSE to follow their doctors advice - they ELECT to do so. Did you go to the source to confirm it? What is your source for saying that therapeutic is NOT a subset of elective? <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a></p>
<p>My personal view is that common sense would have this article list elective abortion (giving the NIH definition) and therapeutic abortion (giving the NIH definition). Therapeutic abortions are, in fact, elective because medical decisions are personal choices (as one ardent abortion supporter pointed out in talk for this article earlier). In any event, NIH is an excellent source - and googling makes it clear that countless other mainstream respected medical websites use the NIH definitions. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a></p>

<dd>This is not an inherently simple issue. A larger percentage -- I believe it's the majority -- of fertilized eggs either never implant or quickly self-abort.

<dd>According to the EC article, no one has been able to scientifically prove that EC actually prevents implantation, so until that connection is actually proven, there is no way we can get a % for that.

<p>EC's prevent fertilization, usually preventing ovulation in the first place. It's not entirely clear whether they prevent implantation, and it's become fairly clear that they don't induce abortion. It's easy to measure the overall effectiveness of EC, but harder to break it down into the specific mechanism involved. As for undetected self-abortions, these can actually be detected with a pregnancy test, leading to the term "chemical pregnancy". <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 00:10, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I was wrong about chemical emergency contraceptives, as you say they usually delay ovulation or inhibit fertilisation. It seems the evidence on preventing implantation is mixed. It seems the WP article needs some clarification. IUDs do however prevent implantation of the embryo, making them a method of abortion to some.</dd>
<dd>On the point of chemical pregnancies - I've not seen any studies developing probabilities of such events occurring, and you would be hard-pressed to develop a good study design to make it work. |→ <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaully_efd5.html" title="User:Spaully">Spaully</a>°<a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpaully_5e32.html" title="User talk:Spaully"><i>τ</i></a> 00:25, 12 March 2006 (<a href="../../../g/m/t/GMT_24fe.html" title="GMT">GMT</a>)</dd>

<p><br />
Yes, IUD's are a different matter from purely hormonal methods. As for a study, the trick is that these early self-abortions are detectable if the woman gets frequent pregnancy tests, so I suppose a study could at least find the lower limit on the number of self-abortions.</p>
<p>What I've read makes it clear that most fertilized eggs don't ever become (noticed) pregnancies, either due to failure to implant or from self-aborting soon after implantation, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers, either, and I can see that figuring them out might not be easy. On a side note, one way I've seen this situation expressed is that, by the standards of treating all fertilized eggs as infants, every woman who has a live birth should hold a funeral. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 00:46, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Abortion Overview Definition</span></h2>
<p>Presently: "An abortion is the termination of a pregnancy associated with the death of an embryo or a fetus." The main problem I have with this is "death". That's the way anti-abortion ("pro-life") activists describe it (though they tend to prefer kill or murder). We don't call it the death of an egg when a woman has her period or the death of sperm when a man uses a condom (or a mouth or hand). Like the egg and sperm, the embryo/fetus is completely dependent on its host for "life". It's not a case where you can keep the embryo/fetus and dispose of the woman. A term like "disconnection", "removal", or "release" would be more accurate.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalliburton_Shill_8a32.html" title="User:Halliburton Shill">Halliburton Shill</a> 04:05, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hmm. I looked "abortion" up in my dictionary and got "the removal of an embryo or fetus from the uterus in order to end a pregnancy". The dictionary says removal, not death. Upon consideration, this makes sense, because it's the removal that aborts the pregnancy; the death of the removed tissue and organism is incidental. For that matter, an operation that kills the fetus but doesn't remove it is called an incomplete abortion. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 04:26, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>You might have waited a little longer. A discussion that starts on 12 March can hardly relect consensus when it's still 12 March and we simply have "Is this a good compromise?" "Yes." And I fail to see how Halliburton can claim that "removal" would be "more accurate" than "death". You could argue that removal is equally accurate, and you could argue that in your opinion it's preferable. But I can't see any way in which you could claim that it's somehow <i>less</i> accurate to talk about the death of the fetus. To make that claim, you'd have to say that the fetus <i>doesn't</i> die.</p>
<p>To Alienus's point that "an operation that kills the fetus but doesn't remove it is called an incomplete abortion", I'd add that an operation that removes the fetus but doesn't manage to kill it, as happened in the case of <a href="../../../g/i/a/Gianna_Jessen_d47c.html" title="Gianna Jessen">Gianna Jessen</a> and others, is called a failed abortion. So it seems that death <i>is</i> a necessary part of what an abortion actually is. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 18:29, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Uhm, the whole point here is that abortions are performed on a fetus (or embryo) that cannot sustain life on its own. Otherwise, we don't call it an abortion, or even a "failed" or "incomplete" one. We call it a c-section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given the controversy about abortion, the term "death" is highly ambiguous. If it's about the death of the various cells involved, then that's not under debate. However, it could also be taken to mean the death of a human being with full human rights; homocide. This interpretation is very much under debate, so we can't incidentally favor it in our definition. We have a definition now that is accurate but neutral. What do you suggest in its place? "Abortion is the murder of a teeny tiny baby, which makes Jesus cry"? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 18:36, 12 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>'Death' itself is not ambiguous. It is true that the _nature_ of what dies is disputed: whether the fetus is just an aggregate of cells, or a human being. But undisputably the death of the fetus, whatever it might be, is a necessary condition of an abortion; if the fetus survives, the atempted abortion has not succeeded. Therefore, I strongly object against removing "death" from the definition and consider it as a strongly biased attempt to conceal the facts. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.220.226.16 (<a href="../../../2/1/3/User_talk%7E213.220.226.16.html" title="User talk:213.220.226.16">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.220.226.16_1c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.220.226.16">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>'Death' is strictly correct, and as late term abortions are possible (even of a viable foetus) then I think this needs to be part of the definition. To not include death in the definition is too far, and is just mollycoddling the reader.</dd>
<dd>I feel that 'removal' and 'death' should both be part of the definition, perhaps:

<p>I wouldn't say my dictionary is mollycoddling anyone. There are 10 definitions for that word in my dictionary, and not one uses "death" or an equivalent.</p>
<p>Likewise, I don't think that concatenating all previous definitions leaves us with something that's an improvement. Abortions exist to end pregnancies, not to bring them to completion, so all this death talk is excessive. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 19:04, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Removal of "death" is POV pushing, as it tries to hide an unpleasant fact. We can disagree all day long about whether abortions are ethically permissable or should be legal or not but to hide this biological fact is unacceptable.</p>
<p>The addition "most commonly before it is capable of sustaining life" does not only bloat the intro, but it is also inaccurate. An abortion can be permoved up to the birth (see partial birth abortion) - many abortions are perfomed when the fetus is already viable, hence a restriction is misleading (even when saying "most commonly"), and adds nothings to the intro. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 19:21, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(after edit conflict with Str1977) Alienus, the fact is that it is <i>accurate</i> to say that the fetus dies. If your dictionary doesn't say it, then your dictionary is omitting something that is accurate. Besides which, Wikipedia is an encylopaedia, not a dictionary. If your dictionary fails to report a truth, that is no reason why Wikipedia should do so. Anyway, "before it is capable of sustaining life" is definitely not a satisfactory definition, because a baby at seven months, eight months, etc. <i>is</i> capable of sustaining life. (Or if you argue that it isn't, on the grounds of its helplessness, then you'd have to argue that for a a full-term, wanted child, born as a healthy infant.) Gianna Jessen was capable of sustaining life. So were other "failed abortions". And so were many of the babies in late-term successful abortions.

<dd>If your dictionary is inaccurate - and the "abortion = non-viablity" addition certainly is as inaccurate as it can get - we should not use it (that would be dictionary abuse). The "death" passage OTOH is a basic medical fact, a part of all abortions and the basis for all debates about abortion. Including it doesn't pick sides in the debate, doesn't decide the debate - leaving it out however does preclude any debate and hence takes a side. Hence it is POV. But, to be honest, I am not surprised about your reaction, Alienus. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 22:36, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This matter is covered in the thread "Termination of pregnancy sentance" in Archive 12. The introductory sentence is attempting to summarize all abortions in one line: spontaneous or induced, early or late term, and human or other species. If we are were to modify the sentence, I would go with "expulsion," as this sentence must also describe miscarriage. The word "removal" implies deliberate action and thus is only an accurate description of induced abortion. Death itself has many senses: astronomers often describe stars in the red giant stage as "dying." I don't see anything too bad in the use of "death," in a biological context, to describe abortion — the POV lays mostly in how it's read. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 22:46, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is, in fact, feasible. See below for two WebMD articles that are neutral, factual and yet avoid the d-word.

<dd>In which case I was aborted, not born. Which is why, precisely, I think that important distinction needs to be made between "expulsion" via birth and "expulsion" via abortion. "Death" does seem emotionally fraught, and it certainly lends itself to POV if interpreted a certain way, but the same could be said of softened phrasings. From a purely editorial perspective, I don't like "death" any more than Alienus or Halliburton, but at this moment I can't conceive of what a balanced, accurate alternative would constitute. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 23:37, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This seems a strange debate to me. If the unborn child (at any stage of development) is living in a biological sense, he or she potentially will leave the womb as a living boy or girl. If the unborn child is dead in a biological sense, it will either be expelled from womb as dead, or cause an infection in the mother. So the status of "dead" or "alive" with respect to the unborn child is always significant and neutral.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course. See how the debate moved from the unsupportable claim that mere using the term "death" is POV to the claim that it "lends itself to POV interpretation". But what does not lend itself? If you care, you can reference a standard medical definition of "death" so that everyone can check the intended meaning. I cannot understand why the fact that calling death what it is may disturb some of those who cause it should prevent the truth to be stated at Wikipedia. Please note: noone in this debate took in question the fact that death of the fetus is conceptually part of what abortion is. Noone attempted to insert the (allegedly) POV claim that it is a death of a human being into the definition. And yet one party continues to protest against using this term. What, if not this, is a POV attitude, I wonder? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.220.226.16 (<a href="../../../2/1/3/User_talk%7E213.220.226.16.html" title="User talk:213.220.226.16">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.220.226.16_1c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.220.226.16">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>The <i>intent</i> of an abortion is make a living unborn child a dead unborn child while the <i>methods</i> may differ. Of course, Preganancies also "end" or "terminate" in giving birth to living children (i.e. my mother's pregnancy naturally "terminated" with my birth), but because of the wide usage of the euphemism of "terminate" meaning to intentionally kill the unborn child, people need to be careful when they speak of a termination of a pregnancy in any sense other than abortion.</p>
<p>So, is the whole point of this discussion to calibrate how far certain euphemisms for killing the unborn have penetrated the medical vocabulary and popular culture? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 03:51, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Technically, the word <i>abortion</i> simply refers to pregnancy loss before the twentieth week.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most people think that a therapeutic abortion refers only to the kind of procedure sought out, for instance, by a couple who discovers they are carrying a defective fetus. This just isn’t so. A teenager who hasn’t the financial means to support a child or the support structures to take care of the child will also be a therapeutic abortion candidate. A woman who was impregnated during a rape will be a therapeutic abortion candidate. Finally, a woman who simply does not desire a child, for any combination of reasons, is also a candidate for a therapeutic abortion. The abortion is “therapeutic” because it enhances the quality of life for the mother and prevents the inevitability of a life of poverty, unreasonable struggle, or unreasonable trauma for both the mother and the unborn, unwanted fetus.</dd>

<p>The doctor who wrote it evidently has a strong POV to favor abortion as a good choice. That is why he uses euphemistic jabberwocky to discuss abortion. "Baby" is a medical term used by doctors to discuss the fetus (in latin: "little one"). Avoiding its use is simply an attempt to make his support for abortion more palatable (Imagine the impression the reader would have if he talked about the couple having a "defective unborn baby"!). "Termination" is most definintely a euphemism for "killing" or "death". Is this somehow not clear to you? How could it NOT be clear to you? Your paradigm is that abortion is a good choice. It may blind you to the fact that billions of people reject that view for objective reasons having nothing to do with religion. Yet those objective reasons are in accord with certain religious views, as well. Catholics believe water and light are good - in fact we use water and candles for liturgy and water and light and fire as sacred symbols. But science tells also us that water and light are good. And we can know that they are good from practical experience, without needing to rely on formal science. You cannot then claim that "water and light are good" is a religious view. Same with murder. With no religious view, one can conclude that murder is wrong and should be outlawed. It happens to comport with the ten commandments. But outlawing of murder is not simply a "religious view" that ought not be imposed on others. Same with abortion. There is much scientific, sociological and medical data - as well as practical experience - that there are many short and long term problems associated with abortion. Many academics in the fields of science, law and philosophy conclude that medically, legally, and philosophically life begins at conception. The fact that such infomation comports with the religious view that life begins at conception is interesting. But it is no basis whatsoever to claim that opposition to abortion is simply a religious view with no basis in objective rational thought. It is hard to hold that view considering people like Nat Henthoff, who is a flaming left-wing atheist columnist for the Village Voice yet an ardent absolutist prolifer regarding abortion and euthanasia, reject abortion:</p>

<p>I will say that for my part, I think death is more accurate. However, I also feel that both Str1977 and Haliburton Shill ... may not be acting in the wisest manner. The idea here is for all of us to work together to reach a mutually acceptable and accurate consensus--not to simply ignore the other side of the debate or ascribe bad faith.</p>
<p>Folks, I do feel that the death of the embryo or fetus needs to be addressed ... but perhaps it would be better to include a section later that addresses the different points of view.

<p>I could work with "expulsion," but then (technically speaking), a live birth fulfills the sentence "An abortion is the termination of a pregnancy associated with the expulsion of an embryo or a fetus." <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 23:09, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Justin is correct. Death is more accurate IMHO. The first sentence is clear and accurate. Expulsion would not be accurate, as it would cover live birth, premature birth, miscarriage, Etc. It would not cover ceasarian deliveries, and right now that's the only pregnancy ending I can think of it wouldn't cover. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 23:29, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>The use of fetus or embryo covers that. Maybe the problem is that fetus is carrying too much common-use baggage. How about compare Wikipedia's entry for <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">Miscarriage</a>.

<dd>(3 ec's) The essential difference between a late term abortion and a delivery, without which they cannot be distinguished, is that in one case you end up with a live infant, in the other case, you end up with dead cells. Any attempt to equivocate that is an exercise in euphemism. The argument that abortion doesn't involve death does a disservice to the pro-choice cause, IMO, by making it appear that pro-choicers need to use semantic sleight-of-hand to maintain their point. Sure, "death" is an emotionally fraught word.

<p>Hal and Alienus, I <i>know</i> you don't like the term "death" applied to abortion. If you want to know the honest truth, neither do I. But in my honest opinion, we cannot risk euphemism in this or any other WP article. Alienus, you said "However, in a context where medical professionals are routinely called baby-killers and murderers, the word takes on a whole different level of meaning, to the point where it should be avoided entirely if it's feasible to do." I quite agree--but I simply do not see that such avoidance is at all feasible. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 23:56, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Back up a second and think about what pregnancy is. The whole point of pregnancy is that an organism that has the potential to be a baby is being kept alive by the woman's body. This is not a permanent state, and it can only end in one of two ways: either the pregnancy can complete with the birth of a baby, or it can abort somewhere on the way.</p>
<p>The majority of fertilized eggs never make it to birth, and we have a variety of terms for the ways they can fail. Abortion is a very broad term that covers any "loss of pregnancy" (to use the WebMD phrase). In no way can loss of pregnancy be confused with successful pregnancy. The term clearly covers miscarriage, and just as clearly does not cover c-sections or birth.</p>
<p>Now, consider this definition:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Abortion</i> is the loss of a pregnancy, associated with the expulsion of the <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryo.html" title="Embryo">embryo</a> or <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetus</a> in such a way that does not result in a live birth.</dd>

<dd>It clearly excluded neonatal death; if the pregnancy completes, then that's that for the pregnancy, even if the newborn doesn't live long.

<p>Am I the only one who does not agree with this proposal? Using the word "death" is, indeed, slanted towards one POV. However, merely avoiding it already favors the other POV. I believe the current phrasing is quite thoughtful and offers an acceptable balance. Something like <i>Abortion is the loss of a pregnancy, associated with the expulsion of the embryo or fetus in such a way that does not result in a live birth</i> is not a solution to me since it slants the introduction <i>more</i> towards one of the prevailing POVs than the current version does. Stating this as a definition makes it appear as if it is generally accepted by virtually all people. This is not what NPOV is all about. Another option (probably discussed in depth before but I'm including it since it's my preferred solution in the spirit of Wikipedia policies): We could preface the article with <i>This article is written from the legal point of view in jurisdictions that allow elective abortion. For other viewpoints please see the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html#Abortion_debate" title="Abortion">Abortion debate section</a> or the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_debate.html" title="Abortion debate">abortion debate article</a>.</i> - or entirely remove the debate/social issues sections to the debate article. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 05:32, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not the only one, but pretty damned close. The reason for avoiding any mention of death is to avoid commiting to any POV. Do you have a better proposal? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 06:51, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But you never succeeded to prove that using "death" is POV. Now, by suggesting "not result in live birth" instead of "results in death", you made perfectly clear that your concern is not semantic - death and loss of life means the same, therefore, if "death" is POV, then "loss of life" is POV as well. The fact that you accept the later wordy circumscription but not the single word that means the same reveals that you simply _do not like the word_ "death", while not having any rational objections against its semantic import. IMHO, personal likings or dislikings should not count as relevant in Wikipedia. If your proposed definition is OK, then using "death" should also be OK, because it means the same. And it is to be preferred, because it is more succint. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.220.226.16 (<a href="../../../2/1/3/User_talk%7E213.220.226.16.html" title="User talk:213.220.226.16">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.220.226.16_1c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.220.226.16">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>I think that to say "does not result in a live birth" is simply a matter of semantics - to not be alive, means to be dead. What dies is a matter for debate elsewhere - be it a person with rights, a person without, a fetus - but it does not change the medical terminology. The embryo, and later the fetus, is a separate living organism apart from the mother, besides the fact that it relies on the mother for survival (so does an infant - yet if it "terminates" it is still called death). A blood cell exists in the body to fulfill bodily functions; it has no potential to survive outside of the body on its own. Likewise, sperm or eggs exist as separate organisms, but incomplete ones incapable of survival or development on their own. But even these, in the actual sense of the word "death," do die - and if you pick up a biology text and read it, you will see that spermatazoa that do not fertilize an egg <i>die,</i> and likewise an unfertilized egg dies. But beyond that, the embryo/fetus is, in the medical (not moral) sense of the word a human organism - therefore, when it is "terminated," like any other human organism, we use the term death to describe the event. It is NPOV, medical and biological terminology to describe the "termination" of any living organism - so why shy away from it? <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 05:39, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, I've had about enough. There will never be a proposal that makes everyone thrilled to tears. Some people will not rest until abortion is defined as either "the godless murder of babies by those who will soon rot in hell" or "a minor surgical procedure that we need not discuss the details of in any way".</p>
<p>Instead of trying to please everyone, which is impossible and undesirable, I take a weighted average, favoring the opinions of those who have shown the least bias and most reasonability (regardless of their personal views). Having done this, I sense a stronger consensus in favor of the compromise I proposed a while ago than for the current text, so I'm going to stick my neck out by putting this new text out in public view. This doesn't mean the issue is closed -- no issue is ever closed in this medium -- but it does mean that we have a new starting point.

<p>"Loss" implies that all induced abortions are successful. It is also more applicable to miscarriage than induced abortion, in my mind, as "loss" implies a lack of control or intent — it just happened. I think "termination" is a substitute which would be applicable to both miscarriage and induced abortion without necessarily precluding failed or incomplete inducings. Also, "expulsion of <i>the</i> embryo or fetus," does not account for abortion in the case of multiple pregnancy — that is why we used an indefinite article. Originally, the construction was something awkward, like, "the death of any or all fetus(es) or embryo(s)."</p>

<dd>While I agree the current version is satisfactory (would any POV accept "..with the death of all cells in an embryo or fetus"?), one could argue your definition with the case of an elective third-trimester breech abortion -- where the baby's body is delivered, and the head is still in the birth canal. Pro-lifers say it was a live birth and later murdered -- that the baby has been alive for months (regardless of which side of the mother's cervix he was on); pro-choicers say the baby was not fully born, hence it was not alive.

<dd>Actually, no.

<dd>The reason I used "loss", from the WebMD quote, is that it figures into the recognition that there are two ways to end a pregnancy. "Terminate" just means end, while "loss" specifies <i>which</i> of the two possible ends is involved. Consider that loss is the opposite of completion, while termination applies to either.</dd>
<dd>I'm not going to revert your change, but I wish you hadn't made it without talking about it here first.

<p>I do understand your frustration; there's a lot left to be done on this article before we can rest. As this incident has pointed out, it's a lot easier to focus people's attention on fine-tuning a key sentence than to get them to write a new section.

<p>Sorry, folks, but this alleged "consensus" (a word used too loosely these days) is in no way feasible.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Loss" may be just a bit uncommon compared to "termination", but the removal of "death" is POV pushing to the highest degree.</li>
<li>The death of the embryo or fetus is a medical, biological fact - how to view this fact in ethical and other terms is a different matter. If some feel their view threatened by an accurate coverage of medical facts they should reexamine their view in light of the facts and vice versa. Maybe we should omitt the fossil record from <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> to make that article more "NPOV".</li>
<li>Justin, I'd prefer to act differently too and I was not the one to bring "bad faith" into the play. And nowhere have I used "religious views" or "faith-based definitions" - the only one that makes religious allusions in Alienus - as strawmen. I am all for working together, but if someone tries to eleminate basic facts, should we negotiate about that?</li>

<dl>
<dd>In response to questions above: No, I do not have a better proposal than the two I gave above. My apologies if I was not clear. To reiterate and clarify:
<ol>
<li>I think in this case it would be better to describe the subject from an important well-documented POV instead of trying to create a "common text". I suggested the legal POV. Other viewpoints can be described separately - I suggested the Debate article since it does not require a lot of space to describe the other viewpoints. FWIW, this is not linked with my opinion on abortion. It is linked with my opinion on how to present information where it's impossible to find a "common text" definition, and the article is given to endlessly recurring problems due to strong POV feelings. Just think of the incredible waste of time, time that could have been spent editing. Please also note that I say <b>find</b>, not <b>create</b>. I think Wikipedia policies could have been observed a bit better. For one thing, if the current attempt at building a consensus is any indication, I would say the article depends too much on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Also, we do not need to reconcile parties or integrate viewpoints (impossible anyway in this case). We need to <b><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">describe</a></b> important viewpoints.</li>
<li>If and only if most editors feel that a "common text" is truly required here, my proposal is to leave the definition as it is now. I do not share <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a>' opinion that leaving out the word "death" equals leaving out any and all POVs. It is my considered opinion that "death" looks somewhat supportive of the pro-life POV in the eyes of those with a pro-abortion POV, while avoiding to call death "death" has an opposite effect that I think is even stronger.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I'm clearly not the only one who seems to support proposal #2. Also, people have not really had time to think about or respond to proposal #1. And I do not believe that <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a>' assessment of other editors' reasonability or commitment to NPOV should influence how much weight one has to give to their opinion. For one thing, I do not know him or the other editors here (with the exception of Justin - we met while struggling with <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">User:Jason Gastrich</a>). I cannot assess <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a>' ability to assess opinions, if you know what I mean. But it needn't be all that complicated. A simple straw poll in a day or two will be sufficient to gauge sentiments and, as always, I am quite willing to defer judgment to the majority (unless it's clear that policies are being violated).</dd>
<dd>Finally a note about the suggestion that this is just a minor problem not worthy of discussion where so much work is still waiting to be done. It is not a minor point at all - it's actually the main difference between the main POVs. Solving it will end the waste of time to a large extent. And if you truly believe it's a minor point, you may want to consider dropping it to make time for more important edits. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 10:36, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree 100% with Str1977. Removing "death", or trying to replace it by a euphemism is POV. It may not be a universally-acknowledged fact that the thing that dies is a <i>baby</i>, but there's no question that, whatever it may be, it <i>dies</i>. Despite the sarcasm and sneers of Alienus, I do not argue for the use of the words "baby", or "murder" in the article, and neither, as far as I can see, does anyone else on this page. To use those words would be POV, because there are people who argue that the fetus is a baby, and there are people who argue that it <i>isn't</i> a baby. There are people who argue that abortion is murder, and there are people who argue that it <i>isn't</i> murder. Therefore, we must all respect NPOV, and avoid presenting any of these POVs as a fact. I am not aware of anyone in the whole world who argues that the fetus does not die as a result of an abortion. (Or, if it doesn't, as in the cases of <a href="../../../g/i/a/Gianna_Jessen_d47c.html" title="Gianna Jessen">Gianna Jessen</a> and others, that the abortion went wrong — it was a <i>failed</i> abortion.) So, this is a fact, not open to dispute, and Wikipedia does not have a policy of removing "facts" on the grounds that they may produce an emotional reaction. We don't call Hitler evil (although he was) in the article because it's POV. It's subjective; some people don't think he was evil. However, we don't try to gloss over the fact that people <i>died</i> because of his policies, regardless of how reading such facts might make people "feel". So we don't call abortion "murder", but we do report that the fetus dies.</p>

<p>A couple of things:</p>
<p>1.)This seems to be getting mighty personal and petty - let's try to focus on the issue at hand. 2.)I wanted to clarify my statement above - I had a cut-off sentence there that might give a different understanding to what I was trying to say:</p>
<p><i>It is NPOV, medical and biological terminology to describe the "termination" of any living organism</i></p>
<p>should read</p>

<p>Just another thought to add to the pile on how we handle the abortion/death link: If a fetus dies in the womb, and the mother's body does not expel it, so she requires manual removal... how does our currrent wording reflect that? Is there one abortion (termination of pregnancy) or two (termination and removal) involved? The <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a> article refers to this scenario as a "missed" abortion (not an actual abortion?), sometimes requiring a standard abortion procedure (D&amp;C, though it isn't refered to as an abortion). Compare with the terms "complete abortion" and "incomplete abortion", which focus not on the time of termination/death of the fetus, but the actual expulsion of the fetus, regardless of the time, or cause, of death.<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 07:39, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Associated with" is rather ambiguous, describing the entire spectrum between "caused by" (e.g. spontaneous abortion after the fetus has died) and "in order to cause" (e.g. elective abortion). Your example falls somewhere in between (induced/surgical abortion after the fetus has died). But I think this level of ambiguity is just right for this subject.

<p>Comment: Because abortions are about ending the pregnancy, and, as cited above, don't always result in the fetus dieing (no stats provided, but I'm guessing a lot less often than smoking causes deformities and other birth defects), it seems anything to do with life or death should be removed and stick to something like "ending pregnancy via expulsion". It may be technically possible in the future, like with stem-cells and cloning, to both abort the pregnancy and re-implant the embryo/fetus in another woman that wants to reproduce.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 01:45, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It wouldn't be an abortion then. And there is such a thing as a premature birth that "ends a pregnancy", where the baby is kept in an incubator for several months. That's not an abortion.

<li>Not an abortion according to who? According to what verifiable citable source? I don't see one here. I see the "other side" providing medical sources that indicate an end to the pregnancy pre-viability. Assuming your reference accurate, even it agrees. The fetus needed extraordinary care and still both barely lived, and then has gone on with severe mental and physical handicaps.

<dd>There's also the practice of stopping the fetal heart from as early as the end of the second trimester (e.g. by injection into the heart or the umbilical) before the fetus is removed (<a href="http://www.womenscenter.com/second_trimester.html" class="external text" title="http://www.womenscenter.com/second_trimester.html" rel="nofollow">example</a>). It is called feticide (sometimes fetocide) in the medical lit. on abortion. This procedure prevents a fetus from feeling pain, should it be able to feel pain in the first place. It also thoroughly prevents a viable fetus (i.e. a baby) from surviving the abortion procedure. (Survival before the third trimester is rare, but it does happen from time to time.)

<p><a name="Uterine_2" id="Uterine_2"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Uterine 2</span></h2>
<p>Apparently, lawyers use the phrase "Uterine 2" as a short name for the <i>Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Intra-Uterine Contraception</i>, a 250-page synopsis of the 1964 conference, edited by S.J. Segal, A.L. Southam, and K.D. Shafer. The conference was funded by the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Population_Council_642a.html" title="Population Council">Population Council</a>, a non-profit organization founded by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_D._Rockefeller_III_fdd7.html" title="John D. Rockefeller III">John D. Rockefeller III</a>. According to my buddy in law school, Uterine 1 and Uterine 2 are known as where a lot of semantic decisions were made that have shaped the national abortion debate to this day. I have here with me a physical copy of Uterine 2, obtained via Inter-library loan from the local medical school.</p>
<p>Looking through the book, it appears to document a conference, taking place over two days in October 1964, in which studies were presented, and then discussions held after each round of presentations. The first round of presentations and discussions concerns "Clinical and Field Programs" and the second round (of two) concerns "Bio-Medical Studies". The quotation I was looking for comes from the second round of discussions. I quote at length:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Dr. Whishik</b>: Discussion of the exact point at which intra-uterine devices exercise their contraceptive effect is bound to involve some examination of terminology. This is not merely an academic question. In a Moslem country such as Pakistan, if it is considered that the intra-uterine device is an abortifacient, this obviously would have a bearing on national acceptance or rejection of the method. I think, therefore, that careful attention should be given to a definition of terms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not think it is necessary for us to change the traditional definition of conception as being the point of fertilization, but the definition of abortion seems to be one that needs to be considered. Abortion, as the prefix indicates, means that something is taken away, and the taking away of an embryo which has successfully implanted itelf would seem to be abortion. This has basis in the fact that we know in human beings a certain percentage of fertilized ova seem to be extruded through the uterus without there being any obvious pathology. Some of them implant and some of them do not, and we do not consider that an abortion has occurred because the fertilized ovum fails to rest in the uterus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Dr. Tietze</b>: Yesterday I had opportunity to report on 142 intra-uterine and seven ectopic pregnancies with the device <i>in situ</i>. We therefore know very well that some ova are fertilized in the preseence of the coil. But until we have more evidence that this is a usual event we should be very careful in stating that this is a mode of action of the intra-uterine device, and not disturb those people for whom this is a question of major importance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Dr. Mastroianni</b>: The philosophical question as to whether or not the ova are fertilized among patients wearing the intra-uterine device has certainly been stressed. I think this is worthy of just two comments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At the conference today we have seen one human fertilized ovum. This was fertilized. However, there is no way of knowing what would have happened to this ovum if it had been allowed to reside in the fallopian tube and had eventually been transferred into the uterus. We do know that among patients wearing the contraceptive device, both ectopic and intra-uterine pregnancies, which incidentally go to term, are entirely within the realm of possibility. So that we can't really extrapolate from the fact that we have recovered one fertiliized ovum in a fallopian tube and extend that to the point where we must assume that the ova in general are fertilized among people wearing the intra-uterine device.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Among the monkeys studied in our laboratory there is one point which I did not stress because at the time I did not think it was terribly relevant. Obviously, in the monkey the only way to know whether the ova are fertilized is to recover them. We can't find them. However, among the group of monkeys in which the fallopian tube was ligated on one side, we did recover ova. All but one of those ova were still in cumulus; they were not yet denuded down to the level of the corona.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the other side no ova were recovered whatsoever. In this group of monkeys a laparotomy was performed at such time as we would expect to see ova, if they were available in the fallopian tube for fertilization. I think that in general when the ova are still in cumulus, fertilization may not quite yet be possible. Certainly fertilization is possible once the cumulus cells are dispersed and the corona radiata remain. So that whatever little evidence we have in the primate would suggest that the ova are extruded from the fallopian tube prior to fertilization.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Chairman Taylor</b>: It has been suggested that we ought to set our definition that pregnancies start at implantation. I think it ought to occur to us that we are talking about a theological definition, not a biological one, and this group can't possibly help in making this definition.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Dr. Tietze</b>: I would like to take issue with the chair on what I hope has not been a definitive theory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I fully agree with you sir, that the time at which a human life or any life begins is a philosophical question, but I submit that throughout history the theologians and the jurists have always taken into account and have listened to the prevailing medical and biological consensus of the times, and I think this is still true. If a medical consensus develops and is maintained that pergnancy, and therefore, life, begins at implantation, eventually our brethren from the other faculties will listen.</dd>
</dl>
<p>...and that's the end of the discussion, end of the conference. The text I've just quoted comes from pages 212 and 213 of the <i>Proceedings</i>. Looking beyond that point in the book, I see a Summation given by Alan F. Guttmacher, M.D. There's a relevant two paragraphs in there:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Before I conclude I should like to remind you that we are not the only group to think about the difference between the prevention of conception and the production of an abortion. It was called to my attention that the British Council of Churches, in their pamphlet on human reproduction which was issued in 1962, made a statement that may give a degree of solace to those of us who are concerned about the theological attitudes. They said: "Our conclusion was that a distinction must be drawn between biological life and human life, and that in the absence of more precise knowledge, nidation may most conveniently be assumed to the the point at which the former becomes the latter. We agreed that abortion as a means of family limitation is to be condemned. But a woman cannot abort until the fertilized egg cell has nidated and thus becomes attached to her body... we see no objection... to the use of a technique which would prevent implantation. Such a method, which might be described as contra-nidation, could also quite properly be called contraception."*</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Obviously there are some eminent theologians on our side even if it is proved that fertilization is not prevented by the IUCD. I share Dr. Mastrioanni's hope - perhaps his belief - that the IUCD prevent fertilization, but even if that should not be the case, if fertilization is achieved, it doesn't necessarily mean that the whole battle is lost and that we are producing abortion.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The footnote refers to <i>Human Reproduction: a study of some emergent problems and question in the light of the Christian faith</i>, 44-45. British Council of Churches, London, 1962.</p>
<p>So, that's the source supporting the claim that the definition of abortion was manipulated for non-medical reasons in the 1960s. Opinions?

<dd>GTBacchus, at first blush this looks like two separate topics in one discussion:

<li>The definition of pregnancy.</li>
</ol>

<dl>
<dd>For a recap, this is the quote 84 brought up originally:
<dl>
<dd>The advice was not isolated. At the 1964 Population Council symposium, Dr. Samuel Wishik pointed out that acceptance or rejection of birth control would depend on whether it caused an early abortion. Dr. Tietze, of Planned Parenthood and the Population Council suggested, as a public relations ploy, "not to disturb those people for whom this is a question of major importance." Tietze added that theologians and jurists have always taken the prevailing biological and medical consensus of their times as factual, and that "if a medical consensus develops and is maintained that pregnancy, and therefore life, begins at implantation, eventually our brethren from the other faculties will listen." {Source for quotes: Proceedings of the Second International Conference, Intra-Uterine Contraception, held October 2-3, 1964, New York City, ed. Sheldon Segal, et al.., International Series, Excerpta Medica Foundation, No. 86, page 212.}</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And this is 84's proposed change: <i>Since 1965 <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> has been defined by the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">medical community</a> as beginning at the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Implantation.html" title="Implantation">implantation</a> of the <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryo.html" title="Embryo">embryo</a>. Some people prefer the former medical definition, which defines pregnancy as beginning at <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertilisation.html" title="Fertilisation">conception</a>.</i> After reading the original source, is 84's proposed contribution appropriate for this article? --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 05:22, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Hi, Andrew. I'd prefer some documentation that conception was actually regarded as the "beginning of pregnancy" before 1964 before considering such a question. 84's source for his quote is wildly POV, and (as I noted before), there have been people on both sides of the abortion debate who have not hesitated to stoop to dishonesty. (That's not an accusation of anyone, least of all the contributors here--simply a strong desire to verify everything.) <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 05:32, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree - we would still need a source verifying that, before Uterine 2, the medical consensus was that pregnancy, "and therefore life" (whoa), began at conception. The evidence that we have now suggests almost nothing in that direction, except perhaps that some portion of the medical community hadn't considered that definition to even be a medical issue. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 05:42, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First off, thank you GT for tracking down that source and sharing it with us. Secondly, I know I didn't post my take on this issue, instead only recapping 84's position. I don't know if I can objectively help out on this issue, because of my POV. The way I see it, it makes 100% medical sense to me that an embryo must implant before pregnancy begins. Test tubes, even if they contain a fertilized egg, do not become pregnant. Fertilized eggs fail to implant very commonly, and these are not considered abortions or miscarriages. If the definition changed in the 60s, it is because the knowledge of these scenarios came up. I think 84s wording is misleading, but maybe I do not fully understand the history behind the definition change.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 06:31, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have just added the section I omitted earlier - it's Dr. Mastroianni's bit about the monkeys. I don't know whether his English was a bit stilted, or whether the person transcribing made some mistakes - I think my typing has been accurate.</p>
<p>Also, this is something to note: Uterine 2 is a primary source. Wikipedia is really supposed to be a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>. It would be good to have a secondary source actually indicating that Uterine 2 was an influential event that affected subsequent medical vocabulary. I think it certainly <i>was</i> influential, but Uterine 2 can't say that about itself. Next time I talk to my law school buddy, I'm going to ask him where he read about Uterine 2, and where one might find a good gloss on the conference and its consequences. Maybe someone else will turn up something else in the meanwhile. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 17:06, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed. I believe it is also imperative to determine the pre-1964 definition of pregnancy. From the above quote, I can't determine if they were changing a definition that had already been agreed upon by the medical community, or clarifying an issue that had never been completely looked at. Dr. Tietse's comment is ambiguous, but Dr. Guttmacher's comments seem to indicate that the Church of England considered pregnancy to begin at implantation in 1962--but the CoE is composed of theologians. What does the medical community say pre-1964? <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 03:35, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you should ask Dr. Tietze that. He's the one who said, above "pregnancy, and therefore life, begins at implantation". As for your multiple choice question, I find the idea that a fetus at any arbitrary stage of development can always be categorized as "living", "dead" or "inert"... extremely problematic.

<dd>Fair enough. I've removed the POV tag from the top of the article; let's try just tagging sections, as necessary. That'll be more constructive anyway, I expect.

<dd>I never agreed to the use of NPOV section tags.

<dd>You'll also note, from Archive 16, that I expressed desire for a pro-choice picture long before you: "A balancing image of pro-choice demonstaters would be nice; however, I am unable to unearth one." We must contend with the issue of copyright; we cannot simply pluck some random picture from the bowels of Google:Image Search in the hopes of quickly resolving what has been a non-issue up until this point.</dd>

<p>NPOV tag doesn't belong to the section. The wording is pervectly npov and NPOV tag is not intended to highlight "problem". You may not like fox-like wording but it is considered npov.

<dd>The undue weight section of NPOV has nothing to do with the public opinion section of this article. To begin with, pro-choice versus pro-life isn't some kind of factual dispute like a round earth versus a flat earth or evolution versus intelligent design versus creationism versus whatever. In addition, the section simply reports the beliefs of people within the shades of gray that make up the abortion question, rather than presenting some kind of dissertation on the views themselves. &#160; ⇔ &#160; <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParallel_or_Together__1f4b.html" title="User:Parallel or Together?">| | ⊕ ⊥</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParallel_or_Together__26d2.html" title="User talk:Parallel or Together?">t</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parallel_or_Together__f6e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parallel or Together?">c</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Parallel_or_Together__2560.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Parallel or Together?">e</a>) 08:32, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Consider the stats from the US poll: <i>33% said that it should be "permitted only in cases such as rape, incest or to save the woman's life," 17% said that it should "only be permitted to save the woman's life," and 5% said that it should "never" be permitted.</i> Basically, 55 percent of people oppose abortion in most circumstances (ie, the "unwanted pregnancy" - rape/incest account for &lt;1% of abortions, and life-saving abortions are rare - I can't call to mind any stats right now), and therefore fall into some portion of the anti-abortion movement. What makes this a minority view? Even in more liberal countries (Canada for instance) we see that 14% of the popn oppose abortion in all cases. Although this is a minority in the statistical sense, it is not a "fringe" view; so it can be stated briefly(which it is).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But aside from that, I think you are missing the point of the WP:NPOV - Undue weight policy. The point of that is to insure FACTS are presented as held by the majority of the population. A debate is a viewpoint BASED upon facts and philosophies of the debating parties - implying that neither is necessarily right, even if the facts they use are, or one is in the majority. (the article cannot say the fetus has/does not have a soul, for instance - it simply cannot be quantified, proven or non-proven - but it is a POV for some Pro-Lifers that it does, and a POV for some Pro-Choicers that it does not. The majority view of the Pro Choicers does not make it a fact). The importance here is that the section explains the debate itself - and neither side tries to say "You aren't actually debating that!" That is to say, if you went to a Pro-Choice person, and said "is this what most pro life persons believe: that the fetus has personhood and rights?" they would agree with that statement. <b>Therefore, no one is disputing the facts of the debate itself, so the presentation of the debate IN ITS ENTIRETY IS STILL NPOV.</b> What WP:NPOV policy would try to prevent is the article blatantly stating the fetus was a person with rights as the truth. The section certainly does not give an extremely detailed description of the pro-life philosopy - that would take a book, I kid you not - and definitely does not present it as the truth, so what's the beef?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In addition to all the above, the fact that various countries still prohibit abortion, and that challenges are being presented in notable courts in the US right now, gives weight to presenting the argument of both sides for the sake of those trying to understand <i>why</i> it is illegal/challenged to this day in some areas.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 20:02, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What is the basis to claim in the article that abortion is generally done by ob/gyns?</span></h2>
<p>Is there a source for this change? Do third world nations have ob/gyns? Are the 20 million illegal abortions done each year done by ob/gyns? Do general practitioners actually do most abortions? Or is it actually a nurse? Please cite the source for the claim that it is generally ob/gyns who do abortions. I think the article is not speaking globally. In any event, there is no source for such a claim. "Abortionist" is in fact a catch-all term that encompasses anyone who does an abortion. It is also used by mainstream media that support abortion, so it cannot be said to be a term used only by anti-abortionists:</p>

<p>"Abortionists" in the context of the debate has a negative connotation. It is similar to "Darwinists". While some advocates of evolution may use the term themselves, generally speaking, it is viewed negatively as a way to differentiate evolutionary biologists from 'real' scientists'. Similarly, abortionists is normally used as a slur against doctors, by the pro-life camp. That said, the current wording was only added as recent as March 1st. Before, the whole sentence about OB/GYN was missing. Maybe it could be clarified that in the 1st world countries where abortion is legal, OB/GYNs generally are the ones who perform the procedure--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 19:38, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Loss" is vague and can be inaccurate. Quite often, the embryo or fetus is not <i>lost</i> at all. For example, during the extremely common D&amp;C abortion the fetus is deliberately dismembered with surgical instruments while in utero {<b>caution - graphic medical image</b>: <a href="http://www.rtl.org/html/Abortion/images/11week.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rtl.org/html/Abortion/images/11week.jpg" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>}, and then immediately thereafter reassembled outside of the womb on a surgical tray to ensure there is no loss of body parts to ensure no parts are left inside the mother. "Loss" is not the best term. <b>"Death"</b> works, as it is always accurate, without exception; it is not ambiguous; and it encompasses natural as well as induced death. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.221.240.html" title="User:84.146.221.240">84.146.221.240</a></dd>

<p>We had discussed the use of the word "death" some months ago, and had reached a consensus to use it. I don't think anyone seriously thinks that the fetus doesn't die, so removing "death" is not making the article more accurate; it's deliberately withholding an extremely relevant fact that some people aren't comfortable with. It is therefore a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</p>

<dd>There is NO dispute as to whether or not death of the conceptus is ALWAYS part of the abortion process (induced or spontaneous). If there is no death and the conceptus remains alive, then we have what is medically classified as a birth or a failed abortion. Using an ambiguous term to paper over this medical fact is an attempt to have the article comport with the POV of people who want this article to tiptoe around the reality of what abortion is.<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.236.167.html" title="User:84.146.236.167">84.146.236.167</a></dd>

<dd>Actually, there is significant, noteworthy, and thoroughly documented dispute as to whether an unborn fetus is "alive", and as to whether the word "death" can properly be applied to what happens to a fetus being aborted. I think it's safe to say that we're all aware of this dispute, and papering over the fact that this particular bit of semantics plays a central role in the controversy surrounding abortion would be irresponsible.

<dd>You are confusing issues. The moral status of what dies (the conceptus) is obviously up for grabs. But whether the conceptus is living (as all organisms are) prior to any abortion and dies as a result of the abortion is NOT at issue since it is a biological fact. Not sure why you dispute the biology. Since everyone seems so intent that the scientific facts are paramount, then the article ought not paper over the FACT that biological life of the conceptus (regardless of any moral status it may or may not have) is deliberately ended as a result of every abortion (induced or spontaneous). <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.213.216.html" title="User:84.146.213.216">84.146.213.216</a></dd>

<dd>Huh. I haven't said anything to indicate that <i>I</i> dispute that a fetus is alive. (Nor that I'm "intent that the scientific facts are paramount".) Second guesses aside, you seem to think that nobody disputes that an unborn fetus is biologically alive; I disagree and say that lots of people dispute that "FACT". Rather than simply disagreeing with you though, I'll go get sources. Watch this space. Oh, and the life of the conceptus is not <i>deliberately</i> ended in the case of a spontaneous abortion, as your last sentence indicates, but I'm happy to assume that was a typo of sorts. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 01:08, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, "deliberately" is only correct for induced abortion. A reliable doctor who disagrees based on biological fact? There is a moral issue as to whether a "human life" with cognition or rights exists. There is no biological issue, however, as to whether the biological entity known as the embryo or fetus is a living biological entity. I have thousands of skin cells that are living, biologically. When they scrape off, they die. These are biological facts. There is no magic that makes an embryo any less living or dead. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.248.62.html" title="User:84.146.248.62">84.146.248.62</a></dd>

<ul>
<li>medically speaking there is no abortion unless there is a pregnancy</li>
<li>a pregnancy begins when a living embryo implants</li>
<li>a pregnancy can only end by live birth or abortion (natural or induced)</li>
<li>there is no pregnancy if there is no living conceptus in the mother</li>
<li>abortion includes any ending of pregnancy (natural or induced) that is not due to live birth</li>
<li>the key difference between the two general categories of how pregnancies end (live birth or abortion) is the life or death of the conceptus</li>
<li>all forms of abortion are associated with the biological death of the organism known as the embryo or fetus</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Any suppression of the word "death" is simply due to a desire to tiptoe around an issue that is painful to many. But this article is about facts, not making everyone comfortable. To discuss the biological medical fact of the embryo's biological death is different than referring to abortionists in an editorial fashion as "baby killers". I agree with Patsw, and also ask for a source that confirms that the embryo or fetus does not always die as part of the process of an induced or spontaneous abortion (in fact, you won't find any). <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.221.240.html" title="User:84.146.221.240">84.146.221.240</a></dd>

<p>Please explain the basis for totally excluding mention of this MEDICAL definiton in the article. It is sourced from a neutral manistream medical publication. The current article reads as though such a view is both unscientific and marginal. In fact, this definition of pregnancy is both scientific and widely held, even among medical professionals, according to peer reviewed research. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Abortion#Research_demonstrating_that_large_percentages_of_Ob.2FGyns_reject_the_ACOG_redefinition" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Abortion#Research_demonstrating_that_large_percentages_of_Ob.2FGyns_reject_the_ACOG_redefinition" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. This definition makes it clear that there is no pregnancy unless the embryo (regardless of stage of development or implantation) is living and developing inside a woman's body. Just thought I would head off the typical "test tubes can't be pregnant" dismissive snipe. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.221.240.html" title="User:84.146.221.240">84.146.221.240</a></p>

<p>We really can't use Wikipedia as a source. In <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">Miscarriage</a>, the phrasing "where the embryo or the fetus is incapable of surviving" manages to dodge most of the POV pitfalls, though, or so it seems to me. Maybe we can borrow those words (it's GFDL, after all!). -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 03:37, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your suggested wording is not accurate. Abortionists are on record that abortions are performed on fetuses that are alive and viable. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.248.62.html" title="User:84.146.248.62">84.146.248.62</a></p>
<p>You are debating semantics. "Death" is a noun-form of the verb "die". Terminating a pregnancy means cells will be deprived of nutrients and therefore <i>die</i>. It is not a POV - it is biological fact. After all, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polar_body.html" title="Polar body">polar bodies</a> effectively <i>die</i> during <a href="../../../o/o/g/Oogenesis.html" title="Oogenesis">oogenesis</a> because of lack of <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organelle.html" title="Organelle">organelles</a>, and this death is necessary for <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meiosis.html" title="Meiosis">meiosis</a> to complete, thereby bringing a viable egg into the fore, ready to be fertilised. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 07:41, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not debating semantics, nor was there any intent to. I agree with you for the most part, except that in general usage, death is also used for "death penalty" and "death sentence". It imposes <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilt_by_association.html" title="Guilt by association">guilt by association</a>, as opposed to innocence. Consider this definition from Amrose Bierce's Devil's Dictionary, "BRANDY, n. A cordial composed of one part thunder-and-lightning, one part remorse, two parts bloody murder, one part death-hell-and-the-grave and four parts clarified Satan."--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 08:30, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, but I find the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilt_by_association.html" title="Guilt by association">guilt by association</a> argument to be very thin and unpersuasive. Of course the word "death" occurs in some negatively-associated phrases (including "death-hell-and-the-grave", for which thanks!), but lots of words occur in negatively-associated phrases; we don't stop using them. When I read the word "death" in a clinical statement about abortion, I don't think of electric chairs and frowning judges. I find "death" to be a pretty neutral word, like "chair", or "Beligium", and I expect to see it used clinically, accurately and unsqueamishly in a work like an encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>"Death" has plenty of neutral and positive associations, too, y'know. Are you familiar with the French term <i>petit mort</i>? Have you heard the band <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Cab_for_Cutie_e602.html" title="Death Cab for Cutie">Death Cab for Cutie</a>?

   * Life is defined by existence of genetic material, hence in sperm. 
   (hence, almost 100 million lives are lost everytime a man ejaculates)
   * Life starts as soon as the egg is fertilized.
   * Life starts when the embryo can feel pain.
   * Life starts when the brain and brain waves are operable.
</pre>
<p>I justified this edit for the following reason:</p>
<p>"Actually, part of the abortion debate IS when the fetus is considered living. The reason this is part of the debate is because nobody has qualms about "killing" a non-living thing (unless it has sentimental value somehow), but if it is living, then it crosses into one's moral boundaries about the idea of taking life. This portion of the debate is actually a precursor to many of the debates about conditions regarding whether it is moral to abort a fetus.</p>
<p>To further the point of why this is a debate, living mammals are typically composed of multiple cells. Is a human cell by itself living? If a human cell is not living, would you have any qualms about killing it? If it is, then would you have qualms about killing any part of the matter that exists in a cell? (which is scientifically known to be non-living on it's own)"</p>
<p>My authority on this is self-justified for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing with various debates in a Morality and Justice course, INCLUDING the one I'm proposing here.</li>
<li>Strong background in Ethics, covered by classes in Morality and Justice, Ethical Theory, and Business Ethics (which I'm currently taking).</li>

<li>I agree with the change. There are all sorts of things that can be referred to as living, and thus die. Death is far to imprecise for that reason.

<dd>Technically, every time you eat, cells lining your cheek die. Every time you scratch an <a href="../../../i/t/c/Itch.html" title="Itch">itch</a>, skin cells die. Anytime a man ejaculates, millions of little cells that are alive die. Funny, the <a href="../../../e/j/a/Ejaculation.html" title="Ejaculation">ejaculation</a> article doesn't say "resulting in the death of sperm" as part of the definition. It is entirely acurate, and scientific, to describe ejaculation in the manner. However, is it appropriate for the first sentence definition for a wikipedia article? What about <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating.html" title="Eating">eating</a>, that "results in the death of plant and animal life" in addition to cheek cells. Is that clause included in that article? Why is it so important to have the word "death" in the first sentence? Note, I'm not disputing whether cells die or not.

<dd>Per Andrew c.

<dd>Because deaths of sperm cells and cheek cells aren't central to a long standing ongoing debate (although you could make a case for sperm cells... a certain Monty Python skit comes to mind :"). Its accurate to state cells die, but it is <b>not pertinent</b>. Here, it is important to note the consequence of an abortion. Pro-Lick, I don't understand your point about conceding "abortion should refer to everything that "dies" as a result of <i>losing</i> its source of life." Could you expand and rephrase please, thanks.

<p><b>The examples given are absurd.</b> I don't know of anyone who itches for the <i>intention</i> of killing the skin cells. If I thought the matter of the death of sperm to be as signficant as the the matter of the death of unborn children, I might be editing that article. Voluntary human action in an abortion such as when a curette is used to dismember the unborn child or fetus <i>intends</i> death, <i>causes</i> death, and <i>results</i> in death.</p>
<p><b>Cells are cells</b> is an unworthy as a talking point. The specific cells we are discussing is/are potential unique human beings. We all existed in the form of this collection of cells whatever technical name one assigns to the cells composing a unique member of our species at an early stage of development.</p>
<pre>
* A unique human life begins at conception, at the union of a human sperm and a human egg.
* An already living human in an early stage of development, with its cells already dividing, implants into the uterine wall.
* This is the <i>continuation</i> of an already existing life.
* This unique human individual will emerge from the womb either living or dead
</pre>
<p>These are biological facts. I'm not making the point that it is <i>important</i> to include a reference to abortion as being the death of a fetus (and not a post-1973 euphemism like <i>termination</i> or <i>loss</i>), but because it only <i>honest</i> to do so. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 04:54, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have said the reason why you are editing this article is because it is "the matter of death of unborn children". This is your POV about the procedure and has no reason to be in the definition. I am not trying to supress your point of veiw. It has it's place under the debate section (and even a reference in the opening paragraph). However, your POV should not define the term. And it's funny you say "post-1973 euphemism". Try the 1911-1913 euphemisms of "expulsion" and "before it is capable of sustaining life". Do you find the opening paragraph of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">Miscarriage</a> to be problematic? I understand completely (because you just explained it) why its important to you that you define the fetus in these terms and point out that abortion results in <b>death</b>. However, the significance of your points is in question. Is abortion defined by your POV to the extent it should be included in the first sentence? I say no.

<dd>Good point about the miscarriage definition. It does serve as a meaningful point of reference. "termination of a pregnancy" is better than "ends a pregnancy"; but I think we had termination on the table before and it didn't pass muster for some reason. I cannot remember. My knee jerk reaction would be "death" is not necessarily accurate for miscarriage since the embryo is usually non-viable from the beginning. Certainly that is also a point here (as its possible one could induce abort a non-viable embryo), but I think we can agree the intent of an induced abortion is to stop a viable pregnancy. (whereas the intent of eating food, is to acquire nutrition, not kill the fruit/roots etc.) - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 05:52, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just convinced myself you are right. As indeed abortion (including miscarriage) broadly speaking does not carry intent; but induced abortion does. The problem here is semantics, the correct broad definition of abortion, and the definition of abortion in common usage which is induced abortion. Hmmmmm... yeah I think we settled on common usage as the definition, since <a href="../../../i/n/d/Induced_abortion.html" title="Induced abortion">induced abortion</a> redirects to abortion. We went through this before, but another round is doable. You have to convince us the broad definition should be employed in the lead (miscarriage/induced abortion), rather than its common meaning (induced abortion). - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 06:03, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the current edit now (and the one that has been there for months) starts off with "termination of a pregnancy". You also bring up a good point about viability in regards to miscarriage and induced abortion, however I believe most editors wanted the first sentence definition to be able to encompass both, because technical, an abortion does cover both, although the popular use of abortion refers specifically to the latter (see the last sentence of the first paragraph on <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a>. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 06:05, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is a copy of something Kyd wrote further up:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>This matter is covered in the thread "Termination of pregnancy sentance" in Archive 12. The introductory sentence is attempting to summarize all abortions in one line: spontaneous or induced, early or late term, and human or other species. If we are were to modify the sentence, I would go with "expulsion," as this sentence must also describe miscarriage. The word "removal" implies deliberate action and thus is only an accurate description of induced abortion. Death itself has many senses: astronomers often describe stars in the red giant stage as "dying." I don't see anything too bad in the use of "death," in a biological context, to describe abortion — the POV lays mostly in how it's read.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The reason I mention this is because this is where I got the idea that the definition is supposed to encompass both induced and miscarriage. Let me think this over a bit. Is there any way death could be changed to dying?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 06:14, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Biologically, is there any dispute that a developing conceptus is biologically living prior to any type of abortion, and that is in fact biological death is ALWAYS associated with an abortion of any kind (spontaneous or induced)? Again, moral human life is another topic. I am talking about biological fetal/embryonic life and death? Its not really at issue at all except for those who turly wish to hide this biological fact. Certainly most people in general conversation and most doctors even discuss miscarriage in terms of death and life. Elsewhere the article should (and I think does) clearly state that some people think its a moral human life and some don't (on the very odd chance that anyone might not realize there are divergent views). <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.248.62.html" title="User:84.146.248.62">84.146.248.62</a>

<dd>I am going to let this drop because there are much more important issues in this article (that Kyd has so kindly listed above). I just wanted to clarify my concern for anyone who missed my point. I was never arguing that cellular tissue didn't died as a result of abortion. I was just saying mentioning this fact in the very definition bring prominence to a POV issue. My analogy was that of <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating.html" title="Eating">eating</a>. Eating results in the death of plant and animal tissue, however that fact isn't mentioned in the first defining sentence of that article.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 06:54, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the human eating process itself almost never involves death. We don't eat things that are alive. We eat dead things. By contrast, the abortion process itself ALWAYS involve death. Induced abortion is actually the DELIBERATE killing of a conceptus along with removing the conceptus from the womb. Its all part of the abortion procedure. If you do any research at all, you will discover that the GOAL of an abortion procedure is to kill the conceptus and then remove it. (Again, I can post links to the words of respected abortinists that state this). A dead conceptus is crucial for both practical and legal reasons. Decapitation and dismemberment of the fetus is part of a D&amp;C abortion, by definition. Killing the fetus is required for a legal abortion. Its not tangential. And spontaneous abortion ALWAYS involves the death of the conceptus. Either conceptus dies and it is expelled, or conceptus dies while being expelled. If the conceptus is expelled while alive, it is a birth. And in fact, the flesh of the dead conceptus itself is also properly referred to as an "abortion". If that flesh is alive, it not an abortion, but a neonatal infant. Death is part and parcel of every abortion. As we say, "No matter how you slice it, abortion kills." 84.146.227.229</dd>

<p>One other thing I think should be pointed out - this talk page is not a battlefield (although some on both sides of the issue treat it as such) - it is intended to work out an NPOV article, and find consensus when necessary. Because of the nature of the topic, consensus is often desirable to avoid edit wars (which often stall all progress on the topic). It takes patience, and can be frustrating - but keep in mind that other editors are not enemies to be attacked, hassled or insulted - that just pits editors against each other instead of working out a solution together. Although KYD and I do not see eye to eye on many issues, I do share his frustration (voiced above) that the main sections that need work within the article keep getting pushed aside because of relatively small issues ballooning into mud-slinging talk page rebutals and edit wars. And a note to new editors (of which I consider myself one, as well) - there are many long-time contributors on this page. This does not make them right, but it does make them generally more knowledgeable about conventions (not always mentioned in WP policies) and the day-to-day niceties that keep wikipedia functioning smoothly and - a concept often forgotten on this page - enjoyably. Try to take long-term contributors' advice into consideration before posting on both the article, and before making snide comments on the talk page.</p>

<dd>Thanks to you I learned something new about abortion activists, though. The "Jane Collective" does sound romantic in a grotesque way. Like "Cider House Rules". Celebrating the deliberate killing of innocents who should be embraced and protected. Sermon over. BTW, analogous to your comment above: its also not surprising that factual information not helpful to the abortion cause would also be hard to find given that journalists and the academy support abortion. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.248.62.html" title="User:84.146.248.62">84.146.248.62</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV is in how it's read</span></h2>
<p>I hate to start a new thread here, but it's probably worth repeating this - I noticed it at the bottom of a section, it took a bit to find......KYD wrote earlier:</p>
<p><i>This matter is covered in the thread "Termination of pregnancy sentance" in Archive 12. The introductory sentence is attempting to summarize all abortions in one line: spontaneous or induced, early or late term, and human or other species. If we are were to modify the sentence, I would go with "expulsion," as this sentence must also describe miscarriage. The word "removal" implies deliberate action and thus is only an accurate description of induced abortion. Death itself has many senses: astronomers often describe stars in the red giant stage as "dying." I don't see anything too bad in the use of "death," in a biological context, to describe abortion — <b>the POV lays mostly in how it's read.</b></i></p>
<p>I believe KYD is right when he says the POV lies in how it is read - a pro-life individual sees it as the death of a person (as opposed to human) with rights, a pro-choice individual would probably see it as the death of a developing cell mass (as many did in the previous consensus). Other pro-choice individuals might see it as a pro-life attempt to bring humanism (as some obviously do above). But the POV lies not in the word, but in its interpretation. It won't be any different with any other word (termination, expulsion, etc.) and the other terms also have problems in not addressing all forms of abortion (expulsion is spontaneous, as opposed to induced - one cannot "expulse" a fetus - so it relates mainly to miscarriage). So it seems to me that death is the most suitable, both for encompassing the necessary definitions of abortion, and after some thought, I think in terms of being a neutral word (as KYD says, death is a pretty loosely used term throughout the sciences). Thoughts in this regard?--2006-03-18 00:48:29 DonaNobisPacem</p>

<dd>You're quoting a POV (it gives no sources) on POV to support your POV on POV. Generally speaking, if this claim is true, why bother having NPOV as a policy? Specifically, death is used in "death sentence" and "death penalty" to name just 2 words that don't make "death" an NPOV term. Do you have any sources that use it in a positive way?--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 07:01, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is the conceptus living or dead at the end of the abortion process? Whether living or dead are good or bad is not of concern. We want facts in the article. What does "loss", "end" or "temination" mean? They can all be synonyms for death (as they are in this context). What is lost, ended or terminated? If you say pregnancy, then its the conceptus living in the womb that is lost, ended or teminated. Pregnancy does not exist if that conceptus dies. Its not really complex.</p>
<ul>
<li>Living coceptus in a womb = pregnancy.</li>
<li>Dead conceptus = no pregnancy.</li>
<li>Living conceptus but not in a womb = no pregnancy and no abortion unless fatal injuries are deliberately caused during the procedure or the conceptus is put to death at the conclusion of a deliberate abortion procedure (reputable abortionists have to kill fetuses outside the womb all the time - I can post a link for the skeptics). BTW, when a fetus survives an abortion and is killed soon after, this seems to be infanticide. But the reality according to abortionists is that many abortions happen this way, so I have discussed the matter accordingly. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.248.62.html" title="User:84.146.248.62">84.146.248.62</a></li>

<dd>Death is death. Cells die all the time. Please see the definition of <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life.html" title="Life">life</a>. The cells undergo <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitosis.html" title="Mitosis">mitosis</a>. They grow, and respond to their environment. Now, if they were removed from the mother's body, these cells will have no supplies, and will therefore die. Death of the cells is a fact. There is nothing wrong with the term "death", and it carries little stigma whatsoever (would you prefer the term <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_cleansing.html" title="Ethnic cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a> or <i>foetalcide</i>? There are things like <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programmed_cell_death.html" title="Programmed cell death">programmed cell death</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apoptosis.html" title="Apoptosis">apoptosis</a>, and all this "death" is seen as natural. After all, during a period, the cells on the uteral lining effectively "die". I could also say, "sentenced to life in prison", where "life" is used negatively, but that doesn't make the word itself POV, does it? Besides, the term "death penalty" IS an NPOV term. Now, if you were to call it unjust, that would be a POV. Please learn your biology. After all, death is needed so the other cells can grow, and is a natural part of evolution and life (well until we can edit our own genome so genetic updating through death becomes biologically unnecessary). In apoptosis, cells in the developing foetus <i>die</i>, in order to make way for spaces in the finger, and they effectively are programmed to commit suicide. Leaves in the fall commit apoptosis and die. None of the uses of this term for "death" is negative. After all, the leaves are of no use in the winter, and will only cause loss of precious water. Similarly, the cells between the fingers are un-needed, and need to die in order to make way for fingers to function. In the same way, people may abort a baby because they think that raising a child is an unnecessary obligation. Whether this is moral or not is a POV, but stating the cause for their actions is not. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 07:35, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A solution for the opening line!</span></h2>
<p>It seems that most of the medical articles I have started looking through (see articles "using death" subsection above) use a two-tiered, as it were, definition: they define an abortion (spontaneous or induced) as the expulsion of a fetus - <b>BUT</b> - before many cheer and ignore the rest - go on to say that it is a result of, or results in, the death of the fetus. <b>SO</b> - before many others cheer and ignore the rest - I propose a solution, that uses both forms of terminology, and is recognized in medical/scientific/reliable/whatever other flipping category I need here literature:</p>
<p><b>An abortion is the expulsion of a fetus, due to or resulting in the death of the fetus, resulting in the termination of pregnancy.</b></p>
<p>This takes into account:</p>
<p>1.) Abortion is the actual expulsion, according to medical literature. Nothing less, nothing more. It is not the procedure itself in an induced abortion, nor is it the cause of the miscarriage. Abortion = fetus leaving womb.[other than birth <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.248.62.html" title="User:84.146.248.62">84.146.248.62</a>]</p>
<p>2.) It is caused by or results in the death of the fetus, as is recognized in medical literature. One or the other happens (the fetus can still be alive at the time of a spontaneous abortion, it would seem).</p>
<p>3.) The pregnancy, at that time, is terminated.[because the woman is no longer gestating <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.248.62.html" title="User:84.146.248.62">84.146.248.62</a>]</p>

<p>That isn't too shaby (but is it significantly different than the current version?) My only suggestion would be to change the order and have 'termination of pregnancy' the first clause.

<p>It was brought up previously <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Abortion/Archive_13#Introductory_Sentence_.28once_and_for_all.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Abortion/Archive_13#Introductory_Sentence_.28once_and_for_all.29" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> by Kyd that when one baby is aborted when carrying twins (a selective reduction), the pregnancy does not end. This is interesting. In order to have one all-inclusive general definition for abortion, perhaps the focus should NOT be on the pregnancy, but on the continued fetal development of the aborted conceptus. Obviously a pregnancy is NOT always ended as a result of an abortion (as in a selective reduction or the miscarriage of only one twin). Technically, the only universal truths (among those we have been discussing in this context) present in all abortions are that the life (development) of the conceptus is what is aborted or terminated, and that this dead conceptus exits the womb. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodandevil_5069.html" title="User:Goodandevil">Goodandevil</a> 16:38, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh dear, that's a complication. If one of two twins is aborted or miscarried, would it be correct to say that the pregnancy ended for the fetus, if not for the mother? Maybe that's a stretch.

<p>If you go to the NIH website <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mplusdictionary.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mplusdictionary.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> and use their online medical dictionary you get this result <a href="http://www2.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwmednlm?book=Medical&amp;va=pregnant" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwmednlm?book=Medical&amp;va=pregnant" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>PREGNANT: <b>containing a developing embryo, fetus, or unborn offspring within the body : GESTATING : GRAVID</b> (Source: Merriam Webster Medical Dictionary)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I asked for input, I have not seen any basis posted for totally excluding mention of this MEDICAL definiton in the article. This definition is sourced from a neutral manistream medical publication. The current wikpedia abortion article reads as though such a view is both unscientific and marginal. In fact, this alternate definition of pregnancy is both scientific and widely held, even among medical professionals, according to peer reviewed research. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Abortion#Research_demonstrating_that_large_percentages_of_Ob.2FGyns_reject_the_ACOG_redefinition" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Abortion#Research_demonstrating_that_large_percentages_of_Ob.2FGyns_reject_the_ACOG_redefinition" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>. This definition makes it clear that there is no pregnancy unless the embryo (regardless of stage of development or implantation) is living and developing inside a woman's body.</p>
<p>I propose the following wording. Please suggest alternatives. Bottom line: the fact that there is a different mainstream medical definition in existence needs to be in the article. Its not simply a different view. Its a different medical view:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Pregnancy is often defined by the medical community as beginning at the implantation of the embryo. An alternative medical definiton places the beginning of pregnancy at fertilization (also called conception).</i></li>

<dd>My opinion is that falls under the same objection (raised by pro-lifers) as the dictionary wording "incapable of survival". It is a long way of saying death; and as we are striving for summary form, death is short and concise; unfortunately it is also more emotive and negative. But frankly I think that is an appropriate tone for the subject of abortion, be it miscarriage or induced abortion. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 22:51, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, while not as concise as I would like, it is better because the result does not always result in death (as somebody arguing from a anti-abortion view made the point of). It sometimes ends in the equivalent of a premature birth. One day, it may be up to the woman to donate her embryo/fetus to another woman as men can donate sperm. So, whether by accident or intent, the pregnancy ends without death. As for edit wars, I don't see you providing any substatial sources that state that abortion must end in death to be abortion. Please stop the discussion war and provide sources.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPro-Lick_d9f8.html" title="User:Pro-Lick">Pro-Lick</a> 22:19, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But as stated above - that is referred to as a "failed abortion," in the case of an induced abortion, and "premature birth" in the case of a spontaneous abortion. The definition (by necessity) states what a "succesful" outcome is.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 23:22, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An abortion by definition results in the termination/death of the thing being aborted; if you have reason to believe otherwise; provide it. You want the change, you convince us, not the other way around. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 22:41, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Besides, if the foetus continues to live, then it is really a <i>failed</i> abortion (as ironic as it may seem). If it gets transferred, then you really haven't <i>aborted</i> the pregnancy, only suspended it temporarily. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small></a> (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENatalinasmpf_9405.html" title="User talk:Natalinasmpf">Be eudaimonic!</a>) 22:45, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
