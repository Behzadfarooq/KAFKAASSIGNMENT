<p>In response to your super chef article, I just wanted to let you know that hwne linking to other articles in wikipedia you only need to do this:</p>
<p>[[target]]</p>
<p>Please don't link to http://en.wikipedia.org.... --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 19:48, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do you prefer hyperlinks within Wikipedia, outside of it -- or both? I would think both, in which case what would be the best way to show both? I would think best would be like this: <a href="../../../a/l/g/Alger_Hiss_0733.html" title="Alger Hiss">Alger Hiss</a> (<a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/" class="external text" title="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/" rel="nofollow">q.v.</a>) Is that good for you?</p>
<p>Also, is there a model page, perhaps for each major category?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have missed the categorizing part: how does one do it? For instance, I would like to categorize the "super chef" page I created. I tried to understand from the other page to which I have most contributed, "Whittaker Chambers," but the Categories were listed at the bottom of the page only and did not seem as intuitive to create as other elements in an article...</p>
<p>(BTW, my edits of the "Whittaker Chambers" page kicked it right up to the top on Google -- pretty simple, by adding links to TIME magazine, C-SPAN, and the like. Looks like the reorganization also completely reordered Google itself -- seems Wikipedia is quite powerful.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't quite understand. When you are linking to other aticles please put the article name like [[France]]. If linking to an external site use the [http://google.com Google] style. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComputerjoe_570e.html" title="User:Computerjoe"><span style="color:black">Compu</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/m/User_talk%7EComputerjoe_0094.html" title="User talk:Computerjoe"><span style="color:red">terjoe</span></a> 20:43, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/o/User_talk%7EAboudaqn_b36f.html" title="Edit section: Super Chef">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Super Chef</span></h2>
<p>I accidentally put this on your user page, obviously others have commented above but here it is. I'd like to address a couple of your points. Firstly, please read the above policies. Yes Wikipedia is a modern encyclopedia but there are rules as to what belongs. You'd be surprised what gets rejected around here. I don't doubt that this phrase has been "coined" and it may or may not accurately describe this set of people. It may even become commonly recognized in the future. But is it now? really? If not then its time will come. Neologisms are regarded with suspicion by many editors, and there is no "deadline" or hurry to include them. If it stands the test of time, it will get in there. You know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>As the page is being considered for deletion it would be well regarded if you didn't spend a lot of time categorizing and inter-linking this article - this makes no difference whatsover to the way people will regard the notability of the page, but if it does get deleted it will create less work for those who have to remove the links. Your full rationale to keep the page may also be more suited to the talk page for the related article, rather than the AfD entry. Entries on AfD generally consist of a basic vote to <b>keep</b> or <b>delete</b> the nominated article, followed by a short rationale and a signature (see above). Well done for noting your involvement with the article. You can always add a link to the given talk page from your AfD vote if it contains further relevant info.</p>
<p>As regards external / internal links: Internal links to existing WP pages are great when done in accordance with <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONTEXT_5f0d.html" title="WP:CONTEXT">WP:CONTEXT</a>. Basically: Only link to other existing pages (bluelinks) that are <i>directly relevant</i> to the original page, don't link to non-existent pages (redlinks) unless you are confident such a page would make for a notable entry and you are willing to create said entry in the near future, don't bluelink the same page more than once and try to keep as even a spread of bluelinks throughout the article as possible. External links should generally be included in a separate section entitled "External Links" after the main body of the article but can be used anywhere in an article as the editor sees fit. However please don't be upset if other editors move your links to the external links section.</p>
<p>Finally, the tone of your piece, and in particular the line "Were any of you to read this entire "super chef" before continuing your deletion process..." is unduly confrontational, verges on patronizing and is highly unlikely to create the right impression on people. 101 new editors appeal for their pages to be kept every day, every page gets treated the same. Stick around and keep editing, because that way you keep improving, that goes for all of us. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990000">D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#990000">izio</font></b></a> 04:28, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Deizio:</p>
<p>(For my own quick reference, here is the link to the "Juliette Rossant" entry: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliette_rossant" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliette_rossant" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliette_rossant</a>)</p>
<p>Many thanks for comments. I would like to note here that Wikipedia seems to demand a very high level of familiarization and is far less intuitive than I would expect for such a broad mission. On the other hand, perhaps Wikipedia keeps this learning curve as an obstacle to the "less committed"? Which do you think?</p>
<p>Also, I would like to apologize for being confrontational. I am new to the W world and, frankly, expected a bit more explanation before my work was purged. Talked seemed internal and not engaging of the entry's author, so I strongly injected myself and challenged commentators/voters on whether they had read carefully. The voter comments were unclear to me and lacked justification -- it did indeed seem to me that many commentators had either not carefully read the entry or did not know the subject well enough to make a comment. So, I was deliberately provocative -- and I also deliberately apologize to any and all.</p>
<p>Regarding the "Super Chef" and "Juliette Rossant" entries, has there been a final vote? Can I still work to improve it, and what should I do at this point to do so? It seems that "Super Chef" and "Celebrity Chef" are in process of melding, though their amalgamation is full of inaccuracies, I assure you. How does W sort such situations? May I suggest "sub-entries" under "chef" -- and are such sub-entries be directly accessible with their own hyperlinks? I think it would be a great service to sort out who is a chef and who is not -- Julia Child was trained as master chef and worthy of the title, but Rachael Ray (current female star of the Food Network and counterpart to Emeril Lagasse) is most definitely NOT a chef nor properly trained... If you give me time and feeback, I could work on this whole thing -- and learn about about proper entries, consolidation, and ordering in the W world.</p>
<p>Lastly (and I wrote about this, below, about Eulalia Perez de Guillen Marine, my second biographical entry), what in your opinion makes a person merit a bio on Wikipedia? To me, Wikipedia, since it is virtual, should contain far more than an Encyclopedia Brittanica, yet. People like Juliette Rossant and Eulalia Perez de Guillen Marine are or were changing thinking or otherwise impacting lives, but what makes them more or less worthy of Wikipedia mention than others? Was the list of external links impressive in both cases and thus "proving" them worthy of W entries, or more what they have done, or what? To my mind, the Rossant entry is a natural for W: she is one of the leaders in defining big-name chefs, who are getting more and more entries on W every single day (thanks to the growth of food on TV). As for Eulalia, she is clearly cited as a "famous centagenarian," connected to prominent early California families, a leading woman in the early days of European-settled North America...?</p>
<p>If you editors can bear with early lengthy questions such as mine, you are sure to recruit a long-time contributor such as me.</p>
<p>Oh, also, before any deletions or purges are made, I would like either to be notified well ahead of time, so I can collect the entries to keep myself beforehand, or, even easier (on me), I ask that the deletor/purger email a copy of the final entry to me. This seems a reasonable request from authors in general, don't you think?</p>
