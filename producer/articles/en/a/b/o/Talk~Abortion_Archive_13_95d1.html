<i>Abortion terminology</i> The intense and virulent <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debate.html" title="Debate">debate</a> surrounding the subject of abortion has created a number of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistic.html" title="Linguistic">linguistic</a> pitfalls, where the usage of certain <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terms.html" title="Terms">terms</a> can <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imply.html" title="Imply">imply</a> additional meaning beyond the strictest <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition.html" title="Definition">definition</a> of the used term. A <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common.html" title="Common">common</a> linguistic pitfall is the use of the term "<a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a>", which can imply an organism with <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a>, or an individual <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person.html" title="Person">person</a>. Similar implications surround the use of the terms "<a href="../../../l/i/f/Life.html" title="Life">life</a>" and "<a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a>". These terms may be used to determine the state of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biological</a> functionality, or may be used to further imply the state personhood. The terms "<a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetus</a>" and "<a href="../../../u/n/b/Unborn.html" title="Unborn">unborn</a>" both refer to the same thing, but sometimes are taken to imply non-personhoood or personhood respectivly.</p>
<p>This was my latest attempt at fixing this little quagmire. It was removed in a spout of vandalism reversion. Despite this being my brainchild, I'm undecided whether its worth putting back in. I figure we can restore it, send it to the folks at <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_Debate_3fce.html" title="Abortion Debate">Abortion Debate</a>, or just wipe it out entirely.

<dd>It's your baby, Tznkai, so it's really your call. On the one hand, it acts something like a talisman to ward off both well-meaning, unintentionally POV edits and fully-intentional, egregious soapboaxing; on the other hand, is it just needless prefacing that contributes little in the way of direct information on abortion, laws, statistics, etc.?

<p>The discussion of treaties and international law was too specific, involved, and overwhelming to be included in the abortion law summary of the top-tier abortion article.

<dl>
<dd>Well, for one <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> is not a pro-choice page.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, I think we're looking at a systemic problem. Since abortion is such a hot topic, and some would say (and I may agree) gruesome topic, with most images we're looking at offending everyone, offending pro choicers, offending pro lifers, and offending wikipedians. The amount of information we get out of most images is either suited to the debate article and sub articles, or just insufficient to the amount of offense it will cause. Of course, I eagerly wait for someone to prove me wrong (again).--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 07:18, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly. It would only be a matter of time before someone came along and use the presence of a few more neutral pictures to justify adding the gory selections of protesters everywhere. Is there really a "neutral" abortion illustration? Perhaps a number of visuals to back up the text: charts, graphs, more maps, etc. Pipe dream, probably. --<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 08:17, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was upset at the time...I don't really want to see (key words) gory pictures.

<dd>The picture you uploaded was taken by Swedish photographer <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lennart_Nilsson_5cd7.html" title="Lennart Nilsson">Lennart Nilsson</a>. Since he is still alive, and American copyright law holds the period in which an author's work is protected to be life plus 70 years, we should assume that the image is still copyrighted. This is why the <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetus</a> page uses a 19th-century drawing: it's public domain. Beyond the copyright concern, of course, the photo isn't exactly neutral when placed in this context. A bit like having a photo of an adorable, watery-eyed calf on the <a href="../../../v/e/a/Veal.html" title="Veal">veal</a> article, don't you think? <a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 09:48, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think that such a picture on veal would be non-neutral (though maybe off-topic). I don't have a problem with eating a "watery-eyed calf" (not in one piece of course. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 09:51, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I disagree that the picture is off topic. It might imply Pro-life but only if the reader chooses to think of it that way. I won't add it because it is probably still copyrighted but there should be pictures - and if the pictures half to be "On topic" what would that leave gory bloody ones, or pictures of the tools used? I think a picture of a living human baby should be included. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a></p>

<dd>Yes, I'd thought that too. An illustration of the instruments used in a surgical abortion procedure would be of direct benefit to the written text. Also, perhaps a picture of protestors on both sides sparring, like the one on the cover of <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1573928763/002-4765776-1828046?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1573928763/002-4765776-1828046?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" rel="nofollow">The Ethics of Abortion&#160;: Pro-Life Vs.

<dd>Chooserr, you're getting close to flying in the face of consensus here.

<p>The medical literature has not conclusively shown that abortion affects mental health.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"George Walter, an employee of then <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgeon_General_of_the_United_States_9a4e.html" title="Surgeon General of the United States">U.S. Surgeon General</a> <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._Everett_Koop_99a4.html" title="C. Everett Koop">C. Everett Koop</a>, conducted a review of more than 250 studies in the literature pertaining to the psychological impact of abortion. Walter conducted the review at the request of Koop, who was being pressured by then <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._President_8806.html" title="U.S. President">U.S. President</a> <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_W._Reagan_2e96.html" title="Ronald W.

Walter consulted primarily with researchers from the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Guttmacher_Institute_3677.html" title="Alan Guttmacher Institute">Alan Guttmacher Institute</a> and the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centers_for_Disease_Control_73db.html" title="Centers for Disease Control">Centers for Disease Control</a>, and used primarily studies recommended by researchers in favor of easy access to legal abortion. Walter submitted the report to Koop, who instructed Walter to shelve the report. Koop submitted a letter to Reagan indicating that the research was inconclusive. However, Walter released the report under Koop's name. Thus, public debates in the US as to the safety of legal abortion remain muddled. Opponents of abortion cite Koop's letter finding the evidence inconclusive, and those favoring the availability of legal abortion cite Walters' report, released under Koop's name, and attributed to Koop.

<p>Here is a potential introductory text:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is indisputable that some women will experience negative feelings as a result of elective abortion. However, whether this phenomenon is significant enough to warrant a general diagnosis, or even classification as an independent <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndrome.html" title="Syndrome">syndrome</a> (see <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_trauma_syndrome.html" title="Abortion trauma syndrome">abortion trauma syndrome</a>), is open to debate.</dd>

The majority of evidence would seem to indicate that adverse emotional reactions to the procedure are most strongly influenced by pre-existing psychological conditions and other negative factors.</dd>

<p>All we would need to do, now, is find some reliable and pertinent sources to back it up. I've removed the current sources. It's pointless to list them when there's no mention of them in the current section:</p>

<dd>Tzn, I like your suggestion about "Health effects", which could include the Mental health stuff, along with other post-abortion health information. Health risks is beginning to look like its POV, as there can be benefits. Not only that once studies are adjusted for mitigating factors such as rape, drug abuse, and poverty the post-<i>abortion</i> group has a lower incidence of depression and other related Mental health issues, but also we haven't mentioned that like any surgical procedure, there are health risks, the health risks for legal abortion are <i>lower</i> than for carrying a pregnancy to term and delivering it. We'll need sources for that, I'll get them - and if I'm wrong we'll adjust that statement. My point being that if all we talk about is health risk of abortion without mentioning that, aren't we being POV and appearing to support the anti-abortion faction? Realizing that we should keep that to one brief statement, probably including the risk % of other procedures, the idea is to give a point of comparison. We're not writing the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_debate.html" title="Abortion debate">Abortion debate</a> article (although <i>someone</i> needs to re-work that mess.)</dd>
<dd>There may well be other issues / points / topics we're not covering. <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/action/GetStudy;jsessionid=9A16374089CD0B3C8D1D77994FDD14CF" class="external text" title="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/action/GetStudy;jsessionid=9A16374089CD0B3C8D1D77994FDD14CF" rel="nofollow">Clinical trials (Abortion)</a> is a list on the NIH site. To see abstracts of completed and nearly completed studies, check the boxes next to the ones marked "completed" and "no longer recruiting" and click button at bottom of page (display selected results.) One example is "Couples Miscarriage Healing Project" which is about post-spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) family depression, which made me realize we're not covering this very well. We shouldn't limit our Mental health to those who have induced abortion.</dd>
<dd>In the "other" post-abortion health issues is the risk of sterility resulting from abortion, usually multiple abortions. There may be other things of which we're not (yet) aware.</dd>

<dd>I'm hesitant on the compared to risks of pregnancy. Its an off quoted statistic and its kinda screwy. Especially since some abortions are almost the same as a cescarian section.

<li>You got that right, Tzn, its an "off" quoted statistic. Seems that if you compare death world-wide to maternity deaths overall (which is 4%), to legal abortions in highly developed countries, (which is less than 1%) it makes for a nice biased spin for pro-choice. If you go apples against apples, though, guess what? Abortion carries a slightly higher risk of maternal mortality.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>WHO reports on all maternal deaths in a combined report: <a href="http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/reduction_of_maternal_mortality/e_rmm.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/reduction_of_maternal_mortality/e_rmm.pdf" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> see table page 17.

<dd>Unsafe abortion 13%</dd>
<dd>Eclampsia 12%</dd>
<dd>Obstructed labor 8%</dd>

<p>Worldwide, the risk of maternal death is 4%. In industrialized nations the risk is .1% <a href="http://www.childinfo.org/eddb/mat_mortal/" class="external text" title="http://www.childinfo.org/eddb/mat_mortal/" rel="nofollow">UNICEF Maternal mortality</a></p>

</dl>
<p>Conclusion: In industrialized countries, legal abortion carries a risk of less than 1%. Full term delivery carries a risk of .1%. Acute appendicitis surgery has a mortality rate of 1.8%. Laparoscopic gastric bypass operations ("stomach stapling") carries a risk of mortality of 2%. The risk increases as the quality of surgical care decreases.</p>
<p>Is this worth including?

<dd>I'd say the overall discrepancy in statistic reporting is a great topic for the abortion debate article. As for Health risk of abortion vs pregnancy, lets whittle it down. Generally, a pregnancy, on its own, even when undesired, is not a health problem to physisians. So perhaps certain classifications of problematic or difficult pregnancies compared to normal pregnancies, compared to abortions would work better. Drawing some conclusions from what I've read, lets see if this is right:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>An unwanted pregnancy is a major mental health burden, abortion generally provides a relief from that burden</li>
<li>An abortion may act as a stressor for depression, but is generally outweighed by the above (abortions surveyed are voluntary)</li>
<li>Abortion has been reported to cause sterility</li>
<li>abortion has been reported to cause breast cancer</li>
<li>Surgical abortions have a similar physical health threat to other surgeries</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
We also need to adress so called <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_trauma_syndrome.html" title="Abortion trauma syndrome">abortion trauma syndrome</a>, although I may merge that to debate and/or AFD the article. Any major conclusions I'm missing?--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 17:01, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I concur with those summaries overall. The breast cancer link has very little evidence for, and a great deal of outcry against, in medical literature. I'd leave this out for the time being until the dust settles a little, or be sure to word it very very carefully. Sterility is for botched (almost always illegal) surgical abortions, and repeat abortions (lots of abortions, not two or three.) I'd trim "major" from mental health burdon as well. Instead of "An abortion may act as a stressor for depression, but is generally outweighed by the above" I suggest reverse order or rephrase - perhaps "An abortion may reduce incidence of depression in unwanted pregnancy as compared to cases where pregnancy was carried to completion, but is sometimes reported as an additional stressor. This is disputed." (footnote, footnote, footnote)</dd>

So, then, BMJ it shall be. I don't think the paper mentions the 2000 BPS study.

<p>What about the extensive research done by Dr. Philip Ney on PAS (Post Abortion Syndrome), as well as other trauma, such as abortion survivor syndrome, psychological impact on medical staff, etc. He is regarded as an authority in this area, and has published quite a bit on it - one can simply google his name and get scads of stuff.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 06:26, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is being included in the assertions made about negative mental health post-abortion. As far as PAS, though, the American Psychological Association states it does not exist. Ney is the "discoverer" of the condition, has a highly POV stance in promoting it as a concept, but the data simply does not bear him out. When examined, almost all the people being diagnosed as PAS sufferers are victims of abuse, drug abusers, poverty victims - in short, if you compare apples to apples people who have had elective abortions have far fewer psychological issues than those who chose to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. PAS is highly disputed by almost all the mental health field, and outright rejected by a large portion. It would be POV of us to present it in any other way. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 12:50, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>How about a title like "Disputed Mental and Physical Effects of Abortion?" The suggestion for a separate section is good - that seems to correspond well with Wikipedia's rules on minority/disputed views. Perhaps better than a separate section entirely would just be a subsection within mental health. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 23:32, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Excellent, I love the title "Disputed Mental and Physical Effects of Abortion", it has my vote. What about have that as a third subsection under Health - which as there are mental health benefits to elective abortions, we need to rename to something else from "Health risks" - perhaps Effects on health, or just plain Health? Or maybe DonaNobisPacem will bail us out with a good title again.

<dd>Agreed. "Disputed" or "controversial" in the title would be subjective qualification. I recommend, for simplicity's sake, that we stick to the current format - although it would be tempting create a seperate section to accomodate such issues as ABC, PAS, and fetal pain. I do think that the section, as a whole, could use a more comprehensive title, like "health effects." The current presentation is rather, uh, messy, and could use some cleaning up. (P.S. Hope my revision to the section is up to snuff). -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 11:20, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, here's my opinion - if we're looking for a new title, I put forth my earlier suggestion minus the "disputed" and plus "health" - ie, "Mental and Physical Health Effects of Abortion". Kyd, I do see your point on "disputed" or "controversial" - on a topic such as this, that is asking for constant POV edits, which could continue to kingdom come. Not to mention, it is important to note that effects, both positive and negative, are still under debate in the medical research community - thus, I put forth the wording "Majority" and "Minority" views as less contentious, and not misleading. As I see it, that leaves two alternatives: 1.) List the mental/physical benefits/risks under the appropriate sections, identifying research done and whether the view is a minority or majority view; or, 2.) Under the Mental and Physical sections, have another subsection labelled "Majority" and "Minority" view (although it does mean another subsection, I think it will shorten the length over suggestion 1.) So, to give an idea of what I propose:</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, this addresses the fact that it is a contentious issue, allows minority viewpoints to be addressed as such, without using language that labels either as being better or worse but rather labels it according to the proportion of the medical community that holds the view. This, of course, necessitates research into how widely a view is held (and should not be limited to North American/Western viewpoints, in my opinion, as long as research was conducted properly), but that research will help avoid people slapping stuff in as they feel fit ("Research indicates that abortions given by aliens have more serious health effects....."), and also helps avoid constant POV reverts and deletions.

<dd>I'm dying laughing here... alien abortions... oh my.</dd>
<dd>I'll abide by consensus here, I dont' have a very strong opinion currently as to the best way to address this. I would like to note that at least one of the effects which we are discussing is not a "majority" vs "minority" view, but rather what happens in the majority vs the minority of cases. How do you propose to work that in? <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 18:19, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That still fits under those sections - is it a majority viewpoint or not? Proponents of PAS (Post Abortion Syndrome) would tell you that virtually every person who has an abortion suffers from PAS. This is the view that something that happens in the majority of cases, held by a minority of people. Likewise, incomplete emptying of the uterus leads to complications in the majority of cases, and this view is held by the majority of people.....it works, but maybe this is too complicated?</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you want humour, Chihuahua, read my latest post under "Picture Survey."</dd>
<dd>The proposed configuration is well-conceived, in principle, but a little too complicated in practice. Basically, I can see every potential "health effect" being subjected to a litmus test -- even undisputed ones. And, even then, where would the line be drawn? If, say, nosebleeds were an undisputed rare side effect of abortion, would we classify them as being "minority," for their rarity, or else "majority," for the lack of dispute? -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 19:58, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Good point - I think that again reduces to having a section such as "disputed mental effects" or "disputed health effects" again.......I personally don't have a problem with the wording disputed, but the problem comes in that (reliable) medical sources can dispute majority viewpoints - for example, the view that abortion is mentally therapeutic is under debate amongst the medical community - it might solve financial problems, etc, but many doctors accept that there are negative mental effects. So care would need to be used to put undisputed claims (such as absolutely accepted physical effects) together, and disputed claims together, despite majority or minority viewpoints. Make sense?<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 00:38, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added more links to the page, but did indeed copy &amp; paste the text. I was planing to work on it make it more NPOV if I could along with add information.

<dd>You still need to address the relevance problem. If you want to work on it on wikipedia, you can do it offthe main article. Try cereating a page like [[user:chooserr/workshop/Fetal pain] and then you can copy and paste from there. The problem with fetal pain is its a degree or two seperated from abortion. Its an issue in abortion debates occasionally, but its pbetter served in the fetus or possibly pregnancy articles. Feeling pain requires a certain amount of development in the CNS and PNS, so thats where you can focus. I'm sure the research is really intresting too.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 21:00, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Then mental and physical health would be seperate as well and the article could only talk about the debate and the actual process. I will work on the page at the workshop if I can create one but it won't allow other users to contribute, which would make it come off verrrrrrrrry POV when it isn't intended to (resulting most likely in it's immediate deletion). That's why a starter that others can work on would be a better Idea.</p>

<dd>The scope of "physical health" could be broadened if this information is deemed appropriate. However, the evidence in support of fetal pain before the third trimester is lacking. The Journal of American Medicine, I believe, published a report on the matter: <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/294/8/947" class="external autonumber" title="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/294/8/947" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<p>I don't see how just because the procedure ends in a death the pain it endures shouldn't be put on the page for most people ask the vet before they put their dogs to sleep "will he feel any pain" and a similar sentiment is uttered by adults when a loved-one has died.

<dd>The subject of fetal pain is relevant if hard facts are available, but it has to be written NPOV. The way it is written now it says, in effect, I just know that poor little foetus is suffering and I want all you bad people to stop killing babies. The fact is we have no way of knowing when the qualia of pain begins. We know some necessary conditions -- a central nervous system -- but we don't know for sure when consciousness begins, and without consciousness there can be no pain. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 23:52, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I checked the three links provided in the "fetal pain" section. The first link is broken. The second link is to an article that states that Republican politicians are certain that a fetus can feel pain, and scientists had better get with the program. The third link tries to give or sell you coupons. With that in mind, I've cut all of the questionable "facts" and left a single sentence to the effect that not much is known on this subject. That should probably go, too. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 23:52, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

You run to the bathroom and see that you've bitten a little bit into your cheek, and it's bleeding a decent amount.

<dd>oh, and the answer seems to be that by the 10th week according to one study, and certainly by the 24th week, the anatomical structures subserving the appreciation of pain are present and functional. Before the 10th week the fetus lacks the necessary antomical ability to register and therefore experience pain. Experts disagree upon how much later in gestation these structures are fully realized and functioning. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 00:15, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Now, no full-blown scientific study has been done on this topic, but can't we use our common sense and at LEAST say "some believe the unborn human feels pain because of observations of it moving away from the scalpel and suction tube during an abortion"?"</p>
<p>Even completely severed limbs can twist and move when stimulated (hold a lizard by the tail and you´ll see what I mean). Similarly even if completely paralyzed and numb below a body segment, a person can still move the limbs reflexively. I have not heard of anyone apart from grossly biased and factually incorrect pro-life sites say that the fetus specifically moves AWAY from the suction tube/forceps. I doubt they use a scalpel inside the uterus. So what "some" believe may well be their belifs, but it has no place in Wiki just because of that, especially when it is incorrect.</p>

<p>Enough is enough people. This article attracts POV pushers. We all know this. What we're forgetting is we all get worked up over abortion and abortion POV because we all care very deeply about it one way or another. We are all guilty of the same evil, of caring so much we believe we are right. This leads to hot tempers and little patience to hear the other person out.</p>
<p>This is directed at pretty much everyone who has been editing here recently and a few who havn't. I'm not going to play teacher and send anyone to the principle's office. It has got to stop.</p>
<p>We have a lot to do here. The prose in this article (a great deal of it my own work) is shoddy. The health risk section, arguably one of the <i>most important</i> part of this article is in serious need of repair. We need sources, we need refrences, and we need them yesterday. Several of the sections are place holders I created to establish the article's framework <i>months</i> back. So sit down, shut up, and get to work. We're a team here people, and if you have a problem with that, get the hell out of this article, and probably Wikipedia as well. If you cannot understand the need to have a sufficient, factual, acurate article here, and how that is more important that quibbling over POV, and accusing others of having it, (news flash, we all have a point of view), then you've got some serious thinking to do before continuing to contribute to this project.</p>
<p>Abortion is a major issue in the world today. We should all be able to agree that without the facts, we have a serious problem. We may have some disagreement on the particulars, but it is clear that there are major facts missing.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 19:54, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm really liking the concept of setting ourselves to tasks. It is easy to get distracted in largely unproductive ventures like bickering on Talk pages.</dd>
<dd>I'll have to agree with you that the quality of the article is patchy throughout. There's inconsistency in phrasing, grammar, and style which my inner grammarian yearns to correct. I don't want to be nitpicky, though, because I do realize there's a certain amount of inconsistency to be expected in a collective writing project.</dd>
<dd>I admit that I get tunnel vision. I tend to work best when I concentrate my energies on one section at the expense of ignoring all others. Hence, I've made the abortion law and public opinion sections my pet projects while leaving the health, etc., to everyone else. I could rework the abortion history section, I guess, being that I already seem to be working the article from the bottom up and the subject does interest me.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History draft</span></h2>
<p>Here's the draft of the summary for the history of abortion section. I'm not sure if I am entirely pleased with the result: I veered away from discussing the social, legal, or ethical aspects of abortion, as those are better served in Abortion Law and Abortion Debate. Instead, I stuck to discussing it from a purely medical perspective, attempting to expand upon the primitive methods of abortion mentioned in the current paragraph. I perhaps focused too much herbal abortion and would like to discuss the 20th century. Thoughts?</p>
<p>P.S. It would make a really great illustrative element if someone could dredge up an example of one of the 19th-century advertisements mentioned in the last paragraph. Such things should, of course, be in the public domain.</p>

<p>The practice of induced abortion, according to some <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropologists.html" title="Anthropologists">anthropologists</a>, can be traced to ancient times. There is evidence to suggest that, historically, pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods, including the administration of <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortifacient.html" title="Abortifacient">abortifacient</a> herbs, the use of sharpened implements, the application of abdominal pressure, and other techniques.</p>

<p>It is also known that the ancient Greeks relied upon the herb <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silphium.html" title="Silphium">silphium</a> as both a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contraceptive.html" title="Contraceptive">contraceptive</a> and an <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortifacient.html" title="Abortifacient">abortifacient</a>.

<dd>Human is out. While my hair cells are also human, they aren't <i>A</i> human. And with modern day cloning, their DNA could be extracted, and they could someday grow into a human. So, on a real level, my hair folicles are uncloned, unborn, unrealized babies. Is this absurd? Of course it is, but it proves the point that <i>un-[future event]-ed</i> is problematic and that since we don't know when a human becomes an independent fully realized human, to say otherwise is POV.</dd>
<dd>I still like what I proposed a week ago, "An abortion is the termination or loss of an embryo or fetus that results in the premature cessation of pregnancy."

<dd>I favour keeping the current wording as it is.</dd>
<dd>For my part, though all Barwick says is true and noble, would discourage inserting it, because in general abortion can be done to animals as well. Yes, it is mostly discussed regarding humans and later on the article clarifies that, but we don't need it in the opening sentence - "of human or animal fetus" I think to circumstantial (I already considered the 2one or all carried fetuses" superfluous. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 14:43, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The question of abortion in animals is a red herring. The artical clearly states that "this article focuses exclusively on abortions performed upon humans."</dd>
<dd>Leave the intro alone. It is correct as it stands: abortion is the killing of an embryo or fetus. That is NPOV, non-controversial, everybody agrees with it. It states clearly and accurately what abortion is.

<dd>I hope we agree many more times. Having looked at the intro, though, I now discover it has sprouted plural forms instead of singular, which seem to me to contribute nothing.

<dd>My problem was actually looking the other direction. If an abortion is the termination and death of <b>the</b> fetus (singular) the sentances implies that pregnancies always have a singular pre/unborn/fetus,embryo, etc. This is not true in humans and very much not true in everyone else. Its more an innacuracy of english, not a POV issue. <s>Anyway. I think we're close to having distilled the current intro section as close as we will ever get it to perfect, unless someone can find a more clever way of the plural issue, or convinces me that it isn't one.</s> Ann, could you jump in here, I know you're good with the whole English Language Thing.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 17:25, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I actually agree with Str1977's deleted comment that Quasipalm's proposal is POV, but sometimes this talk page fills up so fast that I miss important new (or old!) arguments until a few days after they've been made. I prefer the older version "An abortion is the premature termination of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> resulting in the death of the <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryo.html" title="Embryo">embryo</a> or <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetus</a>." I think Tznkai is quite right, of course, in saying that it raises questions as to what we should call it when one child survives, and is later born. But that doesn't make the old definition incorrect; it just makes it incomplete in a tiny, tiny minority of cases. I wonder could we elaborate later in the article, dealing briefly with the case of twins, etc., rather than going for a clumsy wording at the beginning? We could also, perhaps say "resulting in the death of an <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryo.html" title="Embryo">embryo</a> or a <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetus</a>." Changing from the definite article to an indefinite one would get over the problem of numbers. Using the definite article makes it more specific – "this one, not these two", or "these two, not these three". If we don't decide to get rid of the "any or all" bit, then I'd agree with Str to leave it as it is. By the way, I'm not comfortable with "fetus" as the object of the verb "terminate". Pregnancies are terminated; fetuses are killed (or die). I'm not saying that it can never be used that way, but since to terminate means to end, termination collocates more with pregnancy than with fetus, and is, strictly speaking, more correct when used that way.

<dd>Maybe I'm being blind to my own comments, but I honestly think this is NPOV and I'm confused as to what POV this sentence expresses. (If it's my own POV, it's that we don't know when a fetus becomes a baby, which I think is the only POV that is also NPOV in a sense.) But yes, I agree with you about the first sentence you quote being better than the current one. Why don't we have the first sentence just speak to 99% of cases and then have a following sentence say something about multiple births if need be? --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuasipalm_6524.html" title="User:Quasipalm">Quasipalm</a> 19:04, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Point well taken. For the record I'm not trying to eliminate any nasty details about abortion. My objection was that "death" implied personhood. I'm dropping this objection now, however. I'm becoming convinced it may be the simplest way of conveying, um, termination.&#160;;-) I think this may be caused by my own idea of what "death" means, rather than any real, documented definitions. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuasipalm_6524.html" title="User:Quasipalm">Quasipalm</a> 20:38, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Human" should be used only in the adjectival sense (i.e. "human or animal fetus") and not in the form of a noun ("unborn human"). Barwick's concern that people don't understand the terms "fetus" and "embryo" is silly, especially when the suggested alternative is actually a lot more confusing, as in, "Those unborn humans who will someday shape our world." I'm not talking about unborn children, here, but rather as-of-yet-unconceived future generations of people. Unborn is a tricky word, as it can also be used in a context which means "future," so pair it with an equally ambiguous word like "human" and you've got a recipe for confusion. I say stick primarily with the technical words.</dd>

<p>forgive me for barging in on the discussion, as i've not participated in it before. but i wonder if it might be of value to the discussion to refer to how *other encyclopedias* open their entries for abortion. for example, the Columbia Encyclopedia, fifth edition (my fave), opens the entry on abortion thusly: <i>abortion, expulsion of the product of conception before the embryo or fetus is viable.</i> my crusty old copy of Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia, fourth edition, opens thusly: <i>Abortion. The explusion of the fetus from the uterus during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy, before it has become capable of separate existence.</i> i'm offering those here only because they may help with finding simplified, or perhap more accurate terminology. if there's interest, i can transcribe the entries in their entirety, pursuant to fair use etc. - they're not terribly long. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 19:31, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Anastrophe, a long time ago we had a look into other encyclopedias, including the Columbia. I can remember your quotation very well, because back then I was wondering how an encyclopedia, apart from winding around with phrases like "the product of conception", could present wrong definitions with "before the embryo or fetus is viable" - that's neither part of the definition of abortion, nor is it so in reality. There are abortions on viable offspring. There is a famous case in Germany of a baby who survived his own abortion. The boy was aborted but still lived and the "doctors" left him to die. Only after a couple of hours did they help the baby. Also, "during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy" is inaccurate to the extreme. I know some people dispute the term "partial birth abortion", but I always thought they opposed "partial birth" and not abortion. So, Anastrophe, your effort is appreciated but this will not help. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 20:02, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>my effort "will not help" only if you choose to ignore it. columbia, van nostrands, britannica, etc, have <i>authority</i>. wikipedia does not. those writing a non-authorititative definition, or formulating wording in that regard, who don't refer to authoritative sources, do so at their own peril. per your 'example', that famous case is what's known as an abberation; typically, aberrations do not play a part in the definition (that's rather *why* they are aberrant). one can argue that there are two things at work there - the *intention* in attempting an abortion, and the *actual* aborting of a fetus. that the baby lived means de facto it was not an abortion, regardless of what the intent was. i guess you simply misunderstood my intent in posting that. i'm not trying to alter opinions, i'm interested in wording. "the product of conception" is a perfectly valid construct - albeit stilted - unless you have some contrary data.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 21:08, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've given it some thought and I've been compelled that Fetal pain is infact a relevant idea. However, I don't think it deserves its own section. I'd like to roll an "effect on the fetus" sentance into each section of the procedures. However, this is a very touchy situation because of the potential for abuse. Or perhaps a section on effects of abortion cross refrenced against time line of fetal development.

<dd>It definitely does not warrant a seperate section. I think we should divide the abortion methods section based upon the trimester and/or week frame within which each method is used. In this manner, we can roll in discussion of fetal pain into the time period in which scientific evidence seems to suggest that such information would be relevant (3rd trimester, probably), and in so doing avoid overgeneralized alarmism. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 20:31, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Problem with that is that no one is sure. General consensus is that at 20 weeks, with minority views ranging from 10 all the way to 24 weeks, the anatomy is there.

<p>I've looked and I seem to have gathered one standing objection and some quiet support for the article move. I've decided to go ahead and try it barring further loud objection so we can see if it works out.

<dd>Second the objection, strongly. As the article is written, it draws a clear distinction between spontaneous and induced abortion, there is a separate miscarriage article for those who are interested in that, and to move the article will simply result in virtually all requests for <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion</a> hitting a redirect or disambig page.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>i also register my objection. KISS principle. abortion, whether induced or spontaneous or whatever, is still abortion. the article is about abortion. the different kinds are clearly described. or are we to believe there's a large population out there that would specifically be entering "induced abortion" into the search field, rather than simply "abortion" - and who would not understand if "abortion" came up as the first hit? <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 21:05, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No confusion on my part. I read all of "Article Move proposal.", menu item 22, as well as followed the link to your example. My objections stand, and I concur with Anastrophe's objections also. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 00:40, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>My objection remains. Does this not fall under "Readers Aren't Stupid: don't lead em by the nose everywhere."? the article is on abortion. the types of abortion are subsets of the article's topic. it simply isn't necessary to split, disambiguate, and lead the reader around by the nose to different articles. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 01:02, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>actually, the idea was to move it so Spontaenues and induced both fork from pregnancy instead of through abortion: Preg--&gt;abort--&gt;Spon(miscarriage) as well as pregnancy--&gt;miscarriage. This is about organizational and definitional accuracy. RAS suggests that readers should be able to keep up with the more accurate structure, not the other way around.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 02:56, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let me put it this way. My reason for the move is similar move Declaration of indpendance to United States Declaration of Idependance, although less clearly cut. Perhaps a more similar example is the hard redirect from Intelligent design theory to intelligent design. Most people hear of it as intelligent design theory, but it in fact is not a theory. Conversly, abortion as used means induced abortion. There is very little to say on totallity of pregnancy failure, all abortions as a whole, so who cares if the redirect page is hit frequently. That happens all the time.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 03:02, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I'd think that the reason for prefering "intelligent design" to "intelligent design theory" as an article title would be NPOV -- the latter, of course, seeming to comment on the subject's veracity. As for the article move, I have warmed up to it since it was first proposed, but I still habour most of the same reservations expressed above. In any case, let's wait 'til we've completed most of the overhaul. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 08:48, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You assume we object to the move because we don't understand your reasons for the move. My main objection to the move is that it will involve a needless redirect.

Many will search for "abortion". <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 16:07, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is very true, because the argument you use against the move is rather similar to my reasoning TO move. The fact is that the abortion article addresses induced abortions. The spontaneus abortion subsection hasn't been touched since I copied/pasted the first paragraph from the miscarriage article. Its dead weight thats necessary for accuracy unless we teir off. Hitting a redirect is hardly a reason to avoid a move, readers hit redirects all the time without noticing.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 17:23, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, let's all take Tznkai seriously for a moment, and commit ourselves to a vote. Do you vote yes, no, or maybe? If "maybe," state why, or upon which conditions a change in vote would be dependent.</p>

<li><b>Wait</b> but leaning toward <b>No</b> I agree with RoyBoy, need input from admins after a stable version.

<li><b>Yes</b>: There is no such thing as a stable version, as the move would create considerable instability ( a change to the intro section and a removal of a section).

By "speaking for others" I meant your repeating of the "votes" of others. There is no reason not to wait the time for those who have left comments to repeat them as they see fit. Yes, it is bad form to remove content because of petty motivation. If you wish however, to accuse me of doing things because of such intentions, you are attacking my character, something seperate from writing this article.

<dd>If that's the case, then every time anyone pastes part of someone's earlier post it would be "speaking for others." Anastrophe is not "speaking" for me, he's just pasting my opinion along with others, clearly given, in a tidy list for easy reference. Anastrophe clearly pasted, as he included timestamps from our sigs, which was very considerate, as it made it easier to find the original entry actually made by the individual. If anyone wants to change their vote, or correct it, they can certainly do so. I'm willing to assume good faith, and if someone accidentally pastes in my name next to an incorrect vote, I'll just fix it and comment that I did and why.</dd>

<p>Tznkai, I admire immensely your high ethical standards and concerns for others. I honestly think you're wasting your efforts here. If no one cares but you, and you make the new list when you archive (keeping the timestamp as did Anastrophe), then <i>you</i> have entered your vote, you've <i>pasted</i> everyone elses, and I for one don't see this as an issue. This is getting silly. Does anyone else care if the short tidy list is pasted *as a brief summary* or *starting point*&#160;? If so, register your objection. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 15:39, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think, deep down, my answer would be "no": given the widely-understood, broader context of the term "abortion," I think even a redirect would be confusing to some. Some might not understand that "induced abortion" is an umbrella term, inclusive of all types of deliberate abortion, surgical, herbal, medicinal, and so forth. The immediate reaction to the page title might be to mistake it for a specific procedure, say, like D&amp;C abortion, saline abortion, or "partial-birth abortion." Of course, I'm getting dangerously close to using an argument that I just spent the last week debunking: "readers are stupid and need to have the truth — ahem — facts bashed into their bomb-shelter-concrete-thick skulls." Chihuahua's proposal, somewhere above, to include information on the health effects of miscarriage (i.e. spontaneous abortion) drives home to me the potential justification for a move. We aren't writing an article about spontaneous abortion, and perhaps, in that regard, an explicit, forced division between the two subjects and their articles would help us to maintain our focus here. In the process of expanding the article, we must also streamline it and remove what isn't immediately pertinent. I say we continue our revision, writing as though an article move were the ultimate goal, and then take it from there once we're done. We've too many irons in the fire. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 23:14, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Herbal abortion: Ethics question.</span></h2>
<p>Kudos to Kyd for a much improved history of abortion subsection. This brings up an ugly ethics question hwoever. As Wikipedia is an encylopedia it is, in one sense, our job to catalogue all information that is worth cataloguing. At the same time, we provide a great deal of information to a lot of people who don't have the patience or wisdom to look at other sources.</p>
<p>The fact that certain herbs are <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisonous.html" title="Poisonous">poisonous</a> or are otherwise suited to inducing an abortion is clear. What is not clear to me is what we do about it. Currently the information is burried in the history of abortion section, but I'm deciding whether or not to include it in the "other methods." My instinct is to, but I want everyone's input first.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 00:46, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Should absolutely be included... can't remember why it was removed before.

<p>Concur with RoyBoy, add to "other methods.

Herbal Abortion</a>. If you need more sources to cite I will add. I don't see where this is an ethics question, am I being terribly dense?

<dd>For herbs the ethics are a little different; as these methods can indeed be dangerous... and to speak of them in detail without proper disclaimers could be viewed as "promotion" of medically unsanctioned methods of abortion. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 01:01, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see the need for "disclaimers" so much as the need for accuracy and proper citing of sources. If we report accurately the high risk of death and serious problems will be in the segment. I *still* don't see how the ethics are different - it sounds suspiciously POV to me. Are you talking about the ethics of including herbal abortions in the article? or about administering them?

<dd><b>Tznkai</b> and all here: I apologise if I in any way seemed to be using NPOV as a "bludgeon" and I am indeed being serious - it seemed to me by responses that I must have been unclear in how I thought NPOV applied, and I was attempting to clarify. That said, No one has as yet told me how leaving out a method of abortion which is common enough to have a Listmania list on Amazon is something Wikipedia should censor from an article which is about abortion. If the issue is that less people know of the risks of herbal abortion, then as mentioned here already by several people, health risks should also be added, which I would expect anyway as the risks are considerable and well documented.</dd>
<dd>If I err, please let me know. If I am ever unclear, ask and I will try to clarify. That said, it really isn't necessary to accuse me twice in one section of the same thing, and out of chronological order, without waiting for me to respond, especially as your second accusation followed immediately after a post which I had begun with "apparently I was unclear". <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 21:37, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I apologize if I came on to strong, but seeing NPOV cited causes a kneejerk reaction after a while. Now as for this, I do not disagree on its notability, and I remind you all I mentioned I was leaning towards including it in the first place. I wished to gauge everyones opinions and thoughts. At any rate, I again bring up the pipe bomb analogy. Pipe bombs are notable. We know what they're made out of. We know how they are prepared. (well, I don't, but Wikipedians do). The question remains <i>should</i> we. Now, pipe bombs are used almost exclusivly for terror and murder, and abortion is not a tool of terrorism generally, but the question of moral and ethical restraint becomes relevant. I'm fine with naming the herbs as long as we classify them as poisons (which they are), but we suggests not including preperations of abortifcant concoctions if we should find them.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 04:44, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I accept your apology, and offer a little suggestion: since WP:POV is so central to keeping Wikipedia from becoming either pro-this or anti-that or schizophrenic, it <i>will</i> be cited. If you are so sensitized that "it sounds suspiciously POV" is taken by you as an accustaion and results in responses like "I'll let that slide this time" then you might need to remember everyone here is just trying to make a better article, and biting usually isn't the way to accomplish this. I would remind you to remember WP:FAITH but you would probably take it ill (minor humor).</dd>

<dd>in what way is the existing image inadequate? The quality of an article is found in the words, not the images at least wrt to contentious political issues, as opposed to articles about French Impressionism. as it stands, this article appears to be a pretty remarkable example of consensus building and compromise, on one of the two or possibly three most contentious topics in popular discourse. i don't see how additional images will illuminate the issue further. The article is less about a medical procedure than it is about a divisive cultural issue. just my 3.14159 cents.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 04:57, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it's not imperative that the article feature images. But images, in conjuction with strong written text, could help to elevate us to Featured Article quality. Here are some obvious things we'd want to avoid:
<ul>
<li>Shock images: Images intended to shock the viewer into a specific conclusion about abortion. No snapshots of aborted fetuses or victims of back-alley abortions. It'd be both indefensibly POV and an affront to good taste.</li>
<li>POV images: Some otherwise neutral images, within the context of the article, could be interpreted as POV. Such as a fetus (I can't think of a pro-choice analogue right now).</li>
<li>Copyrighted images: This should be obvious. Do we want to get sued?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I think the images we select should be thematic. A picture of the medical instruments used to perform an abortion could be used to illustrate "Methods of Abortion," a picture of protesters on boths sides could be used for "Abortion Debate," and so forth. I've spent the last two days searching the internet for something with which to illustrate History (no luck!).

<dd>I don't really feel the need to pull a specific citation on this one. Overdoses are by nature dangerous. Insertion of objects into your body, especially those which are unclean or SHARP is dangerous. Do you have a serious objection that 99.1% of people who can understand that sentance will agree?

<dd>Well, darnit, it *is* obvious, but your question got me looking for a source anyway, so off I went to Morbitity and Mortality Weekly Report, and while they report all kinds of data on abortions, I cannot find anything yet on abortion related deaths.

<dd>Here's what they have: "In 1998 (for which data have not been published previously and the most recent year for which such data are available), nine women died as a result of complications from known legal induced abortion; no deaths were associated with known illegal abortion." This is inconclusive IMHO, elsewhere it is mentioned that people don't necessarily report illegal abortion, and the deaths are not registered as related to illegal abortion. We may not be able to find any reliable information about this. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 19:04, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>that's pretty much what i suspected. it seems intuitive that illegal/unsanitary/extreme measures taken to abort are likely to be more dangerous than legal, sanitary surgical or chemical abortion. illegal abortion implicitly would go unreported in the main. additionally, illegal abortion is rare since roe v. wade (another assumption, but one that seems intuitive). it's the opposite of the 'better reporting' bias that for other maladies can suggest increases in incidence, where in fact it's increased awareness and diagnosis that partly led to higher reported rates (i'm thinking of skin cancer for example). i think this one has to fall to the 'reasonable man/woman' test. removing a mole with a kitchen knife is implicitly more dangerous than having it removed by a physician. unsanitary/illegal abortions (by whatever means) are implicitly more dangerous than abortions performed in a sanitary clinical environment by trained physicians; any reasonable person can understand the overarching principles involved.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 19:34, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure, I can get you urls to decent sources with relevent information, but the issue is, doesn't seem to be any data whatsoever that doesn't come to the same conclusion: Abortion by itself (without other factors) has no discernable effect on mental health. I can find you tons of sources that all say that. I can also document that some early studies which were flawed showed mental health problems resulted, but those have been debunked (if all your abortion cases are underage rape victims, you're probably going to have some therapy that doesn't have a heckuva lot to do with the abortion itself.)

I thought that I said <i>We should mention them, and that they are flawed and why, with proper citations</i> made it clear that I was <i>not</i> suggesting we actually <i>quote</i> statistics we know to be wrong. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 15:46, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>KC, thats better suited to the Abortion Debate article, I'd take it up with them. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> (<a href="../../../t/z/n/User_talk%7ETznkai_cfc0.html" title="User talk:Tznkai">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tznkai_f320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tznkai">contribs</a>) 17:56, 14 November 2005 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>thanks much for the suggestion. I went to <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_debate.html" title="Abortion debate">Abortion debate</a>... IMHO that article could use a "cleanup" tag but with all those people working on it, it would just inflame people. They have questionable assertions with <i>no</i> sources, their "religion" section <i>only</i> deals with Christianity (and its not like its hard to find the Islamic position!), etc, etc. I don't think they need another fish in the fryer right now. I don't really have the spare time to try to help there either, I'm already involved in several articles, and this one (Abortion) has a great group who are really digging in and making progress. Maybe y'all can all trot over there after this one reaches FA status *grin*. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 01:00, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
