<p><b>Webster's Medical dictionary:</b></p>
<p><b>1. the termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely followed by the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a> of the embryo or fetus: a&#160;: spontaneous expulsion of a human fetus during the first 12 weeks of gestation: b&#160;: induced expulsion of a human fetus</b> (214...)</p>
<p>That's great that webster's medical dictionary says that - but that doesn't make it so. As far as we know, scientifically speaking, the embryo is just a bunch of undifferentiated cells - they are nothing - therefore they cannot be dead or alive - they only have the POSSIBILITY of becoming something. The definition used in this article for abortion is extremely POV and anti-choice, for it supports the fact that a death/killing is taking place. Why is nothing being done about this? (Nadsat)</p>
<p>Sorry, Nadsat, but what you provide is not "scientifically speaking", but rather your POV, and a rather extreme POV. (Apart from a rather strange logic: they are something, therefore they are nothing... What!?) Yes, the article gives "the fact that death/killing is taking place". You are right! It is a fact. You might think, that a woman's choice choice should be supreme, that's your POV and you have all the right to your POV. But facts are facts and Webster gives reference to these facts. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 09:17, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, Nadsat was speaking scientifically. That the anti-choice movement happens to be scientifically invalid is hardly Nadsat's fault. I am looking at "Molecular Biology of the Cell", Alberts et al., 3rd Edition (1994), Chapter 21 (pages 1037-1137); "Functional Anatomy of the Vertebrates", Liem et al., 3rd edition (2001), Chapter 4, pages 118-176. And each of those two books has a few pages worth of references to original research on the subject. Nadsat can't help it if pro-lifers don't bother researching embryology. - David Elliott, 9:51am Australian EST, 25/5/05</dd>

<dd>The only part of Nadsat's post that was scientifical, was "the embryo is ... a bunch of undifferentiated cells" (and even that is only true in the beginning). The rest is extreme POV or factually wrong (or both). That you share it, David, is clear - otherwise you wouldn't be complaining and wouldn't use the strange term "anti-choice".</dd>

<dd>His point was valid because factuality is invoked by words like death and killing. Anyone reading such a definition of abortion would be led to a *moral* opinion by the factual presentation, combined with the clear *ommission* of other facts of the definition. A much more rigorously factual presentation would make it clear that death/killing refferred to biological extinction (as opposed to the implication that this is nessecarily the death of a thinking, protectable being - which is *clearly* in dispute). And his description was a very accurate assessment of a human fetus, and the pro-life campaign most certainly attacks abortion of blastocysts. As for my use of the word anti-choice, it is no less problematic than the term "pro-life" (which, as i'm sure you know, was invented for purely superficial reasons, as much as "anti-choice". In any case, anti-choice accurately captures a part of the argument which i happen to support, so i see no problem with using it. It is independant of my scientific opinions either way.).

<dd>So, David, when the facts lead someone to a moral opinion they turn into POV?</dd>
<dd>Death is, first and foremost, a biological fact.</dd>
<dd>Note, that this is only the real short, first line definition. All you want is explained in the entry further down.</dd>
<dd>There are many strange name tags around in this field, but "anti-choice" certainly is the strangest (I know it is used, and you may use it on the talk page all you like, but still it is strange - the problem of course really is the euphemism "choice" without an object). Pro-life at leat is partly appropriate, even though not all opponents of abortion are really pro-life (life in all circumstances). And another difference is, that one was given by one side to themselves, the other one side calling the other side that way.</dd>

<dd>The facts do not lead someone to a moral opinion, their incompleteness does. Maybe i didn't say it clearly enough: Incomplete and innacurately-worded facts could lead someone to the anti-choice position. That's my contention. That's why courts ask you state "the truth" along with "the *whole* truth". Ommission can be as bad (and effective) as a well-put lie, and 'pro-lifers' generate a lot of fluff regarding early-stage abortions by conflating biological and popular definitions of life, by ommitting accurate descriptions of embryology.</dd>
<dd>As for everything i want being explained further down, i don't think it is at all. I can't see any mention of the scientific argument that pro-lifers are in many cases in the position of "defending" something that shows no cognitive or relevant structural differences from bacteria, algae, or even sperm and ova.</dd>

<dd>Str1977, i think you're getting confused here: i made no secret of the fact that i was using a popular definition of life - i was saying that you (and others) confused this popular definition with the biological definition. This confusion advances the pro-choice argument via a logical error (or a deception (i.e. a "bait-and-switch" argument)). Hence, it is an unacceptable form of POV violation. - David, 5:27pm AEST 29/5/2005</dd>

<dd>Yes, I know. 'living', 'human' and 'death' are just facts. There is nothing wrong with stating these - and everything wrong with trying to tone these down. The opening paragraph is no place for argument, apart from the fact that the "undifferentiated-bunch-of-cells" is only true for the very first stages of "embryohood" (and I think embryo - together with the link - does the trick).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It is not a viable solution to put the arguments in the top paragraph, that's exactly why it is not done. The undifferentiated-bunch-of-cells stage is when abortions usually take place.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 12:41, 25 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Wait: The undisputed Alan Gutmacher Institute facts are that virtually <b>no abortion is performed until woman suspects she is pregnant - which is long after the "undifferentiated cells" or blastocyst" phase.</b> Lets stop arguing silliness - the embryo is alive and is killed, or else there is not an abortion. <b>Abortion requires killing a living embryo or fetus, regardless of whether you ascribe any value to that embryo.</b> Its simple biology and medicine.
<dl>
<dd>From what I know pro-choice argues that an <i>embryo</i> is an undifferentiated bunch of cells with no brain. The Embryo-stage goes until the 9th or 12th week, then it is called a fetus. Abortion laws usually allow abortions within the first two and a half or three months because during this stage the embryo (or early fetus) is a bunch of cells with no brain which is a medical fact (without any further ethic interpretation added) and it is a majority opinion in western society that this argument is valid. That's why it's a law in most countries. Three months is usually also the point in time when brain development beginns. And most abortions happened before that (if there are laws allowing abortion; if abortion is forbidden just as many abortions happen, but at a later stage on average).--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 08:27, 28 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Substantial differentiation occurs DURING the embryo phase. And by the end of week 8 the embryo is a fetus with many organs fully functioning. See the Webster's Medical Dictionary definitions posted above. Regardless, the embryo and fetus is human and alive, and must be killed for there to be an abortion, according to the medical definition of induced abortion (the main topic of this article). The biology here is not at issue. A living human organism exists. Abortion is the killing of that organism to rid the mother of having to carry it. Why is there an attempt to hide that medical fact?
<dl>
<dd>The biology - or, rather, your formulation of it - is certainly at issue - the embryo may be "human" and "alive", but it is not "human" and "alive" by popular/ethical/philosophical notions of what humanity and life mean. Refusing to acknowledge this biological fact is mistaken at best, and <b>a deceptively unnacceptable "bait-and-switch" argument at worst</b>. This is what we have been trying to get through.</dd>
<dd>And for the record, anti-abortionists most certainly campaign for the "rights" of blastocysts, and the "rights" of 0-12 week old embryos just as often (actually, i would say more often) than anything older than that, so the undifferentiated nature of a blastocyst is most definitely pertinent to the question of political POV. This is an article on abortion, and the abortion of brainless lumps of cells is relevant, and its ommission biases the hypothetically 'innocent' reader toward pro-life via misinformation. - David, 5:36pm AEST 29/5/2005</dd>

<p>Nasdat, your comment that Webster's medical dictionary has a anything but a fact-based POV strains credulity. And by the way, <b>cells can be alive (such as cancer cells), cells can die, and cells can be killed.</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Why should it strain credulity? Webster was written by humans, the same as anything else. Presumably they have opinions that may have influenced what they wrote. The fact that someone in a more authoritative position than you wrote a definition that agrees with you means little when there is very obviously a considerable opposing view. Wikipedia talk pages are not a forum for you to argue your position, however well-supported, they are a place to discuss changes to the article, which must be neutral. The fact that people oppose some of your changes <i>ipso facto</i> makes them not neutral. You cannot tell the other side what is neutral since the definition of neutral is something both sides accept. <a href="../../../d/o/p/User%7EDopefishJustin_bbf5.html" title="User:DopefishJustin">DopefishJustin</a> <a href="../../../d/o/p/User_talk%7EDopefishJustin_562f.html" title="User talk:DopefishJustin">(・∀・)</a> 19:27, May 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but Str1977, (and 214... below) you are conflating "life" in the popular sense of the word and "life" in the biological sense of the word. Websters dictionary is using life in the biological sense, by which standard the fetus is alive (just like a bacterium). The biological definition of life is very different from the popular definition, otherwise you'd feel guilty about taking antibiotics. This discussion about Websters is *obscuring* an underlying disagreement which *should* be illuminated by the wiki entry. - David Elliott, 9:51am Australian EST, 25/5/05</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>To 214..., Nadsat, and Str1977: We may all benefit from looking into the article <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life.html" title="Life">life</a>. This may not be a straightforward issue, from any POV. In any case, it would likely do us well to consider using more specific terminology, as "life" certainly carries along much ambiguity, unless the article <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life.html" title="Life">life</a> is to be completely revised... (Djbaniel) 14:52, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regarding "life": the living human organism with unique DNA known as <b>an embryo is the very same organism when it is labeled a fetus and later a nenonate, infant, toddler, pre-teen, adolsecent, and adult</b>. It is <b>alive</b> that entire time. By the definition on the <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life.html" title="Life">life</a> page, the embryo is a living human organism. 214.13.4.151</p>

<dd>Again, it is a lie to claim that a healthy embryo or fetus is not a living human organism, and to consider it somehow "biologically incorrect" to explain that the medical purpose of this (overwhelmingly elective) surgery is to end that life (regardless of whether you ascribe any value to that living organism), thereby ending the pregnancy. Pregnancy is most typically the normal biological state of having a living human embryo or fetus inside oneself as a result of sexual intercourse. The pregnancy ends when that living embryo or fetus dies or is born. Why is it biologically incorrect to put it in such plain unemotional terms? It is clearly POV to use euphemisms that hide the medical and bological reality. <b>"Terminating a pregnancy" is an empty term that gives no hint at what an abortion is - after all child-birth is also the termination of pregnancy!</b> Is there a reason that the physical biological medical reality of abortion is to be <b>hidden</b>? 214.13.4.151</dd>

<dd>214..., as above, your argument obscures the actual disagreement - the conflation of biological life with popular ideas of life as "sentience". The article should make this distinction clear... David Elliott, 9:51 AEST 25/5/05</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will not give you my view on this because it does not matter. What matters is to find a viable definition for this text. One that does not contain arguments of the pro-life-side (living human) or arguments of pro-choice (just an accumulation of cells with no brain yet). When the cells become a living human person is pov. By leaving out 'living' we are avoiding to make a statement on the issue. --<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 15:53, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Fenice; the point here is that we need to develop a NPOV first sentence (that's truly all we're talking about here). The problem here is that bias is unfortunately unavoidable in a passionate argument – not because one side will triumph over the other but because everyone has their own view of what “death” “life” “cells” and “embryo” mean to them. Some people see “life” as a set of chemical reactions that enable an organism to interact with it’s environment, while others view “life” as an incredible, unfathomable gift from God (Note: I’m not trying to make a value judgment. I’m just pointing out different views.). Therefore, any treatment of the word “life” will be struck down as being POV. It’s a given. The most NPOV thing we come up with will be debated. What we need to do is to come up with an answer that most people will reasonably agree with (optimally, a definition in which people from both sides will agree fits in with their understanding of the term).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, we have a responsibility of being as forthright as we possibly can about the topic (in David Elliott’s words, “the *whole* truth”). This leads to two heated arguments over the action (is it “killing”/“death” or is it “removal”/“termination”) and the entity (is it “alive”/“unborn child” or is it “unthinking”/“a collection of cells”).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The entity debate (“alive”/“cells”) brings up the interesting issue of “alive.” In common usage, “life” is more of a spectrum. We can’t help thinking that people we interact with are somehow more “alive” than trees and bacterium. Part of this is that “alive” is often paired with “conscious.” People are clearly alive; rocks are clearly dead: the question is whether it’s misleading to label a set of growing, developing cells “alive.” Since I generally view bacterium as being alive, it is <b>my opinion</b> that a developing zygote is alive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with putting “alive” in the definition is that people may associate it with “conscious.” The zygote might be viewed as “sleeping” to a reader if it were called “alive”. The fact is it’s not quite “sleeping,” but almost there (it hasn’t developed the capacity yet). Therefore, “life” is a tricky issue. <b>It isn’t wrong but it may be misleading.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Likewise, there debate over the action (“killing”/“termination”) requires caution. We are biased to see death as the (often violent) end to a conscious life. Therefore, “death” brings the same problem that “life” did a paragraph before. There is a natural bias to the word.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Don’t get me wrong - the same arguments can be drawn with “cells” and “termination.” “Cells” might hint at bias that puts a soon-to-be child on par with bacterium. “Termination” compares the ending of a (possible) fruitful life to carrying out an action.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I like “termination” a lot better than “death.” The reason for it is that “termination” is often related with death (much like “execution” which actually might be a pretty good choice). I see it as middle ground in this debate.</dd>

<dd>Interesting comments. I note that the requirment for the "death" of a "human" embryo or fetus is how Webster's Medical Disctionary describes it (re-posted below). This is medical/biological fact. The POV comes in when people want to hide this medical fact.</dd>

<dd>214, why is it that you want to hide the biological and medical *fact* that when Websters Medical Dictionary says death, <b>it does NOT mean the same thing that we mean when we argue that a death is ethically wrong?</b> This is dishonest, and medically and biologically inaccurate.

<dd>Dear David,</dd>
<dd>since you keep on repeating it, let me address your mantra:</dd>
<dd>you are accusing 214... and me of conflating a "purely biological death with what you call &gt;&gt;popular ideas of life as "sentience"&lt;&lt;</dd>
<dd>In the opening paragraph only the bare necesseties are mentioned, it is giving the "technical description" and the biological fact of death, which however is the basis for the moral arguments discussed further down or elsewhere. (In other words: if there were no death involved, there'd no debate.)</dd>
<dd>You are declaring "popular ideas" identify life with sentience". Is this your view? It isn't mine and it isn't NPOV.</dd>
<dd>You say: "thing that we mean when we argue that a death is ethically wrong".</dd>
<dd>Who is <i>we</i>?</dd>
<dd>Again it's your POV. You are saying abortion is not ethically wrong, so the death involved can only be a mere biological function and can not be ethically wrong. (Apart from the thing that it's not the death, but the killing that's ethically wrong.)</dd>
<dd>Basically, you are arguing that the opening paragraph should have a disclaimer, saying: "death - yes, it's death, but only biologically, so there's nothing wrong about it, since we argue so.</dd>

<p>Wow. I have not been on this talk page in awhile and we have quite the discussion going here. I'd like to say a few things. First and foremost here is a definition from The American Heritage Dictionary that might knock all of you off of your rockers(except for David (and any others) who I would like to thank for your sanity).</p>

<dd>comment from another: inclusion of the term "viable" in the definition is simply inaccurate legally, medically, and factually - and therefore totally inappropriate on wikipedia (partial-birth abortions are legally performed in the USA on perfect and viable unborn children up until the moment before natural birth - yes, even a pre-born at 9 months - for any reason, including a mother changing her mind as to whether the child is wanted). In light of this reality, "viability" simply will not be part of any wikipedia definition definition - although it certainly is appropriate for the article to point out that it is thought that most abortions occur before viability.</dd>

To me the above definition is more NPOV. I can't respond to all the arguments that were made against me on this page, but feel free to bring them up again because I think the main ones in favor of the current definition (which I maintain is extremely POV) got lost due to this incredibly long discussion. One could say viable just means incapable of living outside of the uterus - which people no matter which camp you are from (pro-choice, anti-choice etc.) can agree that the embryo is NOT capable of living outside of the uterus.</p>
<p><br />
Someone said if there was no death there would be no debate - but that IS precisely what the debate is about. Whether a death occurs or not. Science - yes SCIENCE - biology - MEDICINE - all that jazz - maintains that when the pregnancy is terminated due to abortion it is in the first trimester of pregnancy when the embryo is just a mass of undifferentiated cells - the other side, which seems irrational to mean - for how can one argue with science? ...but anyways... the other side would maintain that somehow a death occurs. The whole argument is whether a death occurs or not. So let us stear clear of the term DEATH!</p>

<p>I vote for my American Heritage Dictionary definition to be used. I am trying to be NPOV - I realize I will not convert any of you over to my belief and that is fine I am not trying to. Fenice and others what do you think of this definition?</p>
<p>Also, THIS HAS <b>NOTHING</b> TO DO WITH THE NPOV/POV DEBATE, BUT JUST TO ANSWER AN INITIAL QUESTION: I use anti-choice because I believe pro-life is a propaganda term. I am not anti-life - I think life is wonderful, afterall I am alive right now aren't I? So to me it comes down to pro-choice or anti-choice. I know people who think birth begins at conception but they are pro-choice because they realize that if one takes away a woman's reproductive rights over her body you practically sell her body and life to the State. That is my very simplified version of that. But I just wanted to clarify.</p>

<dd>comment: there are no neutral terms, so the terms used are the terms each side chooses to use for itself. "Pro-choice" is certainly a manufactured political term, too. The "choice" is hidden - the choice is abortion. But "Pro-abortion" is avoided because everyone knows human abortion is bloody and violent (even if it is a just a mass of cells) - and not something for which to advocate. People who want good education opportunities for all are happy to be labeled "pro-education", but people who want good abortion services run like heck away from the term "pro-abortion". And those who oppose abortion are in fact very accurately described as "anti-abortion" (a term they often embrace in their literature). The only group hiding behind a label are the ones who refuse to mention the word "abortion", as if it were a dirty word.</dd>

<p>Oh, and also whoever stated "ummm Nadsat...like DUH cells can be alive" - obviously, but we're not talking about just any cells and I never mentioned whether the cells were alive or not I just said they were - undifferentiated - which means they are not anything; they just have the POTENTIAL of being something. So the argument you were trying to formulate was heavily flawed and did not make much sense.</p>

<p>Who destroyed my comments - this section is sort of hard to follow right now because of the way you answered what I wrote AND at least sign your name so I know who to address.</p>
<p>Okay, your statement that the term viable is NOT inaccurate legally, medically etc. is just ridiculous. You then proceeded to talk about partial-birth abortions - which are perhaps .102938123% of abortions (don't quote me on that - yes I'm exaggerating) my point is that, those type of abortions are miniscual this page and the definition we wish to generate for the term abortion is about the MAJORITY of abortions - that occur in the 1st trimester of pregnancy BEFORE THE FETUS IS VIABLE!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Be that as it may, but it is not part of the definition of abortion that the fetus is not viable.<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 22:45, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, most partial-birth abortions occur when the mother's health is at serious risk - as in having the baby would result in her death. Anyways, although this has nothing to do with the article - just to respond to more personal attacks you made - I would not support partial-birth abortions just because - only when health of the mother is at a serious risk etc. So what you said didn't really apply.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What I don't understand is how a woman's live can be saved by doing "partial birth", while "full birth" would kill her. I'm seriously asking. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 22:45, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>And I'll be reasonable - and say that the term viable is perhaps a controversial one - because that is what the whole debate is about - but anyways - it is not wrong factually; it is in a dictionary and accepted by most of the medical profession as the correct term.</p>
<p>Viable belongs on wikipedia WAY MORE then - the <i>death of the fetus</i> - does! My god. You are certainly an unreasonable being.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "death of the fetus" is certainly part of abortion. Viability isn't (see above) <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 22:45, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Look the reason pro-abortion is not used is because it's not like all those who are pro-choice LOVE abortions - oh yes we want more, we want more! Let me tell you. I personally dream about them at night. (In the previous statements: HEAVY sarcasm should be detected) It's the fact that we (pro-choicers) do not believe - that people - ESPECIALLY MEN - should have the right to tell a woman what to do with her body. And because we do not wish to sell a woman's body to the State. And because we think that if you take away a woman's reproductive rights you take away the control she has over her life and health. And for many more reasons. That's why pro-abortion isn't used. If there was another way to get rid of the UNDIFFERENTIATED CELLS then perhaps we would all like that instead. We're not particularly fond of abortions, we're fond of CHOICE. Get it?</p>
<p>And I do not consider myself anti-life. I like life. Life = good. I think pro-life is a term that was manufactured to make women feel like murderers; which it was. Anyways.</p>

<p>Dear Fenice,</p>
<ul>
<li>The morning-after pill is often portrayed as a method of abortion, whether correctly or incorrectly, so there is a reason for including a link to it on this page. I took care to formulate it so that the line does distinguish between RU, an undisputed abortifacient, and the MAP, where there is controversy. The question can and is dealt with over there at the MAP page. Why remove the link?</li>
</ul>
<p>'PS. Someone else is changing my wording too. Isn't that evidence that mine is a tangible compromise?</p>

</li>
<li>How does "the abortion debate focuses on the right of the prospective mother" (as opposed to the father, dealt with in the paragraph) differ from "the abortion debate is cast in terms that limit rights over the abortion decision to the prospective mother"? - This paragraph is about the rights of the father (paternal) not about any limitation of supposed rights.
<ul>
<li>Actually now that I think about it both versions imply that the mother has a right to decide over abortion, which is not true in most western industrialized countries. Since the entire section is really about paternal rights, why don't we leave this sentence out alltogether.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 15:25, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Anonymous user: the religious-tolerance link offers conclusory opinions (POV) about the interpretation of Christian scriptures - and concludes that most abortions would not be prohibited or sinful according to its interpretation of Christian scripture. Biblical interpretation is inherently POV.</p>
<p>-Fetus-</p>
<p>Str1977 - Using the word 'living' to describe a fetus (in the first sentence) is POV. Just as using the phrase 'non-living fetus' would also be POV. So just leave it as 'fetus'. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> 11:31, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anonymous user: actually, a dead fetus is never aborted, though many fetuses do die in the womb, the procedure to remove them from the uterus is not an abortion - thus, medically speaking, only a live fetus or embryo can be aborted.</p>
<p>While it is true that "Dilation/Extraction" is the term for extracting a "dead" fetus, the term "living" comes from the non-NPOV stance that fetuses are alive. The term "living" does not add anything but POV in this context. <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptadecagram_a436.html" title="User:Heptadecagram">Liam Bryan</a> 01:29, 2005 May 12 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anon: Tumors, like fetuses, are alive/living/growing. Doctors perform medical procedures to kill/destroy and then remove them. NPOV.</p>
<dl>
<dd>By that argument, a surgeon who removes a tumor is a murderer. That's just silly. Tumors aren't alive, the person is alive. Similarly, a lot of people believe that a fetus is not alive. That's a point of view, and so leaving the word 'living' out removes any POV ambiguities. It doesn't lean either way. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> 09:09, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hold on - Killing a living thing (bacteria, geranium, tumor or ant - and some would say fetus) is not murder. But it is killing, nevertheless. Kelling does not equal murder. An abortion requires the deliberate killing of the fetus, in fact, it is considered malpractice to not kill the fetus prior to removing it from the woman's body. And it is not considered an abortion for a doctor to remove a dead fetus from a woman's body. This is factual, if unpleasant, information. NPOV</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not arguing with you there. But the labelling of an embryo / fetus as living is inherently POV, surely? Also please sign your comments with four tildes. (Like this: <i>~~~~</i>) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> 09:32, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>There is no deliberately induced abortion (the subject of this entry) unless there is a deliberate killing of the fetus. A woman can have a dead or living fetus in her body. Only living fetuses need to be aborted.</b></p>
<p>This argument stems from a moral or religious belief about when conception or life occurs, just because you "believe" that a fetus has what you consider "life" doesn't make it so. That is why if you were put in a situation faced with an unwanted or unexpected pregnancy, you have the choice to decide not to have an abortion, a choice that should be made based on personal beliefs by the person(s) in the situation (that is why abortion is protected as a choice to be decided by the people responsible for the pregnancy, not by a government agency or any other person who is not; 1. pregnant 2. a contributing partner to the pregnancy). Moral beliefs / (moral) judgements have no place in a forum of imformation. Since science can not prove when "life" begins, when "conciousness" is achieved, the word "living" should only be applied to organic beings that are able to sustain life without a "host body" or that are in gestation (utero). If you morally object to abortion then that is your right, as it is another's right to morally support it. Words that imply something that is unknowable by scientific means should not be included in a informational forum. since we can not scientifically prove that what a fetus experiences is "life" as in the organic definition of such, no matter what spiritual beliefs you hold this is why spirituality and science are seperated until spiritual beliefs can be proven on scientific grounds they shall continue to be seperate, and the word "living" as in "living fetus" should be avoided while conveying facts and information on this topic, it is a moral, religious, or semantic issue and should be brought up and discussed in forums of moral, religious, or semantic debate, not one where clear and scientifically provable information is being conveyed. And if the definition of abortion is the removal of a embryo or fetus from a woman's body during the gestational period, then a "deceased" ( I use this word for lack of a better word and hesitantly since it implies that prior "life" existed) fetus or embryo can most definately have a need to be aborted. If a fetus or embryo is found to have no organic function and has not "survived" (hesitantlty yet again) inside the woman's womb, "a deliberately induced abortion" and abortive procedures is and are "needed" and necessary to protect the health of the woman. Also, medical and dictionary definitions have been and will continuely be changed and amended over the years to incorporate newly discovered information and changes in our knowledge as a people. But until the key to the origin of life is discovered you can not difinitively state that an embryo or fetus is living until the point at which it is capable of being without reliance of anothers body to sustain it's being. I can already guess the argument to this will sound something like "but a newborn can not survive without the care and attention of another person to feed, shelter and love the child so is a newborn by your definition not alive? ... ect." No a newborn is alive by this definition, let me cut this off at the pass by saying what I mean by the capability to sustain life independent of another body is the ability of the body to independently function i.e, biologically and chemically function without relying on another person, the ability for the being's organs, bodily processes, and functions to independently operate without being in the womb. Without a mothers womb a fetus would have no heartbeat therefore the ability to sustain is provided by the mother, not the fetus, it can not be sustained independently of her. - Sarah (one question, i dont do this much and dont understand the terms POV and npov.. point of value maybe? let me know someone... thanks)</p>

<dd>I agree with proto and there is also another factor: at the time the doctor terminates the pregnancy there is no way of knowing if the embryo isn't already dead and a miscarriage would have followed at some point. Abortions are usually carried out early in the pregnancy when the risk of the embryo dying off is still high.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 09:52, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Living does belong there, several states have laws that if an abortion goes wrong and results in a live birth it must then receive proper medical care. Obviously this is not applicable to stillbirths and using the word "fetus" by itself is not specific. By living they did not mean that it is human but rather that it has a heartbeat, brainwaves and still has the potential to one day be fully viable. 67.77.73.78</p>
<p>In the Health risks section, under physical health, the sentence "women who had had an abortion were 40 percent more likely to have a very pre-term delivery" is bolded. While I believe the conclusions of the report should be included, the emphasis leads to a POV.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Feminism section</span></h2>
<p>Dear IP, The section "feminism" should actually include information on <i>feminism</i>. <i>Pro-Life-info</i> goes under the heading of "pro-life". If you wish, you can insert the pro-life-info I just removed in the pro-life section. For a detailed description of the meaning of the term Feminism <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">click here</a>--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 08:06, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is POV to deny pro-life women the ability to label themselves as feminists. The star of the most popular sit-com in the nation is a vocal member of Feminists fo Life.</p>
<ul>
<li>you've got it!!!!! <b>label</b> is the right term--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 09:04, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no authority that can claim to define who holds feminist views. In light of this, and the fact the Feminists for Life is absolutely fighting to improve the condition of women, it is inherently POV to allow only certain groups to be described by that term.</p>
<p><b>From the "mission" page of Feminists For Life: "If you believe in the strength of women and the potenetial of every life, if you refuse to choose between women and children, if you believe no woman should be forced to choose between pursuing her education and career plans and sacrificing her child, if you reject violence and exploitation, join us in challenging the staus quo, becuase women deserve better choices." It continues: "FFL recognizes that abortion is a relfection that our society has failed to meet the needs of women. We are dedicated to systematically elminating the root causes that drive women to abortion"</b></p>
<p>Sounds like advocacy for better conditions for all women - sounds like classic feminism - in the style of Susan B. Anthony.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you know when Susan B. Anthony died?? _ in 1906.
<ul>
<li>Karl Marx died in 1883, but like Susan B. Anthony his ideas are still relevant to a movement he helped establish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Violence and even some forms of exploitation are criminal offences in most western countries. Most people in our society say that they reject violence and exploitation. This is not a feminist characteristic. Feminists typically deal with such things as giving women the same job oportunities as men and an equal share in wealth. If you read further you will find out that what they mean by root causes are the treatment of pregnant women in our society. Even I was disappointed that they hardly go any further - supporting women who already have children is underrepresented on this site - even though the problems of women with children add to what they call root problem in a much more drastic way.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 16:33, 12 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But violence in the womb against the fetal child - that too is violence. Abortion is always violent in that it always kills a unique human being - and often it is overtly and undeniably violent because the method of abortion is simply painful to both the mom and baby. Some feminissts reject such violence as any sort of solution or form of eqaulity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>It is not about relevance but about time and misrepresentation of facts.

<p>Dear IP - please do not add nonsensical remarks like this <i>***other things that feminists support are not relevant in this line - already covered above.</i> because they can even be considered vandalism, but are at least obviously disruptive.<br />
Maybe the sentence means you have some kind of trouble understanding the content of this section? Let me explain: It is of the absolute essence to mention that most women don't particularly enjoy their rights being infringed on in any way, as it happens by abortion laws. If you eliminate this statement it would be as if I tried to delete from the pro-life-section that pro-lifers think that the fetus is a living human being. It is also false to claim that all feminists want a right to abortion - some are content with abortion laws.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 10:51, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Fenice, I don't think it's appropriate to divide the Feminism article into Historic Feminism and Feminism Today, and if it were, Feminists For Life belong into the second section, since they are a thing of the present, not of the past. Unfortunately, you seem to be pushing your POV that FFL are not "real" feminists and want to relegate into some "Historic Feminism" museum section. You say: "Feminists today oppose limitations of women's rights" - Yes, that's right. I guess that's the (or at least some) definition of feminism, but I think that includes FFL. The difference is over what women's rights are and what they encompass and what they don't. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 15:03, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Concerning the omission of limitation of rights: No there is _absolutely_no_ difference about what women's rights are, not even the extremist extremist within the pro-life-group would claim that. I think an outsider view like that that does not respect the constitutions of just about any western nations in this world just doesn't need to be considered here. And then I'd like to see a source for that.</dd>
<dd>Concerning Feminists for life: Look at the website of this formation and try to find the <i>slightest</i> bit of evidence that they could actually be fighting for the equlity of women. You will see that they aren't even trying to pretend. You will find a single link called 'Womens equality in the work place' - it leads to nowhere except to a registration form, that is there is no text on this issue on that site. The rest of what they in some places on their site call a fight for womens rights is that they say they help pregnant women (Don't we all?). This is by no means feminism. You will also find in some of their press statements that they believe pro-life and feminism were essentially the same thing, two sides of the same coin. The only thing that ties them to feminism is that they claim they are in the tradition of early feminists (which they are by no means, I think). Even the person who originally placed this advertisement in the text admitted that its just a label.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 15:26, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>The definition of Feminism is not limited to your POV. FFL is for the empowerment of women by ensuring they are not pressured to treat their fetal child as if it were disposable (as countless thousands of women on campus are pressured each year) or pressured into killing their unborn child in order to get an education and develop a career. Your POV cannot accept that this is one brand of feminism.</b></p>

<dd>Concerning your reproach that I am pushing my POV: The insertion of this club <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminists_for_life.html" title="Feminists for life">Feminists for life</a> is advertisment, promotion. It's a minor organization that does not represent the majority view of the pro-life-movement. Within the scope of this text, it should be left out. Actually, the entire discussion on the debate about abortion doesn't belong here. There should only be a short paragraph on the debate in this article because there's a separate article on the debate. Still I did not kick it out and even placed it in the early feminist section after discussion, as a compromise. To claim that I am pushing my POV is not even sad, it's almost funny.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 15:37, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>There definitely is disagreement about what rights a woman can legitimately claim and what rights she can't.</i><br />
Not in western countries. The situation you are describing is usually criminal in Europe and the US. In these countries there are laws that grant womwn the same rights as men. I am not saying we have to ignore the unfortunate dispute you describe, but tell us what country that is and we will put something like "In western industrialized countries womens rights are not limited, but in .....(whichever one you are going to tell us) the situation is different."--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 16:06, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me explain: "Pro-choice" feminists consider it a woman's right to abort their child. Pro-life feminists don't consider this a right a woman can claim - that's the difference, regardless of country or hemisphere. Laws don't mean anything in that debate. I don't think an Irish "Pro-choice" feminist will waive her claim to this supposed right, neither does an American Pro-life feminist will agree this to be a right. Either will disagree with the currently existing laws and argue their point. Either will say, they oppose limitations on women's rights. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 17:07, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't agree with that, and then: this is the feminism section we discuss, not pro-life and pro-choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>First: Pro-choice and pro-life are american terms. no such groups exist in central Europe, not at that scale anyway. Pro-life is much more identified with a church stance. And I am pretty sure pro-life does want laws to prohibit abortion in the US. Feminists (including of course the historic feminists) are the group who changed the situtation in such a way that I can say today: laws grant us equal rights. This is the reason why I think it fits in this section. Then again: an even better place to have the sentence "Abortion laws limit womens right to self-determination" is the introduction to the debate-paragraph. Because that is the core issue of the pro-life and pro-choice debate. Both will agree that women have the right to self-determination. But Pro-lifers argue that the embryo is a person and therefore has the same constitutional rights as everybody else, in this case, the right to life. Pro-lifers then claim that the right to life weighs more than the right to self-determination. Because everybody agrees that women have a right to self-determination, this means that abortion laws limit that right.</p>
<p>Not all feminists argue for a right to abortion. Most believe that the realistic possibility to have a legal abortion within the first three months is sufficient whether they have a right to it or not. And others believe that the Canadian situation is ideal: no laws on abortion at all. --<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 17:54, 12 May 2005 (UTC) By 'legal' abortion I mean that it is not punished by law.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 17:57, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fenice, "Not all feminists argue for a right to abortion." That's the point of groups like FFL, if you think them credible or not. Still there are difference of what women's rights are comprised of. Those pro-choice include abortion, those pro-life don't. If there is any other group I didn't think of, they have their view too. If some one wants to have a "realistic possibility to have a legal abortion" that IMO means they think that is covered by their rights. (By right I didn't mean that you can sue someone for it, but that you are free to do it.) Or they just don't think about rights at all. And the Canadian situation, as you describe it, is the same. No law means it is legal, doesn't it. Anyway, there is difference of opinion among feminists, as you yourself state, but IMO no difference about that women's rights should be upheld. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 22:24, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Basically the misunderstanding is the following: you are trying to tell me that peoples opinion about what <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rights.html" title="Rights">rights</a> are is quite incoherent. Thats fine, but just isn't the issue here. (So I won't comment on that for now, also it belongs into the article <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right.html" title="Right">right</a>). This here is about <i>civil</i>, constitutional rights of course, I thought that goes without saying. I will add civil to the phrase then.<br /></dd>
<dd>And of course if you want to add something about your more eclectic concept of the term <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right.html" title="Right">right</a> to the text, to this text, <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> I mean, we can go on disscussing it.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 06:41, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It certainly isn't my ecclectic concept. Just what I observe. My concept is really more "one package". But the real problem with your edit is this: "Feminists today oppose limitations of women's civil right of self determination ..." So Feminists yesterday didn't oppose limitations of women's civil rights, did they? Is that what you're saying? I think that's unjust to the Early feminists. "Support for women's rights" is not something that changed recently - it's rather the fundament of feminism. I have no objection with including some sentence about women's rights (never mind the civil), but it should include either stage of feminism. And again your banishing FFL out of the present - contrary to reality. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 07:02, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I said, I do not mind your concept. It's not unrealistic. It's just not what this is about. (If you have a problem in that direction, make a sentence and post it here, we will probably be able to include other concepts of <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right.html" title="Right">right</a> in the text.) By the way, if you are opposed to one word in a text (today) I do suggest it would be a lot easier to simply cancel it. Your constant reverting is just not good style.</dd>
<dd>Also, might I just add that it is really quite absurd (misleading?)to say in talk that you are not opposed to sentence and to delete it at the same time.</dd>
<dd>And: no, I do not oppose the adding of "early feminists oppose limitations of civil rights" to the section on early feminsm. (??Are you serious??) Go ahead.</dd>
<dd>For now, let us just put <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminists_for_life.html" title="Feminists for life">Feminists for life</a> in their own section.

<dd>Unfortunately, I haven't been able to come up with a possible wording to include this where you'd have put it. A possibility would be to either include a reference to OLWR or to include one for feminism in general, though that's really stating the obvious, but if you want to, so be it.</dd>

<dd>Str1977 - we still don't communicate right. If I tell you, I am talking about civil rights it's quite absurd to tell me: "No you're not". As I said above, I am talking about civil, constitutional rights here. They are of the absolute essence. If you wantto include anything further that is your idea, not mine.</dd>
<dd>Google came up with about 1500 hits for this term OLWR - the first one was this: 'Office of Land and Water Resources', which accounts for the first 30 or so results and it is also a German title 'Oberlandwirtschaftsrat' (a farming expert) - there are hundreds. The search OLWR and feminism turned out <i>a single</i> result on the google test. So I am opposed to including that.</dd>
<dd>I think you are actually trying to claim that feminists don't support equal civil rights for women. But that there is only some weasel discussion going on about what women's rights could be perceived as by different groups. I do not deny that there a weasel discussions and eclectic views on this subject. But the core issue no one (except for you, so thas actually no one but one) would deny is that rights means at least the constitutional rights.

<dd>Since no solutions have been offered by str1977, and str1977 also declined a separate paragraph, there is another possiblity to secure an accurate representation of the facts. A separate paragraph could be written on the heretical sociological phenomenons like Feminsts for life. There is also a group called Catholics for a free choice. Both could be dealt with under the heading of "Organizations with an atypical stance on the issue".--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 09:51, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Fenice, IMO it doesn't matter whether the rights we dicuss are constitutional or civil. I'm not trying to claim that feminists don't support equal civil rights for women. Let me explain: Some feminists see abortion as a right, others don't. Yet both are feminists and both oppose limitations of women's rights (= OLWR, sorry I didn't explain). The same holds true for feminists of the past and of the present, hence it's unfair to include the OLWR statement only with the latter. As for modesty - I oppose erasing FFL from the fold of "feminists today", since they are feminists of today. You or pro-choice feminists might consider them heretics to the cause, but there is no authority that can legitimately deny them the term "feminist" (that's the difference to Catholics for a free choice) <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 20:06, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm satisfied with the current wording, as of 19.42 - May 14 <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 20:09, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear str1977,</p>
<ul>
<li>again: if I am saying I am talking about civil and constitutional rights, I am talking about civil and constitutional rights. Telling me I'm not is blatant nonsense, isn't it?</li>
<li>and, as I said, again: put the statement you want about 'early feminists opposing limitations of womens constitutional right to self-determination' in the early feminism-section. It is a waste of time to ask that again, when I have already told you to go ahead.</li>
<li>again: the term OLWR is absolute nonsense and your private invention - leave it out.</li>
<li>again: Who sees what as a right other than a constitutional right, I don't care, produce a text or something and post it on talk if you want to add that.</li>
<li>again: if you oppose having a separate pro-life-feminism-section for feminists for life, you should actually argue that on the talk page.</li>
</ul>
<p>--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 22:37, 14 May 2005 (UTC) Any questions?</p>
<p>Allright Fenice, I'll try to make myself understood again:</p>
<ul>
<li>again: I'm not telling you what you are talking about - the thing is just that this is not our disagreement.</li>
<li>I think it nonsensical to include such statement in every paragraph, when in fact it fits for all.</li>
<li>the term OLWR is my invention, but it's not nonsense, it's just an abbreviation to save me from typing "opposition to limitation of women's rights" again and again and again. You'll be able to understand this, won't you? It is not meant for the wiki entry, just for the talk page.</li>
<li>Again: the thing is your wording says that feminists today are OLWR and implies that feministis of former times were not OLWR.</li>
<li>Actually I'd advocate having just one feminism section, but if you insist on having a separate one for "feminism today" than FFL and belong there. I have argued repeatedly for that on this very page. I'll repeat it for you: FFL are a feminist group around today, so they should be included in feminism today.</li>

<p>Just a quick explanation, Fenice: You are supposing our discussion was on the wording, whether women's rights or civil rights or constitutional rights. It wasn't - qualify these rights what you will, that was not my point. And I will use any abbreviations I think fit, whether you support them or not. BTW, I don't object to the current wording, as it says they "consider abortion laws as limitations". So I think the case is closed. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 10:29, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">just a thought</span></h2>
<p>the american heritage dictionary defines abortion as</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
  1. Termination of pregnancy and expulsion of an embryo or of a fetus that is incapable of
     survival.
  2. Any of various procedures that result in such termination and expulsion. Also called induced
     abortion.
  3. The premature expulsion of a nonviable fetus from the uterus; a miscarriage.
  4. Cessation of normal growth, especially of an organ or other body part, prior to full
     development or maturation.
  5. An aborted organism.
  6. Something malformed or incompletely developed; a monstrosity.
</pre>
<p><br />
===and a reflection on your thought:</p>
<p>The descriptors "incapable of survival" [in definitions # 1 &amp; 2 above] and "nonviable" [in def # 3, above] do not accurately describe thousands of legal abortions that occur in the USA, China, and elswhere (a large majority of children born at a gestational age of 24 to 34 weeks survives - yet thousands of fetuses are <b>killed</b> at this stage each year through legal abortion in the USA alone).</p>
<p>And none of these describe what is medically required for an induced abortion to occur - the doctor must first <b>kill</b>, not just cease the growth of, the fetus [I have a friend whose endocrine system is flawed and therefore his body ceased normal growth prior to reaching full development, but he is not dead].</p>
<p>Webster's Medical dictionary is more technically accurate:</p>
<p>1. the termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely followed by the <b>death</b> of the embryo or fetus: a : spontaneous expulsion of a <b>human</b> fetus during the first 12 weeks of gestation: b : induced expulsion of a <b>human</b> fetus</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't have a problem with kill; but you should recognize humans aren't the only species that can be aborted.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Just Facts link</span></h3>
<p>I don't think that the link to the <b>Just Facts</b> site should be under the section "Politically Neutral". The site does present facts for both for and against, but certainly the majority of the facts cast a negative light on abortion. It's a valid link as it had great information, but I just dispute it being entirely neutral. --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonrad_West_6f02.html" title="User:Konrad West">K.</a> 05:32, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The only bias at that site is one toward objectiveity. The site editor acknowledges that it refers to the fetus or unborn baby as an preborn human, a term that neither "side" prefers. The entire site is all objective factual information about abortion. Neutral objective facts are non-POV. And that website, like this one, aims at being non-POV.</p>
<p>Presenting "facts" such as suicide rates etc. without additional information or explanation is a POV presentation of the facts. I'll have to remember that line though... toward objectivity; you're confusing that website with Wikipedia (when it works, and eliminates its own self-acknowledged systematic biases), its Wikipedia not that website that approximates objectivity. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 18:14, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the other hand, when I first read the "Just Fact" page, I thought it had a pro-choice bias. I was jumping to quickly, I admit, being misled by the opening paragraph, that sounds very much like a anti-pro-life snear. But reading on, I had admit that I was wrong and that the page is indeed Just Facts. The site owners might have a POV (certainly) or even a bias, but apart from the first paragraph, it doesn't spoil the information. The page gives just facts, it might not be a comprehensive dealing with all issues related to abortion. It is not POV and it was the only neutral link posted here. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 10:19, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that the page does present "just facts"; there are no POV explanations or elaborations. However, a list of facts can be POV. If the facts presented are only for or only against an argument, then the list is POV. The page presents both, but IMO, the majority of facts still cast a negative light on abortion and especially Planned Parenthood. For the record, I am not a Planned Parenthood fan, but I do believe in Wikipedia being objective. I think it would be appropriate to rename the title of the section from "Politically Neutral" to something more like "Abortion-related Facts". --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonrad_West_6f02.html" title="User:Konrad West">K.</a> 02:14, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am quite tolerant of differing opinions; I'm not tolerant of masquerades. "Just facts" is pompous title for an article that remains neutral factually, but pro-life in context through omission. Meaning it does not present many facts with the aim of a neutral assessment; and is missing (ommiting) facts that can help the reader do that. The article is biased, period. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 06:40, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Exactly. <b>But where do we put the link?</b> I'm not convinced it should be a plain pro-life link as it isn't openly pro-life. I think there should be an evaluation of the link headings; Pro-life vs. Pro-choice is too limiting. Some of the links present mostly pro-life or pro-choice facts, while others have a lot of POV rhetoric. Can we reorganise it into <i>Facts</i> and <i>Opinions</i> headings, then <i>Pro-life</i> and <i>Pro-choice</i> under that? --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonrad_West_6f02.html" title="User:Konrad West">K.</a> 04:07, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's valiant attempt at a compromise; but I do not see a compromise in this instance. The very labels of Fact and Opinion is a categorization we shouldn't be making; as any reference worthwhile likely contains both fact and opinions. As the link stands (with no header)... is "safest" thing to do; but it reflects poorly on Wikipedia being able to read between the lines on references with phrases: "The preborn human moves body parts without any outside stimulation." "Preborn human" is pro-life terminology; and its not necessarily accurate since a pregnancy can spontaneously fail (hence not preborn, but preabortive). I'm moving it back to pro-life; attempts to move it back will be reverted. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 04:29, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Fenice, you are misrepresenting the discussion. I (and others before me) gave reason for the sentence to be there. If you missed them I can repeat. - Though it is correct that most feminists today are "pro-choice", some are "pro-life", FFL being an example. That is proper balance - give the majority stance but also add that there is diversity, as they is no authority to define feminist orthodoxy. The FFL remark does belong in the "current feminism" section as it is part of the range of "current feminism". FFL are around today and today is not the 19th century. If you have a better example for pro-life feminists I wouldn't object to including them rather than FFL. It is just given as an example. I could also do without any example, but please then don't complain about there being no example to the general statement. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 10:08, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

That is a clear sign that a person is running out of arguments to me. if calling me a vandal is not a personal attack I don't know what is...--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 11:56, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, Fenice.</dd>
<dd>I was tempted to call your revert vandalism the first time, but held back and only used the term after you kept on reverting again and again. I though it justified - and it's no personal attack but rather common wiki language, isn't it. Furtermore I am not aware of any personal attacks I directed against you (there are none in this talk section, are there?) Of course, my assumptions are just assumptions, but they are not unfounded, given your editing on this sentence.</dd>

<dd>Aren't you ever embarrassed about yourself? Everybody can check the history and see that your attacks are absolutely baseless, on the contrary. Vandal is definitely a personal attack and by no means common on Wikipedia, neither calling people vandals, nor attacking others personally. --<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 18:32, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fenice, it seems to me that you are over-sensitive. Anyway, if I hurt you in anyway I do apologize. I don't know you and hence I never attacked you personally. At least, nothing that I said seems to me a "personal attack" - what I did do was attack (some of) your edit(s) - I used "vandalism" not "vandal" (and it is common on wiki).</dd>
<dd>(And anyway, you complained about personal attacks before I typed "vandalism" - "they exist, that's reason enough" is hardly a personal attack.)</dd>
<dd>What annoyed me most was your blunt statement that "after weeks of discussion not a single reason was given why Feminists for life should be in this text", when in fact I gave you reasons (and anybody can check the talk page and see) - that you chose to ignore them and sidetracking to "civil" vs. "constitutional" vs. "women's" rights and complained about abbreviations is another matter.</dd>

<dd>No, personal attacks might be common or not, but they are nonetheless bad.</dd>
<dd>But I did not personally attack you ... or called you vandal.</dd>
<dd>What I did is call your secons revert today vandalism - and applying that term to some edits is common at wiki (sometimes justified, sometimes not - I know vandalism really is blanking a page or posting XXX all over). And I don't think that's a personal attack.</dd>

<dd>The reasons, as given above, are of course: to not misrepresent the truth. FFL itself claims its primarily a pro-life-organisation, that sees itself in the tradition of early feminism. They aren't trying to claim or pretend that they are engaging in any typical feminist activity - that is your own personal private idea. You've had ample time to come up with a single 1 (one) hint that this might not be so. All you've done is avoiding the subject and escalating yourself into a personal attack.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 18:32, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
