<p>I tried updating the map. However, there seem to be issues with in the appearance and/or creation of in-article thumb nails, so I reverted to an older version. The changes I made included reverting the status of Northern Ireland from green to red, as abortion is forbidden there, despite the fact that it is a part of the United Kingdom (see BBC News, "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/1386450.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/1386450.stm" rel="nofollow">Q&amp;A: Abortion in NI</a>"), and moving the legend from the bottom of the image to the side.

<p>What color are Germany and Austria meant to be? I haven't read the laws, but a very talkative woman I met there made it sound readily available. Looking at <a href="../../../../de/s/c/h/Schwangerschaftsabbruch.html" class="extiw" title="de:Schwangerschaftsabbruch">de: Schwangerschaftsabbruch</a> it seems that an abortion is available in Germany in the first 12 weeks after completing an offsite consultation, or at any time for the heath of the mother or fetal defects. Austria looks pretty similar. Is there a reason they're a special color that I'm overlooking? — <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurascudder_7cfd.html" title="User:Laurascudder">Laura Scudder</a> <a href="../../../l/a/u/User_talk%7ELaurascudder_bd8d.html" title="User talk:Laurascudder">☎</a> 14:42, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "striped" colour, in fact, represents two colours: blue ("Legal on demand") and orange ("Illegal with exception for rape, maternal life, health, and/or mental health"). It is used to denote countries in which abortion is technically illegal, but where the termination of pregnancies goes unpunished, or the law is unenforced.</dd>
<dd>See the discussion "Abortion law in US and Germany" at <a href="../../../a/b/o/Talk%7EAbortion_law_5e48.html" title="Talk:Abortion law">Talk:Abortion law</a>. A resident of Germany informed me that, in his country, first trimester abortion is, "against the law, but not punishable" — a product of the combination of the opposing abortion laws of East and West Germany after unification in the 1990s. See <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_in_Germany_af4f.html" title="Abortion in Germany">Abortion in Germany</a>. Apparently, the same holds true in Austria, but I can't find the discussion that lead to its designation being changed at the moment. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 10:31, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But i think the country should not in "striped" colour; blie ("Legal on demand") is more correct. Women have during the first three month on demand the right for abortion.

<p>I've just uploaded a new version with some changes to the Australia section, based on (my interpretation of) <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_in_Australia_52d4.html" title="Abortion in Australia">Abortion in Australia</a>. Basically: the law differs in the states/territories, so the borders need to be added (even if it's mostly the same for the purposes of this map). The ACT has "abortion on demand". I read the page as saying that in NSW, the anti-abortion laws are <i>unenforceable</i>, whereas in the other states they may or may not be <i>unenforced</i>, so that's why NSW is different from the rest. But maybe it shouldn't be ... —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 15:44, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The map was originally intended to cover international, not <i>intra</i>-national, laws. Too much information to process at once. Thus, I recently removed the U.S. state boundaries, and you should probably revert the Australian borders too. Why not create an individual map to cover the specific state-by-state legality of abortion in Australia (see <a href="../../../a/b/o/Category%7EAbortion_maps_1c89.html" title="Category:Abortion maps">Abortion maps</a>)? I've been meaning to do so myself, but I've been unable to find an up-to-date, neutral breakdown of Australia's state laws. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 03:11, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not possible to do that while being accurate. I got the impression that abortion is a national issue in the US and most countries from reading the articles surrounding this, but in Australia it's a state issue, so there's <i>no</i> national abortion law, and no color you could do. Regarding an up-to-date, neutral breakdown, do you have some particular problem with the article I referred to? (Regarding Victoria, it's quite likely to become "on demand" after the state election due this November, against the will of the (current and almost certainly future) Premier.) —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 03:18, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(reset indent) There is a limit to the amount of information which can reasonably be conveyed in visual format. If we try to cram in too much, we'll only succeed in overwhelming the viewer, or rendering the map confusing. I understand that the legality of abortion in Australia varies from state to state, as it does in the United States, but many national laws must be "generalized." It is already hard enough for some to distinguish international borders at this resolution without throwing more into the mix. I recommend the creation of another colour code, "varies by region," in keeping with with <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_law.html" title="Abortion law">Abortion law</a>. Perhaps horizontal stripes?

<dd>I updated the map to include a new "varies by region" designation. I was slightly at a loss as to what colours to select for the stripes, as using all the colours featured in Astrokey's map below would again be informational overkill, thus defeating the entire purpose of removing the state borders in the the first place. I suppose I could apply the same logic used by the Center for Reproductive Rights' <a href="http://www.crlp.org/pub_fac_abortion_laws.html" class="external text" title="http://www.crlp.org/pub_fac_abortion_laws.html" rel="nofollow">world abortion map</a> and base classification upon the laws of the most populous states. I chose brown as a second colour because three states in Astrokey's map were brown. Let me know if this isn't logical. I can change the colours used. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 02:15, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Laws in Portugal and Spain are very similar, but applied very differently. While in Spain in practise this means that any woman can ask for an abortion (at least in private clinics) in Portugal the medical approval is taken seriously.

However, in other countries, abortion is clearly illegal, but with the same set of criteria (save for mental health) as exceptions to the ban.
