<li>B - A collection of tissue, somewhat similar to a human (4.54%)</li>

<dd>I think it's fairly clear (and apparent to anyone who has their finger on the pulse of the average reader's understanding on the subject). We strive here to be NPOV, and yet the opening sentence by its very nature leans towards the POV of Pro-Choice by (trying to or not) clouding the fact that the fetus/embryo is human (some say human being, others say drop the word "being" because it implies personhood, and then they're fine with it). So rather than clutter this up over the meaning of the word "being", a compromise is available, and rather than say "unborn human being, known as an embryo or fetus" just say the words "unborn human, known as an embryo or fetus". This avoids a debate over personhood, and still clears the matter up and makes the opening sentence easy to understand by simplifying the scientific terms for the average person to easily understand (so they don't have to look up the meaning of every single word they don't understand). After all, this isn't a medical journal, it's an encyclopedia, made to be scientifically correct, with sufficient technical information, yet easy enough to read so the average person can get a basic understanding of a subject.

<dd>If your answer is A or B or C or D you have missed the main point of being human. A dog or a cat is aware. A human is aware that they are aware and this crucial difference is not easily tested except by communication. Thus, those as yet unborn have not been tested for this essential element which seperates humanity from other living things. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a>

<dd>It's fairly clear you do not have the pulse of an encyclopedic article. Abortion in its most basic definition is about the abortion of a fetus, not a human fetus, not a human, not a human being. Inserting that there is unnecessary, illogical and this has been discussed before. The sentence is NPOV. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 04:08, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I'm prepared to do is add "of a human fetus." to the common parlance sentence... also I'd like to merge the last sentence of the intro with the previous paragraph... simply for aesthetic purposes. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 04:10, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So changing the sentence to: <i>In common parlance, the term "abortion" is synonymous with induced abortion of a human fetus.</i> I think that is fine. As I have argued here before, RoyBoy is correct that abortion technically is not an excusively human phenomenon, so changing the opening sentence is incorrect. -<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParallel_or_Together__1f4b.html" title="User:Parallel or Together?">Parallel</a> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParallel_or_Together__26d2.html" title="User talk:Parallel or Together?">or Together</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parallel_or_Together__f6e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parallel or Together?">?</a> 04:23, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>This does nothing. It goes without saying that it's discussing abortion in a human. Saying "of a human fetus" accomplishes NOTHING besides redundancy. I could say the same thing about [Amputation] in humans, and say "of a human big toe", and we'd say "no kidding" on the basis that a big toe is PART of the person. An embryo/fetus is NOT a part of its mother, it is a wholly separate human being (and I've already said we can drop the word "being" to prevent an argument over the matter). A fetus IS in fact an "Unborn human". If you can find me ONE (non-crackpot) scientist that will come out and deny (with good scientific data) that a fetus/embryo is not an unborn human at the blastocyst stage (I'd argue earlier, but we'll go with that one, and considering most abortions don't happen within 5 days of fertilization, it's a moot point anyhow), I'd fall out of my chair.

<dd>The opening sentence is already a compromise. This article has been going a lot longer than you've been here, and even longer than I have been here, too. The intro is a blanket paragraph intended to be a summation of all types of abortion: animal, human, natural, induced. <i>There is already another sentence, after that, which clarifies that the rest of this article deals with abortion in humans.</i> Unsourced polls prove little, Barwick, even if this were a true issue of contention. The current version is concise, correct, NPOV and reader-friendly. It's taken a lot of editors a lot of effort to get to this point. Let's not mess with that. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 04:25, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm in agreement with something Tznkai said in the last round, which basically was that you'd have to be fairly dense to not realize that we're talking about human fetus's here and to add that is leading the reader around by the nose (not to mention redundant.) And tempting as it is to compromise to stop the revert/edit warring, I don't think that's a good idea because it smacks of pacification and attrition of accuracy and good writing. However, I don't disagree strongly enough to pull the (highly unecessary but minor) addition. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 10:17, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>What's the point of this poll data? The correct answer is A. A fetus isn't <i>a</i> human. A fetus is human, just like my toe is human, but it's not <i>a</i> human. See the difference? Anyway, I find the poll to be poorly worded, and the various shades of meaning make it almost worthless. Besides, science is not a democracy ... what's true is true, and it doesn't matter what the general public thinks on the matter. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cyde_0b5a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cyde">contribs</a></span></sup> 13:36, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is exactly what I am talking about. Here comes someone on here claiming that a fetus isn't human on the basis that "my big toe is human"... apparently he hasn't read the archived discussions on this. My kidney is human too, and so is my left pinky finger, yet I can live without either of them, but they cannot live without me. In much the same way, a fetus/embryo is COMPLETELY human in every single way, he/she (we can say he/she because it's already a definite sex, male or female) requires nothing to be added unto it by anyone else, save nutrition and protection from its mother. Some come on here and claim "well yeah, he/she needs mom to live", which is a completely asinine argument, because on the same basis, my two-year old daughter needs me and my wife to live.
<dl>
<dd>You're about as dense as a clump of matter held up solely by electron degeneracy. I said not <i>a</i> human. Your statement "Here comes someone on here claiming that a fetus isn't human" is a deliberate misrepresentation of what I said. What is so hard to understand about my position. I'm saying that yes, of course a fetus is human in the same sense that my toe is human.

<dd>This argument is about as poor as the person who claimed to come on here saying that a human embryo is similar to a starfish embryo because they display O2/O3 symmetry early on. To which I refrained from replying (but will here): The next time a starfish embryo turns into a human, you let me know. Barwick 17:07, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You two are both getting off topic. Here is a simple scientific fact: An embryo/fetus, within the gravida, is of the same species of the gravida, and is a seperate organism within the same species. (barring speciation anyway, but we can discuss chicken and eggs another day). Is there a singificant misunderstanding in the english speaking public (our readers) that we need to correct within the abortion article?

<dd>I think what the poll is dealing with and the question you’re trying to answer with it have subtle differences. The poll doesn't say if it means different genetically or different in terms of independence or in terms human-ness. “Scientifically, is an embryo a human” isn’t a scientific question at all. Any scientist would respond, how do you define “a human?” By intelligence, by unique DNA, by a unique blood-system, by the ability to sense pain, by the development of its brain, by conscious actions, by ability to be self-sustaining? Etc., etc. It’s like asking, “Scientifically, is a tomato a vegetable?” Well, there’s not an answer to that because vegetable is not defined scientifically. So, while interesting, I don’t think this poll gives us information about any material misunderstanding that would require changes in the article. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuasipalm_6524.html" title="User:Quasipalm">Quasipalm</a> 17:34, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That is certainly a fair criticism of the polling data, but I am intrested in your answer to the question as well, is there a material misunderstanding that needs to be corrected (by us, in this article) or do we let <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetus</a> take care of that?--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 18:57, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't pretend to have all the answers, but I say let fetus take care of it. To talk about the issues surrounding the development of a fetus into a human, or as some might say the development of a fetus as a human, is a huge undertaking with scientific, moral, societal, and practical considerations. This is because the word "human" has varying scientific, moral, societal, and practical <i>definitions</i>, depending on the context. If <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> should attempt to answer these questions, you could argue that <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth.html" title="Birth">birth</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conception.html" title="Conception">conception</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quickening.html" title="Quickening">quickening</a> should also, since these are also events that occure during pregnancy.

Anyone who can read "fetus", read "Any female mammal can experience abortion, however this article focuses exclusively on abortion in women", and now also the completely redundant and unecessary addition of "In common parlance, the term "abortion" is synonymous with induced abortion of a human fetus." which IMHO should be removed, and <i>still</i> not figue this out is too moronic to help and needs to go to the Simple English version of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 20:43, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Let's look at the facts; an abortion is the termination, or killing (for it is, even if one does not recognize it as a human being - it is still living), of a fetus. Whether it is a human being or not, it is still correctly called a fetus - and that is the best NPOV approach, and also the best one to avoid constant edit wars. The article does NOT currently say it is a lump of flesh, a part of the mother, or alternatively that it is a human being; it is up to the reader to decide that. And that is precisely what the "Abortion Debate" section refers to - that there is a great deal of debate and disagreement on what the exact state of a fetus is amongst the general population. We are not going to reach a consensus here amongst ten or so editors - so let's just use medical terminology (which seems cold, but does avoid debate by refraining from defining a moral state of being), make sure the debate section clearly defines the lines drawn and the arguments on both sides, and leave it at that.</p>
<p>On a more personal note - a few people here (it should be obvious from the preceding) need to watch insults, comments meant to belittle other's points of view or the seriousness and personal nature of this topic. Please act like mature contributors to the discussion, or the reality is no one will pay attention to your points when decisions are made, as it becomes obvious that the topic is not being taken seriously.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 22:16, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, but I've done every single thing you guys have asked for on here. I came in and proposed that we change the intro topic (reasons are found in the archive if you wish) to say "resulting in the death of an unborn human being, known as a fetus or embryo". Most on here said "Of course it's human, but the word 'being' implies personhood, drop it and it's ok", I disagreed for a while and in the interest of settling the matter, offered to say "unborn human <s>being</s>, known as..." (drop the word being), and THEN people come in and say "NO, we're not going to have that either..." claiming that it's unnecessary because they claimed "the average person understands a fetus is a human", I disagreed and people said "prove it and we'll change it". I proved it, and NOW they're STILL saying "NO, we're not going to change it". Is THIS how it works on here? Simply because I'm the only solid pro-life person on here, and I want the opening sentence to be a BALANCED presentation of the facts (and not cloud them behind scientific terms), does NOT change the facts.</dd>
<dd>If we are seriously interested in being NPOV in this article (which sure doesn't seem like the case, but at any rate...) then the intro sentence as it stands needs modification. It is obviously written for one of two things:
<ul>
<li>To further the pro-choice viewpoint by clouding the fact that abortion kills a unique human life, OR</li>
<li>Being written for a medical journal</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The former does not belong on Wikipedia, and the latter is a bit too advanced for an encyclopedia. Either way, regardless of the "general feeling" on here (this is not a democracy), the average reader would best be served by the words "...resulting in the death of an unborn human, known as an embryo or fetus". This would do the following:
<ul>
<li>Remove the POV bias from the introductory article</li>
<li>Encourage Pro-Life readers to read the entire page instead of blowing it off as a "Pro-Choice biased page"</li>
<li>Make the introductory sentence much easier to read by:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Summarizing the misunderstood scientific words (fetus and embryo) in the first sentence</li>
<li>For a person who's heard very little about the abortion debate, it presents a summary definition of words that are at first complex-sounding to them</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It also encourages people to continue reading the page, because they realize it's not going to be filled with scientific words that they don't understand, but is rather written so that the average person can easily understand it, yet is also filled with enough scientific facts and links that they can research the matter further.

</dd>
<dd>As you can see (I am about to "start this again") abortion technically is not an excusively human phenomenon, so changing the opening sentence is incorrect. The intro to the article already makes it painstakingly obvious that the article will deal only with abortion in humans.

<dd>You can't argue the points I made, so you resort to a dictionary attack? This is getting pathetic. First of all, a Dictionary, in interest of being concise, does not have the space to differentiate between human and non-human pregnancy. But if you really want to continue with the "ignoring the facts I've brought up and instead grasping at straws"... then here, I'll use your same tactics:
<ul>
<li>Verb - to stop the development of a baby that has not been born, usually by having a medical operation (FreeSearch British Dictionary)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>How's about we use THAT one?</dd>
<dd>This is seriously getting ridiculous, would you PLEASE bother to address the points I brought up? None of this grasping at straws trying to distract everyone from the points mentioned above, most notably that the introductory sentence is highly POV. Anyone pro-life who comes across this page will read the introductory sentence and immediately be turned off by the article. It's not even neutral. Here, you want to see what different intro articles would look like?
<ul>
<li>Pro Choice POV - "An abortion is the termination of a pregnancy associated with the death of an embryo or fetus.</li>
<li>Neutral, NPOV - "An abortion is the termination of a pregnancy associated with the death of an unborn human, known as an embryo or fetus"</li>
<li>Pro Life POV - "An Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by killing an unborn human being, referred to as an embryo or fetus"</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I've already written plenty of reasoning behind this, and nobody has addresed any of those points beyond "well technically, if we're talking about my aunt's neighbor's sister's dog's former owner's cousin's daughter who's looking up an abortion for her goldfish, then you're wrong". Face the facts presented, and let's fix the current POV intro sentence. Barwick 06:12, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

By the way, <i>your</i> dicdef includes the word "baby", which doesn't necessarily always mean human (the definition includes animal infants). You are right that quibbling over specific dictionary definitions really isn't the point, though. I understand your point that people will come to the article to investigate the abortion of human fetuses. That doesn't mean that in the first sentence we have to lie to them by making a statement that is <i>demonstrably false</i>.

This discussion is quickly degenerating (<b>again</b>) off topic. In my analysis, ignoring all statments which violate <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVILITY_dc24.html" title="WP:CIVILITY">WP:CIVILITY</a> specificly, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, we have a single editor voicing the opinion that the opening statement is innacurate and POV. This has been strenously disagreed with by the opposing parties.</p>
<p>This had the potential to be a constructive discussion. It has failed to be. Barwick, you have to understand that no matter how many hoops you think you're jumping through, that doesn't mean we think you are correct. There has been significant time spent on adequate research disagreeing and categorically refuting your points. Whether or not you agree with the conclusion, apply good faith and understand that they sincerly belive what it is they are saying. Wikipedia articles are not islands. To remain consistent with the entire encylopedia, we apply the same standards, putting a premium on accuracy, neutrality, and readability by the average idiot, approximatly in that order.</p>
<p>To echo DonaNobisPacem, the rest of you could have erred on the side of restraint as well. Barwick is new, the rest of you do not have that excuse. I will not go into an exhaustive listing of attacks, as that is counter to my view on discussion pages.</p>
<p>The current statement is factually accurate. The openning paragraph, while not perfect prose, is accurate. There is no clear bias as written, and <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> by nature, suffers from systemic percieved bias, as the choice of terminology and personal views confound the issue. <i>This is addressed in this article!</i> This is a serious subject for serious minds. This is not a battleground.</p>
<p>This discussion has reached the end of its useful life. We have an attempted compromise in place, and we have degenerated into discussions on wiki-philosphy. If you wish to continue that discussion, take it to the public pump, #wikipedia, or somewhere else. We have an article to imrpove here. <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-induced_abortion.html" title="Self-induced abortion">Self-induced abortion</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/s/Unsafe_abortion.html" title="Unsafe abortion">unsafe abortion</a>, and the suggested health effects are serious problems around the world that deserve to have a neutral and accurate article that addresses them. The politically charged atomosphere here has successfully distracted us all from the goal at hand. It is not about victory over the other side, for whatever reason (they are wrong, fanatical/souless, etc), but that Abortion is a serious intersection of tragedy between countless evils. In my home state of Michigan, misinformation from <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planned_parenthood.html" title="Planned parenthood">planned parenthood</a>, pregnancy crisis centers, and the advocacy machinery drove two confused teenagers to assault. The boy beat up his willing girlfriend with repeated blunt force trauma to her abdomen to attempt an abortion. When he succeded, a judge had to seperate two high school sweethearts when the D.A charged the boy with assault in an attempt that was widely accepted as an effort for political gain and to avoid abortion legal mines. An officer of the law, manipulating the law to prosecute a tragedy of accident, misinformation, and the fear of teenagers in love.</p>
<p>The point of that, is that this is not about being right. This is not saying that the law should've been clear to allow/disallow the kids to do what they did. Misinformation caused a travesty to erupt from tragedy. There is nothing good here. We can all agree that this situation should never have happened. We can do our small part to remove the disinformation in the world. We can't do it by bickering.</p>

<p>Fine, so in the interest of "absolute, 100% accuracy for the one in a billion person who comes on here to research abortion in their dog", we're going to throw out all the reasons I mentioned above. This is a prime example of ignoring 99,999,999 people so that you satisfy the last person left. It's exactly what's going on in society today, look some of the large retailers in the US, selling "holiday" trees now instead of Christmas trees, so they don't "offend" someone (thankfully some of them stopped doing this lately when people stood up and said "that's stupid"). If that's what you all wish to do, then fine, so be it. I don't really see much point in bothering to spend my time at a place where we're going to offend 99,999,999 so we can make 1 feel included.

<dd>Offend? Who would be offended by our accurate description of abortion? And why is "Holiday" a bad word, when indeed its 2nd definition is "holy day"; and actually is used to include others in the festivities who, god forbid, don't celebrate Christmas.

<dd>According to my father, "Xmas" isn't an attempt to take the "Christ" out of "Christmas." The Greeks used the letter chi (X) as shorthand for Christ, so Xmas predates "Happy Holidays" and political correctness by a couple of millenia. And, FYI, there <i>is</i> more than one Holiday (Christmas, itself, could be divided into many: Christian, secular, consumerist -- even among those there are variations), so in this sense the anti-PC War Against Happy Holidays is as silly as the PC War Against Christmas.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Next on the Agenda: Unsafe Abortion</span></h2>
<p>On December 15, 2005 I outlined plans to add a section on unsafe abortion (or illegal abortion, although not all unsafe abortions are illegal, and thus the general title), which are now in Archive 14 under the thread title "Coat hangar abortion":</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article needs to discuss the phenomenon of unsafe abortion. We could take a two-fold approach: modern and historical, with illegal abortion and its effects upon the Western world being discussed in "history of abortion," while the increased threat and associated risks of continued unsafe abortions are presented under "health effects." Or, perhaps, it would be better to have one, all-inclusive section on "unsafe abortion" under "health effects"? Let's decide upon a course of format, first, and then we can begin the sourcing process. -Kyd 03:09, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Which of these two formats would you prefer? Dona exhorted us to be careful in choosing our sources, to avoid bias, and KillerChihuahua has also unearthed several sources while rooting around in the backyard, which may prove useful to this section (assessments are Chihuahua's, Nov. 15, 2005, see Archive 13, thread "Change to 'Health Risks'"):</p>

<dd>Should it go under "health effects"? I wouldn't want to think of "unsafe abortion" as being an actual method of abortion.

<p>It seems appropriate that this section would also include discussion of "safe legal" abortions that end up killing or maiming the mother, or that do not go as planned and end up with a live baby who has been harmed by the process. Also, the danger that quacks and the worst doctors often end up as abortionists - and that often they do a disproportionate amount of the abortions in poor neighborhoods in clinics that are usually regulated less than veterinary clinics.

<p><b>Brought from Archive 13</b> If you compare death world-wide to maternity deaths overall (which is 4%), to legal abortions in highly developed countries, (which is less than 1%) it makes for a nice biased spin for pro-choice.

However, there is reported evidence to suggest these numbers are much higher than reported by the CDC - in 1978, an investigative report for the Chicago Sun-Times showed 12 abortion related deaths in one year that were not reported (Pamela Zekman and Pamela Warrick, "The Abortion Profiteers," Chicago Sun-Times, special reprint 3 December 1978 (original publication 12 November, 1978)). There are other investigations that point to the same, up to the current day. Anotherwards - if we cite CDC statistics, as is commonly done, it would be prudent (I think) to indicate that there is evidence to show these numbers are much higher than reported, with credible sources linked.</dd>

<p>I found the rewrite by Kyd confuses rather than clarifies the ABC issue. Kyd removed mentions of positive studies and controversy, and inserted further studies rebutting the hypothesis; also adding mentions of miscarriage which is a minor issue on this subject and lastly isolates Brind as the sole voice in the wilderness. (I'm not saying that was intentional, and yeah, I see the word Others... but to say he's the one doing all the critiquing is to weakly imply, he's the ONLY one actually doing the critiquing) Which is misleading, my version specified Brind as the leading advocate of ABC and critic (of a specific study); there others who are ofters that critique ABC studies generally and even the Denmark study in question. "Refute" is also a strong word; and I don't care for it. Kyd obviously spent some time on it, so I didn't revert it all... but I did tweak it quite a bit; frankly I'm still tempted revert back to my version. Actually now that I think about it, refute is gone. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 06:09, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've already said this in the past, but I'll do it again; I want to avoid trying to get people to conclude one way or another on the ABC issue from a short overview. And force them to read the sub-article. It's very difficult here to provide the details which are necessary. For example the Denmark study doesn't use controls to account for increasing breast cancer rates over the years. (too expensive for a data set of this size) As a result, they lump all the confounding factors together (they have no choice, otherwise they would need specific Denmark studies on every single confounding factor to eliminate it individual, they don't cite any in their study)... in order to account for the increase in breast cancer rates over the decades. Of course in doing that; there is no way to know if they removed any potential increase from abortion over those years (as they have removed all birth-cohort rate differences, which increase as society modernizes, as a result of *confounding factors*). All that is difficult to relate in the breast cancer sub-section without bloating the abortion article; nor should it be there in the first place. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 06:38, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"This section needs to be rewritten. It doesn't sound as if 'ABC hypothesis' actually carries any weight in real scientific circles, yet the lead paragraph all goes on about it without discussing the objections."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The tag was present for months. So, I rewrote it. Explain the hypothesis and discuss the evidence. It was difficult, though, because most of the research is either against ABC or inconclusive. The fact that this subject has more to do with politics and less to do with science makes it even harder to cover (Why does miscarriage never factor into the public health campaign? Sure, one can't <i>choose</i> to have a miscarriage, but, at least, a "If you've had a miscarriage, have a mammogram" message would be warranted, if pregnancy interruption is a risk).</dd>
<dd>As for removing mention of "positive" studies, is this to what you're referring?
<dl>
<dd>"The majority of interview-based studies have indicated a link, and some have been demonstrated to be <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistically_significant.html" title="Statistically significant">statistically significant</a>, but there remains debate as to their reliability because of possible <a href="../../../r/e/s/Response_bias.html" title="Response bias">response bias</a>."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>What interview-based studies? We need a clear source. Nor was was there a source on NCI (that took an hour to find — alone). As for Howe, I'm with Tznkai -- newer is better, and 1989 is a long time ago in the world of science. Not moot, perhaps, but it certainly shouldn't be mentioned <i>before</i> two much newer studies (1997 and 2003).</dd>
<dd>You remember in high school, when the debate teacher made you argue in support of one thing, when you were actually against it? Now, imagine it's science class, and the debate is heliocentrism versus geocentrism, and you're forced to defend the latter. Agh! -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 12:20, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't even know where to begin. For the NCI link you could have merely checked the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion-breast_cancer_%28ABC%29_hypothesis_e165.html#NCI_workshop" title="Abortion-breast cancer (ABC) hypothesis">Abortion-breast_cancer_(ABC)_hypothesis#NCI_workshop</a>! If you want a few interview based studies you also find that in the ABC article; and/or consult Brind's meta-analysis which you cite; or you could have asked me. The lack of cites here was a conscious decision on my part... the easiest thing is to simply cite Brind's analysis.</dd>
<dd>I entirely agree it has more to do about politics and science, but of course you should realize that cuts both ways. I already spent months on this issue, and the fact its called "hypothesis" (rather than theory, or even link) I think accurately portrays its status in the scientific community. Simply put for negative results you cite, I can bring up positive and indeed ambiguous results; I simply think you didn't care to look hard enough for positive results; and/or are a little misguided on what constitutes good research. That was illustrated by the 1.5 million women mention (yes all the news org's and Planned Parenthood and even the researchers themselves trumpet the number); but it has <b>no scientific value</b>, as its the women who actually have breast cancer who are pertinent to the studies findings.</dd>
<dd>Yes newer studies a typically more robust than much older ones (1989 is old, but not really old... keep in mind epidemiology is far more established than say genetic research), so that's lazy thinking even though I agree with it. For example in <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion-breast_cancer_%28ABC%29_hypothesis_e165.html#Spontaneous_abortion" title="Abortion-breast cancer (ABC) hypothesis">Abortion-breast_cancer_(ABC)_hypothesis#Spontaneous_abortion</a> I cite a study from 1976, I go onto cite one from 1993 because I know the newer is better attitude is out there and I've encountered it before by fervent pro-choicers fed up with pro-life pseudoscience. My point is the 1993 study isn't necessary; because good research is good research, whether its 5 or 25 years old. In summation, you didn't have to reinvent the wheel Kyd. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 15:19, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh yeah, and epidemiology doesn't lend itself to "heliocentrism versus geocentrism" analogies. Not sure where you were even going with that; but I could take a guess and tell you my story. I thought the ABC link was pro-life tactic with the disingenuous and biased Brind in the lead. However, when I came across <a href="http://www.prochoiceactionnetwork-canada.org/articles/abclink.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.prochoiceactionnetwork-canada.org/articles/abclink.shtml" rel="nofollow">this</a> article and confirmed how poor her research was it <b>forced</b> me to re-evaluate the situation on the evidence and scientific debate alone, and I was surprised at my findings. The <b>public</b> support ABC has in the scientific community is essentially nil, but I'd maintain that has more to do with politics than the actual science; and I wanted Wikipedia to focus on the science. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 15:49, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Of course, the matter is further complicated by how much of an increase it comes to anyway. If its less than 30% for most women (who have abortions before 12 weeks), is it even worth mentioning?

<p>I awkwardly added in the current scientific consensus. Although by no means unanimous; I don't think its accurate and encompassing to how science regards the ABC link... but it does seems to be the popular view and the word on the street. Until we hear otherwise I consider it barely NPOV. (I'm thinking of Dr. Daling's research and comments in the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion-breast_cancer_%28ABC%29_hypothesis_e165.html#Interviews" title="Abortion-breast cancer (ABC) hypothesis">ABC article</a>) - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 04:15, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point, not deliberate; I've simply never come across a history on the origin of the ABC issue. Pro-life sites cite a Japanese study (Segi et al.

<dd>This article has two items which might be worth pursuing; one, confirms the date of 1957 as the date when an ABC link was first mentioned, and the second, a political interference with the accurate reportiong on the NIH site: <a href="http://democrats.reform.house.gov/features/politics_and_science/example_breast_cancer.htm" class="external text" title="http://democrats.reform.house.gov/features/politics_and_science/example_breast_cancer.htm" rel="nofollow">Breast Cancer Risks</a> The site is a political one, bear in mind their postion is Govt. Reform and its a Democrat site, so they are inclined to criticise the current administration. I saw this while looking for a date, but it might be worthwhile to track back to who made the decision on the NIH site change - if there are political axes being ground here it might merit a brief mention. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 13:19, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Definition of pregnancy</span></h2>
<p>Can the definition of pregnancy be explicitly stated? Currently the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology defines pregnancy to begin at implantation, and I think this is relevant to the discussion of abortion. Additionally, it may be more accurate to word "Certain forms of birth control are used to prevent implantation before the pregnancy occurs" as "Certain forms of birth control prevent the implantation of the fertilized ovum." and follow that with the current medical definition of pregnancy. Wanfactor 03:58, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If the beginning of pregnancy is defined as implantation, how is the sentence "Certain forms of birth control are used to prevent implantation before the pregnancy occurs" inaccurate? I think the facts as you have presented them don't support a lack of accuracy, although I see the point you are making (I think). If the wording is a little off, it could read "Certain forms of birth control are used to prevent implantation, which is the beginning of pregnancy according to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecoloy." Obviously I am not writer, but I hope the gist of what I am trying to say is coming across. -<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParallel_or_Together__1f4b.html" title="User:Parallel or Together?">Parallel</a> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParallel_or_Together__26d2.html" title="User talk:Parallel or Together?">or Together</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parallel_or_Together__f6e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parallel or Together?">?</a> 10:27, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although the medical profession defines pregnancy to begin at implantation, not everyone uses this definition. Many people assert that pregnancy begins at fertilization, and in fact many sources would say that life/pregnancy begins at fertilization. The difference in definition of conception is important to the abortion debate since a substance that does prevents implantation is not considered abortifacient under the definition of the American College of Obstetricians, but can be considered an abortifacient if pregnancy begins at fertilization.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">So called "biased" links</span></h2>
<p>It would probably be more helpful if the links were divided into "sympathetic to abortion" or "anti-abortion" (or whatever terminology), rather than claiming they're all just "biased". I don't think there's any problem with having so-called "biased" links here, but there should be an even distribution of pro and anti sites, and they should be labelled as such.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the "just facts" site is labelled as biased - I wasn't sure if I could decide which way it's supposed to lean? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevage_a8b0.html" title="User talk:Stevage">Stevage</a> 13:07, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At one point, there were about 20 outside links to pro- and anti- sites. It got out of control, as people would be inserting external links on a daily basis, many of them inappopriate (inflammatory sites, shock sites, self-promotion). The pro-/anti- count is currently an even 3 to 3. Labelling "pro-life" and "pro-choice" was also problematic: one would frequently be changed to an epithet, "anti-choice" or "pro-murder," while the other was left alone. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 19:21, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Health effects</span></h2>
<p>I would think that we'd want to lead with the most relevant information, and save the lists of details for later in the article, as per the inverted pyramid. A list of all risks is boring and uninformative. Worse, it's misleading if it doesn't include prominent mention of the fact that many of these risks are negligible for early abortions but quite serious for late ones. In fact, listing risks without explaining this fact would serve to make abortion look more dangerous than it really is, since the vast majority of procedures are performed early in the pregnancy. Likewise, carrying a pregnancy to term is also risky. I don't have a citation handy (so I didn't say anything to this effect), but I seem to remember reading that an early abortion is, on the whole, safer than giving birth. Failing to mention this would once again make abortion sound more dangerous than it really is. Is our goal to give an honest explanation of abortion's health risks or is this an excuse for partisan abortion-bashing? Think it through. If you want to dispute the factuality or relevancy of these additions, this is a good place to do it. Until then, I've reverted the text. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 16:32, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This whole section needs to be rewritten (the article is also undergoing a major rewrite — as a perusal of the talk page beforehand would've revealed). It is wont for a sub-section on unsafe (i.e. back-alley) abortion, especially in the presence of fetal pain, breast cancer, and mental health treatments. However, most of your additions, though valid, are redundant with information in the first paragraph of "Physical Risks:"
<ul>
<li>Your edits: "Early abortions are safer than later ones... As with any medical treatment, success depends on the competence of the practitioners. The risk of abortion must also be balanced against the risk of carrying a pregnancy to term."</li>
<li>Redundancies (emphasis mine): <b>Each phase of the abortion carries separate risks,</b> and practitioners are not in agreement as to the best methods of mitigating those risks. <b>The degree of risk depends upon the skill and experience of the practitioner;</b> maternal age, health, and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parity.html" title="Parity">parity</a>; <a href="../../../g/e/s/Gestational_age.html" title="Gestational age">gestational age</a>; pre-existing conditions; methods and instruments used; medications used; <b>the skill and experience of those assisting the practitioner</b>; and the quality of recovery and follow-up care. <b>A highly-skilled practitioner, operating under ideal conditions, will tend to have a very low rate of complications; an inexperienced practitioner in an ill-equipped and ill-staffed facility, on the other hand, will often have a higher incidence of complications.</b></li>

<dd>Thank you for responding. Unfortunately, the person who keeps reverting my changes is unwilling to come here and discuss the matter.</dd>
<dd>As it happens, I did look through the talk page and noticed that there is an interest in doing a major rewrite. I support this. Until then, however, there's still room to clean up what's here. Moreover, whatever improvements we make now could be preserved.</dd>
<dd>As for redundancy, this is an argument for removing the second place that the information shows up, not the first. I'm concerned that, by unintentionally burying the key points deep in the article, where fewer people will read, we're being misleading.</dd>
<dd>Another misleading issue is how to evaluate risk. As I tried to emphasize in my recent addition, the only meaningful comparison is between abortion and childbirth; either of these is itself more dangerous than not having gotten pregnant. The recent text on mental health risks makes this error particularly badly. It also confuses correlation with causation: those women who choose abortions are self-selected for being unhappy with their situation, and are much less likely to be in a long-term monogamous relationship. To report on this study without mentioning this criticism would be biased. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 07:05, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have not responded, because I feel that Kyd has done a more than adequate job, and my edit summaries were self explantory. These sentances were removed, verbatim, during a major collaboration ( I remember, I helped spearhead it) to revamp the health section. It achieved, by some strange miracle considerable consensus. If you look through the archives you'll find that the pregnancy vs abortion statistics are dubious, and again, we don't prescribe any sort of advice.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 07:38, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I can easily cite support for the claim that women who choose abortion are much less likely to be married, but can't find immediate support for the odds of them being in a long-term monogamous relationship without being married. I suspect it's out there if I spend a little more time, though. In the meantime, here's a quote from <a href="http://womensissues.about.com/cs/abortionstats/a/aaabortionstats.htm" class="external text" title="http://womensissues.about.com/cs/abortionstats/a/aaabortionstats.htm" rel="nofollow">about.com</a>: "Marriage - 51% of women who are unmarried when they become pregnant will receive an abortion. Unmarried women are 6 times more likely than married women to have an abortion. 67% of abortions are from women who have never been married". If you really doubt what I said, we could change "in a long-term monogamous relationship" to "married".

<li><b>Opening paragraph:</b> A point of much contention — particularly from new editors, and ones unfamiliar with the goings-on of the talk page, as it is the first thing that they read. Can we rewrite or revise this text to avoid such spats?</li>
<li><b>Spontaneous abortion:</b> This hasn't been touched.</li>
<li><b>Induced abortion:</b> This hasn't been touched. It probably needs to be tweaked and updated with the latest data from AGI (and, perhaps, ancillary sources).</li>
<li><b>Methods of inducing abortion:</b> Text needs a rewrite and proper sources. This is a very technical section. We might need to enlist the help of someone slightly more "in the know." It might also be that we'll have to devise a new format beyond the current chemical/surgical/other in order to accommodate new information. Perhaps we could have new sub-subsections for specific procedures to make navigation easier (i.e. Surgical abortion: Dilation &amp; curettage, Intact dilation &amp; extraction, Saline abortion, etc)?</li>

<li><b>Physical health:</b> Needs rewrite and sourcing. This section is too loose. The prose needs to be brought together, so that it is informative, accurate, understandable, but also has some semblance of "flow" — which, in my humble opinion, it currently lacks, as it seems more an assemblage of disparate paragraphs.</li>
<li><b>Unsafe abortion:</b> This section — encompassing "back-alley" abortion, self-abortion, illegal abortion, etc., and its incidence and effects — needs to be written and sourced. Can I earmark this as the next on the agenda?</li>

<dd>Thats for the overiew. Unsafe abortion has its own article, so we probably should improve that first. I'll be targeting that myself, and its going to need considerable oversight once write up the section (if you thought arguments over the intro was bad...) Health effects takes up to much time and energy for me, as we can see below, I'm loosing patience faster than I should. I think incidents at home tell me I should reduce my involvement there. We have a number of related topics to tuch upon, and some hard resarch to do. Induced abortion overview and methods though, should probably be our top priority, as this where the hard facts are. I'd like to roll the health risks into each methodlogy, and leave "health effects" to things that effect all abortions.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 19:32, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have removed (again) the addition extoling the reader to compare the risks of abortion to the risks of carrying a pregnancy to term. As an aside do NOT mark reversions of this nature minor edits. Thats for vandalism, spelling, and grammer only. For the record, here is the addition:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, a meaningful evaluation of risk must compare abortion with carrying the pregnancy to term, as opposed to against never having gotten pregnant in the first place. In the United Kingdom, about 1 out of 100,000 women who have early abortions die, as compared about 9 out of 100,000 women who carry their pregnancies to term. Figures for other countries are similar.</dd>

<dd>When making medical decisions, we don't ever consider the risk of a procedure in isolation. Instead, we compare it to the risk of alternative procedures and of not doing anything at all. To present the risk of one option while censoring any mention of the alternatives is inherently misleading and POV.

<dd>Uhm, abortion doesn't particularly involve mothers. It involves women with unwanted pregnancies. Some of them happen to be mothers and some go on to become mothers, but calling them mothers now is as biased as calling fetuses "unborn babies". Sure, though some abortions are mandated by medical need, the primary motivation for abortion is that the pregnancy is not wanted. However, women in such a position can be scared into carrying to term if they're given false statistics that make abortion sound more dangerous than giving birth, which turns out not to be the case at all.

<dd>Alienus, I think many of us would agree with you. But as others have pointed out, given the controversial nature of this article, any figures which are not backed up from a primary source are simply not acceptable. I think the figures are needed here since if we are going to discuss safety, we need to compare the risks (without editorialising) to the risks of carrying the pregnancy to term. We can't quantify overall risks but we can hopefully quantify mortatility. Ideally we would also want to include figures from a number of different countries but this may not be possible due to the general low legality of abortions in many developing countries. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 16:53, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>(reduce indent) " a meaningful evaluation of risk must compare abortion with carrying the pregnancy to term, as opposed to against never having gotten pregnant in the first place" Respectfully I strongly disagree. Only those already pregnant are faced with the choice and or prospect of an abortion. I did a good deal of reseach comparing abortion to full term delivery and other minor surgical procedures, which has been ignored. I did not do that because I thought the comparison was inept. Alienus, I respect you utterly, but that position makes no sense whatsoever to me. Comparing abortion to not getting pregnant is, IMHO, a silly position. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 19:08, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

<dd>"It is indisputable that some women will experience negative feelings as a result of elective abortion. However, whether this phenomenon is significant enough to warrant a general diagnosis, or even classification as an independent syndrome (see <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_debate.html" title="Abortion debate">abortion debate</a>), is a subject that is debated among members of the medical community.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A study conducted by Finland’s National Research and Development Center for Welfare and Health, that was published in the European Journal of Public Health, found significantly higher suicide rates and death rates, among women who had an abortion, versus women who had given birth. Although the correlation existed other factors were determined to have possibly inhibited some of the results.</dd>

Increased risk for a suicide after an induced abortion can, besides indicating common risk factors for both, result from a negative effect of induced abortion on mental wellbeing. With our data, however, it was not possible to study the causality more carefully. Our data clearly shows, however, that women who have experienced an abortion have an increased risk of suicide, which should be taken into account in the prevention of such deaths.” <i><a href="../../../1/2/_/12.html" title="12">12</a>"</i></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Medical definition</span></h2>
<p>Let me explain my recent edit: The Medical profession does not classify things like the "morning after pill" etc as abortion or rather termination of a pregnancy, since technically there is not yet a pregnancy before implantation (mother and embryo are still seen as apart). I don't think however a classification as "emergency contraception" is a medical one, since contra-ception is meant to prevent conception, which at that time has already taken place. These a strictly technical classifications and hence they should be applied strictly. The moral issue however remains unaffected by this. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 23:47, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, I cannot think of anyone considering the moral issue (as opposed to the mere technical one) and not consider pre- and post-implantation as morally equivalent. I can understand that some argue about personhood etc but why implanatation should change the moral ramifications is beyond me. Well, there we have the mess. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 00:31, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I haven't given the issue too much consideration, but my immediate thinking on it is that the viability of the embryo is an unknown quantity (ie. miscarriage occurs when implantation fails, for various reasons); so emergency contraception just as often isn't effecting a viable pregnancy. As to implantation itself changing the morality of things... well without implantation there is no growth/differentiation; which as far as I'm concerned is part of the moral spectrum of abortion. Indeed, a mess that I think makes moral judgement difficult to say the least. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 05:14, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Others disagree, and they tend to be on the pro-life side of the equation. As far as they are concerned a unique DNA strand in a fertilized egg is an individual being; and any moral ambiguity is out the window at that point (as per the pro-life doctors conference). It seems illogical to me to think significant pro-choice groups would consider EC morally equivalent to an abortion as they generally subscribe to a moral spectrum philosophy on the matter; hence stopping of the pregnancy earlier is preferable from their perspective. What matters here is not the actual morality of it, but the perceived morality by those in question. I think its reasonable to assert pro-lifers see no distinction while pro-choicers would. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 06:55, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, the morning-after pill can prevent fertilization in the first place. Second, if fertilization does occur, it can prevent the egg from attaching to the uterine lining. There is some ambiguity about whether pregnancy is taken from fertilization or implantation, but I thought the medical community had settled on the latter. Cites? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 23:56, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Tznkai, I understand the link problem and thought about this as well, but haven't yet come up with a satisfactory solution. It is a loaded term after all (hence a hidden link, e.g. <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_contraception.html" title="Emergency contraception">blahblahblah</a>, will not do). However, I agree with your comment about "not just pro-lifers". In fact, I guess the number of people who really would condemn abortion post-implanation and accept it pre-implantation is fairly limited and the "moral equivalence" goes both ways.</dd>
<dd>Alienus, then the line is drawn between the two functions of the "morning-after-pill". I didn't think about its dual nature so it probably wasn't the ideal example. But in principle the issue remains. As for the definition, I personally would opt for conception, but I can understand how one arrives at implantation by applying the strictly technical reasoning I described above. Though I am not sure whether all medics everywhere subscribe to this. Anyway, the moral issue remains unaffected. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 00:12, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If the medical community says pregnancy starts with implantation, then that's that. The Pope is entitled to his own opinion and can say it starts with fertilization, then perhaps we could report this, but not as a medical opinion. Likewise, if doctors call it emergency contraception, that's what we should call it, though we might mention the views of those who claim it is abortion or its moral equivalent. Therefore, we should call it emergency contraception and report CITED disagreements with this characterization. NPOV doesn't mean letting medical laymen (however clerical they are in another field) to define medical terms. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 00:19, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I didn't suggest inserting my view instead of the medical definition. I am mostly concerned with the ethical dimension and, as I stated before, this issue doesn't change with the defintion.</dd>
<dd>"Emergency contraception" however is another problem, as it is a loaded term. Even if medics use it (and I don't know if they do) it is medically incorrect.</dd>
<dd>And we don't need to drag the Pope into that. (unsigned by <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a>)</dd>

<p>A quick Google got:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"What is Emergency Contraception?</dd>
<dd>Emergency contraceptives are methods of preventing pregnancy after unprotected sexual intercourse. Emergency contraception is often called "morning after contraception" or "the morning after pill" but these terms are misleading because emergency contraception can be used before the morning after or up to five days after." <a href="http://ec.princeton.edu/" class="external autonumber" title="http://ec.princeton.edu/" rel="nofollow">[27]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm sure I can find other examples of medical use of "emergency contraception". Since pregnanacy is defined (by doctors, not priests) as starting with implantation, the morning-after pill us medically correct. If you disagree, find me an unbiased doctor to cite.</p>
<p>Given this, what precisely is the argument against calling it emergency contraception? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 00:45, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alienus, could you please stop your clerical references. It doesn't help the discussion at all.</p>
<p>Now, the question is whether this classification is used by some official medical body, as the definition of pregnancy obviously is, and not just individual doctors (who can never be unbiased, one way or the other).</p>
<p>The argument against calling it "emergency contraception" is that some means that prevent the implantation of an already conceived embryo (or rather zygote) is simply not contra-<b>ceptive</b> but rather contra-<b>implantive</b>. In so far as the morning-after-pill is prevent conception (assuming that it is), it is a contraceptive - in so far as it does prevent implantation it is not. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 01:14, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I made some more changes. First of all, the contraceptive pill, while usually preventing pregnancy by thickening cervical mucus and blocking ovulation, can also stop implantation. Second, since many of the women taking the morning-after pill might not become pregnant even without it, it cannot be IDENTICAL, whether morally, physically or otherwise, with abortion. With abortion, the woman knows for a fact that she's pregnant and is terminating that pregnancy.</dd>
<dd>As for partial birth abortion, as the article states, this is not a medical term in the first place. I showed sufficient verification that the morning-after pill is called EC by doctors. If you want to debate this, take it to the EC page, which we no longer censor the link to. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 01:45, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What you have done is given some quotes. Anyway, it is included now.</p>
<p>As I was working on fusing my and and Tznkai's versions, you made an edit supposedly removing POV. However, it was quite the contrary, as you removed the basis of the definition of pregnancy (the medics) turning it into the dogmatic "because because pregnancy starts at implantation". You also introduced POV by saying that the equivalence was seen only by "some" and further qualified that by referring to the pro-life camp. As I have argued above, this is not true. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 01:50, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alienus, first of all "identical" is not "equivalent". This is about the moral issue and morally it makes no difference whether your kill the unborn by preventing implantation or by removing the implanted embryo. I am intentionally using these strong words (with no intention of changing the article accordingly) in order to make it clear for you what the equivalence is. A lack of knowledge can occur on either side of the "implantation" fence. I am ignorant of this new element of the defintion of abortion (that the woman must know for a fact that she's pregnant).</p>
<p>To explain my reference to PBA: if you are referring to authority in the field to define what terms to use (here: Emergency Contraception - though haven't yet provided a clear link to such a universal definition), than you would have to accept that another authority (legsilature) defines the terms in another field (law). I am only asking to find out whether you are consistent. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 02:00, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It can't even be morally equivalent because, even if I were to grant that EC is somehow abortion, there is necessarily a difference between knowingly aborting and potentially aborting. Consider that killing someone by shooting into a crowd at random is not the same thing as stalking that person and assassinating them. Anyhow, I've made my point here and will leave it for the legal scholars to debate elsewhere. As for PBA, it's a political term that has made its way into legislation. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 02:11, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Last time I checked, pregnancy was a medical, not clerical, term, so "is defined by the medical profession" is, at best, redundant, at worst, POV. Likewise, I know there's "pro-life" literature that equates EC with abortion, so I feel comfortable pointing out that this view is associated with that camp. I've explained why, on a logical basis, EC cannot qualify as abortion. Some people, unfortunately, are immune to logic. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 01:55, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Now, your recent reversion was wrong on many levels. I'll list some:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) The morning-after pill is just a larger dose of regular hormonal contraceptives. Women who are "on the pill" sometimes ovulate and that egg sometimes gets fertilized. It's not common, but it happens. When it does, the anti-implantation side-effect of the pill kicks in, preventing pregnancy.</dd>
<dd>2) Since when is zygote capitalized? Do we now worship the Holy Zygote?</dd>
<dd>3) Who defines pregnancy if not the medical community?</dd>
<dd>4) How can preventing a pregnancy be morally equivalent to ending one?</dd>
<dd>5) How can aborting a pregnancy be morally equivalent to possibly aborting one?</dd>
<dd>6) What makes you think you'll win an edit war here?</dd>

<dd>Alienus, Remove I dunno, about 80% of your comment here as it is uncivil, borderline personal attacks, and speaks very poorly of your character. We are NOT here to discuss our point of views, no matter how factual they are. It is an undsiputed fact, no matter whether they are right or wrong, that many people, smart, level headed people, consider EC the same question as Abortion (to wit, how much right do we have to prevent a new individual from occuring, that, barring accident and human inteference, might well exist).

<dd>well, i've jumped in and tried to tackle the factual, NPOV wording of the section in question. i'm not daily involved in this article. however, sometimes a 'fresh set of eyes' can interpret things differently than those wrapped up in it. i am neither pro-life nor pro-choice, since those are absurdely simplistic stereotypes; and while abortion is not exactly a nuanced issue, the range of people's emotions approaching it is. insisting that medical definitions are the only definitions that 'matter' is a POV, and an intolerant one at that. abortions were occurring long before doctors were treating mental illness with leeches, so let's not pretend that medical science is 'settled'. there, i had my say, on the discussion page, not in the article! <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 02:55, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Indeed, reversion is not the answer, which is why I've avoided reverting. Of course, when all someone does is revert your work to a state that you've already corrected, there's often nothing left to do but revert back.</p>
<p>And in that spirit, I've made some further changes to remove the bias and add some accuracy. First, most women who take EC wouldn't have become pregnant, so there's no net effect. Women can only become pregnant at certain parts of their menstrual cycle, after all, and a small leak in a condom isn't always suffcient, even assuming both people are fertile. Second, the morning after pill is just a larger dose of the regular contraceptive pill. In fact, sometimes it's physically the same pill, only the woman gets more than one. Other times, it's packaged for EC use and is a single pill with a dosage equivalent to a few days of regular pills. That's why it very often acts to prevent fertilization. When fertilization does occur then, just like with the regular pill, the hormones can prevent implantation. Finally, it would be NPOV to hide the fact that it's the pro-lifers who are most likely to equate EC with abortion.</p>
<p>I'd still love to hear whose definition of medical procedures we ought to use if not those of medical personnel. Please, I'm all ears.

<p>(lost in the indents, so I'm resetting) 1) I'm not even bringing up my stance on abortion because it just doesn't matter. What matters is that I care about the truth and dislike censorship. 2) I'd say that pro-life includes those people who oppose legistlation that forbids abortion, yet are themselves against it. However, the nuances of that position are best handled in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-life.html" title="Pro-life">pro-life</a> article, not here. 3) My question remains unanswered, so I'll ask it again: Am I nuts to think that equating EC with abortion is connected with opposing abortion?

As the <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_contraception.html" title="Emergency contraception">emergency contraception</a> article quotes, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists is on the record in claiming EC is abortion.

<dd>- Robert Maginnis, vice president of the Family Research Council said: "As far as we're concerned it causes an abortion to take place. It kills a human embryo."</dd>
<dd>- On 1997-FEB-25, the "Christian Medical &amp; Dental Society" (CDMS) of Bristol, TN issued a press release. Using the pro-life definition of pregnancy, they stated that "Contrary to the claims of some, the so-called 'morning-after pill' will dramatically increase - not decrease - the tragic number of abortions in this country. The public is being misled into believing that this concoction prevents a pregnancy when actually in most cases it will abort a pregnancy...Approving and promoting these pills is not only medically irresponsible, it is also sending the wrong message to the American public. Instead of promoting this as an alternative for family planning, we should be emphasizing sexual responsibility."</dd>

<dd>Generally speaking, I've tried to appear when a little balance needs to be sought on the page - I've scanned all the comments above, and read the offending portion of the article, and have the following comments to make:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First, the comment "in neither case does it qualify as abortion....." etc seems to me to be a sentence written in frustration over wanting to express one's view. Second, the pro-life reference even if true is unnecessary: this is not a social commentary. Third, if one looks at the wikipedia entry on <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a>, it admits in the article (which seems to be well written) that the definition of when pregnancy begins is a confusing issue; and it is important to note that despite the medical community's views on implantation, they date the start of a pregnancy from the last menstrual date OR the date of conception. The definition used is also one of the Western medical community; I am not knowledgeable to comment on the definitions used in other areas of the world, and do not presuppose they have adopted Western terminology. So let's keep wikipedia consistent, admit it is a contentious and unresolved issue outside of the medical community - and in that spirit, I propose the following (hopefully NPOV) rewrite:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Certain contraceptives (colloquially known as a "morning-after pill") may be used to provide <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_contraception.html" title="Emergency contraception">emergency contraception</a>. The pill works by either preventing fertilization of the ovum or implantation of the zygote. Although in Western medical communities implantation is often defined as the start of a pregnancy, for those who date pregnancy from conception this is seen as a form of abortion."</i></dd>

</dl>
</dd>

<p>(resetting indent) That's actually a very easy challenge to meet. See, there's the pro-choice side and the pro-life side, but there's also the medical side. The issue here is that, according to the medical side, CE is not abortion, but the pro-life side disagrees. The pro-choice side is sticking with the medical side, as should we. This is, first and foremost, an article about the medical procedure known as abortion. It is not the abortion debate article.</p>
<p>In any case, the language is pretty tortured right now, and part of my changes had been to correct this. I've put back the language-fixing parts and left out those parts still in dispute. However, I do not consider this dispute settled, and fully intend to replace the deleted parts once there is a consensus to do so.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to the question: What's wrong with admitting that equating EC with abortion is a pro-choice thing? I'm not even saying is exclusively so, just characteristically. In fact, I'm not the one saying it: I have citations from people like Hsu. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 09:03, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that this is not the abortion debate article.

I'm not sure if reliigious tolerance is considered a credible source, I'll get our refrence monkies to answer that question. Whats wrong with it, is that this, as you said is not the abortion debate article, and its not really useful.

<dd>You should address that to Anastrophe, who is arguing that any mention of the fact that equating EC with abortion is a pro-choice thing has to be somehow balanced by mentioning that the rest of the world doesn't see it that way. My view is that we should stick to the medical facts. If we want to speak of how some people interpret or disagree with these facts, we should attribute this so the bias can be noted. Imagine if the medical community said EC was abortion but the pro-choicers said otherwise. In that case, would it be balanced to say that some people disagree with the medical community, but not mention who? Same issue here, in reverse. One of the things we're NOT supposed to do is state things without attribution. In this case, we know precisely who to attribute this view to, so why are we afraid of doing so? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 09:15, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To explain slightly better. Religous conservatives tend to to equate contraception with abortion, as does Humanitus Vitae. However, so do some pro-choicers, except with a diffrent conclusion (women's rights) So now we have religious con, humanitus vitae, and feminists. Then we need to split religious cons into the applicable religions,, jsutarting with Xians: Xian Prod, Xian Ortho, Xian S. Bapt Xian N.

<dd>I seem to recall a number of feminist position statements along the lines of "Abortion is a woman's choice just like birth control.

Its not held solely by any one group, or even one end of the spectrum, its something that happens because people think in a certain way. Sometimes is just fine.

<p>Of course you could find a quote saying that women should have access to both contraception and abortion, but that doesn't in any way equate the two. For an example of equating, look at how the quoted pro-lifers equate EC with abortion by asserting that the former is an example of the latter. I don't know of anyone who says contraception is a type of abortion or abortion is a type of contraception. In short, I think your last change introduced an inaccuracy by reporting a view held by nobody. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 09:35, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>we have all seen this line of logic multiple times. Similarly, we also hear invective along the lines of "People want to take a way Abortion for the same reason they want to take away contraception, to keep women barefoot and pregnant. Likewise, Humanitas Vitae equates the two as a prevention of life. The view is held by various people on various sides.

<li>A woman has the right to do what she wants with her body</li>
<li>Abortion is a woman controlling her own body</li>
<li>Showing her face (as opposed to hiding it behind a veil) is a woman controlling her own body</li>
<li>Therefore, a woman showing her face is equatable with abortion</li>
</ol>
<p>As this argument shows, just because two things are listed under women's rights doesn't mean you can equate them. To equate is to say that one thing is an example of the other. Just because B and C are examples of A doesn't mean B is an example of C or C is an example of B.</p>
<p>In short, I question your logic. As for Humanitas Vitae, you'll need to show citations. In fact, you have a wonderful opportunity to add to Wikipedia, since this stance or group doesn't even have an article.</p>

<dd>I didn't say it was good logic, merely that its logic that has been provided.

<dd>I think I was the one who brought up the fact that the RCC opposes both contraception and abortion. It opposes them for the same reason, but does not equate them. In parallel, I think both okra and licorice taste bad, but I don't say the two are the same thing.</dd>
<dd>In other words, it's not that they're making a logic error andf you're neutrally reporting their stated view. Rather, it looks like you're making a logic error and therefore misreporting their view. This is precisely why I asked (and am still asking) for some sort of attribution. If you remember, I do have attribution for pro-lifers equating EC with abortion, so I'm on very solid ground here. As it stands, I think we'll need to fix that last sentence so as to remove a false claim.

<dd>Humanitas Vitae, as I recall (pardon me for not being able to slog through the latin quickly) does equate the two, as a violation of God's plan for sex, life, birth, etc. The reason they object stems from the same reason, a certain understanding about sex, life, etc. Say, The culture of life. As for the afor mentioned feminist argument, I am reasonably sure that feminsts have infact said that abortion and contraception are the same issue because its all about a woman's choice, sidestepping all other issues.

<p>The issue is magnitude. Your sentence reads "Both normal and emergency contraceptive use is sometimes equated to abortion." This makes it sound as if using contraception is morally equal. To understand why this is a misinterpretation, consider the fact that it's illegal to beat someone unconcious and also illegal to beat someone to death. Both are illegal for the same reason but the latter is considered to be more serious. In the same way, a priest would see the use of a condom as bad, but not nearly as bad as abortion. Now, perhaps you can find some Catholic master of hyperbole who says otherwise. If so, cite him and you're set. Alternately, change the text to read "The use of emergency contraception is considered by some to be a form of abortion", which is completely verifiable, as per Hsu. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 10:27, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not sure how the sentance endorses the moral equivlency view, merely notes it exists. It in fact, doesn't even say its morally equivlent, just that sometimes, it is equated. It speaks not of frequency other than an implied enough to be noticable. It doesn't say who, because as Iargued earlier, lots of people say so. I agree there is a question of magnitude, but lots of people don't. RCC for example, and Feminists groups for another. Most people probably fall inbetween.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 10:31, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See, now you're mixing up different issues. The original issue is that, as cited, many pro-lifers say that EC is abortion, based on their non-medical definition. In this way, they genuinely equate EC with abortion; no ambiguity here. However, your rewrite throws in prophylactic contraception along with emergency contraception, then equates <i>both</i> with abortion.</dd>
<dd>The only way to avoid outright error is to reinterpret this to mean that they are in some way morally equivalent, but even this is not supportable. Yes, the RCC says that all birth control (except for FA) is sinful, but I do not know of any support for the claim that they consider these in some way equal. Likewise, many pro-choicers (and not just feminists) say that the same underlying rights apply to all forms of birth control, but that still doesn't mean equating them. Basically, you've created a dilemma for yourself, where there are two interpretations available to you and neither one appears to be true.</dd>
<dd>At this point, I think the way to avoid the problem is to unsay the falsehood. Let's just change it so that it doesn't mention prophylactic contraception. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 10:41, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On moral equivalency of contraception/abortion from the Catholic point of view - the key point to remember is that any contraceptive pill (ie, the normal and emergency contraceptive) works by both inhibiting fertilization, and preventing implantation if fertilization occurs. As the Catholic church views life as beginning from conception, if fertilization occurs and implantation is prevented, then from the Church's point of view one has intentionally killed, or aborted, the new life, as in medical or surgical abortion. Thus, depending on the circumstances, contraception and abortion can be viewed on the same footing when a contraceptive works as an abortifacient.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 17:16, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's not factually correct. Hormonal contraception typically works by a belt-and-suspenders approach, in that it has multiple layers of defense against pregnancy. The first layer, which is usually all that's needed, is that ovulation is interfered with. Without ovulation, no egg is available for fertilization or implantation. The second layer is that it interferes with fertilization by causing cervical mucus to thicken, trapping incoming sperm. Only if these two fail, and only if the egg does happen to get fertilized, it can prevent pregnancy by interfering with implantation. In that last case, it would fit the clerical definition of abortion, though not the medical one. To complicate matters, there's more than just one type of pill and not all of them offer all modes of defense, so the argument may not hold universally. On top of that, there is the issue of probability that I raised earlier. Women are not given abortions unless they can show they're pregnant, which means that a woman asking for an abortion knows for sure that she is killing an embryo. In contrast, a woman taking hormonal contraception (either prophylactic or emergency) does not know for a fact that she is killing an embryo. Instead, she knows that the most likely effect is that she's preventing conception to begin with. This is even more likely with prophylactic use, of course, since there's no race to get into the ovary ahead of ovulation.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the correctness of the Catholic view is not the primary issue. What matters is whether there are valid citations to show that both forms of contraception are considered to be morally equivalent to abortion. I haven't seen any such thing thus far, however.</p>

<p>I asked for "citations to show that both forms of contraception are considered to be morally equivalent to abortion". You've offered citations to show that EC is considered (by religious/pro-life groups) to be a form of abortion. We already established this. In fact, this all started with my inclusion of a phrase pointing out that this view is generally held by pro-lifers, and I dug up the same links to defend it. Unfortunately, this simple fact kept being mistaken for POV. We <i>still</i> don't have anything that says that regular contraception is morally equivalent to abortion. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 20:21, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm back from my brief Wiki-break. Do I think pregnancy begins at implantation or conception? Definitely implantation. You can fertilize an egg in a Petri dish, but this doesn't make the dish pregnant. A pregnancy will never begin to progress if the egg doesn't implant somewhere. So, the issue, to me, is not whether emergency contraception is a form of abortion, but if denying the zygote the opportunity to implant is the moral, not medical, equivalent to evicting one that already has.</dd>
<dd>Alienus, I appreciate your enthusiasism for the subject. However, pitbull editing — clamping down on one thing and not letting go - is annoying and counterproductive no matter which POV it serves. I can understand the instinctive desire to not back down. Tznkai is a lot more moderate, and a lot better of a negotiator, than I am. I've become embroiled in edit wars which crossed well over 3RR, because I maintain both established consensus and article quality first, and try to accommodate and address minor complaints from editors unfamiliar to the article second. That said, I still don't see the purpose of stating that it's mostly pro-lifers who equate EC to abortion. The break-down of personal views on abortion is a lot more complex than just the pro-choice/pro-life dichotomy. In writing the "public opinion" section, I made a deliberate effort to sidestep the whole pro-choice/pro-life trap, and allow the bare figures to speak for themselves. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 01:15, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1) Pregnant petri dishes aside, these people really are saying that EC is abortion, not that it's morally equivalent. The latter could be argued for, I suppose, but the former is simply an error causes by a rejection of medical terminology motivated by ideology. In short, this may not be the issue to you, but it's the issue to them. Given that it's their issue because of their ideology, it seems to dishonest to mention their conclusion while concealing their motivation. I don't think we need to even spell it out, just mention that this is the official policy of various "pro-life" orgs. The reader can then draw inferences from this neutral, accurate information.</p>
<p>2) Yeah, I'm not really enthusiastic about this subject, but I do stick to my guns so long as they're loaded. If that makes me a pit bull in your eyes, so be it. Hell, I won't even take insult. However, I also don't see it as motivation to change my ways. Perhaps you can't teach an old pit bull new tricks. Then again, pit bulls have strong bites.</p>
<p>3) I prefer to avoid edit wars. However, I'd sooner fight one than back down when the facts show that I'm on the right side. In any case, as I comment elsewhere, I agree that the article starts off muddled and needs tightening. Such a process may well move this issue out of scope. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 05:05, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't have any enthusiasm about this subject, but I do tend to stick to my guns unless I find good reason not to.</p>
<p>The medical profession has embraced abortion and is pro-choice. If the establishment medical profession has that POV, it makes no less a POV. The POV that EC is not equivbalent to abortion, regardless of whether that POV is claimed to be based on science or medicine or whether it is the prevailing view, is a held by PRO-CHOICE people. So, if the EC issue must include references to the POV of those who make certain professional judgements (such as pro-life physicians who are pro-life BECAUSE THE SCIENCE in their view supports their conclusion about abortion or EC, etc), then all such POVs must be treated the same. In other words, the article must clarify that the medical definition was created or changed by pro-choice people. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a> 14:17, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>136..., that might be so, but we still need to stick with the common medical definition (with properly stating that it's the definition of the medical profession) and at the same time state what the moral issue is (and that defining pregnancy this or that way makes no difference morally). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 10:05, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"CONCEPTION is the implantation of the fertilized ovum." - from the ACOG Terminology Bulletin, Terms Used in Reference to the Fetus, Chicago, American College of Obstetrics ad Gynecology, No. 1, September 1965. This simply shows that as abortion and contraception began to become political issues, doctors who supported both started changing definitions to advance their moral and policy views by ensuring the science was re-framed to support those views.<a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a> 10:16, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here <a href="http://www.all.org/news/declife.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.all.org/news/declife.htm" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> is a well-documented article that explains the historical evolution of the terminology. The medical terminology was manipulated to coincide with the doctors personal moral views. Its simply factual - and while these definitions are now the prevailing view (because unlike the majority of people who do not morally support abortion on deamnd, the doctors who control the profession do), the genesis of the terms are relevant to note when discussing current definitions. The simple fact that such definitions are fluid is NOT POV - and it WILL appear in any neutral article.

<p>Fact: related definitions have been fluid. Fact: this fluidity has coincided with a public policy debate in which such definitions are crucial to winning that battle. Opinion: the definitions settled upon were not simply based on science but on advancing moral views about pregnancy, abortion, conception and sexual repoduction in general. Changing definitions indicates controversy and possible linguistic manipulation - very relevant when relying on new definitions so heavily to bolster certain views. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a> 12:02, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alright. Lets refocus here. This isn't about NPOV, this is about keeping the article focused properly. EC is not abortion. Some people think it is. We need to get people who think it should be here, to where it is. Meanwhile, it fits very nicely in the rubrick of the Pregnancy that ends/neverbegins but X happens is actuall called Y paragraph.

<dd>The current version is ok, but when I read it to a friend, they were confused about what sort of people might reject the medical definition of pregnancy. Only when I explained that this was a view strongly associated with pro-lifers did a light go on in their head. Currently, it reads "there are those who believe pregnancy should be measured from conception and consider emergency contraception to be a form of abortion". Perhaps we could clarify the basis for their rejection of medical definitions briefly enough that it doesn't derail the article, but instead illuminates a confusing portion. I'm not going to change the article right now, but let me offer a proposed change right here for feedback. How about, "there are people, often pro-life supporters, who believe pregnancy should be measured from conception and consider emergency contraception to be a form of abortion".

<dd>rather than reading one or two lines to a friend, why not let that person read <i>the whole article</i>, which discusses the abortion debate in some detail, thus rendering the "often pro-life supporters" a pointless POV addition. earlier you stated "The pro-choice side is sticking with the medical side, as should we.". is that a fact? i was under the impression that the pro-choice side of the issue had to do with the question of individual freedom/liberty - you know, CHOICE, not 'we stick with what doctors say'. I know personally someone who is pro-choice, but who still experienced regret and sadness after an abortion, because she still felt - even being pro-choice - that she was killing a potential person. but the reality of her situation did not allow (in her opinion) for the addition of a baby into her life, so she made a choice. it had nothing at all to do with what medicine says. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 23:58, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not really interested in arguing pro or con abortion, since it's irrelevant and POV to do so. What we need to do is focus on what the role of the doctors is.

<dd>Here's a thought - the EC page has a section on the controversy over its use and its definition as an abortion (which could definitely use some work, but I digress) - why not state for the record on this page in the abortion debate section that for many pro-life/religious groups emergency contraception is regarded as a form of abortion, because of the issue on when life/pregnancy begins, with a link to the EC page, and drop the reference entirely from the intro? I believe it was kyd who pointed out that the intro is a bit hap-hazhard, certainly by featured article standards - this would help remove clutter from the intro, and put the statement where it most likely belongs.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonaNobisPacem_dd38.html" title="User:DonaNobisPacem">DonaNobisPacem</a> 07:14, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have kept away from this page for a few days. I won't comment on some statements above that I think to be unwarranted but only comment on the version as it currently stands:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Pregnancy is defined by the medical community as beginning at the implantation of the embryo. ... Medically, the use of contraception (including emergency contraception) is not considered to be abortion; however, there are those who believe pregnancy begins at conception and consider emergency contraception to be a form of abortion."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am still not satisfied with this. We agree that the first sentence gives the medical definition as it now stands and as it has been adopted by medic's associations. They have done this for proper "technical" reasons. A woman that is pregnant is a woman who's carrying someone in side of her. They could have also taken "conception" (assumed it hasn't occured in the woman), as the embryo is already inside of her before implantation. But be that as it may, they have taken their choice, a reasonable one, and we should adhere to it.</p>
<p>However, the sentence "however, there are those" - though no incorrect word for word - is misleading. It suggests that a disagreement about the definition of pregnancy leads to an equation of "emergency contraception" with abortion. That's not true. Even if I accept the current medical definition of pregnancy, the ethical issue is not affected. The reason for considering the termination of an embryo pre-implantation as equivalent to terminating one post-implantation is not based on definitions of pregnancy but the defintion of when human life begins. Therefore my suggestion is to change the sentence into</p>
<dl>
<dd>"however, those who believe human life begins at conception, consider emergency contraception to equivalent to abortion."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I left out "ethically" or "morally" as Tnzkai suggested that there is another (practical) equivalence involved. I don't know what he meant and am asking him to explain.</p>
<p>Also note that "equivalence" is IMHO the more correct term. Yes, in common parlance one hear "is abortion", but I think that's a colloquial usage of abortion not entirely in line with the definition we give above and not based on any deeper reflections.</p>
<p>Two more things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the first sentence "Pregnancy is defined ..." should be moved down to stand immediately before the "Medically, the use of contraception ...", as it is not connected to "premature birth" or "still birth". Also, in moving it, we could make a better grammatical link to the "the use of contraception" bit, e.g. "Pregnancy is defined ... and hence the use of ...".</li>
<li>Can I please hear from those that have not spoken on this whether "emergency contraception" is a neutral or a contentious term and how we should use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your consideration. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 18:33, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One more thing: I'd prefer to change</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Medically, the use of contraception (including emergency contraception) is not considered ..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>to something like</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Medically, methods of birth control that prevent implantation, such as emergeny contraception, are not considered ..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>That IMO better clarifies the issue. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 18:59, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just taking a quick break from my studies to say that I fully agree with Str1977's suggestion. "Emergency contraception" is certainly not a neutral term. Contraception means "against conception", and it all hangs on what "conception" means. It was, AFAIK, traditionally always used to mean fertilization, although the latter is preferred in scientific text books, and the former is used more in religious texts. Since conception is not a medical term, it didn't have a precise medical definition, and, while it is still used to mean fertilization, but is also sometimes used to mean implantation. (Such a change would certainly seem politically motivated to me.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertilisation.html#Human_fertilisation" title="Fertilisation">extract in the Wikipedia Fertilization article</a> says:
<dl>
<dd><i>The term "conception" commonly refers to fertilization, but is sometimes defined as implantation or even "the point at which human life begins" and is thus a subject of semantic arguments within the abortion debate.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since the word "conception" has become controversial, then the expression "emergency contraception" must also be controversial. In my view, the traditional meaning (conception = fertilization) is still the more common one, as when a woman talks about conceiving on her wedding night.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also agree that "equivalent to" or "morally equivalent to " would be better than "a form of". And Str1977 is quite right in stating that the people who oppose anything that will prevent implantaion of the embryo are not motivated by the belief that "pregnancy" has started, but by the belief that "human life" has started. (The same people would oppose the destruction of test-tube embryos.) <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:49, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is the "emergency"? Medically, an emergency is an injury or illness that requires an urgent need of medical attention to alleviate an immediate threat to one's health.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> If a woman has sperm inside of her, medically speaking there is no emergency. There may be a personal desire to quickly address the matter, but is is NOT a medical emergency. Fertility is a sign of health. Contraception, medically speaking, is not actually health care - rather it is elective medical treatment (similar to elective medical treatment to make one look younger). Contraception by definition always inhibits the normal natural state of reproductive health. The exception is the rare case of a woman actually suffering from a medical condition that makes pregnancy dangerous to her health. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a> 09:46, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like the new intro guys! That reads a lot better.

<dd>Ha! Perhaps I should change my name to Tznkyd? The transplant is a little rough around the edges. The intro needs to be expanded, perhaps to cover more of the article, as the introductions to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">intelligent design</a> do. Also, the definitions section needs to be cleaned up a little, although I'm in no mood to do so right now. I'm moving onto unsafe abortion, for which I've been clamouring, because someone's gotta take the initiative. -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 20:31, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems obvious to you and to me sure, but others may talk about the "collapse of soceital values" or what not. My concern is in stating it X was caused by Y, we're supposed to cite why, and we've got another contentious debate waiting to happen in the intro.

<dd>Indeed, but I'd think that would fit snuggly and tie into (from their perspective) feminism. I don't see it expanding beyond that; but I cannot disagree a cite would be handy to have... moreso to keep it from being expanded upon and bloating the intro. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 21:40, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Image and link standards straw poll</span></h2>
<p>There has, for some time, been an informal rule, established in the practice of multiple users, prohibiting the inclusion of "shock images" in the article or links to external sites which contain such material (whether pro-choice or pro-life). Let's resolve this once and for and and seek to establish a hard consensus on the matter. Also, feel free to comment on what level of enforcement you believe would be appropriate, if any, such as whether any standards should apply only to this top-tier article or to all subjects throughout the abortion spectrum. Consider, too, the issue of context: could a "shock image," itself, be inappropriate, while an image of an activist holding a sign containing a shock image might not? -<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 04:31, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For clarity, this is what is to be understood as a "shock image":</p>
<ul>
<li>Alleged photographs of aborted fetuses sometimes used among pro-life advocates (<b>Warning:</b><a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/resources/photosassorted/" class="external text" title="http://www.priestsforlife.org/resources/photosassorted/" rel="nofollow">example</a>).</li>
<li>Alleged photographs of women who died from unsafe abortions sometimes used by pro-choice advocates (<b>Warning:</b> <a href="http://womenonwaves.org/article-1020.42-en.html" class="external text" title="http://womenonwaves.org/article-1020.42-en.html" rel="nofollow">example</a>).</li>

<p>First off, there is no need for a unique rule for this article. Checkout other wikipedia articles with shocking or graphic images or links: <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasectomy.html" title="Vasectomy">vasectomy</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castration.html" title="Castration">castration</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female_genital_cutting.html" title="Female genital cutting">Female genital cutting</a>, <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episiotomy.html" title="Episiotomy">episiotomy</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safe_sex.html" title="Safe sex">safe sex</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_implants.html" title="Breast implants">breast implants</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Lai_massacre_fb94.html" title="My Lai massacre">My Lai massacre</a>, <a href="../../../n/g/u/Nguyen_Ngoc_Loan_5afa.html" title="Nguyen Ngoc Loan">Nguyen Ngoc Loan</a>, <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching.html" title="Lynching">Lynching</a>, <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandan_Genocide_7e36.html" title="Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">Torture</a>. Billions of people embrace abortion. Billions of people abhor it. Hiding the details of what an abortion entails - the physical process by which it occurs - smacks of censorship and also paternalist protection. Are we really of the mind that people can't handle such links? Or that it is good to try to keep people away from such factual information? And if you find that pro-choice sights never provide such information, then all the more reason to wonder why their goal is to hide what occurs during an abortion. It is, after all, one of the most common surgeries there is. Seems that people ought ot have details about what happens when they visit the abortionist. Again, we are talking about LINKING to such information. People would have to opt in. Not sure why folks are against providing readers with more information. Is a <a href="http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/images/ency/00042992.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/images/ency/00042992.jpg" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> <b>sterile un-bloody medical drawing of how to conduct an abortion</b> a banned shock image? Is a <b>black and white fetal ultrasound</b> a banned shock image? In light of the controversy over the legality of abortion, why is it a good thing to hide the process by which an abortion is accomplished? It certainly seems that excluding factual scientific information because it disturbs some people's political views is not what we want as a policy. Why are we banning things that shock people? Is "how shocking" a criteria by which we ban information? I was shocked to see emaciated (walking skeletons) holocaust victims the first time. And amen! What a good thing that was - it helped me understand what the holocaust was. Why is "shocking" equated with "must not be seen since it HAS to be propganda and we can't have any of that"? Historicaly, some of the most shocking images have been the basis for people understanding an issue. And again, <b>the suggested policy won't even allow medical diagrams.</b></p>
<p>Sometimes pro-lifers also use shocking images of women maimed or killed through LEGAL abortion.<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.246.151.html" title="User:84.146.246.151">84.146.246.151</a></p>
<p>This vote is a false dichotomy. You are painting this as a vote that only impacts "gross-out" images - when in fact your view is that NO image at all of abortion or its by-products should be permitted. And you are hiding the fact that countless other wikipedia articles contain similar images and links. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.224.186.html" title="User:84.146.224.186">84.146.224.186</a></p>
<p>Kyd, the pro-life site you list is not of ALLEGED abortions, it contains ACTUAL abortions (see: Image of child aborted at 9 weeks <a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/resources/authentication/auth09w-2002-06.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.priestsforlife.org/resources/authentication/auth09w-2002-06.jpg" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>, authenticated by a pathologist).<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.206.84.html" title="User:84.146.206.84">84.146.206.84</a></p>
