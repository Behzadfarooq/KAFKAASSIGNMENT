<p>OK, let's work together; just popped by your new <a href="../../../p/u/g/Pugets_Sound_Agricultural_Company_f98e.html" title="Pugets Sound Agricultural Company">Pugets Sound Agricultural Company</a> and my first reaction is I'm pretty certain the primary title should be <a href="../../../p/u/g/Puget%27s_Sound_Agricultural_Company_b0da.html" title="Puget's Sound Agricultural Company">Puget's Sound Agricultural Company</a>, and there should probably be a redirect from <a href="../../../p/u/g/Puget_Sound_Agricultural_Company_1295.html" title="Puget Sound Agricultural Company">Puget Sound Agricultural Company</a>. There's quite a bit on this in that Akriggs book I mention on the Oregon etc pages; the PSAC owned land around Victoria, also, and kept on functioning as a corporate entity there even after the founding of the Colony of Vancouver Island (1849). If you're a student, you might want to ask your librarian to use interlibrary loan to get the <i>British Columbia Chronicle</i> by Helen B. Akrigg and G.P.V. Akrigg, Discovery Press, Vancouver, and read both volumes cover to cover, although for pre-colonial history only Vol. 1 need apply. Also recommended just as a great read, but also involving cross-border territorial/colonial politics, is D. Hauka's <i>McGowan's War</i> (cf. <a href="../../../m/c/g/McGowan%27s_War_3b62.html" title="McGowan's War">McGowan's War</a>) and <a href="../../../o/k/a/Okanagan_Trail_2b00.html" title="Okanagan Trail">Okanagan Trail</a>.. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 20:49, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a user who posted nasty stuff in the Oregon Country: talk page - Skookum1 - I'm sure you remember <i>him</i>... (sigh) who is part of a contingency of Canadians who are doing personal attacks, deleting my edits, and generally making a hard time for any perspective on any pages that there is Canadian/American content on (I was actually surprised to accidentally run into his spat with you and his totally disrespectful exchanges with you). But it makes sense that he is having spats with others on other pages, as he has been one of a couple people that has started a full blown attack on me. I would appreciate some help (or advice) in stopping "these people" (there are a handful of them that associate with him) from their constant harassment of me (including the fact that they are enlisting Canadian big guns to try to threaten me or get me blocked). I mean, don't you get SICK of it? It's borderline psychotic if not totally retarded behavior. Thanks. A fellow American who is fed up. - Donteatyellowsnow 03:53, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I posted this on my page. But I'll post it here in case you aren't looking there:</dd>

<dd>Thank you so much! (sigh) That is exactly what I HAVE been doing (what you are suggesting), but he and his buddies have gotten so brazen that they just delete anything I add and even if I make laborious citations (i.e. every single sentence!) And yet when I have questioned their sources (some of which are actually entitled "Useless Facts" when you click on the Internet link) then they DO NOTHING. It's too funny, but not... because these people are a pain in the neck to deal with. - Donteatyellowsnow 04:17, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ironically Donteatyellow is the only one who has been blocked by Wikipedia out of all in this so called 'contingency'. Take a look at my <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELangara_College_ac2a.html" title="User:Langara College">User:Langara College</a> history to see vandalism done by him as well as an automated complete index of warnings given to Donteatyellow on his time at Wikipedia. Most of his citations don't even cite the statements or words he's using them for and naturally they're deleted as most cases they're heavily biased for example "Canadians have self titled themselves Hollywood North" etc. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELangara_College_ac2a.html" title="User:Langara College">Langara College</a> 02:47, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No problem, glad you noticed! I've become a bit obsessed with improving citations…good citations make it so much easier for one editor to build on another's work.</p>
<p>Also, I was going to ask you - can you take a look at <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oregon_Constitution_1255.html" title="Oregon Constitution">Oregon Constitution</a> sometime? Seems pretty sub-standard for such an important topic. But I don't know nearly enough about the thing to jump in and start editing.

<p>Thanks for the note. I am sorry if I suggested that you considered the matter canvassing because I realize that you did not. And I don't think that I will use that word again in relation to this episode. The post that I wrote before I saw your response to DEYS called his actions "recruiting" but I though as a plain English word, canvassing sounded milder. In any event, I was pretty specific about what was wrong with DEYS actions and that it had nothing to do with WP:CANVAS. He invited an editor to come to his dispute with Skookum1 on the basis of their supposed enmity towards him. He did that twice before your message to him, which advised he e-mail instead and he certainly e-mailed at least one more user. As I said, this is the worst behaviour that I have seen from a legitimate user in my year and a half with the project. And DEYS maintains that he did nothing wrong. His response, besides "he got me fist" was that he came across the users by accident, as though that was the problem.</p>
<p>I agree with you that some of the other users have made troublesome comments. I did say something to Skookum1 because his behaviour was not acceptable, although he already knew it. I do often tell other users to mind the civility if I think that they are uninformed or unaware. I had considered saying something when the excessive warnings were being posted on his talk page. Ultimately I didn’t because I thought that DEYS would take it is message that his actions were acceptable and the others were not. He seems to see WP as a zero-sum experience. But I probably should have said something and I probably will. Thanks. --<a href="../../../j/g/g/User%7EJGGardiner_acaa.html" title="User:JGGardiner">JGGardiner</a> 21:24, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I should note, that my mention of a third e-mailed request by DEYS was mistaken. DEYS had merely assumed that an editor contacting him wanted to talk about the issue. I mistook his response to a perceived solicitation to be a solicitation of its own. Sorry about that. --<a href="../../../j/g/g/User%7EJGGardiner_acaa.html" title="User:JGGardiner">JGGardiner</a> 22:44, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the note AM. Actually I think that your involvement has been quite helpful. I remember I gave DEYS some friendly advice early on about getting stuck in a rut and I think all of the users at HN have been. Sometimes after a while it is hard to see the forest beyond the trees and it helps to have an "outside" user remind you of the basics. If you want to contribute to the article or the discussion in the future, I'd certainly be happy to have your input. Sometimes it is better to be in up to your ankles than up to your elbows. --<a href="../../../j/g/g/User%7EJGGardiner_acaa.html" title="User:JGGardiner">JGGardiner</a> 05:32, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem, I've seen your busy work. I made the new one for <a href="../../../w/p/o/WP%7EWPOR_1de0.html" title="WP:WPOR">WP:WPOR</a> so we can have something to reward/encourage so we don't lose too many people. So pass it along if you see others in the project doing good work. Plus I think you might have better editing software where you might be able to make it look like the gold pioneer is holding the barnstar by a ribbon or something. If you have time/feel like it. I have a few Oregon pages on my watchlist, but I don't get too much into the government and transportation areas, and I'm sure there are people doing good work there. <a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAboutmovies_2e04.html" title="User:Aboutmovies">Aboutmovies</a> 20:19, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I see we're not getting anywhere in the lattice discussion. I nominated the article for deletion since it stagnated as a wikispam article for far too long. If the people who know [or can cite] things about the company didn't want to clean the article up it shouldn't have stayed the way it was, hence the AfD.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, after the AfD the article was cleaned up. It wasn't the right way to go about promoting change, and for that I apologize. But I won't stand for some lame argument that I have a COI against anyone in my field. I find it insulting that you question my objectivity or purpose. The only thing that went through my head when I read the article as it was, was "this is spam." not "omg I gotsta destroy mein enemies!"</p>
<p>Eitherway, if it's Wiki policy not to edit articles in your field, I guess I'll go vandalize articles about banana board surfing or something. Unless you can cite revisions I've made to articles of "competitors" or otherwise, that show a bias or tendency to vandalize articles because of a COI I think you should stop insulting me with your vague tones. Just because we work in related fields (Lattice makes FPGAs, we just use them) doesn't mean I can't be objective, and even though you can label it with a wiki COI doesn't mean the revisions are specifically inappropriate (although I agree the AfD was, the ends don't justify the means, but one bad edit doesn't a vandal make).</p>

<dd>Thanks for taking care of that, and for the offer to use your database access in the future. Maybe you can help me understand the lay of the land a little better: that thing that's linked to, is it properly called the "court case?" It seems (to my layman eyes) a little different from opinions I've seen published on other cases, in that it provides a lot of context and procedural background. Is this something that's prepared for all cases, or only those that are of broad public interest? -<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteforsyth_da42.html" title="User:Peteforsyth">Pete</a> 19:53, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In reference to your changes to the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soloflex.html" title="Soloflex">Soloflex</a> article. I referenced the police records of the Hillsboro police department for the robbery. How is that not a reference? I don't get it. As far as the other stuff.... the entire article has no reference... why have you not deleted the entire thing? Can I reference myself? I am a first hand witness and I have interviewed my father who is mentioned in the article and worked at Soloflex.</p>
<p>Your link to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> seems to only focus on other printed material.
