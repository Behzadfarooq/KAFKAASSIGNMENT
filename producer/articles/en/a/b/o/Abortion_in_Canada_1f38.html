<p><b>Abortion in Canada</b> is not limited by law. While some non-legal obstacles exist, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> is one of only a few nations with no <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_law.html" title="Abortion law">legal restrictions</a> on <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a>, and access there is still among the most liberal in the world.</p>
<p>Polls continue to show that a majority of Canadians believe abortion should remain legal in some circumstances (<i>see</i> <a href="#Opinion_polls" title="">Opinion polls</a>, below). Over 110,000 abortions are performed in Canada every year. 90% of abortions are performed in the first <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trimester.html" title="Trimester">trimester</a>, with just 2 to 3% performed after 16 weeks.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_in_Canada_1f38.html" title="Edit section: Legality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legality</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_Canada_1283.html" title="Supreme Court of Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> has deemed abortion a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminal_Law_4aea.html" title="Criminal Law">Criminal Law</a> matter that is within Federal jurisdiction. Consequently, Provincial Legislatures have very little power to regulate abortion, even if done indirectly. Thus, the discussion on the law on abortion in Canada turns almost entirely around the state of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Section 287 of the Criminal Code is the abortion provision drafted by <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Trudeau_6783.html" title="Pierre Trudeau">Trudeau</a> and passed in 1969. Prior to 1969, taking steps to cause an abortion was an offence liable to life imprisonment. However, the Trudeau scheme made an exception for abortions performed in a hospital with the approval of that hospital’s three-doctor therapeutic abortion committee. The committee would have to certify that the pregnancy would be likely to endanger the life or health of the mother. The term health was not defined, and therapeutic abortion committees were free to develop their own theories as to when a likely danger to “health” (which might include psychological health) would justify a therapeutic abortion.</p>
<p>In 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada in the <a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._v._Morgentaler_b1c6.html" title="R. v. Morgentaler">Morgentaler</a> decision declared this entire section to be of no force or effect because it was held to violate section 7 of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms_50c7.html" title="Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>. Section 7 states that: “Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and the security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.”</p>
<p>The majority of the Court held that “the structure of the system regulating access to therapeutic abortions is manifestly unfair. It contains so many potential barriers to its own operation that the [exception] it creates will in many circumstances be practically unavailable to women who would prima facie qualify”. As such, the provision was held to violate the principles of fundamental justice and was struck down, leaving Canada with a legislative vacuum to this day.</p>
<p>The court did not consider the question of whether the unborn were included in the “everyone” who have the right to life. The court was to hear Borowski later that week with that very question as the central issue, but the case was rendered moot by the decision in Morgentaler which struck down the provisions that were to be challenged. The court has never considered the issue. Early attempts to fill the legislative vacuum failed politically, and no government has since dared to touch the issue.</p>
<p>The majority of the Court in Morgentaler did not go so far as to find that section 7 contains a substantive right to abortion. The seeds of this argument are arguably found in the decision, but as such, it was only explicitly argued by <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertha_Wilson_9bbe.html" title="Bertha Wilson">Wilson</a> J and not for the majority of the court. Strictly speaking, the court found it unnecessary to consider whether the substance of section 7 implies a right to abortion, but instead made its decision on narrow and merely procedural grounds. The practical result is that it is still open to Parliament to impose some restrictions on abortion within the present jurisprudence and without the use of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Section_Thirty-three_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms_7262.html" title="Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">Notwithstanding clause</a>. However, such restrictions would surely be met with vehement opposition, and the Court could very well explicitly read-in a right to abortion into the Charter in a future decision. On the other hand, a future court could echo the dissent of <a href="../../../g/%C3%A9/r/G%C3%A9rard_La_Forest_c509.html" title="Gérard La Forest">La Forest</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_McIntyre_5f60.html" title="William McIntyre">McIntyre</a> JJ or go further: “The proposition that women enjoy a constitutional right to have an abortion is devoid of support in the language of s. 7 of the Charter or any other section.”</p>
<p>The end result, then, is that there is no Criminal regulation of abortion in Canada.</p>
<p>The case of Chantale Daigle (<i><a href="../../../t/r/e/Tremblay_v._Daigle_a1d0.html" title="Tremblay v. Daigle">Tremblay v. Daigle</a></i> [1989] 2 SCR 530) is one of the most widely publicized cases concerning abortion in Canada after the law regarding abortions was thrown out by the Supreme Court of Canada. It went before the Supreme Court of Canada in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>. Daigle's ex-boyfriend obtained a restraining order against her having an abortion. While the restraining order was issued in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a>, it was legally restricting Canada-wide. The case came before the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled that only the woman could make the choice; the father had no legal say in a woman's choice to terminate a pregnancy or carry it to completion.</p>
<p>Daigle had already had a late second-term abortion before the ruling of the Court. While the case was fast-tracked, the progress was so slow that a <a href="../../../l/a/t/Late-term_abortion.html" title="Late-term abortion">third-trimester abortion</a> would have been required had Ms Daigle waited for the ruling to be handed down. The fact that Daigle had an abortion, in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, while the case was before the Supreme Court of Canada was not made public until after the ruling, although it was not unexpected. This is in contrast to the <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_v._Wade_9976.html" title="Roe v. Wade">Roe v. Wade</a> case in the United States where Roe was forced to carry the baby to term. That case, however, was different from the Daigle case in that it was about whether abortion was legal. In the Daigle case, the question was whether a male partner has an equal say in whether a woman can obtain an abortion.</p>
<p>There have been several cases since then that have confirmed the decision of the court in <i>Daigle</i>.</p>

<p>Abortions in Canada are provided on request and funded by <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicare_%28Canada%29_2c12.html" title="Medicare (Canada)">Medicare</a>, to Canadian citizens and permanent residents (as with most medical procedures) in <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospitals</a> across the country. Abortion funding for hospitals comes from the various provincial governments (their overall health expenses are however paid for in part by the federal government). One-third of hospitals perform abortions, and these perform two-thirds of abortions in the country. The remaining abortions are performed by public and private-for-profit clinics.</p>

<p>While the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada_9fbb.html" title="Provinces and territories of Canada">provinces</a> are required by the federal government to fund abortion clinics fully, Quebec and <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_Scotia_7d1d.html" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> provide only limited funding, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Brunswick_a9a1.html" title="New Brunswick">New Brunswick</a> provides no funding for clinics.</p>
<p>Until 2004, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba.html" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> did not fund private abortion clinics. However, in July of 2004 the province's only private abortion clinic was purchased by a non-profit organization, which then successfully sued the provincial government to pay for abortion procedures there. In December of 2004, a Manitoba judge ruled that the province must pay for all therapuetic abortions.</p>
<p>In 2004, Dr. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Morgentaler_237e.html" title="Henry Morgentaler">Henry Morgentaler</a> launched a judicial battle against the New Brunswick government, seeking to have abortion recognized as a constitutional right under the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms_50c7.html" title="Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">Canadian Charter</a>.</p>
<p>Access in rural and northern areas, and especially in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Edward_Island_24cf.html" title="Prince Edward Island">Prince Edward Island</a> (PEI), is often restricted by the lack of nearby facilities, requiring women to travel long distances (often at their own expense) to obtain an abortion. Some hospitals refuse to perform abortions on out-of-province patients, in contravention of the <i>portability</i> requirement of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_Health_Act_4e8f.html" title="Canada Health Act">Canada Health Act</a>. This can be especially troublesome for women in PEI, where no facilities currently perform abortions.</p>
<p>A doctor's referral is not necessary, although an independent <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultrasound.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> usually needs to be done. The number of Canadian medical schools that give instruction in abortion procedures is decreasing, which could potentially create a shortfall in medical personnel skilled in this area.</p>
<p>Third-trimester abortions are not generally available. For instance, in Quebec, there is currently no doctor who will perform a third-term abortion unless the health of the woman is in great peril or there is a <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetic_disorder.html" title="Genetic disorder">genetic disorder</a>. Currently the province sends women who seek to have third-term abortions performed to the United States. Quebec is currently actively looking to hire a doctor to do third-term abortions, but has not been successful as of October 2004.</p>
<p>Access in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> (BC) is governed by the <i><a href="../../../a/c/c/Access_to_Abortion_Services_Act_f979.html" title="Access to Abortion Services Act">Access to Abortion Services Act</a></i>, which limits political demonstrations outside of abortion-providing facilities, doctor's offices, and doctor's homes to set distances.</p>

<p>Abortion was completely banned in Canada in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>. As in other countries, illegal abortions were still performed, leading to the deaths of many women every year. An early example received much attention during the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_trial_of_Emily_Stowe_83f1.html" title="Abortion trial of Emily Stowe">abortion trial of Emily Stowe</a> (1879). Another such case, <i><a href="../../../a/z/o/Azoulay_v._The_Queen_4e21.html" title="Azoulay v. The Queen">Azoulay v. The Queen</a></i>, reached the Supreme Court in 1952. In <a href="../../../1/8/9/1892.html" title="1892">1892</a>, abortion and the advertisement and distribution of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contraception.html" title="Contraception">contraception</a> were made illegal in Canada.</p>
<p>The movement to liberalize Canada's abortion laws began in the 1960s. Then Justice Minister <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Trudeau_6783.html" title="Pierre Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a> introduced a bill in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> (amendment to Section 251 of the Canadian Criminal Code). The bill passed and became law in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, and provided for abortions when the health of the woman was in danger as determined by a three-doctor hospital committee. However, abortion still remained in the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminal_Code_of_Canada_90bb.html" title="Criminal Code of Canada">Criminal Code of Canada</a>, unlike the U.S. law where, after <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_v._Wade_9976.html" title="Roe v. Wade">Roe v. Wade</a> in early 1973, abortion was no longer illegal. This same bill also legalized <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contraception.html" title="Contraception">contraception</a>, and would be the subject of one of Trudeau's most famous quotations: "The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation."</p>
<p>While many Canadians opposed the liberalization of abortion laws, others believed that the law did not go far enough, and that the rulings of the three-doctor committees were inconsistent and often untimely (taking perhaps several weeks). A <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> doctor, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Morgentaler_237e.html" title="Henry Morgentaler">Henry Morgentaler</a>, not wanting to break the law, initially turned away women seeking abortions from his practice. Soon, however, he could not stand the suffering and desperation of those women; and he began performing safe abortions in his clinic in contravention of the law. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, Morgentaler stated publicly that he had performed 5,000 abortions without the permission of the three-doctor-committees, even going so far as to <a href="../../../v/i/d/Videotape.html" title="Videotape">videotape</a> himself performing operations.</p>
<p>The Quebec government took Morgentaler to court twice, and both times juries refused to convict him despite his outright admission that he had performed many abortions. The government appealed one acquittal, and the appeal court overturned the jury's verdict. Morgentaler was sentenced to 18 months in jail. Public outcry over the appeal court's decision caused the federal government to pass a law (commonly known as the Morgentaler Amendment) preventing appeal courts from overturning a jury's not-guilty verdict. Morgentaler was again acquitted at a third trial, causing the Quebec government to declare the law unenforceable.</p>
<p>Morgentaler's struggle prompted a nation-wide movement to reform Canada's abortion laws. In 1970, 35 women, including Jackie Larkin, chained themselves to the parliamentary gallery in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_House_of_Commons_f3ab.html" title="Canadian House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, closing Parliament for the first time in Canadian history.</p>
<p>Upon his release from prison in Quebec, Morgentaler decided to challenge the law in other provinces. Over the next 15 years, he opened and operated private abortion clinics across the country in direct violation of the law. Following a fourth jury acquittal in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, the federal government appealed the decision, and the appeals court reversed the decision.</p>
<p>Morgentaler, in turn, appealed to the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_Canada_1283.html" title="Supreme Court of Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a>. In a landmark decision, the Court declared in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> the entirety of the country's abortion law to be unconstitutional. The court noted that "[f]orcing a woman, by threat of criminal sanction, to carry a foetus to term unless she meets certain criteria unrelated to her own priorities and aspirations" and that the law "asserts that the woman's capacity to reproduce is to be subject, not to her own control, but to that of the state" were essentially a breach of the woman's right to <a href="../../../s/e/c/Section_Seven_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms_e425.html#Security_of_the_person" title="Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">security of the person</a>, which is guaranteed under Canada's <i><a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms_50c7.html" title="Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a></i>.</p>
<p>The Court also found that the procedural requirements to obtain an abortion, as set forth in the law, were especially troublesome. Only accredited or approved hospitals could perform abortions, which imposed a barrier to local access. The law also specified that women wanting an abortion were required to consult a "Therapeutic abortion committee" (TAC), a committee of at least four physicians appointed by the hospital's board of members. The court found that the TAC was deeply flawed, in part because of the long delays caused by the TAC and that in many hospitals, the TAC were merely committees on paper and did not actually perform abortions.</p>
<p>In its decision (<i><a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgentaler_et._al._v._Her_Majesty_The_Queen_d627.html" title="Morgentaler et. al. v. Her Majesty The Queen">Morgentaler et. al. v. Her Majesty The Queen</a></i> [1988] (1 S.C.R. 30) at 37), the Court stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The right to liberty... guarantees a degree of personal autonomy over important decisions intimately affecting his or her private life. ... The decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is essentially a moral decision and in a free and democratic society, the conscience of the individual must be paramount to that of the state."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A large part of why the Supreme Court of Canada ruled against the abortion law in 1988 had to do with how amendments to the criminal code that allowed abortions (amendment to Section 251) the law worked. In order to have an abortion, a woman had to first have a doctor who was willing to give her information on the topic and refer her to another doctor, or to take the case him or herself. The abortion then had to be approved by a hospital's <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therapeutic_Abortion_Committee_9666.html" title="Therapeutic Abortion Committee">Therapeutic Abortion Committee</a> (commonly known as a TAC), which was composed of three doctors. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-life.html" title="Pro-life">Pro-life</a> groups attempted at times to have their members become the members of the TAC so that the hospital would no longer perform abortions.</p>
<p>The court noted that it was mostly always men that were deciding if a woman should have an abortion. Also, because some pro-life doctors would not take any case to a TAC, or would only take a very severe case, and because some of these doctors would not even refer a women to a doctor who would present the case to the TAC, there were barriers to women who wanted to have their applications considered by a TAC. It could take a long time for a woman to find a doctor that would take her case to the TAC. Finally, the TAC had to decide on each request for an abortion. These factors resulted in a time lag that meant that abortions were being performed much later than they could have been.</p>
<p>The Court also recognized that the rules resulted in varying levels of abortion availability, depending on the city, province or territory. The law also resulted in <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_class.html" title="Middle class">middle class</a> and affluent women having better chances to obtain an abortion. The existence of private clinics meant that women who had enough money could bypass the TAC system completely.</p>
<p>The court did, however, encourage the government to introduce a new and improved abortion law, which it attempted to do in 1989. This new bill, which threatened doctors with a two-year jail term if they approved an abortion when the woman's health was not in danger, was widely and loudly condemned by the country's doctors. While the bill was approved by the Canadian House of Commons, it was defeated in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Senate_c1b3.html" title="Canadian Senate">Senate</a> by a tie vote. This failure prompted the government to give up on legislating abortion entirely, leading to the unique situation of Canada having no abortion law whatsoever. Between the time the law was passed in the House of Commons and the time it was defeated in the senate, a 20-year-old student at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Waterloo_4517.html" title="University of Waterloo">University of Waterloo</a> bled to death after trying to perform an abortion on herself -- the first such case in years.</p>
<p>Some of the private abortion clinics that have been set up by Morgentaler since the Supreme Court decision were opened to challenge provincial law on the medical financing of abortions in private clinics.</p>

Traditionally, more Liberal members are pro-choice than pro-life, and more Conservative members are pro-life than pro-choice. The ambiguity in the official stances of these two main parties has occasionally created disputes within the parties.</p>
<p>The recently-formed Conservative Party has, for instance, had to wrestle with combining the conflicting social policies of its two predecessor parties, the moderate <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_d0d3.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Canada">Progressive Conservative Party of Canada</a> and the more right-wing <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Alliance_ea7c.html" title="Canadian Alliance">Canadian Alliance</a>.

In the March 2005 policy convention, in a narrow vote, the party voted to not introduce legislation on the subject of abortion.

<p>The Liberal Party, on the other hand, has a pro-life caucus which, while not publicly fighting to change party policy, has created a degree of uncertainty in how the party would handle the issue were it to be brought up in Parliament. Former <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Canada_02d6.html" title="Prime Minister of Canada">Prime Minister</a> and Liberal leader <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Martin_629b.html" title="Paul Martin">Paul Martin</a> has indicated he would protect a woman's right to choose, but to what degree he would go in forcing his party to do so is not clear. Proof of the pro-life opinions within the Liberal party, Liberal MP Paul Steckle introduced in June 2006 a bill<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> that if passed, would make abortion after 20 weeks gestation a criminal act.

<p>Although the issue of abortion rights has popped up from time to time in Federal elections as a <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedge_issue.html" title="Wedge issue">wedge issue</a>, the issue is consistently rated as a low priority for most Canadians.

<p>Most Canadians oppose the pro-life movement's goal to make abortion illegal. In that sense, it might be said that Canadians are generally pro-choice; however some polls suggest that Canadians may favour some legal restrictions on abortion.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a <a href="../../../l/%C3%A9/g/L%C3%A9ger_Marketing_7aff.html" title="Léger Marketing">Léger</a> poll taken September <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, 46.6% of respondents say they are personally "for" abortion, while 37.6% say they are personally "against" abortion.

The results showed that 32% of Canadians believed abortion should be legal in all circumstances (down from 37% in 2000), 52% believed abortion should only be legal in certain circumstances and 14% thought abortions should be illegal in all circumstances, (up 9% from 2000).</li>
</ul>

<li>In a Léger poll taken January <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, 47% of respondents said abortion was "not immoral," while 41.8% said it was.</li>

<li>A poll in October <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> conducted by Leger asked about prenatal legal protection, and several abortion-related topics, 63% said they favoured legal protection for human life before <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth.html" title="Birth">birth</a> and 69% favour informed consent legislation on abortion.</li>

<p>While the absence of any law forbidding abortion could give the impression that the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-choice.html" title="Pro-choice">pro-choice movement</a> would be satisfied with the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_quo.html" title="Status quo">status quo</a>, the pro-choice movement is still quite active as it wants all abortions to be fully funded with government funds, and it wants abortion to be easily available everywhere in Canada, instead of being mostly concentrated in large urban centres.</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisis_pregnancy_center.html" title="Crisis pregnancy center">"Crisis pregnancy centres"</a> and other offices provide counselling to pregnant women have been established by pro-life organizations such as "Birthright". These organizations, as part of their counselling, provide pregnant women with alternative choices to abortion. The advertising for these offices discloses neither the identity of the sponsoring organization, nor the motives on which these services operate; but under government legislation, the counsellors are not permitted to directly advise an individual to not obtain an abortion. However, in recent years, a trend has emerged in the United States in which such centres offer free ultrasounds to the woman, on the premise that seeing a picture of the fetus will make her less willing to consider abortion. There is also considerable controversy surrounding this move, as the volunteer performing the sonogram is typically not a trained medical professional, and may cause some injury to a woman in the process. Moreover, there is a greater chance of the woman suffering emotional trauma due to such interventions, possibly requiring psychological counselling afterward.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church in Canada has been an outspoken critic of abortion and a strong proponent for the rights of unborn children. According to the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, "Abortion is killing Canada's future" <a href="http://www.cccb.ca/PublicStatements.htm?CD=549&amp;ID=1839" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cccb.ca/PublicStatements.htm?CD=549&amp;ID=1839" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Statistics show that the number of children being born in Canada will not allow it to sustain its numbers. This is, however, a secondary issue. The main issue is that The Catholic Church in Canada and around the world considers abortion a serious evil, an issue explored at length in <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_II_390d.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a>'s encyclical <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelium_Vitae_81b5.html" title="Evangelium Vitae">Evangelium Vitae</a>.</p>
