<p><b>By the end of week 8, the embryo is a fetus</b> with many organs fully functioning (which means mega-differentiation has already occurred, folks). See the Webster's Medical Dictionary definitions posted below. Regardless, the embryo and fetus is, medically speaking, human and alive, and must be killed for there to be an abortion, according to the medical definition of induced abortion (the main topic of this article). The biology here is not at issue. A living human organism exists. Abortion is the killing of that organism to rid the mother of having to carry it. Why is there an attempt to hide that medical fact? A vast majority of abortions are done AFTER 8 weeks, after the developing human has developed into a fetus. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 17:40, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Based on medical definitions, we will need to adjust the definition of <b>spontaneous abortion</b>. A natural loss of pregnancy <b>after</b> 12 weeks gestation, is NOT a spontaneous abortion - rather it is a <b>stillbirth</b>. The term <b>miscarriage</b> includes <b>both</b> spontaneous abortion <b>and</b> stillbirth. The term <b>abortion</b> does not apply to miscarriages after 12 weeks. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 13:55, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In this case not only the medical definitions of the words, but also the connotations to non-medical people must be taken into account. If this article was written using medical terminology it would not only be unreadable but would be misinterpreted by non-medical people. This is why "unborn human " is innapropriate. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaully_efd5.html" title="User:Spaully">Spaully</a> 12:41, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>From both the lay view and (as the medical definitions above demonstrate) also from the medical view, the use of "unborn child", "human", "dead" or "alive", etc., is appropriate. In fact, "unborn", "baby", "dead", "alive", are very common when lay people discuss miscarriage, stillbirth, pregnancy and fetal development - and l Lay people infrequently use the term fetus or embryo. So, in sum, the most commonly understood parlance in both lay and medical contexts uses the terms "unborn", "baby", "dead", "alive", etc. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 14:06, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hear unborn a lot, but baby, dead, alive, clump of cells, blatocystes, those are terms used by POV'rs. Fetus is an exceelent NPOv, since everyone knows what it means without any connotation. Unborn is often a misnomer, since many unborn end up miscarried. Lay people are pretty smart and use fetus often.

<p>RoyBoy - you are pretending that pregnant women and friends don't use unborn, etc. more frwquently than fetus, etc.&#160;? Same with Ob/Gyns when talking to pregnant patients and their friends? That, my friend, is just a ridiculous attempt to try to win this point despite logic. The last time a friend of yours lost a baby due to miscarraige, did you discuss the termination of her pregnancy or did you talk about the sad death of her unborn baby? Your pretense at "we're just trying to be neutral" strains credulity. In fact, you are just trying to use the pro-abortion euphemisms and make them seem normal. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 06:15, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>LoL! How wonderously twisted your line of thought is; I suggest from now on you ask questions first; make accusations later... it will make you more civil, and look more reasonable. Unborn, I have little issue with that word; certainly better than the "pre-born" garbage you were supporting. As to losing a baby, child to miscarriage; if it was her intent to have the baby then indeed it was a loss of those expectations, and if she chooses to use those words then that is what it meant <b>to her</b>. But very simply her emotional expectations are not in support of your position, and it is not difficult to imagine her (and our) sense of loss and tragedy would be more profound if the child was born and then died. Your point has little merit, and for the record I do not consider pro-abortion euphemisms normal; just check the archived response I gave to nadsat on non-viable. A conversation I very well may lose; but one I want to explore for our mutual benefit; rather than to persecute and label someone. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 16:15, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">WHO about UNSAFE ABORTIONS</span></h4>
<p>"Unsafe abortion is entirely preventable. Yet, it remains a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in much of the developing world. Over the past decade, the World Health Organization has developed a systematic approach to estimating the regional and global incidence of unsafe abortion and the mortality associated with it. Estimates based on figures for the year 2000 indicate that 19 million unsafe abortions take place each year, that is, approximately one in ten pregnancies end in an unsafe abortion, giving a ratio of one unsafe abortion to about seven live births. Almost all unsafe abortions take place in developing countries. Women who resort to unskilled or untrained abortion providers put their health and life at risk. Worldwide an estimated 68 000 women die as a consequence of unsafe abortion. In developing countries the risk of death is estimated at 1 in 270 unsafe abortion procedures. Where contraception is inaccessible or of poor quality, many women will seek to terminate unintended pregnancies, despite restrictive laws and lack of adequate abortion services. Prevention of unplanned pregnancies must therefore be the highest priority, followed by improving the quality of abortion services and of post-abortion care." WHO see:</p>

<p>"The opinions towards abortion is mixed. While most people are morally uncomfortable with induced abortion, the debate is primarily on the legailty of abortion.

<p>The point I was trying to get across is that very few reputable pro-choice advocates run around aborting because it gives them kicks.

<li>But to say that they are uncomfortable with induced abortion I feel is not objective, and not neccesary here given the article goes on to define the viewpoints indivually.

<p>As long as the medical and scientific facts about abortion are presented without pro-abortion euphemisms that sanitize the medical and scientific reality, I am all for removing the ethical arguments from this entry. Although it surprizes most people who have never thought about what occurs during an abortion, the medical and scientific facts about abortion cannot help but paint a picture of a helpless and innocent developing human meeting a cold, calculated, violent and bloody death. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 14:42, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I disagree with 214... and agree with Tznkai. There should at least be a brief summary of the ethical discussion, otherwise the whole enty will be POV. It is one view to see abortion as a mere "technical issue" and not as a moral one. Hence, an ommission of the ethical debate will support one side's view more than any presentation of their point could. As for the "hanging" reference: Christina, if you feel the "Hanging" entry need such a discussion, then please add one. Or rather add one to a "death penalty" or "capital punishment" entry, since these would be the parallel entries to the general "abortion" entry. (I mean, this entry is not about any specific method of abortion, but the main page one will see when typing in "abortion") <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 17:34, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I certainly do not miss the point - I have not complained about this wording - I simply pointed out that Planned Parenthood (IN FACT) sells abortion, and has not made any serious attempt to cut into that revenue by promoting adoption. The rate of adoption referrals related to Planned Parenthood is virtualy zero. And that is because their revenue (almost $1 billion a year) comes mainly from abortion (after the "safe" pills and condoms they sell fail). <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 6 July 2005 16:43 (UTC)

<dd>Tznkai - your view on this is just silly. Portions of the "common ground" section were posted with the idea that people will comment on the appropriateness of the langauge. One person critiqued the language by noting a fact about the Catholic Church. Although I am not opposed to the language being in the article, I simply noted a similar fact about Planned Parenthood that would support the idea that perhaps the content of the article is in fact not accurate based on both organizations' actions. But, again, I think the language is ok, as there are other groups that exist that make the language in the article accurate. Your threat to blank my comments on this is just not supportable on any basis - and certainly not on the basis you claim. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 7 July 2005 08:56 (UTC)

<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>First, I apologize for the stupidty of getting into an edit war. I believe the version I have is better for the follwing reasons. 1. Harmonized wording: both the stance summaries use similar wording styles and prose styles, no accidental POV.</p>
<p>2. Accurate and Comprehensive: I rolled the rape,incest, and health issues into the summaries, shortening the article overal without bringing that issue up as more important than the others. Both sides have very strong cases here. Also, may pro-life groups and advocates I know are pro-life except in maternal danger, but to get into that would overly complicate the article. This allows a breif summary of the stances, and invites either looking at the specific articles are the main article. Note, I did screw up the spelling for feminists for life. NOW, ACLU Planned parenthood, Catholic church Feminists for Life and carenet seem to be a good cross section of the biggest names involved in the debate.</p>
<p>3. No waffling: completly avoid quotations marks. Quotation marks are POVish in this sort of thing, they make an idea seem less legitimate. Nowhere else in this article do we have it. no reason for it--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 19:47, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>By using the terms "Pro-life" and "Pro-choice" we are subjecting the article to the agendas of both sides. Call the stances accurately what they are: "For Legalized Abortion" and "Against Legalized Abortion", then in the explanation of the two stances provide the marketing names that both sides have adotped. I know this seems silly but, "pro-life" and "pro-choice" are tautologies; I don't know anyone that is anti-life and anti-choice. Both sides have chosen names that sound great and make one feel unethical or anti-democratic for going against their POV. By using these terms in an encyclopedia we are inadvertently lending credibility to these terms as if they mean something significant which they really don't. For example:</p>

<p>I understand your point Dwight, (please sign with your IP as well from now on), but its how they self identify and the words most people use, so I think thats more useful.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 16:41, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>-Thanks for the posting tip, it's my first time on Wikipedia. I agree that the 'pro-life' and 'pro-choice' terminology is the most convenient for identification (at least for us), but I disagree with them in concept. Whenever I discuss the two sides I feel obligated to refer to them by what they really are, rather than what they want to appear to be (hence my use of "pro-life" and "pro-choice" in quotation marks). Therefore it pains me to see an encyclopedia use PR/ Marketing terms that really have little or no significant meaning behind them. Earlier in the article it mentions 'pro-life' and 'pro-choice' in the manner which I am reffering:</p>
<p>"Abortion has been a controversial subject throughout history due to the moral and ethical issues that surround it <i>(A link to the en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_abortion would be great here)</i>. Both Human rights and constitutional rights are major issues. The complex issue usually focuses on the legal status of induced abortions. Advocates for making or keeping induced abortion illegal are usually termed Pro-Life. Advocates for making or keeping abortion legal are usually termed Pro-Choice."</p>
<p>Also, the use of "constitutional rights" in the above segment contributes to the articles America-centered feel. Dwight</p>

<p>The ongoing debate: a mixed stand (Harvey Jackins): 1. Yes, killing an embryo of any age is killing a human (denying that is the oppression of children, not seeing them as fully human); 2. Yes, the woman has to decide (denying that is the oppression of women, not seeing them as fully capable); 3. Support should go to the woman in the form of non-manipulative informormation and emotional and where needed financial support to reduce the chance that she would obt for an abotion; N.B.: Prevention earlier in this chain: better sex-education for both sexes, availability of good anti-conception. Anti-abortion laws don't reduce abortion rates but lead to a bigger percentage of self-inflicted or shady abortions, having a bigger health risk for the woman.</p>
<hr />
<p>The section called "Reasons for induced abortions" starts with the following line: "Women have many reasons to seek an abortion." Is this really necessary? The statement seems self-evident and (although I can't put my finger on why) a bit biased in favor of a pro-choice stance (maybe it seems biased because the existence of "many" reasons makes abortion sound like a solution to a huge number of problems). Below this statement is a table that provides 9 reasons why women seek abortions (adding to about 84% of abortions). This compounds the sillyness of saying "many" reasons. If the table showed 100 reasons my reaction would've been one of agreement with the statement, but a tiny table just makes an already silly line look even worse.</p>
<p>There is a wikipedia entry on the history of abortions at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_abortion" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_abortion" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. It seems like an article on abortion should include a small paragraph on it's history rather than just a link at the bottom of the page under 'related topics'. I think a historical context is not only helpful when learning about abortion, but also pretty interesting. Most people don't realize that abortion has been practiced for at least a couple thousand years and has been a topic of debate for centuries. As the wikipedia entry shows, it was determined to not be homicide by the catholic curch in 1140, was considered acceptable (if performed before quickening) by the church until 1588 when the church deemed abortion and contraception to be crimes against nature. Even after that the church waffled back and forth until 1869 when it took its current stance against abortion. Dwight 6/21/2005 11:55AM</p>

<p>214... while the stats you are inserting are correct they are in the table right below the paragraph you are editing. If you wish to clarify the percentage that are due to neccesity do it below that table, not in the text where it clearly shows your POV.</p>
<p>On the point of 'unborn human' or fetus, when describing the pro-life stance you have to use objective terminology regardless of the views you are describing. 'Unborn human' as I have said carries with it connotations that make that term innapropriate in this article. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaully_efd5.html" title="User:Spaully">Spaully</a> 11:55, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The use of 'unborn human' vs 'fetus' has been discussed many many many many times, and a consensus was reached that 'fetus' was a neutral and less loaded a term than 'unborn human'. Reverting so the article conforms to this consensus does not, I believe, violate the 3RR rule (although repeatedly altering 'fetus' to 'unborn human' does). <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> 11:59, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In fact, your conclusion about consensus iw not correct. The consensus was that "fetus" is a calculated use of a medical term that is appropriate in the medical section, but should not be exclusive. To use "fetus" exclusively is, by itself, a viewpoint of dehumanizing the human fetus or embryo. Medical professionals use the term 'unborn child' or 'unborn baby' more frequently than they use the term fetus or embryo when talking to a pregnant woman. (See Webster's Medical Dictionary definition of "unborn" on this page at the top). And finally, use of that term in the pro-life section is NECESSARY to explain the pro-life stance. Otherwise the totally ignorant reader would have no idea that the very point of the pro-life stance is that a fetus is an unborn child. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 13:27, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>From both the lay view and the medical view, the use of "unborn child", "human", "dead" or "alive", etc., is appropriate and very common when lay people discuss pregnancy and fetal development. Any parent or person close to expecting parents or parents who miscarried can vouch for the common use of "unborn baby", "alive", "the baby died", "person" etc. Whereas the formal medical definitions below demonstrate that the use of "unborn" and "alive" and "dead" are appropriate for medical use:</p>

<p>Hey, 214 - let me know if you find a way of phrasing this question so that somebody who is not involved in the debate has any chance of figuring out what you are trying to say. 'Cause I really don't think that there are that many medical texts that refer to the fetus as "the alive" or "the dead".

<p>The Catholci Church is the most well-known pro-life group in the world. This church is also well-known as being against most all war and most all captial punishment, and for welfare support of the poor - and provides a huge amount of social services around the globe. These are very liberal positions. It is extreme bias to claim that Catholic Church is "conservative" in light of this fact. And also to claim that most pro-life groups are conservative, when in fact the most well-known group does not fall into that cateogry. You hold extreme biases that you do not even recognize you have. I am a catholic pro-lifer - but I am at least honest about it. I am not afraid of facts or words that I may not prefer to highlight. I simply advocate that the abortion industry paradigm not be accepted as the neutral view here at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 06:59, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Two important things. One, the catholic church is widley considered Socially Conservative, with a remarkable lack of fiscal policy to examine. Issues such as Gay marriage, Birth control, abortion, euthinasia, a remarakable oppoistion to communism all can be seen by a myriad of people as conservative. Second, even if we were to conceded that the church is not socially conservitive in anyway, why only edit the pro-life, and not edit and neutralize the pro-choice?

<p>I am playing ball - but not to your satisfaction, apparently. I am happy to let those who support at least some abortion being available to state what that view entails. And I am not happy to let those same people write a false or misleading summary of the pro-life view. Anyone who follows the Catholic Church knows that she confounds liberals and conservatives because she falls into neither camp. And you still have not addressed the exclusive use of abortion industry euphemisms for this entry. Why exclusive use of that POV's terms, when medical professionals and laypeople more frequently use other terms? And certainly why not allow such terms at least in the pro-life section? You really have made no attempt to address this. I know you find me annoying, but I am only annoying because I am forcing you to rethink your paradigm - and you are disappointed that I do have some valid points that you had previosuly not considered. I don't claim to know everything. But this is one issue about which I know both sides arguments very well, and I know where the neutral ground exists.

<p>Your edits aren't simple changes of fetus to unborn. Again, a misnomer, misleading, and biased as has been pointed out by me and others. You are constantly reverting the article to your particular POV, which you can do to your hearts content on the Pro-choice article, and I will not be there to stop you. Here though, we are comitted to having a breif summary. You are a very vocal and intelligent minority, but you are just that. Furthermore I have not, and will not resort to personal attacks and discussions on what you have or have not considered. The articles written are fair and charitable to both sides.

<p>Tznkai, are you opposed to the use of phrases such as "unborn human", "dead fetus", "fetus is alive", "death of the fetus", "unborn child", "unwanted child"&#160;? These are terms that are in common use by doctors and normal people in every day conversation. (Even pro-abortion activists often talk about the need to prevent "unwanted children" - but somehow even that iss not allowed by you.) Why do you - personally - want only the terms favored by the abortion industry used here? And what is more, why do you want to avoid using other terms even when discussing the POV of the pro-life stance? You have not answered theses simple questions, other than to claim "consensus" (which you improperly define, as true consensus means all parties are willing to agree to a compromise solution).</p>

<dd>These are innapropriate to describe a fetus. Until the 20-24th week the fetus is not viable i.e. cannot live outside the womb. In this case it is innapropriate to call the fetus a child, or to imply it is a fully formed human that just hasn't popped out of the womb yet. The cases where doctors refer to the fetus by these terms would be in the thrid trimester when the fetus can actually live if it is born. The other cases might be by a midwife or obstetrics doctor near the end of pregnancy. No self respecting doctor would refer to the fetus as an unborn child at less than 20 weeks.</dd>

<dd>Can an embryo be considered an "individual" when it is biologically dependant on another organism (i.e. the pregnant woman)? This is certainly the case before viability. --<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 18:58, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, an embyro is also an individual. Though dependent on the mother, the embyro is a distinct "biological entity" with the potential to grow/develop into someone different than the mother - this makes the embryo different from a kidney. (Note that I am not associating anything more with being an individual than being a "distinct entity" - personhood is another question and actually the one really in debate (though sometimes subconsciously). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 19:05, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A genome distinct from that of its mother will not allow a 2-month-old embryo to survive ex utero.

<dd>The embryo might not be viable outside the womb, but that is a different issue: viability. We, I think, agree on that. But it doesn't follow that viability is a necessary condition for humanity or individuality. Some with a kidney malfuntion cannot survive without dialysis. Does that make him and the machine one individuum. Or does it deprive him of his humanity? And dialysis is a articificial means much more "costly" than just leaving the embryo in the womb. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 09:29, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed one can argue a person develops till death, but making a comparison between in utero and childhood development is unpersuasive and disengenous. Using the same word does not make them the same thing, just as the meanings of <b>human</b> are not equally applicable to a fetus. You focus on its individual characteristics and I focus on its developmental stage. The fact its developing indicates it has yet to become <b>"insert word here"</b>. A child/teenager is not an adult, nor is a fetus a child. What does that mean, I dunno... but using the same words (developing, human) in different or ambiguous contexts isn't the best way to figure it out... or express it. Be that as it may so long as things (on both sides) are couched as POV's in the article; all's well that ends well. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 19:39, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't see why it should be unpersuasive and disengenous. There are distinct and different stages in development, but IMHO it's unpersuasive to arbitrarily draw a line at this or that stage and say: from here on human, before that not - except for conception, as this is the biological beginning of a new "entity".
<dl>
<dd>I entirely agree; just remember that next time you want to interpret dictionary definitions to suit your line in the sand.</dd>

</dd>
<dd>You are mistaken about "developing". Is a developing country a country? Is a toddler a developing adult? I think, the former answer is yes, the latter answer is no!
<dl>
<dd>As stipulated the word developing in different contexts means different things. "Country" denotes legal sovereignty of a geographical area; it being <b>economically</b> disadvantaged "developing" does not change that in the slightest. When speaking of biological development; yes we can describe it as "developing" in all stages of life; but that in no way makes stages equivalent and mentioning it as you have serves no useful purpose. A biological entity is fundamentally changing what it is as it develops. To make your poor country analogy roughly equivalent; it would be writing its constitution and setting its borders. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 17:42, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"A child/teenager is not an adult" - I agree - "nor is a fetus a child." - it depends on how you define child: is child a period in human life/development as opposed to adult (the alternative is: child in relation to be born of parents, but that's off-topic here), then the fetus might or might not be a child, depending on how you define the beginning of childhood. But that affects merely the term, not the underlying reality.

<dd>Why do they not mention "unborn child", because it is factually incorrect and not objective.

<dd>No, the word "unborn" only applies that the fetus/embryo is not yet born. At most, it implies that that unborn someone USUALLY is bound to be born. It does not imply that birth will occur under any circumstances. (just like, say, an "undergraduate student" is bound to graduate and will graduate if everything works according to the plan, but the student might drop out or fail the exam. Still the term "undergraduate student" applies to all students prior to their graduation. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 09:29, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, the words "unborn" and "human" and "alive" and "dead" are all used by medical professionals and laypeople when describing pregnancy related ob/gyn concerns. Even though "unborn child" is used, I have never pushed to use that word, but simply make the point that it is a neutral term - just as neutral as "fetus" is. The fact that many references choose to adopt the abortion industry's terms is not a sign that those terms are neutral. It simply reflects the bias of those editors. But wikipedia is NOT like those other encylclopedias.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Ref 1 of yours is simply an old wikipedia entry - and thus does NOT illustrate your point.</li>
<li>Ref 2 and 3 of yours are the exact same text cut and pasted from "Columbia Encyclopedia", a print encyclopedia published by the avowedly pro-abortion Columbia University - and thus does nothing to prove the neutrality of the content.</li>
<li>Ref 4 is an incomplete entry so we do not know what the content is, but it is published by the oldest encylcopedia in the world (Britannica) - offering an old-fashioned approach to encyclopedias and hardly something wikipedia seems inclined to imitate.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In sum, your references actually weaken your argument. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 14:03, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have no problem with words such as death or alive being used, the issue is with "unborn child", "unborn human" without the developing qualifier, or "baby" or other variation.</dd>
<dd>Last I checked this was an online encyclopedia, hence is trying to be an encyclopedia. So modelling one of the oldest encyclopedias in some respects cannot be a negative thing. You'll notice that entry does not even use the term "unborn". It is revised, and so not old-fashioned apart from the fact that it does not have subjective inputs from users all over the world.</dd>
<dd>You seem so keep to inform us of the use of unborn in the medical literature and cite the glossary as an example? Of course the glossary is going to explain the term. Perhaps if you showed a medical definition of abortion - pre 24 weeks - where the term unborn child is used, that part of your argument would hold more weight.</dd>
<dd>Proto raises an important point - arguing with you there are several people of the opinion that these terms are subjective and should not be in the article. This in itself demonstrates that the word is innapropriate. "Unborn child" should be relegated to pro-life websites where the idea is to misinform.</dd>
<dd>Finally, the reason for me not believing your arguments that the medical profession uses unborn child often is not just because I think your argument is flawed or my stubborness. It is from my experience as a medical student and time I have spent shadowing doctors in hospitals. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaully_efd5.html" title="User:Spaully">Spaully</a> 17:02, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If even one person objects to the use of the term 'unborn child' to describe a fetus, then its neutrality is inherently questionable. In this case, there is a growing consensus (a lot more than one person) in favour of using the term 'fetus' rather than 'unborn child'. There is a growing consensus that the use of the term 'unborn child' (unborn human, unwanted child, etc) is a loaded term that should be avoided. Why are you unable to accept the consensus? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> 14:24, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll be weighing in on the "fetus" side of things as well. It is inherently flawed to refer to a fetus as "unborn" for any number of reasons. By that logic, you should be referring to your breakfest as an unborn chicken. It is also biased to use a word which the general wikipedia community has decided as POV, Fetus does nothing to diminish the capacity of that being for life, and unborn child is merely waving a flag; the best litmus test for this could probably be as simple as cracking your average high-school health book; no mention of "unborn child" in there, I do however see zygote and fetus all over the place. <a href="../../../d/a/e/User%7EDaemon8666_292b.html" title="User:Daemon8666">Daemon8666</a> 13:15, 21 Jun 2005 (EST)</p>

<dd>Yes Daemon, a breakfast egg is an "unborn chicken" (or once was one, since it is killed somewhere down the line) and it'd be perfectly factual to use that term. (The moral difference is, that it is a unborn <b>chicken</b> and not a unborn <b>human</b>, but that's a different issue.)</dd>
<dd>Where has the general wikipedia community has decided that a certain word is POV? Where can we read about that?</dd>
<dd>From what I have heard, 214... does not oppose the word "fetus", but only that prescribing this word while banning all alternatives is just as much flag waving.</dd>

<p>Why do you insist, 214, that removing "abortion-industry terminology" will neutralize the article? Why aren't you advocating the converse: removing all "pro-life terminology" at the same time? Unfortunately, we're treading a thin line, aren't we? Obviously, though, no one here is suggesting the use of an egregiously POV synonym for fetus or unborn child, such as "precious, innocent human baby" or "unfeeling glob of cells." Most would seem to be in agreement that the term "fetus" (and, perhaps, "unborn child" in a limited and appropriate context) is an acceptable comprise between view points. --<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 17:37, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you on fetus, but "unborn child" is the most misleading of the lot for the gestation time during which most abortions occur.

<dd>Precisely what I was thinking. I think it would be best to avoid the term entirely - unless it is used in the discussion of late-term pregnancies. Otherwise, it has the distinct flavour of POV. But I am open to considering "unborn child" — not "human," "unborn person," or "baby," all of which are seldom used in abortion-related discussions in a neutral context — in tandem with "fetus" if it will resolve conflicts with those who insist that the latter term is too cold, clinical, and "dehumanizing." --<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 18:25, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unborn can probably be used, as it is in this sentance "Further complicating the debate is the issue of paternal rights, involving what rights and responsibilities the father has regarding the unborn offspring in question." I am not certain why I wrote it that way, but it seems to have stuck. I think what 214 is missing here is not that the word unborn cannot be used, but it should be used with great care and respect. The use of the term fetus is not soley the providence of pro-choice advocates, but the default term for reasoned discussion.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 17:55, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This discussion has pretty much resorted to repetition. Understand, I am not trying to be confrontational, nor am I attempting to disrespect anyone's personal beliefs, but it seems that as I was reading through this, it is 2 or 3 people giving a reasoned argument why we should use "fetus", followed by 214 claiming that not using "unborn" is a POV. I think we've pretty well established that it's as close to a neutral word as possible, most of all because using a scientifically accurate word is not at all a violation of someone's beliefs. I have not been weighing in for very long on this, but it seems this argument is headed for potential Ouroubourous. Let's stop discussing, remove the lock, and start editing; objectively.</dd>

<p>As I have stated above, my goal is to use the terms the pro-life stance uses in the section clearly called "pro-life stance" - a goal which has been thwarted by several, including particularly Tznkai. My other goal is to use neutral scientific/medical tems (such as "developing unborn human" or "dead fetus" or "living fetus" or "human fetus" or "human offspring" when appropriate. Fetus is a generic term that encompasses all mammals - it is appropriate to occasionally use the term "human fetus" instead of simply "fetus" when discussing the human variety in a lengthy article. Contrary to how others here have painted this, I have not advocated use of "unborn child" throughout the article - and actually noted that fact, and my edit history shows that I have actually eliminated that term when it popped up. This, despite the uncontrovertible fact that virtually all persons who discuss a miscarriage (at any stage of pregnancy) talk about the loss of a baby or child who has died (not a potential child - which would insult the parents). Even women I know who have had abortions discuss the child they aborted. And the doctors who perform abortions also discuss the fact that they actually abort what they consider to be children - but that it is not their choice. And medical professionals also use these terms when discussing a pregnancy with the parents of the unborn child (at any stage). Of course, I know this because I have six living children (and several miscarrigages) and this is ALWAYS how the doctor discussed things with me from my very first appointment with the OB/GYN - and this did not matter whether I was seeing a European doctor or American doctor. And each child was born in a different city or country. Finally, I will restate my intention to use pro-life terms in the pro-life section, and to use terms such as "developing unborn human" or "dead fetus" or "living fetus" or "human fetus" or "human offspring" when appropriate elsewhere in the article. To exclusively use "fetus" is to slavishly adopt the abortion industry's preferred terms as if they were neutral (prior to the disease of political correctness, there was no slavish exclusive use of the abortion indutry's preferred terminology). Clearly EXCLUSIVE use of that term is ABSOLUTELY not neutral and is very much POV; and if its EXCLUSIVE use were neutral (as you all claim it is), then people who were pro-life would not be having this debate with you. And I will point out that each of you has either expressed actual bias or has shown bias by your actions and comments that considers legal abortion to be acceptable in at least some circumstances. As such, I cannot count any of you as having or even understanding the pro-life view. Therefore, despite your much ballyhood "consensus", whatever you call it, it is the "consensus" of peopole who think aboriton should be legal. As such, the "consensus" expressed here is that of people with a known bias in favor of some legal abortion. Do any of you hold that abortion is an unjust killing of a human person with rights that should be unlawful? I don't think so. But despite whatever you imagine, many people DO agree with that pro-life idea. And it was the view of most people until 30 years ago. Wikipedia should be open to a fair/neutral representation of ideas that are quite mainstream, although under-represented here at wikipedia. For goodness sake, the president of the US holds this view, the party in power in the US holds this view in its platform, the world's largest religion holds this view, Islam holds this view, some international human rights documents hold this view, most OB/GYNs won't do abortions because they hold this view (one prominent argument of abortion advocates is that there is a shortage of abortionists) - in sum, the pro-life view is not a fringe view. Wikipedia should be professional enough to acknowledge this and treat the matter fairly. I have not advocated exclusive adoption of pro-life terms (that are also commonly used by lay people and doctors when treating patients). But others do advocate for exclusive use of abortion industry terms (that are also commonly used by doctors, but rarely used by lay people). It is folly to claim that in normal conversation with friends and family about pregnant people they know or love the term "fetus" is commonly (if ever) used. It makes sense for this article to be professional but also to use commonly used language. Is there really a problem with using common language (while being careful to avoid the terms "baby" and "child" except in the "pro-life stance" section)? <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 09:55, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I agree with a number of your points, you are little loose on your rationale in a few ways. While OB/GYN's can certainly be pro-life; the shortage of them willing to do abortions has more to do with harrassment and murders of abortionists than it does with how many OB/GYN's are pro-life. As to your personal experience, I'd imagine you'd seek and find OB/GYN's that agree with your views, but even if that were not the case; as professionals they would use terms that are appropriate for a women who wanted to have a baby and has miscarried. Their use of those terms within that context means little to the debate of abortion, and I'm therefore doubtful if it supports your/our position on allowed terminology for an encyclopedia; the purpose of which is to inform. But in pursuit of informing people, I think pro-life terminology should be used when discussion pro-life; as it serves to further clarify there isn't agreement on the status of a fetus. So I agree with the thrust of your argument, which is that the pro-life position needs to be presented. This does not mean being able to reclassify the Catholic church as not conservative because they are liberal on other subjects, adding elective labels to statistics and other shenanigans that is not only against consensus... but you take it upon yourself to do without dicussion, then revert warring and forcing the article to be protected, again. That persistent behavior will eventually just get you blocked. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a>&lt;/sup&gt; 15:01, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</sup></dd>

<dd>Your comments tend to illustrate my point about how "neutral" it is to use only the term "fetus" - the reality of what exists does not change simply because the unborn child is/was wanted. Those cells are what they are, regardless of what the mom thinks they are. Thus to only use the sterile medical term that dehumanizes the human fetus is to agree that the fetus is nothing more than a sterile medical thing. Just as it would likewise be a sign of bias to only use the more warm medical terms of baby or child. The point is, the use of the sterile term implies the following "we don't think this thing should be treated as if it were a person, and so we will make sure we use cold terms that engendr no empathy or compassion for it." Can you explain it any other way? The default position it the one that implies its nothing more than a thing? Again, to be fair, we would have to use an equally sterile term every time we spoke of the mom - gravida. But that would be just as ridiculous as using fetus exclusively. I am happy to see some indicators that there is some openness on terms. I do NOT advocate for using unborn child anywhere but in the 'pro-life stance" section. It seems that this fundamental belief ought to be present in the paragraph that explains what that stance holds to be true. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 19:14, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Medical terms <b>are</b> neutral in the sense they are without emotion; this is why they appeal to many editors. But I agree that in stripping the emotion, the humanity if you will, that also betrays a POV on the "personhood" of the fetus. Be that as it may, I think it important for an encyclopedia to minimize emotional language in its entries. I will continue to defend a variety of terminology in this article; I guess as I see it, just as with populations... in variety comes strength. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 21:23, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No one here is suggesting that pro-life people be precluded from debate. On the contrary! I know you must feel like something of a one woman army, 214, what with the apparent paucity of ideological fellows, but it's not as though Wikipedia is being run exclusively by abortion-rights supporters. The discussion page would not be seven pages long if that were the case. Obviously, though, the pro-life side cannot be unilaterally voiced, and I doubt that all who share your views at least in part would approve of all your suggestions. Nor would most pro-life or pro-choice Wikipedians make rampant POV edits without prior discussion. Don't claim to be extending the olive branch of measured, rational discourse when your past conduct seems to have demonstrated otherwise. --<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 18:11, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some basic, NPOV terms should be laid down. Something along the lines of "abortion proponents" and "abortion opponents." On many online bbs, simply the semantics of "pro life" and "pro choice" are the targets of huge debate. Abortion proponents charge that the term "pro life" implies that the supporters of abortion are "pro death." Furthermore, the entry should use only the terms used by the medicinal community to refer to the baby at different stages. The only REAL problem is when refering to an unborn child at any point in the pregnancy. Is "unborn child" NPOV? One could say it is, but then again many do not consider the embryo to be a child yet. Perhaps "embryo or fetus" would do? --<a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrucible_Guardian_c04e.html" title="User:Crucible Guardian">Crucible Guardian</a> 6 July 2005 01:53 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for sharing your though. Scroll up and look at the medical definitions from Webster's medical dictionary. Medical community frequently refers to the developing fetus or embryo by those terms, and even uses the word "child". Even abortionists use the term when discussing the children they abort. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 6 July 2005 14:42 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have clearly made a mistake - you have not read my words and digested their meaning: I want the terms commonly used to discuss pregnancy to be used here. I do not want to exclude the sterile cold terms that the abortion industry uses to dehumanize the fetus - and likewise I do not want to exclude terms commonly used by ob/gyn doctors and medical references (such as Webster's medical dictionary) that acknowledge (as most pregnant women do) the humanity of the unborn child at any stage. The only final word is that it is certainly just as common for doctors and laypeople to refer to the content of a pregnant mother's womb as an unborn human, a child, etc., as it is to slavishly use ONLY the abortion industry terms (fetus, embryo, etc.) to underscore the viewpoint that this entity is not a human person. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 7 July 2005 08:45 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>In response to Nadsat on /Archive 7</i></p>
<p>I reiterate that in the context of Wikipedia there isn't a requirement we follow medical terminology; nor does something need to be medically viable in order for it to die. On the issue of "death" there is no rational grounds to remove/change it. If it troubles you, I suggest you read fewer medical texts and more literary and philosophical texts. (not to change your opinion on abortion, we are on the same side, but to appreciate the differences in language aren't as stark as you perceive; just because death/died aren't in medical texts does not make it incorrect) The issue I'd like to continue to explore is whether non-viable should be included in the lead. I have copied this paragraph to the main discussion page, please follow up there. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 16:46, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd oppose including "non-viable" into the definition, since it does not apply to all (induced) abortions. Yes, some aborted embryos/fetuses are not viable outside the womb, but some are and this article is about abortion in general. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 19:22, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Clearly, unless one is an abortion-supporter who considers partial-birth abortion to be infanticide (rather than abortion), the word viability is totally misplaced, because any abortion performed after 22 weeks is performed after viability is likely. But, alas, it matters not what one wants the definition to be, as abortion clearly, at least in the influential US, now legally and medically encompasses any time from conception until the instant before natural birth would occur. Although I suppose some people would still consider it abortion for the first few days after the babe is born.<a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 18:20, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dehumanizing the unborn human offspring by using selected medical terms (that are also used for rabbits and pigs) and censoring out any medical terms that humanize the unborn child (such as "unborn human") is a classic example of the doublespeak Orwell warned us of. When the only lexicon allowed is one that dehumanizes the unborn, then the POV is clear: the unborn child is not human (as many of you vociferously argue whenever there is the slightest mention or hint that the embryo or fetus is a fully human entity with unique human DNA, etc. etc., that is in the process of normal human development). Such a lexicon and such fear of words that express the undeniable scientific reality that this is a living unique human entity is classic doublespeak and classic "it's not human" POV. Many are blind to this obvious expression of POV, as they have bought in to the doublespeak. I am all for using the word fetus, embryo, etc. - just not exclusively. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 30 June 2005 03:18 (UTC)

<dd>Just piping in from a country where this ethical debate is very much a fringe thing. Whatever terminology you guys end up using, try to keep the facts straight and don't choose misleading wording, please (according to mainstream science). Words such as "child" and "human" have many uses, and whether or not that includes corner cases such as fetuses is non-trivial to decide in general. (e.g. replacing "children" with "children and fetuses" wouldn't generally be a good idea; same for many other pairs of words) However you classify things, it doesn't change the phenomenon, and I'd like to have it described as accurately as possible so it can be used as a reference. I think that whether fetuses (or whatever) are dehumanized or enhumanized doesn't interest many of the readers of the article at all. In your language, letting this debate affect the article too much introduces America-centric POV. (for some reason Americans want to wage huge flamewars over everything)

<dd>Instruction creep? The way I see it if we don't make this then in a few weeks some new editor will come along and start up this debate again. We have to break the cycle somehow. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaully_efd5.html" title="User:Spaully">Spaully</a> 18:41, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I understand your concerns, it just seems vaugley unwiki like to have a list of words that are OK and a list of words that are not ok. I'm really ntot sure where I stand on this--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 18:54, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that it would not be a good idea in general, but I think this is such a frequently disputed problem and sensitive issue that it might be sensible. We could just create a specific archive for this topic and refer new readers to that instead. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaully_efd5.html" title="User:Spaully">Spaully</a> 19:30, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I'm going to have to go with my gut feeling here and disagree with this whole idea. I think it'll get us into a lot of trouble, although I understand where you are coming from.

<dd><b>Pregnant</b> and <b>gestation</b> are new additions. Just demonstrating that use of the terms I prefer are actually quite neutral, and it is only those who advocate for abortion to be legal who consider the use here of words commonly used to discuss pregnancy-related medical situations as somehow divisive or POV. I know this is objective evidence that underscores my point, but I also know that such objective evidence will be ignored by the constant nay-sayers here who seek not a neutral stance, but one that presumes abortion is a good thing that is beyond legitimate public criticism. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 18:09, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This is an example of two major problems 214, and I hope and believe you are not doing them on purpose. First, you are propogating a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_dilemma.html" title="False dilemma">false dilemma</a>, second you are forgetting <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. 214, the dictionary helps make your point that, yes, people out there do use those terms, and yes, sometimes in medicine. That ultimatly ins't the concern here. We want to be neutral, accurate, and useful, and I disagree that equivocating fetus and unborn as equally acceptable terms does that. Also have moved things about for organizational purposes.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 18:28, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Activty around here seems to have died down, are we ready to get the article unprotected yet? I'm still not sure if we stand on any kind of solution to the edit wars, and I'd like 214 to weigh in on my proposed solution in iether direction. If she's left, or if I've missed us having an agreement, go ahead move to get the article unprotected.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 29 June 2005 15:05 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your proposed solution if fine, as long as it accomodates usage of the words that have been for some time listed above on this discussion page as "acceptable words". If that is the solution, then no need for mediation. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 1 July 2005 05:08 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I said, I don't really like the acceptable words solution, but I have no serious problem with those words.

<dd>'<b>Mediation does'nt help</b> "in protecting the article from future disputes," rather it helps to untangle any issues that may exist now, and clarifies them in terms of how to represent material in the article. I have'nt read any of the issues, yet, but experience has shown that disputants who can agree to mediation can also agree in terms of how to convey information in the article. One, do parties agree to mediation? Two, do parties aceept me as mediator? -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">SV</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">t</a> 7 July 2005 19:14 (UTC)

<p>Ive noticed theres a large gap with regard to info on <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> here on Wikipedia. For example the stages of pregnancy are not well defined (as a chronology). (Maybe a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Template%7EPregnancy_8a6d.html" title="Template:Pregnancy">template:pregnancy</a> would be a good idea for consolodating this area?). Another example, which is highly relevant to this topic, is the discrepancy (aside from the terminologies) between the notion of "conception date"(ing) and the far-dominant "menstrual date"(ing) or "menstrual age." As abortion and the abortion controversy fall under the category of pregnancy, its important to state the facts, and explain how the sides in the abortion debate represent or account for the accepted and factual knowns about the state and stages of pregnancy. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">SV</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">t</a> 08:35, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to add a small factual edit about the abortion debate, the nature of which should not be controversial itself. In the section, Debate on abortion laws, add to the end of the first paragraph: "These terms are often inverted by political opponents such that pro-life becomes anti-choice or pro-choice becomes pro-abortion." Indeed, I think most people will agree that each side tends to use these inversions when refering to their opponents. User: Jkwhitejr</p>
<p>Shouldn't it be "anti-life" according to that model. And please sign your posts with four tildes. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 17:54, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
