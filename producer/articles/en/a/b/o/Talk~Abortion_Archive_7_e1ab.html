<p>I think this article does not need this tag. It is informative on how abortion is done. Views of Pro-life or Pro-choice people does not matter in defining how the procedure is done.

<p>Granted it is a contraversial issue (and the tag for it exists on this page). Lots of moral and ethical issues are involved. This article does not question either sides. It provides how moral and ethical issues. It also provides what health risks are involved (just like any medical practice). I don't hold views either way. I do see both sides moral and ethical issues.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clarification</span></h2>
<p>I apologize in advance if I'm doing this incorrectly - I'm new and not 100% confident as to how discussions are organized/edited. My question is in regard to this sentence: "Abortion rights advocates often argue that abortion needs to be widely available because some women become pregnant due to rape or incest (estimated at 2% of pregnancies)" under the <b>"Rape, incest and health" debate</b> section. It seems to me that 2% of all pregnancies being due to rape or incest is very high, and I'm wondering if it's meant to say that 2% of <i>abortions</i> occur because the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest. I tried briefly to find the statistic online with no luck. Can someone clarify (and let me know if this is the wrong way to go about checking)? Thanks! /<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcefyre_51e0.html" title="User:Icefyre">Icefyre</a> 21:39, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Two small changes</span></h2>
<p>I made two small changes to the descriptions of both the pro-choice and pro-life viewpoint. I feel that my changes promote accuracy and neutrality. Most importantly, it is true that many who are pro-choice privately find abortion distasteful even while maintaining that women have a right to it. Secondly, there are many convincing philosophical arguments on the pro-life end, and pro-lifers should not be stereotyped as basing their beliefs on this matter upon religious convictions.</p>
<p>I'd also like to point out to the supporters of both that it is vitally important for this article to portray this issue as accurately and neutrally as possible.</p>
<p>These changes got lost in the revert. Would someone who's got time do me a favor and try to fix the POV bits to reflect the less extreme views on the subject? I really think that better representing the more moderate views would add a great deal to the article.<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Mutz_713b.html" title="User:Bill Mutz">Bill Mutz</a> 13:55, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">baby vs fetus</span></h2>
<p>We all know that a fetus is a potential baby. When a woman has a spontaneous miscarriage she may mourn her unborn and unknown baby that never was. However, in the context of abortion, the vast majority of fetuses are pre-viable and in this context, for a "neutral" encyclopedia article, as for a medical textbook, it is misleading and deliberately inflammatory to insist that they be called "babies." Yes, people use different words in different contexts for the same thing. Fetus is a perfectly good and accurate word when the intention is to describe the process of abortion neutrally. It doesn't mislead or conceal anything and doesn't sound so self-righteously sermonizing. Baby is a good word to use in a sermon or a political polemic, but that is not what this is supposed to be, right? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 03:26, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yucky intro, it won't last long.

<p>Why yucky? Just the American comment? The article is extremely American-centered, so why not acknowledge it?

<dd>Heh, I was coming to clarify that... its certainly a more informative intro with the terms and such, but the composition is long and awkward to me, especially in comparison to previous leads. Simply put abortion is controversial around the world; specifying America stands out as inaccurate (saying America is more divided on the issue than other western countries is clearer). Putting further perspectives (making the lead even longer) isn't necessary if America is just removed. I guess keeping the acknowledgement is fine, but its not just social (as the lead eloborates) and its not the "primary" focus... the primary focus is (or should be) Abortion; which the lead is elaborating. That results in a little confusion IMO, the lead ends up redirecting the focus in the last sentence. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 04:53, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Much better... I'll do some tweaks and see what you think. Initially I didn't like "without survival," but its quite accurate, I think it was the novelty of the phrase that troubled me; and that it does seems to repeat termination. But I'd certainly agree we should err on the side of clarity. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 14:44, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">defending the intro</span></h2>
<p>To the anon contributor: You have removed useful and accurate definitions from the intro. You have made it less precise and accurate, since the word truly applies to both natural and induced abortions, even if you are only interested in one type. You have introduced unnecessarily POV terms: when there are various terms used for something, choosing a less precise term that is used only by one faction of a controversy is by that fact arguing only one POV. To argue otherwise is simply dishonest. The place for making it clear that some people prefer the terms baby and death is in the section on opposition to elective abortion. Both terms (baby and death) are used in many ways and in many contexts, and they are not the best choice for the intro to this article because the choice of them would already place the article on a single side of the controversy. Finally, all of us would appreciate it if you would sign in as a user and reassure us that you share the purpose of this project, which is to produce an accurate article that reflects the range of perspectives on the topic rather than a single view. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 12:48, 30 May 2005 (UTC) PS, perhaps it is worth explicitly acknowleging both POVs in the intro, with the words deired by both. Does that satisfy?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wasn't me. All that I did was add content to the POV sections, so there must be some other anon user. I generally try to make a habit of mentioning any changes I make on the discussion pages and usually discuss major changes to introductions before making any actual changes. In spite of what my own changes might have reflected, though, I'm actually very pro-choice. Odd, eh? In any event, in order to prevent future mix-ups, perhaps I'll follow your request and log in before adding more content to this controversial subject. Oh, and how do you go about putting your nick at the end of a posting?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Medical definition POV&#160;?</span></h2>
<p>STR1977, see above for the problems with your preferred paragraph: it is inaccurately narrow, omits useful terminology, and uses terms used ONLY by one side of the controversy, signalling the reader that a single POV will be presented. Is that your intention? I am not trying to exclude your POV; it is presented very strongly in the second paragraph, and you can elaborate more fully in the appropriate section of the article. The first paragraph is definitional, using the same language as would be used to describe any other biological or medical event or procedure. There are no terms in the first paragraph not used by both sides of the controversy. Thanks for understanding. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 15:14, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry Alteripse, but "the use of <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgical.html" title="Surgical">surgical</a> procedures or drugs to end a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a>, associated with the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a> of the human <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryo.html" title="Embryo">embryo</a> or <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetus</a>." is a medical definition taken from Webster's (see above) and it is not POV. All that's in the sentence is fact. Nothing more, nothing less. And it is straightforward, clear, intelligible language, whereas "without the survival" is awkward unusual and, though not actually wrong, whitewashing to further a certain POV. This is the only change I made, the "baby-fetus-embryo" change was someone else. Where am I omitting terminology? (PS. Written partly before reading preceding post by Alteripse) <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 15:21, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thinking the medical definition of induced abortion should go first <b>is</b> a POV Str1977. I don't necessarily disagree with that, since the word "abortion" is generally understood to be exactly that. But, Wikipedia is not a dictionary... medical or otherwise, so we need not prioritize that definition. Without survival is awkward... but it is an accurate inclusive definition of "abortion" which is elaborated on immediately after. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 16:08, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know that pro-choice advocate don't like the mentioning of death in this context, but a fact is still a fact. This paragraph is not about the moral issue and death is not a moral term. However, if this fact is constantly denied (or if it is claimed, that there are two kinds of death), one is amazed how far some people will go to justify their POV - even though that POV has its rightful place further down in the entry. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 15:26, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well thank you for the response. I am opposed to abortion, but can understand the other side and I am trying to make this article neutral at someone else's request, to my great regret. Nonetheless, please see my point. If you start by defining abortion as the deliberate killing of a baby, you are signalling to the reader that at least the intro is being written from a POV so extreme that it only uses words and concepts acceptable to one side of the controversy. Is this your intention? The additional logical problem is that your words already implicitly accept only one conclusion to the controversy. And my first paragraph is far more a "medical definition" in any sense of the term. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 15:33, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Alteripse, I see your point and I concur with you on fetus/embryo. (changes there were not from me) I also see the effect you are considering. However, I think the "without survival" is really awkward (and I know why others are more comfortable with it) - it'd make sense only if the death was some side-effect of the procedure, but it's not. Consider, whether you'd describing beheading someone like this: "severing head from the body at the neck, without survival of the subject"? I don't think so. But thanks for your consideration. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 15:52, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well we are getting to the point where they could survive if put in stasis and had the capability to reconnect the head. But I'm siding with you on this one... it should be reworded to "Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy resulting in the death of the fetus." Saying death is the result is clear and doesn't take sides. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 16:17, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, guys, it's a living thing. Our ability to distinguish between one living thing and another does not make the severence of its life something other than death. "Abortion usually refers to the intentional destruction of a placental mammal's foetel offspring at some point prior to the event of birth. The effect of doing this is that a pregnancy is 'aborted,' hence the name" would suffice as the beginning of the intro, and "The source of the controversy is that such abortions necessarily result in the death of the fetus, and many, understandably, do not completely reconcile this with their morality" or something roughly similar would work well enough as an intro to the dispute. For that matter, let's put the dispute in a completely seperate article, hopefully allowing us to stick to purely non-POV subject matter here in the main article on abortion.

<p>I disagree. There's nothing "odd" or "overcomplicated" about it--the word "destruction" has an intuitive meaning here that is absolutely correct and that does not carry the social stigma that the word "death" can convey. --Nachtrabe 16:24, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Destruction is not intuitive; it has odd violent connotations; and complicates matters since it is non-specific and begs the question how was the fetus destroyed?

<p>Expulsion... now that's a quality word.

<p>The fetus is certainly dead if her dismemberment began with her tiny head! You may remember that the wording used to include "....associated with the death of the embryo or fetus" - which covers the various ways the preborn human meets her death. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 10:17, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Certainly, but other causes of abortion may not kill the fetus until its expelled... your wording does make more sense though. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 18:31, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nadsat; a fetus and even undifferentiated cells are alive by most definitions, please stop wasting time. If you wish to define alive as strictly as multicelled organism with complex systems like a brain etc etc, go right ahead. But anything biological that is taking in energy and doing something, be it growing, differentiating, moving, is also alive. It <b>has</b> to be alive to give rise to a life; except if we are talking about abiogenesis; but that's a rare phenonmenon and another facinating discussion by itself. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 16:23, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A cell is alive - until it dies. A sperm cell is alive until it dies. An ovum is alive until it dies. Whatcontradcits your claims about biology and medicine is that the doctor will consider that he has two patients as long as the mother tells him she does not want an abortion. Are you really that ill-informed as to not know that even die hard pro-abort medical professionals admit that after a few weeks the cells begin to differentiate and by the 8th week (the point after which almost ALL abortions are performed) there is no dispute as to whether there is full differentiation. Science is on the side of the fetus! SO sad that your paradigm blinds you to the science. Many people who have been part of an abortion have a hard time letting go of the paradigm you hold because it is a comfortable paradigm ("its just tissue or cells") that allows one to avoid any admission of responsibility for anything more than a removal of unpleasant cells. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 12:47, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OKAY, sure - I was being stupid. I do apologize; I was mad, not thinking straight. Let's hope I can think straight now. I will disagree with 214 though - science does not say that differentiation has occured in the first trimester - when abortion - the main type spoken about on this page - not partial birth - etc. - so when MOST of the usual abortions occur is in the 1st trimester - differentiation has not taken place! The embryo is still a mass of undifferentiated cells - they have the POTENTIAL TO BECOME SOMETHING - to be given a designation - but at that point they are not anything. Just a bunch of cells. So the only scientifically valid argument those who oppose abortion and choice can make is that the fetus has rights because it has the POTENTIAL to become a human being. But at the point of abortion it is just a bunch of undifferentiated cells - nothing actual - the mother is actual - the embryo, you ask...it just has potential.</p>
<p>I guess my main problem is that death sounds POV - I've never heard abortion in a biology textbook etc. describe abortion as the death of the embryo or fetus - when I read that I immediately think ...oh so it's the death of a baby? Which I think people might come read the definition and suddenly think that is what an abortion is - killing a baby. When really that is what is under "debate" - does that make sense?

<dd>It may sound pov, but I can personally assure you its not. The problem could be with pro-choicers avoiding those words as an understandable overreaction to pro-life attacks and concepts. As to biology textbooks, what language do they use (non-viable?), or do they simply describe the proceedure and neglect the outcome to the fetus? Needless to say, Wikipedia isn't a biology textbook, and we precisely say an embryo or fetus is dying in the sentence. If it didn't die then it would be premature birth, so I don't see a way around it. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 02:29, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Nadsat,</dd>
<dd>I think there is some confusion between abortion being death and an embryo/fetus being non-viable.</dd>
<dd>That abortion results in the death of the embryo/fetus is a fact</dd>
<dd>- the debate above is not really about that, but about how to "classify" the "living entity" brought to death - is it <b>merely</b> (that's the important word) bunch of cells or is <b>merely that</b> but a person with rights.</dd>
<dd>That it is a (biological) human being in the first stages of development is also a fact.</dd>
<dd>As for viable, it depends on the stage of pregnancy the abortion is done.</dd>
<dd>An embryo is not viable, since it cannot even barely survive outside, but a fetus can be viable (as in the cases of people who - after medical intervention - have survived their own abortion), because it can survive.</dd>
<dd>That's what viable means and hence it is not part of the definition of abortion in general to say, that the fetus is non-viable. This entry is about induced abortion in general (including partial birth abortion or other late term abortions) hence it makes no sense to put non-viable into the defintion. Sometimes the fetus is viable, sometimes it isn't. And hence the American Heritage Dictionary defintion is clearly wrong.</dd>
<dd>And I'm also sorry the OED now takes part in hiding facts behind words - though it at least only leaves out facts, rather than stating obvious falsehoods (unless the defintion was in some way qualified beyond the words you quoted (e.g. in the first trimester, abortion is ...)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the reasoning cited by Nadsat:</dd>
<dd>"abortion as the death of the embryo or fetus - when I read that I immediately think ... oh so it's the death of a baby? Which I think people might come read the definition and suddenly think that is what an abortion is - killing a baby."</dd>
<dd>That's a reasoning the wording "death of the embryo ro fetus" might provoke, yes, but unfortunately (from my POV) it doesn't provoke that nearly often enough. People can still think for themselves and even shut themselves off to the consequences.</dd>
<dd>However the statement you cited is completely factual and if it triggers such a reasoning, it might be because it is most reasonable deduction from these facts.</dd>
<dd>This should lead you to not disputing the facts (and these are facts) but to reevaluate your reasoning.</dd>
<dd>But even if you don't do that, you should at least acknowledge the facts.</dd>
<dd>There would be not debate about this all, if abortion were not associated with the "death of embryo or fetus".</dd>
<dd>What the debate is actually about is, whether the embryo/fetus is a person, and flowing from that, whether it is permissibile to kill the embryo/fetus more than it is permissible to kill a born human being (I mean exceptions like self-defence, which pre-birth would be the "life of the mother" exception).</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 10:51, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You, Str1977, are citing your VIEWS as facts. "People can shut themselves off to the consequences..." Well that is ridiculous! It is not a FACT that it is a BABY - so I do not think I or anybody else thinks they are shutting themselves off to the consequence - since I do not believe that is a consequence - I will recognize that belief of yours and maybe in the future it will be proved correct - but as of now it is not a proven fact that it is a baby that dies - If it was there would be no debate. The debate is wehther a bunch of undifferentiated cells dies or whether a human being dies. I believe the former, and will highly dispute the latter.</p>
<p>Also there is already an article in Wikipedia about Partial-birth abortions, so I would say the main purpose of this article is regular abortions - those that occur in the first rimester. Also, when giving the definition of abortion we are speaking of that, NOT partial-birth abortions; as that definition is entirely different.</p>
<p>I also regret to inform you that I believe the OED and the American Heritage Dictionary over you, my friend. I've never been a fan of Webster's anyways - it is not all that accurate - not 100% accurate at least, in my opinion, and the opinion of many others.</p>
<p>You are a closed minded human being. There is no hiding of facts - can't you at least be reasonable - and realize we do not know the absolute truth - that your beliefs are not yet FACT - they are theory - or perhaps not even theory, perhaps a step below. Non-viable is a fine term to be used when describing the embryo etc. - I have found many dictionaries that support this fact - you have only given one extremely POV definition that doesn't.</p>
<p>Also, I will try to get my hands on a biology textbook to see how it is spoken of there, this might take me awhile though. --<a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadsat_dc33.html" title="User:Nadsat">Nadsat</a> 23:09, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and the OED definition - stating the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy - well that to me does not offend either viewpoint - since it pretty much says the only thing that is 100% certain of an abortion - that a human pregnancy is terminated - the rest is not FACT. --<a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadsat_dc33.html" title="User:Nadsat">Nadsat</a> 23:11, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Certainly an empassioned response, reminds me of days past... those were the days. Anywhoooo... I'm pretty good with words, understanding their nuances etc etc; I'm not so good at putting them together, poor grammar and all that jazz. But "terminated", as I previous argued against "destroyed" is a non-specific word that combines expulsion and death of the fetus. It does not clarify what an abortion is in plain language... actually expulsion is a bit advanced come to think of it... may have to change that if a candidate comes up.</dd>
<dd>As to non-viable, there could be an argument made for that, but I see it at best being included with death... so "death of the embryo or non-viable fetus." The problem is; as medical technology advances when a fetus is non-viable could get tough to nail down. For example if a fetus is pre-mature in, uh, Siberia with very poor prenatal facilities it would die and be non-viable. But that very same fetus in California with top notch tech could be saved. Furthermore linguistically "non-viable" implies that the fetus is not viable prior to the abortion; I'm pro-choice and that doesn't make sense to me if its healthy and developing... seems viable to me. Those dictionaries might be making a politically correct decision, and as a result committing a similar mistake to pro-lifers... confusing potential with actual. The fetus <b>becomes</b> non-viable when its aborted, not necessarily prior (although for miscarriages it usually is non-viable prior to actual abortion). I know I've changed non-viable from how they use it; but how they use it is counter-intuitive. Simply use "non-viable" in other contexts; this plant is non-viable; this car is non-viable; your plan is not viable; that says to me its broken, not working and/or will die. That hasn't happened for a healthy embryo/fetus yet.</dd>
<dd>I know its not the best example because there is pretty good handle on when a child can survive outside, and abortions done around this grayzone are called partial-birth etc etc... but to say non-viable is to assume we could not artificially save the fetus. While true today; may not be true in a decade. Anyway, I ultimately see death as a factual compromise with pro-lifers to maintain embryo/fetus in the lead; and I think that's preferable to trying to control the tone of the entire article. Because if pro-choicers try that, pro-lifers will be even more perturbed than they already are. So that's the political reasoning added for good measure. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 05:43, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Regardless, the embryo and fetus is human and alive, and must be killed for there to be an abortion, according to the medical definition of induced abortion (the main topic of this article).

<p>OKAY first of all 214 you are just infusing your anti-choice (pro-life) mantra into this debate - if you want to spew filth - spew it in your on time, not mine. All the above you said about major differentiation and the human fetus being human and alive, well that is YOUR belief - and the belief of the right wing - and those who do not know what they were talking about.

Non-viable just means incapable of surviving on its own - and I read through what you said, but don't really understand - I mean I don't see how it can be disputed that the fetus cannot survive on its own when aborted -I've never heard of that - I mean in talking about the marjority of abortions - first trimester - the organs haven't fully developed and all that - even artificially I don't think it could be kept alive - hence it is non-viable. Please clarify.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I understand how non-viable is defined medically; and I'm explaining that is a counter-intuitive definition; and that viability commonly refers to how healthy/normal something is. Keep in mind we are not (nor should we be) in a position to dictate the Abortion article should have medical terminology; and that medical terminology is "correct" or NPOV.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, you speak of perturbing the pro-lifers, heck - I AM PERTURBED! The way the beginning of this article is worded perturbs me - and I'm not going to let something I think is factually incorrect and wrong and POV pass just so I don't "perturb" the anti-choice people; I'm upset by this, too.</p>

<p>ALSO, even if the embryo is healthy and developing - that doesn't make it viable at the time of the abortion - if it's in the first trimester - as most abortions are, for example - it COULD BECOME viable - but it isn't at that time.</p>
<p>VIABLE MEANS IT CAN LIVE WITHOUT THE MOTHER. This cannot be disputed! I think I can safely say that there has never been a first trimester birth of a living fetus in the world - there has never been a birth that has taken place after three months where the fetus has lived and developed into a regular baby etc.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A better medical definition is "live unassisted". You would be correct in your statements; but a fetus' medical viability could be dramatically changed in advances in medicine.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is no viable life! The embryo has no independent function! If it is argued, "well what about third trimester abortions" then I would respond that perhaps a definition could be attached on the article stating that third trimeter abortions are different but when the definition of abortion is given we are speaking of the majority of abortions, which are first trimester. --<a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENadsat_dc33.html" title="User:Nadsat">Nadsat</a> 06:13, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reiterate that in the context of Wikipedia there isn't a requirement we follow medical terminology; nor does something need to be medically viable in order for it to die. On the issue of "death" there is no rational grounds to remove/change it. If it troubles you, I suggest you read fewer medical texts and more literary and philosophical texts. (not to change your opinion on abortion, we are on the same side, but to appreciate the differences in language aren't as stark as you perceive; just because death/died aren't in medical texts does not make it incorrect) The issue I'd like to continue to explore is whether non-viable should be included in the lead.

<p>Actually I was wrong. The Human Rights Act doesn't protect self-determination. In any case it's unhelpful to use the term constitutionally protected or anything resembling it in the context of UK law. In effect, Parliament can set aside any UK law by a simple majority vote. The legislature is sovereign, and the government exercises Crown Prerogative. The judiciary has a limited ability to review such legislature and no defense at all against its repeal. There is no UK constitution -in the sense that Americans use the term. Even separation of powers does not apply in any meaningful sense. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:10, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did some more clean up - removed the gender language to make it neutral and it seems that human rights is the best term. I have some expertise in international human rights law, and it really falls in that category. "American nations" is also awkward since it could imply indigenous peoples ("Indian" or "Native American" nations) to some; countries is a word all people can understand in context. Also, it is not "limitations on", but really the "extent of" self-determination that is the neutral way legal sholars look at the mattter. "Extent of" covers all circumstances: a theoretical state having zero limitations or one with severe limtations.<a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">user:214.13.4.151</a></p>

That is why I insist on constitutional - so we have a clear basis, the lowest common denominator.

<dl>
<dd>1) That abortion mostly is a choice (with the exception of the mother's life being in danger while she is unconcious)</dd>
<dd>2) "feel forced to make such a choice" - yes, some feel that way, but feelings are not always correct.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Pre-born?":</span></h2>
<p>The statement "the deliberate killing of an [sic] pre-born human is considered tantamount to murder of any other innocent human" seems to reveal a pro-life viewpoint ought to be changed to reflect a neutral viewpoint. The phrase "pre-born human" is, I believe, a phrase used exclusively in pro-life literature, and therefore likely to be objectionable to readers who have pro-choice sympathies. Also, (since the phrase is not standard medical terminology) it could be confusing to people who are not familiar with the terms of this debate in America (e.g. younger readers or readers from foreign countries where abortion is not debated in these terms). I believe the statement "an abortion of a fetus is considered tantamount to murder of an innocent human" is more neutral way to state this. I have made this alteration.

<p>It would have been nice if STR1977 (or whoever reverted my edit) would have EXPLAINED why (s)he did so.

<p>No problemo, on the up side it forced me to archive a bunch of stuff. It is STR1977; who's position (playing devil's advocate here) I think would be that when discussing the pro-life position the use of "pre-born human" is appropriate within that context. I'd agree, although I'd put it in quotes or something like that. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 20:09, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, it was me. Sorry for not explaining my edit. Roy is right I think pre-born human is not only factually correct (which is not the question here), but also NPOV in this context, since the section portrays the pro-life view. If you want to use quotes it should be around the whole sentence, not just around pre-born human (I'd object to that). Also, how would the pro-choice section be changed if we apply the same principle, given that "reproductive rights" are mentioned. Another thing: The previous "deliberate killing of an pre-born human ... murder of any other innocent human" shows more clearly that the pro-life position is basically treating the unborn equal to the born and not actually making abortion a special "crime" (hence exceptions for the life of the mother). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 20:33, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The reason I think "pre-born human" belongs in quotes is because its <b>not</b> factually correct, and its misleading. It's not a fact the pregnancy will be successful, pre-"born" implies this (although still-born works, but does not cover other circumstances); and "human" is misleading since it can mean our species (true), but in common usage it also means a human being (false, at least for the first trimester) since its a human forming. The rest of the sentence is fine since it is stating the position of pro-lifers and I understand "pre-born human" is how they perceive the fetus; but saying and maintaining it is factual doesn't strike me as justifiable. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 21:07, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now I understand what your problems with "pre-born" are (though it can be justified, since the normal, natural course of events results in birth). Maybe unborn would be better. It is more common anyway. As for "human" - no, it's not misleading - a human being is a human being is a human being. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 00:40, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I thank you for your understanding; although I prefer inutero, unborn is certainly better. As to human forming = human being; well obviously I <b>strongly</b> disagree... hence our respective positions on abortion, and hence it not being factual. Understand?

<p>Roy, I understand that you disagree and that there is (and always will be) contention. I don't agree however that "hence it not being factual". Facts are facts, even if people disagree.

<p>I'm happier with the current edit, but I think we should add that phrases like "unborn human" are pro-life terminology. Say, the following: "For pro-lifers, the deliberate killing of what they call an unborn human is considered tantamount to murder of any other innocent human." Any objections? <a href="../../../d/k/o/User%7EDkostic_3483.html" title="User:Dkostic">Dkostic</a> 16:07, 11 Jun 2005</p>
<p>Yes - I object. Physicians use the word fetus and also the terms unborn child, unborn baby, unborn human, etc. If terms are going to be described as belonging to one camp or the other, then the terms that the pro-abortion industry uses also need to be labeled as such.

<p>I agree with 214...,</p>
<p>Also, if it really is pro-life terminology it is quite suiting in this context, since the section described the pro-life position.</p>

<p>I disagree, "human" as I've explained is a non-specific (and IMO misleading) term since it can mean homo sapien but is understood to mean human being. The rationale that physicians use these terms has no bearing on its standing in this article; it is an argument from authority and has no validity. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 15:35, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You might disagree, Roy, but only because of your POV that distinguishes between <i>homo sapiens</i> and <i>human being</i>. That is your POV and your are entitled to it (though you might reevaluate it), but that doesn't mean that you're right in face of the usage by physicians.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't be ridiculous; and uh YEAH, I'm aware my POV is involved. Now I could into how your entitled to your opinions, but that would be a waste of time since that's not at issue actually. (What's important here is acknowledging that when a human being comes into being is POV; our POV's be damned.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also I don't think an argument from authority invalid. There are experts in certain fields and they know more than we do. And I guess they could argue their case/usage.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then find their argument and paste it here; and just to clarify; arguments from authority are not only invalid; but are very very lame and lazy excuses for "discussion". They don't KNOW jack! Why? The answer is quite simple, why are you so confident I'm using a POV in this discussion? Because there's no such thing as KNOWING and proving when a "human being", a person etc. etc. is created. That's the point! And that is why even in the pro-life context we may have to make that clear. Having a doctorate doesn't make you immune to philosophical unknowns. As to my POV on when something is a human being, I actually don't have a position on that... although certainly I'm leaning away from arguments that rely on a soul.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I wasn't referring to a soul in any way. We don't know when there is a soul.</dd>
<dd>You say it is POV when a <i>homo sapiens</i> is a <i>human being</i>? That might be the case, we cannot know - there are two views, but the one is quite straightforward, simple, cnclusive, while the other view goes to great length to dinstinguish between <i>homo sapiens</i> and <i>human being</i>. You don't have to be a scholar of latin to see the link. For my part, I am opposed to any of this "dehumanizing" business.</dd>

<dd>I didn't say you mentioned a soul; I was clarifying I would use things other than religion for my opinion. And I'm not arguing of a lack of a link; indeed there is a link since one eventually turns into other; but I'm clarifying one is not necessarily equal to the other. It is not "dehumanizing", it is "deindividualizing"; since an embryo is human in one sense of the word (species), but not immediately human in another sense of the word (a member, a person, an individual). This is why a while back I said you don't understand; you're not seeing the disconnect between them. And no, a genome is not only thing that makes an individual, that is the foundation... like for a home essential for a beginning, but it is just that, a beginning. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 16:38, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I consider my position more reasonable because unborn humans in their early stages are entirely dependant on the mother to survive and form. During these early stages it is not an individual; as to drinking... I don't know where you're going with that. And to be perfectly honest with you; based on our conversation thusfar you're a nice moral person; but do not strike as the best judge of what is reasonable.

<p>There's no reason a doctor can't be pro-life, and (s)he might use language of the pro-life movement when discussing abortion, even in a professional context. This appeal to authority is unconvincing.</p>
<p>The sentence "For pro-lifers, the deliberate killing of an unborn human is considered tantamount to murder of any other innocent human." adopts a central tenet of the pro-life movement without identifying it as such--that a fetus at any stage of pregnancy is a living human. Many people, myself included, do not believe that a small, palm-sized fetus with underdeveloped nervous, digestive, respiratory, reproductive, etc bodily systems can be considered a "living human being" under any reasonable definition of the term. It is, of course, everyone's right to disagree with me on this matter; and any opinion on the subject is necessarily a POV. Indeed, the definition of "life" itself suffers from some ambiguity--see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus#Viruses:_non-living_or_alive.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus#Viruses:_non-living_or_alive.3F" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>--suggesting that it is a POV, even if it is widely accepted. Whether a fetus is alive or not is one of the most important questions of the whole abortion debate, and this sentence seems to presume it one way.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Biologically and medically - without question - a human fetus is an organism, is human, is alive, and is unborn - regardless of the value you choose to ascribe to it. What you mean to say is that there is a debate as to the "personhood" of the fetus, not whether it is alive. Clearly you don't ascribe personhood to the fetus. That does not mean the fetus is dead. What is more, even if you pretend the science does not exist, the reader understands that the sentence discusses the POV of pro-lifers. You have the law on your side (for now) but the neutral science - when forced to deal with it - is clearly on the side of pro-lifers. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 15:39, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, don't put words in my mouth. I meant <b>exactly</b> what I said, and I repeat it again for emphasis: I do not think a fetus in early stages of pregnancy can be considered alive under any reasonable definition of the term. Your discussion of "personhood" is redundant (if a fetus is alive, what organism could it be except a person--a giraffe?) and utterly beside the point. You cannot automatically conclude--certainly not "without question"--that a fetus, which may only vaguely resemble a developed human being, whose circulatory system functions quite differently from that of a developed human (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus#Circulatory_system" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus#Circulatory_system" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>), which cannot even survive outside the womb, is a person. You are perfectly free, of course, to believe that a fetus retains some quality that gives it life (by whatever definition you choose), but you should also recognize my right to believe otherwise.

<dd>Dkostic, 214... was giving you the benefit of the doubt, but you obviously insist on adhering to a contrived, illogical view, at least it seems so. 214's conclusions "without question" are absolutely correct on the medical and biological field. You are putting forth new, invalid criteria for being human: If a human gets into an accident and is seriously maimed but not dead - is he a living human being? If you get old and weak and are unable to walk from your bed and thus cannot feed yourself (and thus not survive) are you still a human being? The question about personhood is not beside the point - it is the actual question, if you cloak it in biological terms. And the alternatives are a person or not a person - no giraffes involved here. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 23:31, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I decide that I'm unable or unwilling to care for granpa, I can ask my cousins to help or pay a live-in nurse or use his social security to place him in a home or one of many other options that do not require his death. If I decide that I'm unable or unwilling to carry a baby to term, the only options require the death of the fetus. Therefore your comparison is invalid because a fetus depends on one specific person for support (and thus in my opinion it is only that person's decision to carry it to term) whereas an invalid depends ultimately on society in general for support, much as each person in the society does at some level. Therefore the invalid is simply another member of society - just another person - whereas a fetus is not. --<a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurascudder_7cfd.html" title="User:Laurascudder">Laura Scudder</a> | <a href="../../../l/a/u/User_talk%7ELaurascudder_bd8d.html" title="User talk:Laurascudder">Talk</a> 02:34, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>STR1977, the supposed counterexamples you provide are instances where the bodily functions of a normal human have been obstructed by external phenomena (serious illness, accidents, affects of advanced age, etc). I'm trying to point out that a normal human being (like me) has physical characteristics and bodily activities quite different from that of a fetus undergoing normal development (and the earlier in the pregnancy, the greater the differences). A human who has endured (and survived, presumably) the unfortunate maladies you describe retains a sufficient similarity to a normal human (e.g. the victim can presumeably still think, eat, breath, sleep, digest, excrete, etc although perhaps with difficulty) and reasonable people will understand that had this victim not suffered bad luck, he would be considered a normal human. A fetus, during its normal development, cannot perform many of the bodily tasks we associate to a normal human. I'm comparing normal things; you're comparing a normal thing to an abnormal thing.</dd>

<dd>I am still waiting for someone to answer my objections and explain to me how a zygote, or even a fetus a few weeks into a (normal) pregnancy, is--"without question"--the same thing as a living, breathing (normal) human being. I am not asking anybody to adopt to the views I have put forth, only to accept that a reasonable person might agree with me, and that this is cause for modifying the sentence to state explicitly that an "unborn human" is not a generally accepted concept (say, by substituting it with the less controversial term "fetus"). If no such explanation is forthcoming, I ask that we make the edit and move on to other matters.

<p>The above sentence should be modified to reflect the neutrality found in, for example, the sentence "The cornerstone of the pro-choice movement is the issue of reproductive rights, which its proponents argue encompasses the right of a woman to choose to have an abortion." which appears in the preceding paragraph on the positions of the pro-choice movement. In this sentence, by way of contrast, it is made clear that only pro-choicers contend that "reproductive rights" (which also encompass less controversial activities as the right to purchase contraception, the right to have children, etc.) cover abortion. I think we can all agree that the sentence "The cornerstone of the pro-choice movement is the issue of reproductive rights, which encompasses the right of a woman to choose to have an abortion." would not be NPOV, even in a context intending to describe pro-choice positions. The edit I am suggesting would eliminate this contrast. (<a href="../../../d/k/o/User%7EDkostic_3483.html" title="User:Dkostic">Dkostic</a> 00:17, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are assuming way too much. Many people consider the very term "reproductive rights" to be manufactured, false, and a euphemism for "abortion rights" - and also consider that there are no such "rights" to have sex without incurring its natural consequences. This may be novel to you, but it was mainstream until the 1950s, and is still held by many. In sum: the term "reproductive rights" is POV all by itself. <a href="../../../2/1/4/User%7E214.13.4.151.html" title="User:214.13.4.151">214.13.4.151</a> 15:39, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, "rights" may bring consequences. My right to speak may carry the consequence of unpopularity, my right to a judicial trial may carry the consequence of a conviction, etc. This does not in any way suggest that these are not rights. I absolutely agree that "reproductive rights" are POV, but the concept of reproductive rights isn't controversial at all--if you accept that there are certain sex-related behaviors (for example, incest, pedophilia, zoophilia, and maybe abortion) that our society may legally outlaw, and other sex-related behaviors (for example, conception within a church-sanctioned marriage) that our society may legally protect, then you too believe in some concept of "reproductive rights" (even though it may be very different from what I call "reproductive rights"). My point was that the statement I quoted (in the paragraph you responded to) made clear that pro-choicers believe "reproductive rights" (which means many things to different people) encompass abortion--the statement doesn't assume (incorrectly) that reproductive rights <b>must</b> contain a right to abortion. Similarly, I would like the statement in contention ("For pro-lifers, the deliberate killing of an unborn human is considered tantamount to murder of any other innocent human.") to reflect that the concept of a fetus as an unborn human is one that is generally accepted by pro-lifers, but NOT pro-choicers.

Your information is extremely fringe, and IMO does not belong on the abortion page. I suggest you place it at the end with a link to a page started for odd-ball abortion methods that are and never will be medically recommended. I find myself laughing at this, becuase I don't find surgical abortion any less barbaric than doing the deed via herbs or trauma, however the entries here are supposed to reflect information that is generally useful to the population.

<p>I have gone and done a mass reversion of the edits of 214.13.4.151 for several reasons. First, the most recent change was a clear vilation of POV. Legality is also dependant on nation, area, and enforcment. Mass labling of illegal is pretty silly. Using herbs to induce an abortion was cited and also passes occam's razor (if herbs can do anything at all, they can probably induce abortions, the same way a herb can be used to poision a person.) The rest of the changes were questionable, and I decided that 214,13,4,151's edit history was too suspicious and I revereted for saftey's sake. skepticism about herbal and trauma is fine, but I'd like to move the article AWAY from the dispute tag, not towards it--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 18:24, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Eyeon (masturbation, anus and feces): there is no proof that herbs can actually cause an abortion. Citing a for-profit herballist website is not proof. Please find a scientific study that demonstrates your claim. The fact the peoplehave written about it for a long time does not make it so - some Chinese eat rhino horns (in vain) to treat impotence and have been doing so for millennia - it does not prove rhino horns are a remedy for that malady. This entry is supposed to be factual - not speculative. My wording reflects the facts. It makes no sense to list the specifics of a home-remedy that is not proven to cause the desired effect. And I changed the title to one that is appopriate "Self-induced abortion" - which is quite approrpiate and not at all "POV".

<p>"Ban abortion with Constitutional amendment. We say the unborn child has a fundamental right to life.

Our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions.

<p>"Alternatives like adoption, instead of punitive action. Our goal is to ensure that women with problem pregnancies have the kind of support, material and otherwise, they need for themselves and for their babies, not to be punitive towards those for whose difficult situation we have only compassion. We oppose abortion, but our pro-life agenda does not include punitive action against women who have an abortion. We salute those who provide alternatives to abortion and offer adoption services."

Wade, and regardless of her ability to pay. We stand firmly against Republican efforts to undermine that right. At the same time, we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives. Abortion should be safe, legal, and rare." (Source: The Democratic Platform for America, p.36 Jul 10, 2004)</p>
<p>"Choice is a fundamental, constitutional right. Democrats stand behind the right of every woman to choose. We believe it is a constitutional liberty. This year’s Supreme Court ruling show us that eliminating a woman’s right to choose is only one justice away. Our goal is to make abortion more rare, not more dangerous.

<p>There was an edit to add the information of Self induced Abortion. I suspect this is not a mainstream term: A google search for "self induced abortion" returns 3650 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22self+induced+abortion%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22self+induced+abortion%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> A google search for "induced abortion" and "spontaneus abortion" return 109,000 and 164,000 hits respectivly <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22induced+abortion%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22induced+abortion%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22spontaneous+abortion%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22spontaneous+abortion%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Total Dispute: How can we fix it?</span></h2>
<p>I flagged this article as totally disputed, since we can't seem to come to any sort of agreement whatsoever on almost anything. I propose a top to bottom review of this article, primarly fact checking, accuracy and reduction of point of view statements. Then, balance issues (mainstream versus not) then trim for length. Either way, this article is quickly becoming useless.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 16:16, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Overall problems: globally limited. All most all of this article is US-centric, especially talk about legality issues In my opinion, we should also strive to use clinical terms. Trauma instead of violence or pressure for example.</p>
<p>Introduction: Fine as it is. if <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-induced_abortion.html" title="Self-induced abortion">Self-induced abortion</a> becomes a consensus accepted term, restore it at the end with a "also known as..." verbage.</p>
<p>Methods of Inducing abortion: This could probably be spun off into its own article. If not, what headings do we use? I think reasonably neutral would be the larger headings of "Medical" abortion and "alternative" abortion. Medical describes methods used by the medical community accepted as medicaly safe. Alternative covers everything else (herbal, trauma, etc.) Several of the health risks can be rolled into these descriptions as well, and then another section of "general health risks" can cover the psychological and psychatric issues involving abortion. ABC hypothesis goes in general, as well as risks of premature birth. CITATIONS are a MUST!</p>
<p>Abortion law should reflect what is currently true around the world, which it seems to.</p>
<p>Paternal rights, politics should be rolled into the debate on abortion section of the article. That may end up being spun off into is own article which can also detail the history of the abortion debates and issues.</p>
<p>Pro Life links still need to be culled.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 16:16, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>As for methods of abortion being spun off into a separate article - each method currently has its own page, so why place another page between the user and the methods when all it would be is a page of links? If a more accepted term was found for self-induced abortion, the article you have requested for deletion could be moved and edited to accomodate this. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaully_efd5.html" title="User:Spaully">Spaully</a> 19:03, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>do all herbal and traumatic abortions qualify as self-induced? I seem recall a very sad case in Michigan where some kids got into trouble. That wasn't really "self-induced" nor was it done within a clinic. And looking, you're right, each method has its own page, then we need to have "for the main article..." links on each. As for the VfD, it seems I am probably wrong about the article itself, but I still doubt it as a useful classification of "types" of abortions, rather it seems to be an accepted term about a problem in the ongoing abortion crisis/debate. --<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 20:23, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alrighty. I disagree WomenonWaves needs no comment; because I didn't know what it was when I initially saw it; and the rationale "just go to the link" can apply to all links, but we put comments to be helpful especially for people unfamiliar with the subject or the organizations. For example if The Alan Guttmacher Institute is a research arm of planned parenthood, perhaps that should be mentioned. (I saw it was removed when an anon placed it there.) - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 04:50, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At this point, I removed all commentary aside from official catholic doctrine since who the hell understands latin these days anyway. WomenonWaves has more than just abortions where illegal information, and looks more like a general prochoice site to me. I'm just cutting like mad, and I'm doing it pretty viciously.
