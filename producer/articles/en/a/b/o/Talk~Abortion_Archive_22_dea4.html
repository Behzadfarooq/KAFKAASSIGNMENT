<p>As for Motion 2, I count 5-2 against. It looks like some of the objections are to the form of the tag rather than the form of the sentence. Upon reflection, I agree that it's the wrong tag, I'm withdrawing my motion, and I'm submitting this one in its place:</p>

<p>Oh, and KC, the <b>fact</b> of the death is <b>very much</b> disputed, given that something that never lived cannot die. I will not cede that life begins at conception, that is not a scientifically established fact, anti-choice dogma to the contrary. Defining the cessation of viable cellular function as "death" is way too problematic. Otherwise, one could argue that women who ovulate and then menstruate are complicit in the "death" of their ova... or worse: that men who masturbate commit <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a>! <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStruct_2b6a.html" title="User:Struct">Struct</a> 02:21, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just a random outside opinion: would "removal" of the embryo/fetus make more sense than death or destruction?

<dd>Outside opinions appreciated, but removal isn't in contention because it does not clarify what occurs to the fetus. Is it removed and frozen? Re-inplanted? Put in an artificial womb?

<p>I would argue that it isn't our preview to write in such a way as to assume the manner in which our information is to be used. We aren't writing an informed consent pamphlet, as Ackoz seemed to imply, but rather an encyclopaedia.

<dd>I agree, factualism above all else where possible.

<dd>Whatever... pamphlet or encyclopedia, both must be factual, not euphemistic. The fact is, that the embryo is alive before the abortion occurs and it is not after. IMHO there must be some death involved.

<dd>Ackoz, this argument was mentioned and refuted some time ago. The purpose of an induced abortion is to end the pregnancy. The foreseeable side-effect is that the embryo or fetus does not survive. When we take an animal and eat it, the purpose is to feed ourselves, not to kill the animal; that is a side-effect. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 21:25, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems clear to me at this point that the community is deeply commited to the word "death" and that my proposal to change that word is not going to gain any traction. I respect the WM process, therefore I'm going to withdraw my motions to change the opening sentence.</p>
<p>However, I'm also deeply appalled by that word's (in my opinion) inaccurate and inflammatory misusage. I cannot in good conscience participate in this discussion or contribute to this article so long as a deeply entrenched (as I see it) non-neutral perspective remains, and I hope y'all will respect that in return. I'm removing this article from my watchlist and considering it a non-neutral, unreliable and inaccurate source. I hope you'll take my word for it that I'm doing this for reasons of conviction and not to be a bad sport.

<dd>One point that I'm not seeing in this discussion (at least not with this specific example) is that "death" does <i>not</i> just mean murder, which I would define (vaguely) as "morally wrong death". "Death" is a biological process which happens to fetuses, flies, bacteria, vegetables, and fungi. (Not to mention chickens, which, to reference an earlier argument made here, <i>do</i>, in fact, die in order to be eaten, if not at the exact moment of eating. Yet I eat chicken, because I happen not to think that all instances of killing are murder.) In addition, I will agree that a fetus is unquestionably "alive" at the moment of conception, and even further before that, because eggs, sperm, and embryos are all active biological matter. I still lean on the pro-choice side of the issue, but I think it's important that we get our terminology straight throughout. The way I usually think of the debate is that it's not a question of whether an embryo/fetus is alive but whether it possesses a "soul", or whatever we should call that which has a right to exist for its own sake, like you and I have. (My extremely POV answer is no, as I would say also for the chickens/insects, etc, but I feel a lot of empathy for the opposite answer, both when it comes to pro-lifers and vegetarians.) --<a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenoxus_9f29.html" title="User:Lenoxus">Lenoxus</a> 02:25, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Motion 3 There should be more definitions for abortion, the killing f an unborn fetus is not the only thing that abortion means. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonmon6691_c983.html" title="User:Jonmon6691">\/\/@||@(3</a> 05:47, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Disclaimer"</span></h2>
<p>The thing I added is not a real disclaimer (I don't think that wikipedia needs something like that) but a warning. As it is subject to frequent edits by not-so-informed editors, the information contained in Wikipedia can be misleading. (for other reasons please see the template's talk page). I would appreciate if someone suggested some better wording, because this doesn't actually fit "abortion". <a href="../../../a/c/k/User%7EAckoz_4ac0.html" title="User:Ackoz">ackoz</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg_c483.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cb/Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg/20px-Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg_c483.html" /></a> 10:14, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Health Warning</span></h2>
<p>I have never seen the disclaimers you mentioned in <a href="../../../h/e/a/Template_talk%7EHealthDisclaimer_f658.html" title="Template talk:HealthDisclaimer">Template_talk:HealthDisclaimer</a> before.

<p>Could someone help with adding a new reference to a recently published study on the mental health consequences of abortion?</p>
<p>Here is the reference: Fergusson, D.M., Horwood, L.J., &amp; Ridder, E.M. (2006). Abortion in young women and subsequent mental health. <i>Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 47</i>(1), 16-24.</p>
<p>This is an important study because it is longitudinal rather than cross-sectional in design, and also because they statistically controlled for confounding variables, such as prior mental health and demographic characteristics (e.g. socioeconomic status).</p>
<p>This study was conducted in New Zealand as part of the Christchurch Health and Development Study, which has been studying a New Zealand cohort since birth. The study has spanned 25 years. They examined women between the ages of 15 and 25, and found that 14.6% had had an abortion. After controlling for confounding variables, they found that these women who had had an abortion had increased levels of <i>subsequent</i> mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviors, and substance use disorders. These mental health consequences only appeared after the abortion and, given the control of confounding variables in the analysis, this finding strongly suggest that these mental health problems were caused by the abortion and/or events surrounding the abortion.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Brobbins (<a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrobbins_9b3e.html" title="User talk:Brobbins">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brobbins_e69b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brobbins">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>The <i>Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry</i> is the official journal of the Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health, which is the leading international journal in child and adolescent psychiatry. They have a strict peer-review process, so they would be highly unlikely to publish such a study, especially of such a highly charged issue, unless the research was impeccably accomplished in terms of validity and reliability of measures. Nevertheless, for those who are curious and would like to examine the study yourself, it is available on-line in pdf form here: <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01538.x?cookieSet=1" class="external free" title="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01538.x?cookieSet=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01538.x?cookieSet=1</a> or here: <a href="http://www.chmeds.ac.nz/research/chds/view1.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.chmeds.ac.nz/research/chds/view1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.chmeds.ac.nz/research/chds/view1.pdf</a>.

<dd>Abortion, being a top-tier article, requires the streamlined coverage of a broad array of topics. Thus, doubling the size of sub-section without adding much in the way of new information to the article is something to be avoided. I remember that the Christchurch Health study was suggested before and so I will try to trim mention of it down to the meat of its findings. However, as for the other study, which, I am sure, was snuck into the article in good faith, it is a definite no, as Reardon has been flagged for bias (Archive 19, "Suicide rates revisited"). -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 02:20, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not redundant. Google links haevily to wikipedia now, and directly to the articles. Average uneducated internet user only sees the article and doesn't really know how things work here PLUS the disclaimer at the bottom is insufficient with regard to the fact, that in some articles, latent nonsense / politically biased / extremist information (how many times do I have to repeat that until you get it, John Seigenthaler, John Seigenthaler, John Seigenthaler, John Seigenthaler, enough??) can be entered and go unnoticed for months. For instance in the case I mentioned above.

<p><i>It's believed the method works by preventing conception from occurring.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">UK Law</span></h2>
<p>The section on UK law is not correct. Two doctors do not need to agree that an abortion is socially necessary, they simply need to agree that continuation of the pregnancy will entail greater risk than an abortion. Given that (almost always), this is the case, this is defacto abortion on demand, though with the caveat that the law does not oblige the state to perform that abortion. There are no practical legal limits on abortion before 24 weeks in the UK.<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERos_Power_4a2c.html" title="User:Ros Power">Ros Power</a> 20:38, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks. The key quote is that the law requires the doctors to certify that "continuing with the pregnancy involves a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman, or her existing children, than having a termination". As Ros pointed out, abortion in the first trimester and well into the second one is almost always safer than carrying a pregnancy to term, so this is no barrier. On the other hand, as the article points out, some doctors are obstructionist about this, and getting two doctors to agree is a pain. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Al</a> 22:15, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The precise wording is, in fact, "medically or socially necessary." The majority of sources support that, in the U.K., two doctors must approve of an abortion before it is performed:</p>

<dd>I can't find the text in the Act that uses the term "medically and socially necessary". As a point of fact, the DoH (Department of Health) in the UK have verified my point in writing to me, that basically all abortions are legal on these grounds in the UK before 24 weeks. However, Alienus is correct insofar as doctors have the ability to conscientiously object to abortion, and as more and more of them become educated about it, an increasing number are refusing to be involved in the orchestration of the killing of the unborn. However it remains factually incorrect to state that there is any theoretical or practical protection of the unborn child in the UK before 24 weeks, or that people have any legal responsibility to protect those that they conceive through their own volition. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERos_Power_4a2c.html" title="User:Ros Power">Ros Power</a> 03:36, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I agree, but the point is that by it's inaccurate to state "medically and socially necessary". What this implies is that there are criteria an abortion request must meet before it's permitted, such as a direct risk to a woman's mental or physical health, rather than the default "risk" of simply continuing with a normal pregnancy. By that criteria, it would be medically necessary to abort ALL children. The statement in the article is misleading and needs qualified.<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERos_Power_4a2c.html" title="User:Ros Power">Ros Power</a> 05:53, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do think this is misleading and needs to change. It suggests that there is at least a nominal, cursory, legal protection of the unborn child in the UK. This is simply fallacious - there simply is none.

<dd>Ros, maybe you can review your comment in light of the fact that abortion is significantly more dangerous (to the mother) than childbirth in most cases (I'm fairly certain of this). If that is the case, the situations in which abortion will cause less harm that continuing pregnancy will be relatively few.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.94.136.99 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__203.94.136.99_7307.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 203.94.136.99">contribs</a>) 21:43, 8 June 2006.</small></dd>

<p>(Reset indent) The part of the Hippocratic oath which relates to abortion, "<i>Nor will I give a woman a pessary to procure abortion</i>," is open to interpretation as either a sweeping ban on all forms of abortion or merely those induced by <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pessary.html" title="Pessary">pessary</a>. As noted at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_abortion.html" title="History of abortion">History of abortion</a>, Hippocrates recommended a questionable method for inducing abortion — jumping up and down — to a woman on one occasion, and also gave an account of performing a surgical procedure in documents attributed to him. I think these are facts which would be worth mentioning if we were to discuss the Hippocratic Oath in such a context. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 18:03, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I probably should have been clearer. I was always under the impression that physicians took the Hippocratic oath as part of their graduation, it seems I was wrong. It would seem appropriate at least to mention the Hippocratic oath and how it was interpreted as protecting the life of the unborn child, even though today the unborn child is largely undefended in many jurisdictions in which it was/is taken. It would be appropriate to parallel the change in the law with the change in the oath or its usage.<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERos_Power_4a2c.html" title="User:Ros Power">Ros Power</a> 03:53, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
