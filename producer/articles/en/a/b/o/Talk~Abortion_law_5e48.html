<p>The timeline lists Iceland as being first in legalizing abortions, but what about the Soviet union? It's a fairly big and important topic, I don't know when abortions started in the USSR, but since feminism was very strong in the communist movement, it would be very interesting to know...</p>
<p>"Iceland was the first country to legalize therapeutic abortion under limited circumstances, doing so in 1935." I've checked up on this now: While I can't find an exact date for legalizing abortion in the USSR, It was definitively legal under parts or all of Lenin's regime, and also under Stalin until he made it illegal again in 1936 (because he was dissatisfied with the low population growth). So this line is not correct. How about changing it to something like</p>
<p>"Iceland was the first western country to legalize therapeutic abortion under limited circumstances, doing so in 1935. Abortion had then been legal for some time in the Soviet Union, but Stalin outlawed it again in 1936 out of concerns for population growth."</p>
<p>Some information on the subject can be found on <a href="http://www.dickinson.edu/~history/dictators/stalin_women.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dickinson.edu/~history/dictators/stalin_women.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<hr />
<p>This article, especially the following paragraphs, seems to be non-NPOV. These paragraphs seem to be arguing for the legalization of abortion, don't you think? <i>Many Western countries began to make abortion illegal in the 19th century. Anti-abortion forces were led by a combination of conservative groups opposed to abortion on moral grounds and medical professionals who were concerned about the danger presented by the procedure and the regular involvement of non-medical personnel in performing abortions.</i></p>
<p><i>It became clear in the following years, however, that illegal abortions continued to take place in large numbers even where abortions were expressly illegal. It was difficult to obtain sufficient evidence to prosecute the mothers and doctors, and judges and juries were often reticent to convict. Many were also outraged at the invasion of privacy and the medical problems resulting from abortions taking place illegally in medically dangerous circumstances. Political movements soon coalesced around the legalization of abortion and liberalization of existing laws.</i></p>
<p>I'm sure the neutrality issue has been discussed to death at <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a>, which I have not participated in, but maybe an effort should be made here as well.

<p>Abortion only became decriminalized in Canada in 1988, although i'm not sure how to explain the way it worked...you can take a look at the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion in Canada</a> page to get the idea. Basically there was an exception to the law provided for the health of the mother, which became wider over time as some came to include mental health, although access was very unever as a result. Also before that abortions for exteem health reasons were done, but they were not called as such from what i understand (i didn't do a hell of a lot of research on that but when i was looking at Therapeutic Abortion Committees i came across a reference to doctors previously meeting in even larger groups then 3 to cover their asses....but the chance in law did effectively allow abortion so how to you get that in without being real complicated? Also currently there is no law whatsoever on abortions in Canada, although access to abortion is still an issue.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcie_43f5.html" title="User:Marcie">Marcie</a> 15:57, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>It would be benificial to add a section on the highlights of Roe v Wade and other major decisions on abortion. Also how the Supreme courts view/interpret this issue with respect to right to life. Also there seems to be no mention of the laws eliminating "Partial-Birth" Abortion.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to make a confirmation as to current practices with reputable sources, but in the past the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>, in enforcing the one child policy, have engaged in seemingly state-sponsored but not necessarily legislated activity in forcing peasent women to abort their fetuses. From CNN: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9806/11/china.abortion/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9806/11/china.abortion/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. There were a lot of other links off of Google but I don't trust their impartiality. The thing I do know is that the combination of poor contraceptive availability, abortion on demand, and the one child policy in China have made gender selection such a problem the government in Beijing has passed a law banning abortion based on gender.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wonder if there are better sources, and perhaps other countries, which still engage in forced abortions?</p>

<p>In the UK entry it indicates that abortions are illegal if it's due to rape. However, it can be argued (and i'm sure it has been in the past) that the birth of a child from an act of rape would cause mental anguish to the woman, and therefore make it legal for the abortion to happen. On a side note, I believe that an abortion has in the past been carried out because of a ski-ing holiday, what is the definiton of on-demand? The chart is inherently inflexible to deal with all the different legal aspects. -- <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJoolz_b423.html" title="User:Joolz">Joolz</a> 00:22, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Being directed to this article, I repost what I said on <a href="../../../a/b/o/Talk%7EAbortion_3254.html" title="Talk:Abortion">Talk: Abortion</a>, regarding the abortion map colouring of the US and Germany.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Tainter, that the US should be pink for "legal on demand". The restrictions cited by Tznkai are really not touching upon the exceptions cited on the map (and are rather periphery anyway.</dd>
<dd>As for Germany, the situtation is difficult: Abortion is "legal" only for rape and mother's health, but under certain provisions (obligatory counselling) it will not be punished if done during the first trimester. How to paint this? Str1977 18:06, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have done the appropriate changes regarding the German law. It's a bit difficult in the last column, so I "overstepped" the limits of the legend. It'll be even more difficult to include this into a map. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 19:08, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're right about America. The puce colour is for countries that make specific socioeconomic provisions for abortion in their legal codes and allow it as such -- and America, for all its state and federal level restrictions, doesn't seem to do this. I'm making another series of maps to deal with the state-by-state restrictions in America (see <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_in_the_United_States_e65c.html" title="Abortion in the United States">Abortion in the United States</a>). As for Germany, though, most sources I have consulted are satisfied that it fits the designation "abortion on demand" because it allows abortion in the first trimester if conditions are met. As for whether it is technically illegal there, even in the first trimester, I wouldn't even know how to begin to address this and other such legislative complexities without the map's legend having 40 colours. --<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 21:38, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Kyd, apart from rape and mother's health abortion is not legal in Germany (another exception for "eugenic reasons" was declared unconstitutional). The other thing is that a woman seeking an abortion in the 1st trimester can have one if she first undergoes obligatory counselling. Such an abortion is considered "against the law, but not punishable". I know it's a tricky law and frankly I don't like it since it suggests to too many people that abortion is legal.</dd>
<dd>As for the map, I have been saving your map for private use and played around with it and turned the US pink and covered Germany with stripes. If you want, I can send it to you via e-mail (I don't know how to upload). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 21:54, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Read the U.N.'s dossier on Germany's abortion law at <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/profiles.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/profiles.htm" rel="nofollow">Abortion Policies: A Global Review</a> and it is in agreement with what you've been saying -- except that, to the question of abortion on demand, it answered "yes." But the map, foremost, is a visual representation of current laws, not the observation of such laws. Spain, too, seems to be similar quandary: the practice of abortion seems liberal but the law not. Should I colour Germany periwinkle -- illegal with exception for rape, life, and health -- until we can devise a solution to the issue that will be both concise and visually appealing? I'm liking the stripes thing, but, unfortunately, I'm worried the white borders plus stripes would make the national boundries more confusing (the solid colours are a lot more visually coherant on a map with countries on such a small scale). Perhaps a new colour to indicate countries in which abortion is illegal but the law is unobserved and/or unenforceable? --<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 22:43, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the UN dossier describes the actual effects of the law, which is unfortunately abortion on demand, though only after obligatory counselling.</dd>
<dd>The law on this is an akward compromise found in 1995, when a new law was to be adopted after the reunification (until then, there were still 2 laws - one for the West and one for the East). The basis for this "illegal but not punishable" stems from the supreme court's ruling in the 1970s, which ruled a general legalisation in the 1st trimester unconstitutional. It also said that state had to uphold the right to life, but that penal law was not the only way to do this.</dd>
<dd>It's not so much that the law is not followed (though it's wrongly perceived in wide circles) - it's that the law is 2double-dealing".</dd>
<dd>I have managed to upload the file, which you an observe here: <a href="../../../a/b/o/Image%7EAbortionLawsMap05.jpg_0144.html" class="image" title="Image:AbortionLawsMap05.jpg"><img src="../../../upload/6/61/AbortionLawsMap05.jpg" alt="Image:AbortionLawsMap05.jpg" width="1400" height="628" longdesc="../../../a/b/o/Image%7EAbortionLawsMap05.jpg_0144.html" /></a>.</dd>
<dd>Germany is striped (at least it's supposed to be stripes) pink (like Canada) and fair blue (like Poland). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 23:25, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I edited the map to incorporate your idea. The legend now contains a "striped" option: illegal but unenforced. The colours of the stripes can be used to indicate whatever the particulars are of "in law" and "in practice" in the country. This configuration, however, might be more difficult with the smaller countries, in light of the scale of the map. --<a href="../../../k/y/d/User%7EKyd_897e.html" title="User:Kyd">Kyd</a> 00:05, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Abortion is essentially legal on demand across the United States right now, if you're willing to allow for some elasticity of the term 'on demand.' The restrictions that exist are for notification, education, waiting periods, etc. At the end of the day, though, the reason for the pregnancy is a factor that cannot be taken as a cause for diminishing the legality as far as I know. The Carhart decision could theoretically be taken to argue that under a certain combination of circumstances, the reason for pregnancy could have an effect - but I don't know of any law in effect that fits this. As far as the South Dakota act, it basically isn't enforceable until the courts reach a decision. --<a href="../../../d/m/g/User%7EDMG413_758c.html" title="User:DMG413">DMG413</a> 02:15, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I notice the are a lot of yeses including for abortion on demand e.g. Canada. Since there is a special category for first and second trimester, this implies that the yes means at any stage. This should be clarified (yes means at any stage. Is abortion on demand really legal at any stage in Canada or many of the other countries with a yes? I suspect the answer is probably no, except perhaps for China? For that matter, some of the other yeses are probably incorrect as they probably only applicable to the first and second trimester. I believe in NZ the yeses are incorrect (see <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_in_New_Zealand_2080.html" title="Abortion in New Zealand">Abortion in New Zealand</a> or at very least misleading as abortions after the second trimester (or 20 weeks more correctly) are much more difficult so we need a way to make this clear. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 17:48, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another thing. A number of countries such as New Zealand and I believe UK don't technically have abortion on demand. However they do have abortion for mental health reason. Generally speaking, this has been intepreted in these countries that if it's an unwanted pregnancy i.e. you really want an abortion (not because you're being pressued) you qualify so IMHO we need to make it clear even though they don't have it legally, they do more or less have it in practice. This is perhaps somewhat similar to Germany and other countries where it is described as illegal but not punished except that it's quite a tricky legal issue. While abortions on demand might be illegal, abortions for mental health reasons are not. Whether these 'on demand' mental health reasons qualify is usually untested in court. Also, I don't know about in Germany but in NZ and I think UK, the way the laws are and abortions work probably means the Drs would be the ones pubished not the women. This depends on the country in question too I believe since in NZ the laws are rather strict but more liberal in most Australian states and the United Kingdom for example. When the law is intepreted liberally but legally it's a tricky situation, this intepretation generally has two components. The first is the willingness of the Drs involved in agreeing to the abortion to provide it 'on demand' for mental health reasons. The second is the governmentness unwillingness to prosecute or sue for these 'on demand' mental health abortion and likely the inability for anti-abortion groups to sue or prosecute. The opinions of the courts may come in to it to since they are likely the ones who deny anti abortion groups the ability to sue or prosecute. Of course, mental health reasons is not intepreted so liberally in all countries. In Malaysia for example, it's generally not although I've heard people say that if you got a private hospital, it can usually be done... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 17:48, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right. Thanks for the pointer. I have, correspondingly, modified the designation to, "Illegal with exception for rape, maternal life, health, and/or mental health." The "and/or" is of special significance here as Brazil is one of those countries which allows abortion for life endangerment and rape but not health.

<p>"Mother" is certainly commonly used. I've often read things about the unborn child/fetus getting nourishment etc. from the mother. The "woman" is not common usage, and seems too far removed from the child/fetus. The "woman" could be <i>any</i> woman. Mother makes it clear which woman it is. And, Alienus, rather than making personal remarks about other users, which you seem to do rather a lot, could you think about whether any of <i>your</i> views could possibly colour your perspective? <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 12:02, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that "woman" is accurate and neutral, while "mother" is neither. A woman who has a desired pregnancy is expecting to be a mother, so calling her one now is just a little bit of harmless sloppiness. For that matter, calling an embryo or fetus that is being carried to term a "baby" is jumping the gun, but hardly unfair. In contrast, a woman with an undesired pregnancy will likely abort it, which means that she will not become a mother and the embryo will not become a baby. That's the accuracy problem.</dd>
<dd>The neutrality problem is that there is a tendency by certain partisans to use maximally emotive language so as to distort thinking. When referring to an egg that has just been fertilized in a petri dish, they call it a "beautiful little unborn baby". And when referring to a teenager who was violently raped by her uncle and has an early chemical abortion, they call her a "mother", then a "murderer". To avoid this bias, articles on abortion try very hard to stick to neutral, medical terminology.</dd>
<dd>Coincidentally, you've made a career of supporting and enabling people like Nandesuka, which colors your perspective as well. If you pursue this further and continue in your current vein, I will wind up escalating this; I will under no circumstances drop it. I'm quite apathetic about circumcision, but I have very little tolerance for intentional distortions regarding pregnancy. Coincidentally, I also have very little tolerance for meddling and biased admins. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 12:17, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Focusing on the arguments, rather than the people, the point I am trying to make is that the word "mother" <i>is</i> used in the medical literature to describe a gravid woman, regardless of her intentions. A simple PubMed search will show this. I agree with you that we should try to avoid words that introduce bias, but one can also introduce bias by using unnatural terminology. For example, if we replaced all instances of "mother" with "womyn", or "human being who has two X chromosomes," that would clearly be clinically correct but so far removed from normal English usage as to introduce a different sort of bias. Obviously, the gap between "mother" and "woman" is much smaller. But we should be following standard English usage, not forging new standards. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 12:26, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note also that many complications and procedures that fall before birth (or termination) are performed by maternal-fetal medicine specialists. This includes termination of pregnancy. On the other hand, not everyone <i>always</i> uses the term "mother." The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists seems to favor the term "pregnant woman"; see <a href="http://www.acog.org/from_home/publications/ethics/ethics034.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acog.org/from_home/publications/ethics/ethics034.pdf" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Lastly, I really would not want to be in the room with someone who told a previously childless woman who just miscarried that she is not a mother because she did not go through a live birth, since I suspect the blood stains would be hard to clean. Given the diversity of opinion, I think we'd be justified in mixing in the terms "mother", "woman", and "pregnant woman", selecting as appropriate to avoid stale writing. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 16:24, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not interested in personally attacking anyone, but I'm also unwilling to hide the existence of prior negative interactions that reveal partisanship and suggest a current bias. Take it in context. And, for the record, Ann chimed in to support Nandesuka after he and his buddies maneuvered to have me banned on a misinterpretation of 3RR. In short, this is not a case of two neutral people sharing neutral opinions. Both are on the record as religious partisans, and both have worked together against me personally.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I bet you also wouldn't want to be in the room with a rape victim who just had an abortion when someone calls her a "mother". The simple fact is that, for all the reasons you've already read, "mother" is an inappropriate and partisan term when applied within the context of pregnant women getting abortions. The phrase "pregnant woman", you may notice, is painfully neutral, while "mother" is not. It is also, as has been pointed out, not accurate in cases of abortion.</p>
<p>Frankly, the argument here is overwhelming and you have no basis. If you continue to disagree, I suggest an RFC.

<p>I mentioned this before but perhaps I rambled too much so it was ignored. However I think we need further clarification of mental health issues. It's intepretation varies significantly between countries. In some countries, it more or less means on demand. For example, in NZ you will be given conselling and support and do need the certification of two doctors but will generally be given an abortion if you want one.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in other countries like e.g. Malaysia which according to the table allows for mental health reasons in the first trimester, it's not really on demand at all. While I believe it varies between hospital and there is somewhat of an underground in private hospital where it may very well be on demand, it's generally interpreted much more conservatively</p>
<p>At the very least, even if we don't clarify by country, we should mention this in the intro</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/o/Talk%7EAbortion_law_5e48.html" title="Edit section: Yes vs * and #">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Yes vs * and #</span></h2>
<p>The fact that we have * and # for the table, implies that yes means there is little or no restriction based on trimester. However it appears in some cases, people have missed the * and # even when there are trimester based restrictions. For example, in New Zealand <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_in_New_Zealand_2080.html" title="Abortion in New Zealand">Abortion in New Zealand</a> <a href="http://www.abortion.gen.nz/legal/crimesact.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abortion.gen.nz/legal/crimesact.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, there are additional restrictions after the 20th week but the at the moment, it suggests there are no restrictions based on the table at the moment, this is not clearly the case. I think we need a fact check and perhaps we can insert a hidden comment in the table to remind people that yes implies there are no trimester based restrictions. Either that or we make a new category for when it's a yes but trimester based restrictions are not noted in the table <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 18:12, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The introduction states that additional restrictions (social, economic, geographical, as well as legal) may exist. The table is meant to encompass the spirit of the law as far as each circumstance. If it were to encompass every nuance of every restriction of every law (various kinds of waiting periods, information disclosure, medical assent, notification, etc.) in every jurisdiction, I suspect we would run out of letters, numbers and other symbols to reference. Judging by the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_in_New_Zealand_2080.html" title="Abortion in New Zealand">Abortion in New Zealand</a> page, the first three columns (life, physical health and mental health) are correct as "yes", while the next two columns (rape and fetal defects) need to be changed to #, which I'll change in a minute. --<a href="../../../d/m/g/User%7EDMG413_758c.html" title="User:DMG413">DMG413</a> 02:11, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I'm not saying we should specify every nuance but IMHO we should use the symbols properly. If we have a * #, this implies to me that yes means the country is less restrictive then 2nd trimester. IMHO, it doesn't make sense to have the * and # if we don't always use them. The other alternative IMHO is to include a special symbol when trimester restictions are not noted in the table (doesn't make much sense IMHO but if people are really reluctant to specify in the table for whatever reason or simply do away with them and just yes or no. I still think a fact check would help (I'm not saying anyone has to do it, just proposing) and also think a hidden comment may be useful to remind people of the * and # but whatever if others feel it doesn't matter because we already say the table might not be accurate I'm not going to argue about it <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 15:23, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Actually, Jareand is right. I misunderstood the nature of the bill. It was my original understanding that H.B. 1215 was a current, active law, which S.D. intended to enforce immediately regardless of federal abortion law — apparently, according to the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Dakota_abortion_law_1e60.html" title="South Dakota abortion law">South Dakota abortion law</a>, it's actually a "trigger law" which would take effect if and when <i>Roe</i> was overturned. I'm still a little confused on the issue, though, because I've also read that HB 1215 will be enforceable once it clears any court challenges (even if that's before <i>Roe</i> is ever overturned). But, as the issue has also been raised on <a href="../../../a/b/o/Image_talk%7EAbortionLawsAroundtheWorld.png_12c9.html#South_Dakota" title="Image talk:AbortionLawsAroundtheWorld.png">the abortion law map Talk page</a>, I'm going to revert S.D. until the confusion is resolved.</p>
