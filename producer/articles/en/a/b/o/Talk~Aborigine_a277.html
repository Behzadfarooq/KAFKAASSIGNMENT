<p>Why do we have a <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">aborigine</a> page and a <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Aborigine (disambiguation)">aborigine (disambiguation)</a> page? the disambiguation page doesn't disambiguate anything that isn't already on the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">aborigine</a>, it is merely less complete and informative. The <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">aborigine</a> page should say "disambiguation" and the current disambiguation page should be removed.

<dd>Ballchef, the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Aborigine (disambiguation)">aborigine (disambiguation)</a> pg is a recent creation, and formerly <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">aborigine</a> did have a dab notice on it. See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aborigine&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aborigine&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">recent Edit history</a> for some indication; it boils down to a slight disagreement on whether "standard" stylistics ought to be employed here or not. My own personal preference is for this pg (<a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">Aborigine</a>) to be flagged as a dab pg, whilst retaining the information it has. A proper article should not be built on this page, since there are already separate articles on the various things which the term "Aborigine" could refer to; nor should this be a simple redirect since there is more than one article it could point to. <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Aborigine (disambiguation)">Aborigine (disambiguation)</a> is only linked to this pg, &amp; I agree it is unlikely to be useful to dab anything as it stands. However, a pg "<a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">Aborigine</a>" (without the <i>(disambiguation)</i> bit added) is needed, since many editors will continue to (and have already) created links to it, when they actually meant to link to one of the alternatives listed on the pg. Therefore, unless you go back and change all these <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">Aborigine</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigines.html" title="Aborigines">aborigines</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aboriginal.html" title="Aboriginal">aboriginal</a>, etc links to <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Aborigine (disambiguation)">aborigine (disambiguation)</a>, and continue to monitor future link creation to these pages, I don't think it will help any to use the "aborigine (disambiguation)" page title format.</dd>
<dd>To put it another way, IMO the "article-name (disambiguation)" pg title standard/format only works when there is a primary article with the title "article-name", and the "article-name(disambiguation)" link is placed at its top and refers to the other, subsidiary meanings. In this particular case, <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">Aborigine</a> will not be expanded as an article on its own merits, and so ought to contain instead the dab references, as most editors cannot be expected to use [[aborigine (disambiguation)] as the explicit link.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> | <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small>TALK</small></a> 01:48, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks CJ. OK, i dont want to expand <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">aborigine</a>, but how about I copy the content of that article and replace the content at <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Aborigine (disambiguation)">aborigine (disambiguation)</a>, then redirect <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">aborigine</a> to the dab page. if <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">aborigine</a> redirects, then any pages that link to <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">aborigine</a> will redirect wont they? At the least I will vote to merge the pages for now.</dd>
<dd>On abother note, I looked at what links here for <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">aborigine</a>, and there are a LOT of pages. I would guess that most of these pages are supposed to link to any one of the three types of aborigines pages, not the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborigine.html" title="Aborigine">aborigine</a> page which is virtually a disambiguation page. that will take a long time. sigh. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallchef_4000.html" title="User:Ballchef">Ballchef</a> 04:42, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The intro says "...peoples who are native to a land..." and says "native" twice more. Is this a correct use of the word, or should these say "indigenous", "pre-colonial" or something? <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native.html" title="Native">Native</a> includes all people born in a place, not just of pre-historic ancestry in that place. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 06:46, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I changed the 3rd instance of "native" to "indigenous", to avoid over-repetitous usage. The other two instances should be fine. The trick is to provide a definition for Aborigine without using the term itself, and of the terms which are sometimes used in a cognate sense, few of them these days are considered appropriate. "Pre-colonial" does not work (e.g., for Taiwanese Aborigines), and expressions such as "primitive", "stone-age" or "prehistoric" are dated and perjorative to boot. Note that the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native.html" title="Native">Native</a> article does distinguish two senses: "native" in the casual (etymological) sense of "having been born in", and "native" as a referral to peoples whose habitation of an area preceded that of Western familiarity and presence in the area (and usually thought of as being tribal-based peoples as well). The latter use does have some colonial overtones, and its usage is often now deprecated, except in a couple of usages where its adoption has persisted (cf. <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_33b5.html" title="Native American">Native Americans</a>). --<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> | <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small>TALK</small></a> 00:43, 2005 July 25 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the term "native" is used to identify <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Aborigine_5939.html" title="Australian Aborigine">Australian Aborigines</a> as well as the term "indigenous", what term is left to identify people born in Australia of other ethnic origins? I don't identify with the homeland of any of the 30 or so of my immigrant ancestors (mostly in the 1850s and 1860s), especially as some of those migrated to escape religious persecution in the country they came from. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 02:00, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the particular context of Australia, referring to Australian Aborigines collectively as "natives" (common noun) is not in widespread contemporary practice, as I'm sure you'd be aware. They can be said to be "native to" (adjectival use) the continent, however where adjectives are called for, "aboriginal" or "indigenous" are now the preferred terms. However this article serves only to briefly explain the various senses in which the word "Aborigine" may be encountered (not restrictive to Australia), and where "native" appears it only does so to clarify what is meant, rather than equate the two terms exactly. As far as how best to refer to other non-Aboriginal or TSI peoples in Australia goes, there are a variety of terms and expressions which might be employed, depending on the circumstances: "Native-born Australian", "nth-generational Australian", "Australian of European (or other) descent", etc. Probably just simply "Australian" or "Australian citizen" would do, unless one particularly wanted to highlight ethnic background or descent. Given the wide range and admixtures of ethnic/cultural ancestries which are possible, it's not surprising that there is no universal descriptor. For whatever reasons, Australian society at large has not yet embraced "native Australian" to include all its peoples, even if the expression sometimes is used that way. --<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> | <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small>TALK</small></a> 04:48, 2005 July 25 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The term "native Australian" has meant people born here of foreign ancestry for over a century - see <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Natives_Association_9e2d.html" title="Australian Natives Association">Australian Natives Association</a> for example. It looks like you have a much better understanding of the issues than I do—would the first line be acceptable as something like "...in general the peoples who first occupied a land, ..."? --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 05:24, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When the ANA co-opted "Australian Natives" back in the 19C., it would seem to have been a purposeful act to distinguish themselves from the British, and they no doubt disdained the formula "Colonials". Nowadays, if someone uses the phrase "Australian natives" you're more likely to think of eucalypts and banksias (I suppose we have Don Burke and his ilk to thank for that!). But no matter, anyone is free to use whatever qualifying terminology they like, the only arbiter being whether or not they are unambiguously understood. As far as the use of the word "native" in this article goes, replacing it with "...who first occupied a land" conveys the same sort of sense, with a proviso that not all such groups are necessarily the first inhabitants. Personally I am happy with the current formulation, but I'm certainly not claiming to be a final authority. If you do want to change it, perhaps use "...peoples who are the earlier inhabitants of a land", or something on those lines.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> | <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small>TALK</small></a> 10:05, 2005 July 25 (UTC)</dd>
