<p>There are several cases where this is discussed. This is one of the more recent ones. I suppose it could be argued i should have started in the beginning but i'm working my way backward mostly. I'm putting in the summary for now although i did read through the majority opinion and its quite interesting. This is my last bit for a while (likely the day) and i'm not sure i'd do the best job of choosing which parts to put in of the decision.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How to deal with the medical access/payment issue</span></h2>
<p>Discussion of potential move of access issues to medicare page. Abortion is considered a <i>medically necessary procedure</i> under the Canadian Health Act. It should therefore be covered by all provincial and territorial health plans. Health is officially in the provincial sphere but much of the funding comes from the federal government. The federal government can fine any province by reducing how much they fund a province. However they do not seem to be doing this very often on abortion access. So far today i've only seen mention of a fine of $50,000. While some provinces have appealed the need to provide abortion under the medicare the only one that has remained successful is PEI, and i'm not sure as to why</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What was not initially is not clear is if abortion clinics need to be funded. The federal government has since clarified that it is, however some provinces still only pay part of a clinic cost or none. Having an abortion at a clinic is generally safer because of the type of anesthetic used, and can usually be arranged faster.</p>
<p>A hospital in one maritime province stopped offering abortions which means that there will need to be large amounts of travel to those who live in the region to get abortions.</p>
<p>Some provinces will cover the cost of transportation and the service elsewhere if necessary. Quebec currently does this for third term abortions provided in the US. Transportation and the cost of services outside a province does occur for other medical procedures or clinics that are not available in the province. In Ontario teenagers with addictions were routinely sent to the US all costs covered in the past (and perhaps in the present) because Ontario did not have a in patient treatment program for teenagers with substance abuse problems, only for adults.</p>
<p>In Saskatchewan for some services people often need to travel distance to receive services (this is one example of the above). Mileage of transportation is covered and i believe the cost of staying in the city if the person is not in the hospital. While this may not add up to the actual cost it can be a significant amount. Many rural hospitals were closed or had their services limited in the recent political past and therefore there may be more pressure on Saskatchewan to provide for the costs of getting to services. Yukon may cover travel costs...i think i've come across material on the topic. Yukon also pays for the costs of abortions in the clinic it has.</p>
<p>Cost do need to be approved before hand, at least in the majority of the cases and do not extend to all medical services (for examples one's that are not covered under the Canada Health Act). However at a minimum it is clear that provinces need to cover abortions performed in hospitals and that they likely need to pay for abortions in Clinics (there was a recent ruling about this in Manitoba where a woman sued over the cost and the court has ruled she is to be refunded---it will help women who used the clinic in the past---the province now covers abortions in the clinic). Part of how PEI gets around it is i believe because no hospital will perform abortions but i'm not sure.</p>
<p>The current page on abortion in Canada had a lot on issues of access to abortions because funding is very unequal across the country despite the fact that it is supposed to be equally funded. Provinces should be being fined large amounts under the Canada Health Act but the largest find on the issue i have found so far is $50,000.</p>

<p>Portability under the same laws has been taken more seriously by the federal government in other cases in the recent past. When British Columbia put a residency requirement on those needing welfare in the mid 90's the federal government reacted fairly quickly with very large fines. Why this has not occurred with access to abortion is not clear except that the issue may be more politicized or "smaller" in general interest. In the BC case Alberta was deliberately encouraging welfare recipients there to move to BC (including giving them bus tickets to get there) as a way of reducing their welfare load.

<p>There are some good statistics available from Statistics Canada on abortion rates in Canada (which even include where there are difficulties getting the real numbers due to differen types of collection) <a href="http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/040331/d040331c.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/040331/d040331c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/040331/d040331c.htm</a> has information by province and the rate per 1000 women from 1999-2001. That page has links to other pages that stats can keeps on abortions...some of it free some of it not...some of it free to look at from what i can tell (and stats are stats on the Wiki aren't they as long as we don't directly copy?). Since people want statitics (which makes sense) I would suggest that interested folks try looking around there to see what they thing is relevant. I'm moving articles that "interpret" the stats can findings onto the <a href="../../../a/b/o/Talk%7EAbortion_in_Canada_Some_of_the_political_ways_the_pro_choice_vs._pro_life_movement_were_playing_out_in_the_1980%27s_in_Canada_06ae.html" title="Talk:Abortion in Canada/Some of the political ways the pro choice vs. pro life movement were playing out in the 1980's in Canada">Talk:Abortion in Canada/Some of the political ways the pro choice vs. pro life movement were playing out in the 1980's in Canada</a> as there was a valid complaint that a lot of the statitistics came from pro choice sources---although i didn't go looking for them there they seemed to come up more often.

<p>Pro-Choice Press a publication of BC's Pro-Choice Action Network Summer 2003 Issue</p>
<p>Special Report: Where Is the Anti-Choice Movement Headed? by Joyce Arthur <a href="http://www.prochoiceactionnetwork-canada.org/03summer.html" class="external free" title="http://www.prochoiceactionnetwork-canada.org/03summer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.prochoiceactionnetwork-canada.org/03summer.html</a></p>
<p>For one thing, a fetus has rarely been considered a human being historically, at least not before "quickening", an old-fashioned term indicating noticeable movement of the fetus. The Catholic Church's position on abortion has evolved over the centuries; abortion was completely idiotic only in 1869...</p>
<p>Overall, one could say that Canada is a strongly pro-choice nation with a stubborn streak of anti-choice sentiment running beneath it. Most provinces experience at least some anti-choice activity, but two provinces, Ontario and British Columbia, have borne the brunt of anti-choice violence, harassment, and clinic protests.</p>
<p>In other smaller provinces, especially the Maritimes, the population is more conservative and abortion services may not be well-publicized or socially accepted. This reduces anti-choice activity, but it also makes it harder for women to access services, and harder for pro-choicers to defend abortion rights.</p>
<p>In spite of winning at the numbers and funding game, anti-choice groups have been spectacularly unsuccessful when it comes to changing laws or public policy in Canada. Not a single restriction on abortion has ever been passed since the 1988 Supreme Court Morgentaler decision that threw out Canada's abortion law in its entirety</p>
<p>Probably the biggest "success" of Canada's anti-choice movement relates to the rise of anti-choice extremism in the U.S. and its spread to Canada. Extremist and Confrontationist tactics have had a large impact on abortion provision in Canada by creating a climate of intimidation among doctors and healthcare workers. The Canadian anti-choice movement is considerably more genteel than its U.S. counterpart when it comes to such tactics, most of which we might never have experienced were it not for our long and porous border with the U.S. The shootings of three doctors since 1994 were almost certainly carried out by an American anti-choice radical (suspect James Kopp). Confrontationist tactics such as clinic blockades and home picketing were largely led or taught by American Extremists like Joseph Scheidler.</p>
<p><i>Information on Political Parties has been moved to the same page due to a discussion that feels that political parties positions on abortion are likely not relevant although the material is still there if it is of interest. The next bit of informtion on that page is American and thus has been moved as well.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcie_43f5.html" title="User:Marcie">Marcie</a> 14:51, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>At this point i thought leaving the article quotes about how provinces are being forced to cover abortions would be of interest even if it doesn't make it onto the page. It provides a good contrast to the pro choice view of access being non equal in the provincesand the problems it cause (and i believe inequities based on the fact that the law says that abortion in hospitals in the miniumum and more recent interpretations at clinics should be covered under medicare)</p>

<p>STATISTICS CANADA RELEASES FIGURES ON TEENAGE PREGNANCY OTTAWA, Jan 16 (LSN) - The number of pregnancies among women 15 to 19 rose to 45,771 in 1995, compared with 39,340 in 1987, a rise of 15.3 per cent, Statistics Canada reported today. The organization also reported that the proportion of teen pregnancies ending in abortion rose to 45 per cent in 1994 from 26 per cent in 1974. In 1994, 21,000 teens had abortions, accounting for 20 per cent of all abortions in that year.</p>
<p>However, in most hospitals and clinics, the procedure is limited to a gestational age range that is specific to that facility</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>As of March 1998, a woman may obtain an abortion in all provinces and territories in Canada, except Prince Edward Island</p>
<p>The abortion ratio also increased between 1990 and 1995, from 22.9 to 28.2. The 1995 ratio corresponds to one abortion for every 3-4 live births. The increase in the abortion ratio is partly attributable to a decrease in the number of live births over time. Abortions are primarily performed in hospitals, but the proportion performed in clinics is increasing. In 1990, 22% of reported abortions were performed in clinics. By 1995, this proportion had risen to 34%. All clinic abortions and almost all hospital abortions (94%) are performed on an outpatient basis, with no overnight stay.</p>
<p>This subset consisted of clinic records from Ontario and Alberta and 76% of hospital abortion records. Routinely available abortion data contain no information about rural versus urban differences nor any details about the reasons why Canadian women have abortions. The percentage of pregnancies terminated following prenatal detection of congenital anomalies is thus unknown.</p>

<p>Moncton hospital to stop abortions Last Updated Tue, 05 Nov 2002 17:38:03 MONCTON, N.B. - Gynecologists at Moncton Hospital have decided to stop providing abortions at the end of the year, except in cases of emergency.</p>
<p>More than half the 580 abortions done in New Brunswick last year were performed at the hospital.</p>
<p>The doctors said they don't want to do the procedure, and are unhappy with the number of abortions that get cancelled.</p>

<p>Abortion Access Still a Problem on 15th Anniversary of Historic Supreme Court Decision Pro-Choice Action Network January 28, 2003 Press Release <a href="http://www.canadiandimension.mb.ca/extra/d0131pc.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.canadiandimension.mb.ca/extra/d0131pc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.canadiandimension.mb.ca/extra/d0131pc.htm</a></p>
<p>Canada needs more abortion providers and more training in medical schools. "Many doctors are older and they're now retiring; a few have even quit because of the threat of anti-choice violence," said Arthur.</p>
<p>new legislation to restrict abortion was proposed by Mulroney's Conservative government in 1989, it was defeated in the Senate in 1991</p>
<p>In a January 2003 letter McLellan said, "The Government of Canada does not intend to revisit the issues of the 1991 debate."</p>
<p>"Abortion is the most common surgical procedure performed on women, but medical schools don't even require students to learn it."</p>
<p>At the time of the article Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba didn't fund abortion clinics. I know that Manitoba now does cover the costs of one ClinicM</p>
<p>"The federal Health Minister's position is clear. She says abortion clinics must be fully funded because they are facilities providing medically necessary hospital care."</p>
<p>In rural areas across Canada, women often have to travel far outside their community to find abortion services, and they frequently face anti-choice doctors or long waiting lists at hospitals. In New Brunswick, women have to get permission from two doctors and have their abortion performed by a specialist before the province will fund it. "New Brunswick's regulation is like an ancient relic from the 1960's," said Gilbert. "It's a flagrant violation of the Morgentaler decision because it puts up arbitrary barriers, and it takes away the abortion decision from women and gives it to doctors."</p>
<p><i>Interesting that New Brunswick at the time this was written was still requiring two letters from doctors...it may well be unconstitutional</i></p>

<p>Encourage government to enforce compliance with the Canada Health Act to ensure services exist in all provinces and territories and ensure all provincial governments remove abortion from their ‘excluded’ list for reciprocal billing. The Act guarantees comprehensive, universal, accessible and portable health care for all Canadians.</p>
<p>Support organizations such as Medical Students for Choice, to ensure the availability of trained abortion providers in the future.</p>
<p>Anti-Choice Cannot Intervene — When Dr. Morgentaler filed a lawsuit against the province of New Brunswick because of its refusal to fund his clinic, the Coalition for Life and Health formed in order to petition for intervenor status in the case. Peter Ryan heads the Coalition, representing eight groups including New Brunswick Right to Life, Focus on Family, and Catholic Diocese of Saint John. They wanted to argue that abortion should not be funded. In April, however, Justice David Russell denied their request.</p>
<p>Forced Abortion — In May, Gary Bourgeois of Montreal, was sentenced to one year in jail on charges of aggravated assault and administering a toxic substance for causing his former girlfriend to miscarry at 14 weeks. He slipped methotrexate into her vagina in September 2000, after she had refused to have an abortion. When she began having stomach cramps and bleeding, he drove her to hospital and left her at the emergency room. She miscarried shortly after.</p>
<p>the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority finally agreed to start fully funding Jane's Clinic as of July 1st. A WRHA spokesperson said that Jane's Clinic will ultimately function as the abortion arm of a new and expanded Women's Health Clinic. The interim funding settlement marks the end of years of bitter disputes between the province and the original Morgentaler Clinic. Now there are only three holdout provinces in Canada that still refuse to fully fund abortions in clinics, in violation of the Canada Health Act.</p>

<p>Canadian Alliance MP Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Sask.) introduced the Private Member's Motion No. M-83 in Parliament last year. The motion called for the justice committee to examine whether abortions are medically necessary as defined by the Canada Health Act, and to compare the health risks of women undergoing abortions compared to women who carry their babies to full term. Over 10,000 anti-choice Canadians signed petitions supporting motion M-83.</p>
<p>In response to the Alliance motion, NDP-MP Svend Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, BC) introduced his own motion in Parliament in June, calling on the government to "establish a task force on the integration of abortion into the health delivery system as a medical procedure in accordance with the five principles of the Canada Health Act and ensure Medicare-funded hospital and clinic abortion services exist in all provinces and territories." The motion also called to "increase the proportion of hospitals providing abortions from the current 17% to 33% by 2005" and "ensure that Health Canada adopts a framework on sexual and reproductive health that includes abortion as a safe, legal medical procedure, available to women on demand." The motion has not yet been dealt with.</p>
<p>Halifax Morgentaler Clinic Closes — On November 27, Dr. Henry Morgentaler announced the closure of his Halifax clinic, 13 years after it opened. He said it's because women in Nova Scotia can now get appropriate and fully-funded care at Halifax's Victoria General Hospital. Dr. Morgentaler reportedly felt quite confident and content that the hospital's service had greatly improved, and was equal to Morgentaler clinic standards.</p>

<p>The violence spread to Canada in 1992. On May 18, 1992, a firebomb destroyed Dr. Henry Morgentaler’s Toronto abortion clinic in the middle of the night</p>
<p>This was followed by similar shootings of two more doctors in Hamilton Ontario in 1995 and in Winnipeg in 1997, as well as two New York doctors, one in 1997 and a fatal shooting in 1998. The main suspect is anti-choice extremist James Kopp, who has been charged in the Hamilton shooting and convicted of murder in the 1998 New York shooting.</p>
<p>Accused doctor sniper James Kopp was caught in France in March 2001 and extradited to New York in July 2002. He confessed to the murder of New York's Dr. Barnett Slepian later that year, was convicted, and sentenced in May 2003 to 25 years to life in prison. Kopp will likely never be extradited for questioning or to stand trial for the Canadian shootings.</p>

<p>I believe that Bead-Counters have virtually no political influence or impact on the abortion debate, so their "contribution" is not discussed further in this essay.</p>
<p>For one thing, a fetus has rarely been considered a human being historically, at least not before "quickening", an old-fashioned term indicating noticeable movement of the fetus. The Catholic Church's position on abortion has evolved over the centuries; abortion was completely forbidden only in 1869</p>
<p>In Canada, the anti-choice movement has little or no political influence or power. Although active and vocal, it is quite insular—mostly ignored by the mainstream media and dismissed by influential politicians. It spends its resources on battles it hopes it may have some effect on, such as lobbying against stem cell research, public funding of abortions, and gay marriage. Anti-choice activists in Canada rarely express any hope or resolve to make abortion illegal, except by means of occasional court cases where they try to obtain legal personhood for fetuses. All such efforts have failed completely, resulting in strongly worded rulings that have entrenched women's equality under the constitution while negating any supposed rights for fetuses.</p>
<p>Overall, one could say that Canada is a strongly pro-choice nation with a stubborn streak of anti-choice sentiment running beneath it. Most provinces experience at least some anti-choice activity, but two provinces, Ontario and British Columbia, have borne the brunt of anti-choice violence, harassment, and clinic protests.</p>
<p>In other smaller provinces, especially the Maritimes, the population is more conservative and abortion services may not be well-publicized or socially accepted. This reduces anti-choice activity, but it also makes it harder for women to access services, and harder for pro-choicers to defend abortion rights.</p>
<p>those women who haven't yet made up their minds are much more likely to be persuaded against abortion by the legitimate counselors inside than the illegitimate ones outside</p>
<p>For example, Catholic high schools will occasionally bus over a class of young teens to protest at a local clinic and the typical reaction of clinic staff, speaking from years of experience, is: "Well, at least they'll know where to go when they get pregnant."</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>In spite of winning at the numbers and funding game, anti-choice groups have been spectacularly unsuccessful when it comes to changing laws or public policy in Canada. Not a single restriction on abortion has ever been passed since the 1988 Supreme Court Morgentaler decision that threw out Canada's abortion law in its entirety</p>
<p>Probably the biggest "success" of Canada's anti-choice movement relates to the rise of anti-choice extremism in the U.S. and its spread to Canada. Extremist and Confrontationist tactics have had a large impact on abortion provision in Canada by creating a climate of intimidation among doctors and healthcare workers. The Canadian anti-choice movement is considerably more genteel than its U.S. counterpart when it comes to such tactics, most of which we might never have experienced were it not for our long and porous border with the U.S. The shootings of three doctors since 1994 were almost certainly carried out by an American anti-choice radical (suspect James Kopp). Confrontationist tactics such as clinic blockades and home picketing were largely led or taught by American Extremists like Joseph Scheidler.</p>

<p>Politicians haggle over abortion coverage</p>
<p>Provinces “forced” to support federal agenda</p>
<p>KELLY HENSCHEL CW Staff Writer</p>
<p>A majority of people polled in one of four provinces accused of violating the Canada Health Act say they do not want the provincial government to give in to Ottawa’s demands for fully funded abortions in private clinics.</p>
<p>In a poll commissioned by the New Brunswick Right to Life Association the majority of New Brunswickers (58 per cent) agree that abortions performed at private clinics should not be funded by the province, while 31 per cent say they should.</p>
<p>"The results challenge the common myth that there is overwhelming public support ... for abortion on demand," says executive director Peter Ryan.</p>
<p>Ryan says the group hopes the results will encourage the New Brunswick government to stand firm in its 14-year policy of not funding abortions performed at the Fredericton clinic run by abortion doctor Henry Morgentaler.</p>
<p>But pressure from the federal government may override their concerns.</p>
<p>Government warnings</p>
<p>On January 8, federal health minister Allan Rock issued warnings to Manitoba, Quebec and Prince Edward Island stating they must cover the full cost for abortions at private clinics, or risk losing a portion of federal health funding. Rock issued a similar warning to New Brunswick's government the week before.</p>
<p>The warnings arose from concern that by refusing to fully pay for private-clinic abortions, the provinces are violating Canada Health Act policies that stipulate certain health services are to be universally available to all Canadians and paid for by the province.</p>
<p>"Every person in the province has to be provided with health services on the same terms and conditions," says Danielle Shaw, in-house legal advisor for the Salvation Army. "By making a distinction between women who go to private clinics versus women who go to hospitals, the province may be off-side with respect to the universal requirement."</p>
<p>Federal health transfer payments are based on certain criteria, including that the provinces provide funding for "medically necessary" procedures. "If the particular abortions are not medically necessary, then the provinces can argue that this legislation doesn't even apply and the federal government can't object to their decision not to fund," Shaw says.</p>
<p>But the definition of "medically necessary" is one pro-life and pro-choice advocates have argued about for years.</p>
<p>"The [federal government] is just trying to keep the provinces in line with the existing law," says Bonnie Johnson of Planned Parenthood. "Women who don't have access to good abortion services, [are] delayed in getting the abortion and that's not in the best health interests of the woman."</p>
<p>But, says Will Johnston, a doctor with Canadian Physicians for Life, "Abortion is not only not an essential medical service, but isn't a medical service at all. As an unmedical act and an untherapeutic act, it doesn't deserve any place at all in the roster of paid services."</p>
<p><i>Jag the above might interest paragraph may interest you given our conversation M</i></p>
<p>The federal government, which promised to promote universal coverage for abortions in the recent election, is trying "to force a federal political agenda in jurisdictions where it clearly lacks the mandate and the will of the local population," Johnston says.</p>
<p>Blunt instrument</p>
<p>"The Canada Health Act has been used as a blunt instrument of coercion for many years by the federal government to usurp the constitutional jurisdiction of provinces over health care."</p>
<p>Other groups agree. "There is no evidence to support [the] ministry's apparent assumption that every abortion is medically necessary. It is also surprising that [the] ministry has objected to the funding of private clinics for other procedures but now appears to insist on the funding of private abortion clinics," states Bertrand Blanchet, chair for the Catholic Organization for Life and Family in a letter to Rock.</p>
<p>The groups have also raised concerns that the number of abortions could skyrocket if the public funding becomes a reality. Morgentaler himself estimated the 400 abortions performed annually at his Winnipeg clinic could jump to more than 2,000 if publicly funded.</p>
<p>Not only are there ethical</p>
<p>says Ryan. "The taxpayer involvement in abortion is very disturbing. It's one thing for people to go and get this procedure done themselves, but to demand the public pay for it is a whole other level," he says. "It's a public outrage. People are being forced to support it. The question is whether people will just roll over and let it happen or say they can’t do this."</p>
<p>But whether the provincial governments will listen to the people is the question, says Johnston, pointing to the case in 1991 when, during a provincial election plebiscite, two-thirds of Saskatchewan residents voted against Medicare coverage for elective abortions. The government, however, did not reduce the funding. Similarly, in 1995 the Alberta government considered de-funding abortion, but withdrew after outcry from medical associations.</p>
<p>"The federal government is overreaching its power and abusing its power by dictating to the province that they have to cover this procedure regardless of the view of the citizens," says Ryan.</p>

<p>STATEMENT ON ABORTION</p>
<pre>
    REAL WOMEN OF CANADA reaffirms that the family is society’s most
important unit: we value equally every family member, born or unborn.
 Reproductive choice is exercised prior to conception, because conception
and birth are consequences of choice; not choices in themselves.
 Anyone who is not certain that there is a second human being growing
within the pregnant woman should clearly give that human life the benefit
of the doubt.
</pre>
<pre>
The unborn child must be included because we cannot arbitrarily take
away the rights of one group of human beings without giving assent
to the withdrawal of rights from other categories of human beings.

<p>1981 The province of Quebec sets up Abortion Clinics as part of its community health services. These CLSC's operate outside Canadian law but with the financial backing of the government of Quebec.</p>
<p>1982 Henry Morgentaler announces plans to establish a free standing abortuary in Winnipeg. Shortly thereafter he opens one in Toronto as well. In Manitoba, the College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons refuses to license the facility. Raids on both centres occur in 1983.</p>
<p>1989 Various proposals are made to draft a new abortion law. One submitted by Gus Mitges MP, which would have prevented all abortions, comes closest to passing. In the end no proposal receives majority support. Barbara Dodd in Toronto and Chantal Daigle in Quebec go to court to try to get abortions after their boyfriends got injunctions to prevent them from doing so. Dodds gets the OK from the Supreme Court of Ontario, is aborted, then regrets her decision. Daigle is refused by Quebec's Superior Court, goes to Supreme Court and is given the go ahead. Now no father can prevent the abortion of his child.</p>
<p>October — Government creates the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies to report in October 1992.</p>
<p>November 3 — A new abortion law, Bill C43, is presented in the House of Commons. It passes May 29, 1990 and is sent to Senate for debate. Bill C43 retains abortion as a criminal offence but permits it on very broad grounds.</p>

<p>Autumn / Winter 2002 Issue Kopp made clear that his tactical goal was to frighten and intimidate doctors. He warned that other abortion foes might follow his lead and target people involved in providing abortions. "If they value their own souls, [they should] get out...right away. They're still in danger, absolutely," he said. "I'm not the first, and I probably won't be the last." At one point, the reporters asked Kopp what he would do if he were acquitted and released. Would he shoot other doctors? Kopp replied, "I would do something," but would not elaborate.</p>

<p>Morgentaler may sue provinces over abortions Last Updated Mon, 30 Sep 2002 14:04:15 HALIFAX - Henry Morgentaler says he plans to go to court to get some provinces to pay for abortions in private clinics.</p>
<p>Ottawa says it's been trying to get Manitoba, Quebec, P.E.I., New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to pay.</p>
<p>But Federal Health Minister Anne McLellan says she has little power to do so.</p>
<p>"The power I have is to withhold a certain percentage of federal transfer payments and that is the only enforcement mechanism that I have," said McLellan.</p>
<p>But Ottawa withholds less than $50,000 from Nova Scotia over the abortion issue, according to federal documents obtained under the Access to Information Act.</p>

<p>1926 to 1947: 4,000 to 6,000 Canadian women die as a result of bungled illegal abortions.</p>
<p>1969: Parliament passes amendments to Section 251 of the Criminal Code, decriminalizing contraception, and allowing some abortions under extremely restricted conditions. Some hospitals with Therapeutic Abortion Committees can approve and provide an abortion, if the pregnancy would endanger the woman's life or health. Access to abortion is applied unevenly and unfairly across the country. Women wait an average of 8 weeks for an abortion. Some provinces refuse to provide any abortion services at all, and abortion is largely unavailable to women outside major cities.</p>
<p>1970: The Vancouver Women's Caucus, a group of independent feminists, organizes political opposition to Section 251. The Caucus organizes the Abortion Caravan, the first national feminist protest. Women travel over 3,000 miles from Vancouver to Ottawa, gathering numbers as they go. In Ottawa, the Abortion Caravan, now 500 women strong, holds two days of demonstrations. Thirty women chain themselves to the parliamentary gallery in the House of Commons, closing Parliament for the first time in Canadian history.</p>
<p>1976: The Federal Minister of Justice sets aside Morgentaler's conviction on the first charge and orders a new trial. Morgentaler, who had suffered a heart attack in jail, is freed after serving ten months of his sentence. In September, he is acquitted at the retrial of the original charges, the third time a jury acquits him. In late 1976, the Quebec government drops all further charges against Morgentaler.</p>
<p>1977 to 1983: Clinics open in Quebec, Toronto, and Winnipeg in spite of Section 251. Prince Edward Island refuses to fund abortions and all hospitals stop providing the service. Morgentaler's Winnipeg and Toronto clinics are raided by police and Dr. Morgentaler is charged with conspiracy to procure a miscarriage, along with other doctors. At the 1984 trial, everyone is acquitted.</p>
<p><br />
1989: Dr. Morgentaler opens a clinic in Nova Scotia after the provincial government passes legislation prohibiting abortions at clinics. Morgentaler is charged under the provincial Medical Services Act. In 1990, a provincial court strikes down the Act as unconstitutional and acquits Morgentaler.</p>
<p>1989: The federal government introduces Bill C-43, an amendment to the Criminal Code that would prohibit abortion unless a doctor finds the pregnancy is a threat to the woman's physical, mental, or psychological health.</p>
<p>1992: A firebomb destroys the Toronto Morgentaler clinic. No-one is hurt, but the perpetrator is never caught.</p>
<p>1994: In November, Dr. Garson Romalis of Vancouver is shot and seriously wounded in his home</p>
<p>1995: In response to the shooting of Dr. Romalis, British Columbia introduces the Access to Abortion Services Act, the first legislation in Canada to prohibit protests outside abortion clinics, and doctors' offices and homes.</p>
<p>1996: In November, the Edmonton Morgentaler clinic suffers a butyric acid attack. Butyric acid is a toxic, foul-smelling chemical that is injected through the walls and ceilings of abortion clinics.</p>
<p>2000: Dr. Garson Romalis is stabbed in the back while entering his medical office. Romalis recovers, but the assailant is never caught.</p>
<p>Today, Canadian women in most major centres have access to abortion. Medicare pays for abortion in hospitals, but some provinces refuse to pay for abortions in clinics. Rural women still have difficulties with access.</p>
<p>Out of five major political parties, four are officially pro-choice, and the fifth has no plans to stop legal abortion.</p>
<p><i>Of course there is now 4 parties. The Conservative Party of Canada has promised it won't bring in legislation but appears to be willing to allow private members bills.M</i></p>
<p><i>I can't find it right in here ( might be missing it) but i did come across an article that said that Conservative and Liberal Members were in a recent pro life march...wouldn't be hard to find again, i remember which organizations page it was on.

<dd>This page is being worked on for a substantial edit. I was supposed to summarize the information on the talk page that is below the non-statistical data part (i finished the part above so that it was more concise)...and then Jag was going to work on writing it from there, and we would discuss the writing ( i agreed to take a break on the writing part on this page. At the time it was just the two of us. I'm sure she would welcome the help and I think she would still be interested. And it was my research being used in the summary because that was what we had. However so far i've only managed to summarize the statistical data part. So I must admit i haven't done that yet...i haven't had much time and i'm slow at summarizing.I haven't been on the Wikipedia all that much recently... If you want summariz it, go ahead. If you look at the statistical information (above) you will see i moved all of the original info onto a page that is strangely named (i'm not the best at the naming thing yet. I will try to make it to this by the end of the week at which point if Jag is free we would start to rewrite). I'm not sure if i agree with you opinion or not but since we are looking at a rewrite i think the focus should be on the rewrite (which you are welcome to be involved in...i myself have said i will not write,but that the writing will be done from research i've done). A fair bit of the discussion about this page on my talk page...the last and second last categories are the most relevant. Of course you are free to start rewriting the page from where it is at the moment as well.</dd>

A lot of the info on there will not be used exactly because it is copywrite...but it can be used as a source for some information...write to me if you want...or here...i try to keep track of both.

<dd>Maybe they were trying to know whether "women or the government should decide" as pro-choicers would say, maybe they were trying to spot those who are "personally opposed but pro-choice" (as the preceding question was "Are you personally FOR or AGAINST abortion?") or it could have been an attempt to verify support for parental consent/spousal notification measures.</dd>

<dd>In the U.S., many states have tried to pass legislation requiring that parents or husbands consent to a woman having an abortion. Before 1988 in Canada, a woman needed the consent of her husband and of a panel of three doctors.

<dd>Just for the record, in case someone checks this discussion page and gets some ideas to change the article... the old 1969 abortion law did not require spousal consent for an abortion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some hospitals did require it for various reasons (either because they believed the specific nature of abortion required it, or in an attempt to put various roadblocks to abortion due to an informal quota system), but this was always a purely local policy initiated by these hospitals. Most did not require spousal consent, either because they believed in abortion on demand and accepted all or almost all applications, or because they were pro-life and reject all or almost all applications. -- <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EABCXYZ_206e.html" title="User:ABCXYZ">ABCXYZ</a> 09:45, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Logic</span></h2>
<p>There's something wrong with the following pair of sentences (under the "Legality" heading at the top). "According to Canadian law," <i>both</i>&#160;:</p>
<p>(1) "...a fetus has no inherent right to life...", and (2) "...the woman and her fetus are considered one and the same..."</p>
<p>Under a normal interpretation they imply that a woman (or just a pregnant woman?) has no inherent right to life. And I'm <i>fairly</i> sure that's not true in Canada. However, I don't know what the correct statement should be. The most reasonable supposition--though someone needs to look into this--is that the law holds that a fetus has no right to (<i>its</i>) life because it is not considered a person apart from the mother (i.e., it is not a person <i>at all</i>, and does not have a distinct life; so there's no one to have its right to life, and no life for it to have a right to.) This is quite distinct from saying that the fetus <i>is</i> the mother, as in the above quotation.)</p>

<dd>I attempted to clarify this by replacing "the woman and her fetus are considered one and the same...". I hope the new version is less confusing. -- <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EABCXYZ_206e.html" title="User:ABCXYZ">ABCXYZ</a> 09:50, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Thus I simply rephrased it to say Canada is one of several nations <i>with no</i> legal restrictions on abortion</p>
