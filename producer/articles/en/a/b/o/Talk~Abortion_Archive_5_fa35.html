<p>Twice, I've added a link to a page that gives a number of scriptures pertinent to abortion. Both times, Squeekbox has deleted them for no good reason.</p>
<p>They clearly belong on this page. I submit this to an admin and suggest they warn Squeebox for his unwarranted edits.</p>

This is not an issue for admins, who don't have special privileges in deciding what is and what is not POV. I don't believe the Bible talks about abortion, but if it does I still do not believe this is appropriate in an article on abortion, which is not a religious issue, --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 22:04, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have protected this article due to the dispute between the two of you. I am of the opinion that the link being added by <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Hurt_8e8c.html" title="User:Big Hurt">User:Big Hurt</a> is both spam and POV pushing (he has added links to the same site on other similar articles. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakbox_bac0.html" title="User:Squeakbox">User:Squeakbox</a> is not vandalising, he is merely enforcing our policy regarding these issues. The page being linked to offers merely an interpretation of the bible, and is therefore not appropriate for this article; it does not offer the official position of the church or major political group, but that of one person and is therefore spam. I think it should therefore be removed, if Big Hurt is not happy with my analysis I am willing to take this to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a>. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 22:27, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New sentence added about legality of US abortions</span></h2>
<p>First off i'm not sure the reference is related to the site, and in fact it has already been added and deleted before (see above discussion)...it seems something that generally should be on the American site. Canada was chosen before i turned up on the Wiki, i would assume as an example, as having no laws because there is no law whatsoever concerning abortion. However if you looked further down the page (or it may have moved to the US page) you will find that there is no Doctor currently in Quebec that will do a third term abortion unless the women is about to die or there are genetic abnormalities---and the concern from what i can tell is not being sued...it ethical. Quebec is currently sending the few patients that need third term abortions to the US...which strongly suggests the service isn't available elsewhere in Canada (Quebec tends to be a very liberal province on "values" issues).</p>
<p>Discussion anyone? Otherwise i think moving the comment to the US page might make better sense. Although i'm not totally up to date on the Planned Parenthood case, at least until then under the Roe. v. Wade decision the government DID get a say to a certain extent in second trimester abortions (in a limited way) and a less limited (but not perhaps total) say in the 3rd trimester.</p>
<p>Also the US federal ammendment on "partial birth abortions" (i hate the term personally) has to my knowledge only been overturned in 3 states...so it would then actually be active in the other remaining states from what i understand although there is now good precendent if there are further lawsuits.</p>
<p>So unless there is some discussion i'm going to take the new addition out in a day or two--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcie_43f5.html" title="User:Marcie">Marcie</a> 02:18, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Abortion History (focusing on illegal abortion practices)</span></h2>
<p>I noticed the following vandalism was just reverted: "In days of yore, unwed mothers were often hit, hard, in the stomach with a shovel, or kicked down a flight of stairs in an effort to abort the unwanted child." But it did get me thinking that there is not an "Abortion history" article focusing on the practices/myths of abortion prior to legalization. This should cover how/who/where these abortions occurred but also provide a more complete telling of the complications as a result. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">RoyBoy</a> [<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy">∞</a>] 04:37, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>When we talk about abortions prior to legalization, we have to consider the whole world and all of recorded history. That said, I was just thinking about the history of abortion myself, and how best to make note of it on Wikipedia. Would it warrant a whole article or just a section on the main abortion page? I know the ancient Greeks mentioned it on occassion, and there is a little talk about points of view before its legality in the U.S.A. in the article. It's an interesting topic. I will take your lead on this... - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadofborg_a6f8.html" title="User:Chadofborg">Chadofborg</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamaGeek_2ede.html" title="User:MamaGeek">MamaGeek</a>'s edit</span></h2>
<p>MamaGeek made an edit labelled "Postabortion physical issues - remove quote from biased source, added statistical information". I'll explain why I have reverted it.</p>
<p>Essentially MamaGeek replaced this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planned_Parenthood_8de0.html" title="Planned Parenthood">Planned Parenthood</a> website notes that "attempts to prove this theory, however, have failed," and in March 2004 <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancet.html" title="Lancet">Lancet</a> published a meta-analysis of 53 <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemiology.html" title="Epidemiology">epidemiological</a> studies which concluded there was no ABC link. Nevertheless epidemiologic gaps remain in the research while the "ABC link" is still a hot campaigning issue in anti-abortion circles.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>with this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>28 out of 37 worldwide studies have independently linked induced abortion with <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_cancer.html" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a>. Thirteen out of fifteen studies conducted on <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> women report increased risk. Seventeen studies are statistically significant, sixteen of which found increased risk. Most of the studies have been conducted by abortion supporters. The first study was published in an English publication in 1957 and focused on <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_people.html" title="Japanese people">Japanese</a> women. It showed a 2.6 relative risk or 160% increased risk of breast cancer among women who'd had an induced abortion. [Segi et al. (1957) GANN 48 (Suppl.):1-63] Nevertheless epidemiologic gaps remain in the research, and the "ABC link" is still a hot campaigning issue in anti-abortion circles. The best that one can definitively conclude is that more comprehensive studies by neutral objective sources are needed.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm prepared to be convinced on this edit, but it seemed a bit much to say that a "biased source" was being removed when two were being removed and one of those was <i>The Lancet</i>. I don't think a mere list of studies saying X out of Y concluded this or that is much. You need some kind of evaluation system; some studies are better than others. The statement that most of the studies were conducted by "abortion supporters" seems unnecessary and, frankly, sounds a little difficult to verify. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:06, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is factually accurate, but it lends itself indeed to second guessing (which I could rebuff)... but would be more trouble than its worth in my opinion. I've come across these cites and rationale before and it is anti-abortion arguments. (again... it *IS* factually accurate) Actually MamaGeek helped point something out to me. The reason I included the Planned Parenthood quote is because it was offset immediately by something else; which has been subsequently removed by someone. So if that is to remain removed, then I indeed feel the quote should be removed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The kicker though... is essentially I'd probably end up replacing it with the same thing (just not a quotation); because it is important to note it is not proven... however it is equally important to note it isn't disproven... hence the initial balance I tried to strike in previous versions. What seems to be clear is that MamaGeek has not read the article yet, and come across the rationale of why the Japanese study has not been cited in the intro... or even in the entire article for that matter. But that's fine, MamaGeek was being <b>bold</b> and that isn't a crime.&#160;:-) - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">RoyBoy</a> [<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy">∞</a>] 10:00, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>After some consideration I do think its appropriate to completely remove the theory not proved meme; because the article has been renamed to hypothesis that should make it clear it has yet to be scientifically verified. And if we are to keep the Lancet mention, then I'd replaced Planned Parenthood with something more general and less confrontational than MamaGeek's edit; but still indicating the majority of studies indicating a link. I think that would finally be a way to statisfy me on the intro; since I've been unsure of it ever since it was edited. It would go something like this...</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lancet study</span></h2>
<p>MamaGeek here: The Lancet's "meta-analysis" is hopelessly flawed. The analysis was conducted by UNFPA-funded scientists, and anyone doing a little research can see that the UNFPA is a big abortion backer. Furthermore, 15 published peer-reviewed studies were rejected from the analysis outright for unscientific reasons (i.e., they couldn't locate original authors of some studies). All of those studies concluded an average of 80% elevated risk of post-abortion cancer. In addition, these scientists included 28 new studies which were never published or peer-reviewed, which of course supported the no-link position.</p>
<p>I will not add my own text, but I will most certainly remove the PP and Lancet citations.</p>

<dd>Hello MamaGeek. Your work is certainly appreciated and I actually share your concerns about the "Lancet" (I call it the Beral) study. However since you are new here you may not be aware of some of implications of your edits. For example this paragraph is also the introductory paragraph to the main <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion-Breast_Cancer_%28ABC%29_hypothesis_5ae5.html" title="Abortion-Breast Cancer (ABC) hypothesis">Abortion-Breast_Cancer_(ABC)_hypothesis</a> article which I wrote. In that main article in the meta-analysis section criticisms of the study (by Dr. Brind) are linked to. The reason I've agreed with Tony on letting that meta-analysis be in the introductory paragraph is because it is "recent news", and its prominence in the entry reflects its prominence in reality. Furthermore, I was not aware the meta-analysis was "UNFPA-funded" (I'm not even aware of who they are), but it hardly surprises me there are pro-choice conflicts of interest in the research. Could you please provide citations, ideally online citations, of the UNFPA funding and who they are so that it can be included in the main article further down.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However currently the meta-analysis will stay where it is until I can be satisfied this is the case. If it is then it will either be removed or re-edited to include the obvious conflict of interest. Also you can sign your entries with - ~~~~ which provides your name and the time of your message. Also I should note that there is a 3 revert rule where, if necessary Tony or I would seek arbitration as a result of continued edits. If you read my main article on the ABC link I think you can appreciate I have more than an open mind on the ABC issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you also read the talk history I had a debate with Tony and Marcie about raising one study to the introduction above all others. I conceded the argument because the Lancet study is news, and should be reflected as such in the encyclopedia. But that doesn't stop us from being critical of it.

<dd>Excellent BBC citation. I entirely agree the UNFPA have a bias in favor of abortion as an option for women, hence any funding provided by them would naturally be a conflict of interest given their objectives; which I happen to agree with. But that would not excuse them for funding and influencing "scientific" research, nor would it excuse Lancet or the media of glossing it over. So is there a reliable online citation of UNFPA funding for the Beral study, or would I find that mentioned in the study itself?

<p>I bolded the sentence in the article that i did (which pointed out that the women who had the most problems were those who already gone through trauma) because i thought it was an important point and it wasn't brought clearly to attention. To be honest i missed it the first few reads...and i read carefully. If it being bolded is objected to can we agree on some way of making it a bit easier to see among the quotes? If you go back i was concerned earlier...its in the rewording area although that was a while ago and i was still worried with it when i came across it later...it seems though that the sentence i wrote about dentists was pulled out (i don't think it was originally but who knows)...looking at it now i figure there isn't a problem in that area--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcie_43f5.html" title="User:Marcie">Marcie</a> 08:48, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mamageek changed that, I kept the change because an entire segment of a sentence being bolded isn't necessary to highlight a point which is fairly logical and self evident.

<p>The first sentence which describes abortion as "termination of pregnancy" does not say what abortion is.

<dl>
<dd>The word "death" begs the fundamental question which is at the root of the debate about abortion -- specifically, whether a fetus, embryo, etc is "alive" and whether abortion is therefore "killing".

<dd>I don't think "death" begs any question. The issue is not whether the fetus is alive (which it clearly is in the same way your organs are alive) but whether it is a human being. Also, the issue is not whether abortion is killing, but whether it is unjustifiable killing.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(Dunno who wrote the above)</p>
<p>I agree. The embryo, zygote and fetus are all living and are all killed by abortion. This isn't the issue in the pro- anti- abortion debate since most of us agree that in some circumstances killing is justified. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:33, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The decision to include or not include a reference to the fetus is not something which can be completely objective. By the time you set the terms of the language, you've already biased the article. Right now, by not mentioning the unborn child in the introduction, this whole article takes on a pro-abortion stance. But by mentioning the unborn child, and especially by using the word "kill" to describe what the mother does to her child, then that makes the article have a pro-life stance. - JW</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's simply not true that the article takes a pro-abortion stance by not using the term "unborn child" in the first paragraph. Assuming, arguendo, that you are correct, the solution to correcting bias is not to add more, opposing bias, but to remove the current bias. Regardless, I fail to see the bias here. In the interest of full disclosure, I am an opponent of abortion but a proponent of neutrality on wikipedia. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko">Jersyko</a> 15:17, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am sorry. By "unborn child" I didn't only mean that exact term. I mean that no mention is made of the unborn child, fetus, embryo, or whatever other term that life might be called. - JW
<dl>
<dd>Well, I still fail to see how making such a reference will make the opening paragraph more neutral. The term "pregnancy" gives the reader a clear indication of what is involved. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko">Jersyko</a> 18:43, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>After reflecting on the question more, I figured out what was truly bugging me. The real issue is that the opening sentence of the article calls abortion the "termination of a pregnancy" which is like calling a car accident the "termination of a journey." Calling a car accident the "termination of a journey" really doesn't describe what a car accident is. And if such a sentence were put as the first sentence of an article about car accidents, I am quite certain it would be revised and improved. - JW
<dl>
<dd>I understand your analogy, and am rather sympathetic to what you are saying, actually. However, I will have to disagree for the purpose of retaining a neutral article. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko">Jersyko</a> 18:55, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Termination of a fetus means the termination of pregnancy. Those who don't know that terminating a fetus involves terminating a pregnancy can find out by following the pregnancy link, -- JW

<dd>But the term pregnancy implicates both sides of the abortion debate because pregnancy involves both a mother and a child or fetus. By using a term to describe only one of the two actors involved in abortion, subtle bias is inserted into the article. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko">Jersyko</a> 19:02, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)

I havn't changed the link to Planned Parenthood, because I can in fact see why you might believe it to be neutral. But the language used in their FAQs (ex. "anti-abortion laws kill women") is more than a simple presentation of "facts".

I think there is a need to have neutral medical information linked to up top, and I'd settle for changing the link to a comparably scientific, medical site such as JAMA or something.

<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandbody_f4b6.html" title="User:Sandbody">Sandbody</a>'s changed it back, with the edit summary "rv Some pro-lifers -do- believe that a zygote is a human being (article must be representing all POV)"</p>
<p>However, this statement when juxtaposed against the medical opinion only represents the beliefs of one faction in a moral debate--it's extremely POV. The morality of abortion is covered in depth in another article <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality_and_legality_of_abortion.html" title="Morality and legality of abortion">Morality and legality of abortion</a>, where all significant moral views of abortion should be represented. A one-sided representation of human beliefs with respect to abortion (whether related to pre-implantation contraception or not) should not be presented here. Therefore I have reverted, with the edit summary "Revert. Juxtaposing the medical definition against the beliefs of *one* faction is POV. Leave the beliefs for the appropriate articles and cover *all* significant ones." The medical definition of pregnancy is given solely to explain why abortion is distinguished from contraception as a matter of medical classification. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 08:03, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no problem with that - the question might well be asked, "Why not also juxtapose the belief that the unimplanted zygote is <i>not</i> a human being?" I do wonder under what circumstances the phrase was added so that I saw it when first I read the article.

<p>I see that planned parenthood has been added to the politically neutral section again. I followed the link, and found statements like these: "Public opinion polls show that a strong majority of Americans favor preserving safe, legal abortions, but there is still a vocal minority that does not. They want to make abortion a crime, robbing women of the right to decide for themselves when or whether to have children." How anyone can think that is neutral with respect to the pro-life/choice debate is beyond me. This is vandalism, pure and simple. <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintermann_08df.html" title="User:Vintermann">Vintermann</a> 10:11, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A large portion of <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonado_6185.html" title="User:Monado">Monado's</a> edits are neutral and are a welcome addition to this article. The problem is that such a large number of edits were made, making it very difficult to go through everything and remove the bias and POV contained in some of the edits. Monado, could you possibly go back through your edits and try to make sure that the article remains a neutral discussion of this very sensitive topic? I would recommend not creating a new "maternal health" section, as the article already contains a "side effects" section. Maybe some of the information you added could be synthesized into that section?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversially</span></h2>
<p>Is it NPOV to say that the use of the term 'Partial-Birth Abortion' is controversial? To me, the term itself 'partial birth abortion' is a weighted one, so is it fair to say that the term is controversial? Going back through various versions, people seem to keep removing and adding it ... that in itself would suggest the term is controversial. And it's not like the phrase 'partial birth abortion' has been expunged, it's still there, just with an addendum that its use can be controversial. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> | 11:11, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anonymous user: the media and most of the American populace uses the term PBA when discussing this method of abortion - the man on the street rarely uses techincal medical terminology. The method of killing the fetus is cearly controversial - but the term PBA is well-established as the term of choice for the foolish masses, like me.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">debate on abortion and feminism</span></h2>
<p>The debate on abortion section spends a lot of time on pro-life feminists. As it stands, I think that this tilts the section away from NPOV. Basically, the article historicizes the pro-choice position in a damaging way -- one of the basic claims of pro-choice advocates is that pro-choice is a pro-woman position. This article as it is seems to linger on the fact that that has not always historically been the case.</p>
<p>I can see a couple of ways to clean this up. The easiest is to cut the pro-life feminist discussion drastically -- cutting it to a sentence, probably (which is I think a fair assessment of its importance in the current debate.) This is probably what I would do, personally, for reasons of time and expertise.</p>
<p>The other way would be to historicize the pro-life position as well, particularly discussing the link between advocates of pro-life positions and advocates of traditional family structures. This would raise questions about pro-life motivations (i.e., it's all about children's rights) similar to those raised about the pro-choice movement's motiviations (i.e., it's all about women's rights.)</p>
<p>It seems best to be clear about my own POV -- I'm pro-choice, though with qualms. <a href="../../../n/o/a/User%7ENoahB_93fe.html" title="User:NoahB">NoahB</a> 18:15, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

As such it is not pertinent to abortion; and the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_abortion.html" title="History of abortion">history of abortion</a> makes it clear men of the church understood the Bible did not outlaw abortion. (The closest it comes to it is Exodus 21:22-25, but its unclear if that is commenting on the injury to the mother, the premature child or both... anyway it is clear in this example the pregnancy is far along if the child is <b>born</b>.) And to seal the deal even for POV pushers, this addresses the issue of an <b>attack</b> on a women; it does not in any way speak to abortion.
