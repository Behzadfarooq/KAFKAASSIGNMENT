	    <p>This is a conspiracy that is meant to prove that the Belgians are not actually Belgian people but they are actually Swiss. You see, many years ago, during the Second World War, Hitler was on a mad hunt to kill everyone who is not blond, blue eyes, and tall. Amongst these criteria, another one was made. Belgians are infidels were once German but moved out because of the snow. There they met peoples who were not aerials named the Belgian, but the Germans after coming over and taking immediate genetic dominance being that all their traits were capitalized took the name of the people who called themselves the Belgians and mixed it with their name, thus we receive: the Belgians. You see the Germans took the “s” from the end of their name and mixed it with the “Belgian” part in Belgian. And thus a new race was made. The Belgians and the Germans got along just fine, until the nazi movement was started. Amongst the Jews and the gypsies, Belgians were persecuted. In fact, there were more than 4 Belgians concentration camps. During World War Two, there were many innocent deaths of the Belgians, and in fact there were put up ghetto like areas for them called chocolate factories, the chocolate factories were a sign of sure death, only the old would go in there, and in them they would make a lifetime supply of chocolate, and be forced to eat it. Gorging themselves to death. The more fortunate amongst them were put in massive bakeries for the soul purpose of making tasty waffles with a thin chocolate covering on them for the German troops. After the end of the Second World War, a small remnant was left of the Belgian people, only 500 were left in all, but they were soon discovered by American militia in Belgium and killed. There needs to be some explaining here, you see, America viewed itself as the guardian of peace back than to, so when the world was screaming for help from the anti Belgian tyranny, America decided to help, and so it did. Winning the war in Germany the troops later went home, but little did they know that on CNN old school, people were taking sides with the Germans saying that it wasn’t they’re fault. But being that Bill Clintons great grandfather, William Clinton, was governing America in the meantime, America invaded Germany, found all the Germans they could. (Amongst them were 499 Belgians) slaughtered them and went out. The remaining Belgian ran into the forests of Antarctica and no one has heard of him yet.</p>
<pre>
           Being that the Swiss are, were, and always will be the pawns of Germany, Germany sent them an order to vacate 1,000,000 people to the now unoccupied lands of Belgium to repopulate the land, but keep the Belgian name just to be politically correct, the Germans told the Swiss immigrants to name themselves Belgium, so they did. Many years passed, and the new inhabitants of Belgium continued to make chocolate and thinly glazed chocolate breakfast delicacies that please the Germans.

           Little do the Swiss/ Belgian people know that they have passively furthered the Ariel domination of the world. And they still live blind of that fact today. They still make their little pastries. They do not know their sin. The world has not yet recovered from the threat of World War II. We are still in danger. There is no escape from the Belgian.
