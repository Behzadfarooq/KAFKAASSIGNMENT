<p>Hi. I don't know if you're aware of it, but your last edit to <a href="../../../u/n/u/Wikipedia%7EUnusual_articles_dd7d.html" title="Wikipedia:Unusual articles">Wikipedia:Unusual articles</a>, in addition to the categorisation improvement also redacted the word "------" (if you don't see a word between the preceeding quotes, it was the-n-word) from the GNAA linked from that page. As you seem to be embarked on an impressive programme of category tweaking (and not a personal swearyword jihad) I'm guessing you (or whatever institution from which you're editing) has some kind of automatic "naughty words" removal system. That's probably something you might like to look into, as it has the potential to zap lots of stuff quickly, without your knowing it. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Fader_67b5.html" title="User:John Fader">John Fader</a> 19:44, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Interesting you have a no soliciting sign on the top of your page, yet solicit for votes on your RFA. I reallize you just asked me to vote, not to vote for you, but I think you would be much better off if you did not solicit votes. Many people frown on that. Just a heads up.

<p>Hi! It certainly was a lot easier to get counts when Kate's tool was working. What I did was to view my contributions and set the count to 500 per page. I then hit "next 500" until I reached the last page. At this point I reduced the per page count to 100 and went to the last page. Now there's less than 100 edits (starting from #2101, for example), which can be counted easily.

<p>Hi, Jonathan. It seems I was wrong in connecting you with Alex Plank, and I would like to apologize. Just to set my mind at ease, I wanted to know if you'd be willing to provide a little information. I want to respect your privacy, so this isn't information about you, just something that you would know and Alex Plank wouldn't. I believe the place you went to school last year (I don't know if you're still going there, and I don't need to know) has an elementary school next door, or across the street, right? Could you give me the name of that elementary school? --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 22:01, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tolbert is what I was expecting, and I knew the information I had was dated. Anyway, thanks for doing that, you've completely satisfied my doubts. Again, I apologize for my accusations and for contributing to this situation. And regardless of what others may say, I think you handled it reasonably well considering the circumstances. Just keep in mind that if you do end up using admin abilities to deal with vandals, they may respond even more harshly, even though you probably won't deserve the mistreatment any more than you did this. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 22:37, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ABCD I would like to appeal your recent decision to close discussion and delete the article Circumcision and Anti-semitism. This page was not listed on <a href="../../../v/f/d/Vfd.html" title="Vfd">vfd</a> long enough. Also most of the criticism of the article was not relevant to the current version which was significantly enhanced since the process began.

I did this because I noticed you were doing some interesting things with yours. As an experiment, I decided to try to mangle part of your .js for my own; my intention was to have (in this case) my edit summaries always and automatically filled out as <i>test</i> (again, that's just an experiment). So, if you could assist me with a some .js that could do that, I would be appreciative. Thanks!&#160;:) Ph43r 23:12, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was just joking around. I think the En-0 template is ridiculous because this is the english wikipedia and everyone should be able to speak english (I do understand that people from other wikipedias do interwiki work here, but how would they be able to find out what template to put on their page if they can't speak enlgish). The En-0 category is especially crazy. Why would someone want to look up people who can't speak english? The commons got rid of the En-0 category (where the template does make sense) for that reason. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b>egue</a> 23:22, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, ABCD. You changed the missing article text to wiki coding. However, this is not enterpreted by the server when calling it. For some reason that I cannot divine, it had just been changed by MediaWiki Default to the default settings. Wiki coding does not work from these pages, so it is necessary to put in the HTML. I have put it back to my version. Could you have a look and check it out?

<dd>Hm, I'm not sure about this. On a couple of occasions, when checking edits recently made, the wikitext has been returned. Actually, this could be the reason: diff pages do not show up with Missingarticle, but normal links do. I don't know if there is any way around this.

<p>Hi ABCD. One remark. At <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linear_regression.html" title="Linear regression">Linear regression</a> after you reformatted it, some text got messed up, becoming bold italic. This effect happens when there are unmatched quotes, like when you have the prime symbol, f'(x). It was this thing which stopped me a while ago from using a bot I wrote to do what you are doing. So, I think you need to inspect visually each page in which you do the formatting.

<dd>After reading the comments, and examining the current content of the page listed, I determined that the consensus was to keep, though many voted delete for the version that they saw. The current version, at the time of closing, did not have the problems mentioned in many of the comments.

The <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Deletion process</a> is clear that an "unambiguous merge and redirect" is a "variation of a keep" vote.

<p>Hurrah! I note you've started nuking ASIN codes as well... thanks!</p>
<p>I notice you're hyphenating ISBNs. Is there any particular reason for this, or just personal taste? The software here doesn't need it, and it make no actual difference to the standard if the hyphens are included or not... I find missing it out prevents accidentally giving incorrect hyphenation for foreign publishers, where things can sometimes get confusing, but YMMV. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> 23:38, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reason I hyphenate ISBNs is to improve readability. Also, I am using the list from <a href="http://www.isbn-international.org/en/identifiers/List-of-Ranges.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.isbn-international.org/en/identifiers/List-of-Ranges.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.isbn-international.org/en/identifiers/List-of-Ranges.pdf</a> for the numbers, so I don't have to worry about giving the wrong hyphenation.

<dd>Thanks. I didn't see any unusual ISBNs glancing through the pages you'd fixed, but wanted to politely check you knew the hyphenation was strange for the 8x and 9xx range.&#160;;-) I agree with you it improves readability, which is probably v. helpful for people using this without the automatic lookup feature available.

<p>Help! I was trying to edit down the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> page, because the disclaimer at the top said that at 46K, it was too long. In the edit window, only the portion up to the section on Jackson's nosejobs was shown, so I just assumed that my changes would only affect everything up until then, and that I'd have to click on the "edit" links for the sections following that, but when I finally hit "save page," to my horror, I saw that EVERYTHING after that was gone! The earlier version is visible on the History page for that article, of course, but I don't know how to restore it.

<p>Hey ABCD: I posted this to Alphax's talk page:</p>
<p><i>(Oops, darn that enter key.)</i></p>
<p><i>What I meant to ask before accidentally saving a blank message is: We talked about your monobook.js on IRC yesterday, and discussed me copying it to my monobook.js and adding a block feature to the list. However, I've been unsuccessful; every time I try to enter the feature, it doesn't work, and all the features your code is supposed to insert disappear. Since you seem to know something about this, could you tell me: What do I need to do to add the "block user" tags to user &amp; user talk pages? -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 04:53, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>Since she recommended you, I'm asking you: Do you know how I can add the block feature to my monobook.js 1) successfully (as all my attempts have failed), and 2) without it removing all the other functions (as all my attempts have caused all the other features listed there to disappear).

<p>It's up to you, of course, but there's no standard or approved way of writing ISBNs; they can be one block of numbers or grouped, either hyphenated or separated by spaces. (When I ran my own small publishing company this was explained in the bumf that came with my assignment of numbers.) They appear in all those ways on books and in publishers' catalogues, and the Wikipedia system works in all cases. If you just like seeing the hyphens then fine, but I thought that you should know that you're wasting your time if you thought that you were<i>correcting</i> them. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 08:52, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm trying to figure out why <a href="../../../2/4/s/24SevenOffice_4819.html" title="24SevenOffice">24SevenOffice</a> is relevant on Wikipedia. The company is a complete unknown in the business. With only 1000 customers, there are pieces of shareware that have more users than that. The consensus was to delete the article. The exception to that was the employee of <a href="../../../2/4/s/24SevenOffice_4819.html" title="24SevenOffice">24SevenOffice</a> who originally posted the topic who voted to "rewrite". Can you help me understand what reasoning went behind keeping the article? I've tried providing a neutral point of view on this, but its hard since the product really is an uknown in the industry. A google search for his company brings up 2000 articles -- most of which stem from blog posts, forum signatures with url's to his company, and information from Wikipedia itself.</p>
<p>Additionally, the same employee of the company has spammed his links across several technology articles and competitor pages in an attempt to bolster his position. Its an obvious attempt to market his product. I've fought with <a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepyhead81_fac2.html" title="User:Sleepyhead81">User:Sleepyhead81</a> on this (he is the employee) with no luck in finding common ground. Please feel free to contact him or myself for more information, but I would be very interested in finding out what criteria was used to keep this product page alive.
