<p>What is justice? Is it just an arbitrary word coming out of our mouths, or does it have a real meaning? According to dictionary.com justice means the quality of being just; righteousness, equitableness, or moral rightness: to uphold the justice of a cause. But is this the real meaning of justice, or is it just a simple definition. The real meaning of justice to me simply means being fair. Whether its racism, sexism, or even ___________, all it is is being fair. Justice, this is privilege bestowed upon every person in the nation. The forefathers of our nation drafted the constitution to ensure equality for all. However, when a person finds himself in a legal situation, their social standing and the finances available are the key factors in accessibility to justice. It is my belief that immediately upon being detained for any sort of criminal activity, the suspect is “sized up” and treated according to what social class they are thought to be in. Of coarse the lower class of society is treated with less respect and little regard for the law; because in most cases they are not equipped with a cell phone to call their power defense team immediately. Now, imagine for one moment that the suspect is actually detained in jail and bail money is required in order to be released. Once again, privilege comes into play. Do you have enough social status to be released on your own recognizance? If not, the downward spiral has been set in motion. You will no longer be able to attend classes or maintain a regular work schedule from county jail. In turn, this means you earn no money; you can’t pay bills and so on and so on.</p>
<pre>
               On the other hand, Mr. Jones, the president of the Bank of Sacramento has been caught with just a wee-bit of cocaine in his pocket, oops! Mr. Jones has several options; all of them are to his benefit. He can either go straight to the ATM and with withdraw a little “hush money”, agree to be arraigned and immediately released on his own recognizance, or, worst case scenario, he is charged and has to call his brother in-law, the founder of the city’s largest law firm. So many choices so little time. This is the reality in today’s society. Wealth and social privilege do allow extended opportunity. 
</pre>
<p>In addition to justice, there is another enormously important, non-material privilege that often comes with being wealthy. “Peace of Mind”. People of all social classes may have “ peace of mind” but only the truly affluent know it, in its entirety. This is a state of well being, a calm over your heart and mind because you know everything is taken care of. Little by little a person has had the time to address all of the issues that plague the average working class man and woman. The house and cars are paid for, the grass is cut, the cat has had her shots and the refrigerator is full of food. Most importantly, you are in touch with your children, your spouse and yourself; because you have the luxury of time to take care of all of these items. One can only imaging what a day would be like if the only worry was what dish you would bring to the bridge game.</p>
<pre>
              In short, a small percentage of this world is made up of wealthy people. Yet, the well off seems to reap all of the great rewards in life. My only response to this is fight for your privilege in life, earn every thing you can! The one advantage to earning all of your privileges as opposed to being born into them is that it is much harder to take from someone who understands the value of what they have. Being wealthy is nothing to be ashamed of. Being wealthy and privileged because you earned every bit of it, has to be so sweet. Where justice is concerned, I have no recommendation. Things just are the way they are. I can only hope that I have at least one opportunity in life to assist a less fortunate person in the pursuit for justice. I will admit that I am somewhat ignorant on the subject of how to seek justice, being that I have never needed legal assistance. As for “peace of mind”, I strive for it. I know I will find it. Monetary earnings can only put me closer to my goal, so I will continue to work my hardest.
