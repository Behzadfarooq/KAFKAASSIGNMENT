<p>It may seem strange that the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">doctrine</a> of indulgences should have proved such a stumbling-block, and excited so much <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prejudice.html" title="Prejudice">prejudice</a> and opposition. But the explanation of this may be found in the abuses which unhappily have been associated with what is in itself a salutary practice. In this respect of course, indulgences are not exceptional: no institution, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy.html" title="Holy">holy</a> or otherwise, has entirely escaped abuse through the fallibility of the people behind it. In light of the inherent flaws of man, it is not surprising that the offer of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Pardon.html" title="Pardon">pardon</a> in the form of an indulgence should have led to evil practices. These again have been in a special way the object of attack because, doubtless, of their connection with Luther's protest. On the other hand, it should not be forgotten that the Church - while holding fast to the principle and intrinsic value of indulgences - has repeatedly condemned their misuse. Roman Catholics assert that much of the present knowledge of the abuses of indulgences stems from internal (Catholic) investigations into them.</p>

<p>Even in the age of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyr.html" title="Martyr">martyrs</a>, as stated above there were practices which <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Cyprian_ad41.html" title="St. Cyprian">St. Cyprian</a> was obliged to reprehend, yet he did not forbid the martyrs to give the libelli<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. In later times abuses were met by repressive measures on the part of the Church. Thus the <a href="../../../7/4/7/747.html" title="747">747</a> <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Clovesho_90da.html" title="Council of Clovesho">Council of Clovesho</a> in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> condemns those who believe that the purchase of indulgences would absolve them of their sin. Against the excessive indulgences granted by some <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prelate.html" title="Prelate">prelates</a>, the <a href="../../../1/2/1/1215.html" title="1215">1215</a> <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Council_of_the_Lateran_8ac3.html" title="Fourth Council of the Lateran">Fourth Council of the Lateran</a> decreed that at the dedication of a church, the indulgence should not be for more than year; and furthermore, for the anniversary of the dedication or any other case, that it should not exceed forty <a href="../../../d/a/y/Day.html" title="Day">days</a>, this being the limit observed by the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">pope</a> himself on such occasions. The same restriction was enacted by the Council of Ravenna in <a href="../../../1/3/1/1317.html" title="1317">1317</a>. In answer to the complaint of the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominican_Order_2f62.html" title="Dominican Order">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franciscan_Order_4c4a.html" title="Franciscan Order">Franciscans</a> that certain prelates had put their own construction on the indulgences granted to these Orders, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Clement_IV_b893.html" title="Pope Clement IV">Pope Clement IV</a> forbade any such interpretation in <a href="../../../1/2/6/1268.html" title="1268">1268</a>. He declared that, when it was needed, it would be given by the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_See_26a9.html" title="Holy See">Holy See</a>. In <a href="../../../1/3/3/1330.html" title="1330">1330</a>, the brothers of the hospital of Haut-Pas falsely asserted that the grants made in their favor were more extensive than what the documents allowed: <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_XXII_2681.html" title="Pope John XXII">Pope John XXII</a> had all these brothers in France seized and imprisoned. <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Boniface_IX_fe8e.html" title="Pope Boniface IX">Pope Boniface IX</a>, writing to the Bishop of <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrara.html" title="Ferrara">Ferrara</a> in <a href="../../../1/3/9/1392.html" title="1392">1392</a>, condemned the practice of certain holy men who falsely claimed to be authorized by the Pope to forgive all sorts of sins, and exacted <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">money</a> from the simple-minded among the faithful by promising them perpetual happiness in this world and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">eternal glory</a> in the next. In 1420, when <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Chichele_6c72.html" title="Henry Chichele">Henry Chichele</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, attempted to give a plenary indulgence in the form of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Jubilee_2018.html" title="Roman Jubilee">Roman Jubilee</a>, he was severely reprimanded by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_V_1743.html" title="Martin V">Martin V</a>, who characterized his action as "unheard-of presumption and sacrilegious audacity."

At the Council of Magdeburg, Nicholas also condemned this error, which had stemmed from a misunderstanding or mistranslation of the Latin words "a culpa et a poena." Finally, in <a href="../../../1/4/7/1478.html" title="1478">1478</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixtus_IV_2400.html" title="Sixtus IV">Sixtus IV</a> reserved for the judgment of the Holy See a large number of cases in which faculties had formerly been granted to confessors (Extrav.

<p>These measures show plainly that the Roman Catholic Church recognized and attempted to mitigate abuses of indulgences long before the Protestant Reformation with varying degrees of success. However, it is clear that despite In spite of all this, disorders continued and furnished the pretext for attacks directed against the doctrine itself, no less than against the practice of indulgences. As in so many other matters, greed was the chief root of the problem: indulgences were employed by mercenary ecclesiastics as a means of <a href="../../../p/e/c/Pecuniary.html" title="Pecuniary">pecuniary</a> gain. The Vatican claims that the doctrine itself has no natural or necessary connection with pecuniary profit, which they claim is evident from the fact that the abundant indulgences of the present day are free from this association- the only conditions required are the saying of certain <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prayer.html" title="Prayer">prayers</a> or the performance of some good work or some practice of <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piety.html" title="Piety">piety</a>. Among the good works which might be encouraged by being made the condition of an indulgence, <a href="../../../a/l/m/Alms.html" title="Alms">alms giving</a> would naturally hold a conspicuous place, while men would be induced by the same means to contribute to some pious cause such as the building of <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">churches</a>, the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endowment.html" title="Endowment">endowment</a> of <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospitals</a>, or the organization of a <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">crusade</a>. Although in these acts, there is no inherent evil, misunderstandings compounded greed to produce evil acts. On one hand there was the understandable danger that the payment might be regarded as the price of the indulgence, and that those who sought to gain it might lose sight of the more important intangible conditions. On the other hand, those who granted indulgences were often tempted to make them a means of raising money- moreover, even where Catholic officials were free from blame in this matter, there was substantial room for corruption in their officials and agents, and among the popular preachers of indulgences.</p>
<p>While it cannot be denied that these abuses were widespread, it should also be noted that, even when corruption was at its worst, some these spiritual grants were being properly used by sincere Christians. The <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Trent_988c.html" title="Council of Trent">Council of Trent</a>, which was largely a response to the actions of Luther and the Protestant Reformation, in its decree "On Indulgences" (Sess. XXV) declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In granting indulgences the Council desires that moderation be observed in accordance with the ancient approved custom of the Church, lest through excessive ease ecclesiastical discipline be weakened; and further, seeking to correct the abuses that have crept in . . . it decrees that all criminal gain therewith connected shall be entirely done away with as a source of grievous abuse among the Christian people; and as to other disorders arising from superstition, ignorance, irreverence, or any cause whatsoever--since these, on account of the widespread corruption, cannot be removed by special prohibitions--the Council lays upon each bishop the duty of finding out such abuses as exist in his own diocese, of bringing them before the next provincial synod, and of reporting them, with the assent of the other bishops, to the Roman Pontiff, by whose authority and prudence measures will be taken for the welfare of the Church at large, so that the benefit of indulgences may be bestowed on all the faithful by means at once pious, holy, and free from corruption."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After deploring the fact that, in spite of the remedies prescribed by earlier councils, the traders (quaestores) in indulgences continued their nefarious practice to the great scandal of the faithful, the council ordained that the name and method of these quaestores should be entirely abolished, and that indulgences and other spiritual favors of which the faithful ought not to be deprived should be published by the bishops and bestowed gratuitously, so that all might at length understand that these heavenly treasures were dispensed for the sake of piety and not of lucre (Sess. XXI, c. ix). In <a href="../../../1/5/6/1567.html" title="1567">1567</a> <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Pius_V_b6e1.html" title="St. Pius V">St. Pius V</a> canceled all grants of indulgences involving any fees or other financial transactions.</p>

<p>One of the worst abuses was that of inventing or falsifying grants of indulgence. Prior to the Reformation, such practices abounded and called out severe pronouncements by ecclesiastical authority, especially by the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215 and that of Vienne in 1311. After the Council of Trent, the most important measure taken to prevent such frauds was the establishment of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregation_of_Indulgences_dd47.html" title="Congregation of Indulgences">Congregation of Indulgences</a>. A special commission of cardinals served under <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_VIII_bbf1.html" title="Clement VIII">Clement VIII</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_V_8186.html" title="Paul V">Paul V</a>, regulating all matters pertaining to indulgences. The Congregation of Indulgences was definitively established by <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_IX_1da8.html" title="Clement IX">Clement IX</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1669.html" title="1669">1669</a> and reorganized by Clement XI in <a href="../../../1/7/1/1710.html" title="1710">1710</a>. It has functioned to decide various questions relating to the granting of indulgences and by its publications. The "Raccolta" (q.v.) was first issued by one of its consultors, Telesforo Galli, in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a>; the last three editions <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1886.html" title="1886">1886</a>, and <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a> were published by the Congregation. The other official publication is the "Decreta authentica", containing the decisions of the Congregation from <a href="../../../1/6/6/1668.html" title="1668">1668</a> to <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a>. This was published in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1883.html" title="1883">1883</a> by order of <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_XIII_3fa7.html" title="Leo XIII">Leo XIII</a>. By a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motu_Proprio_2cd2.html" title="Motu Proprio">Motu Proprio</a> of Pius X, dated <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_28.html" title="January 28">28 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>, the Congregation of Indulgences was united to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregation_of_Rites_ea13.html" title="Congregation of Rites">Congregation of Rites</a>, without any diminution of its prerogatives.</p>
