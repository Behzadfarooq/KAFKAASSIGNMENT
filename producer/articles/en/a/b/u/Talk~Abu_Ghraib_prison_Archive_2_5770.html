<p>Is that word written on one of the prisoners "rapeist"? --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 16:57, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The prisoner in Pic 6 is recognizable. IANAL, but I am a human being. Shouldn't the img be tweaked (blurred, blacked out) to conceal his identity?

<dd>It looks like it could be RAPEIST or PAPFIST. News sources refer to it as a slur. 64.112.183.66 17:57, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've since read press reports (specifically, the Daily Mirror -- sorry, not one of the best possible sources) describing it as an Arabic insult transliterated into English. Far more reports describe it as an "American slur" or "English slur", however. <a href="../../../h/a/j/User%7EHajor_7ab9.html" title="User:Hajor">–<i>Hajor</i></a> 23:24, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>It says "Papeist", a mispelling of "Papist"! It's a religious insult, accusing the victim of being Catholic! Actually I'm pretty sure it is "Rapeist", given the context. Shouldn't we either make a call based on this high probability or just remove speculation in the caption since the reader can see exactly the same evidence as we can? --<a href="../../../m/4/-/User%7EM4-10_ee36.html" title="User:M4-10">M4-10</a> 08:10, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oddly enough, the Taguba report lists the word as "RAPEST (sic)". But there's definitely an <i>I</i> there.</dd>

<p>I don't think we should have 14 pictures in this article, as the additional 12-13 don't add any content to the story.

Similarly, we could put up 50 images of torture during the Hussein regime, which would also not be essential to understand what happened, and would be inappropriate. In addition, you do not run this wiki, and I do not appreciate your dictatorial tone. "I believe they should stay" is within your prerogative to say.

<p>The whole point of the images is to illustrate <i>what happened</i> -- what was done to these people? This is not a matter of the historical record yet, so the comparison with Auschwitz is absurd; furthermore, we <i>should</i> have more images about what happened in Auschwitz in the appropriate articles.</p>
<p>What we should do is provide <i>captions</i> for each image to actually describe what happens here.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 21:26, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This isn't a primary source document, but an encyclopedia. We should, for example, have illustrative images on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Auschwitz.html" title="Auschwitz">Auschwitz</a>, but an in-depth image gallery is inappropriate. Same with the Rwandan genocide: having an image gallery of 15 images of Rwandans being murdered would not help illustrate what happened. The same goes with just about any other atrocity: a few illustrative images are very helpful, but an image gallery is not. What do 14 images add that, say, 4 do not? I agree all 14 (and more, as there are certainly more in existence) are important for the historical record, but not for an encyclopedia article. Putting them all here, and not in other articles, seems a bit like an attempt to advance a particular agenda. What would you think, for example, of someone who added a lengthy image gallery depicting the victims of Palestinian terorrism to one of our articles? There are plenty of pictures of mangled Israeli bodies---should those be in Wikipedia in order to illustrate what happened? --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 21:28, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Showing the same corpse out of two different perspectives is pointless. Showing different concentration camps, different gas chambers in different regions is not, nor is showing the wide range of atrocities committed by Nazi Germany. In this case, the different images show different types of humiliation (the electric schock threat, the hoods, the body pile, the sex acts), they show the behavior of the soldiers (laughing, smiling and pointing, proudly posturing in front of the "human pyramid") -- this is hardly redundant, and all of it is part of the evidence of <i>what happened</i>. What you are trying to pull off here is the most blatant attempt of censorship I have seen on Wikipedia in recent months.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 21:34, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If I were interested in censoring the images, I hardly think <i>Wikipedia</i> would be the place to go, given that the news sites that have them have orders of magnitude more readers than we do---nearly everyone coming here has <i>already seen</i> the images, unless they live in a cave and don't read the news. What I'm interested in is why we have an image gallery here, when it is standard Wikipedia policy to only use a few illustrative images, and not use image galleries. We could, for example, show images of Palestinians blowing up cafes... or blowing up buses... or blowing up military checkpoints... celebrating in the streets afterwards... we could show torture committed by the Palestinian Authority... we could show any number of things, but don't, because this is an encyclopedia, not a catalogue of atrocities. This isn't the place for <i>evidence</i>, but discussion. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 22:20, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I suppose I didn't formulate my objection well enough. I think this does give the impression of trying to show <i>evidence</i> of atrocities, which isn't our job. We should simply neutrally <i>describe</i> things. This has a bit of the feel of advocacy. For what it's worth, I didn't support the invasion, and don't support Bush, but don't think opposition to Bush and the war should be based on propagandistic images, but on actual reasons. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 22:23, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Describing things neutrally is not identical to evoking no emotions. The latter is inevitable when dealing with subjects like this. We do not portray these pictures as anything except exactly what they are - a description of the events that occurred in this particular prison at the end of last year. If you want to interpret this as a pro-Bush or anti-Bush thing, then that is your business. Describing the facts of a matter is the job of an encyclopedia, and in this case, the images and the article work together to tell the story of what happened.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 22:39, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but even simple descriptions can tend to bias things. If our article on the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a> had an image gallery of Taliban atrocities, for example, that would be factual, but one would question why we were playing up that aspect. Very rarely these days does even outright propaganda actually make things up: instead it uses factual images, whether they're of mangled Israeli corpses or dead Palestinian teenagers or mangled bodies of US security contractors or whatnot. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 23:48, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whichever example you use, I will always disagree with your stance on images. In the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a> case especially, in fact. Who could forget the pictures of corpses in the streets, the mutilations, the destroyed Buddha statues? If we can use images to better tell the story of what happened in Afghanistan during the Taliban rule, we should most definitely do so. (I suspect the only reason that is not the case yet is copyright.) As I said to Merovingian below, when there is evidence that an image is used in a propagandistic way - that the extent of a crime is exaggerated, that important context is missing - then that evidence should be cited, and then one can talk about either making the article NPOV, or removing the images. Images which are factual and not redundant belong in <i>every</i> article. If that makes some people feel bad, tough.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 00:01, May 1, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For what its worth, El, I think 3 (maybe 4) of those photos are redundant, those fulfilling your requirements for removal. 7 and 13 seem functionally identical, as do 2 and 8. 9 doesn't show us anything that 1 doesn't show us. 11 and 12 are photos of the same incident, although the inclusion of the prisoner in the second angle shot does make a difference. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 17:06, May 1, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Seems that Mr. Delirium is too much obsessed with the encyclopaedic nature of the wikipedia. Well, this is not at all a traditional encyclopaedia. This incident demands widespread attention throughout the course of the history of mankind. Future Americans need to know how uncivilised their ancestors were. Pictures are essential not only to portray what happened but also because these pictures themselves are part of the history.

<dd>I agree. These were, according to all reports, taken by U.S. armed service members on active service.

In my (not a lawyer, not legal advice) opinion, it is questionable whether any news agency can assert any rights over images cropped or blurred or captioned from the originals, as they would have to demonstrate that doing so was creative expression, rather than a mechanical process.

<dd>The story is nothing without the pictures. The fact that the pictures are disturbing is central to the existence of this article. In June of 2003, a British soldier took some photos to his Chemist to be developed, and they were seized by the police. The pictures allegedly showed British troops maltreating Iraqi prisoners. This story then disappeared off the radar, essentially because nobody was interested in a story about dodgy pictures when the pictures themselves were not available. Everybody forgot about this story and when the Abu_Ghraib story broke everybody said "Ohh, this is terrible, but the British wouldn't do this, they are better trained", only for the new pictures of the British soldier urinating on an Iraqi prisoner to surface less than two days later. Everybody seemed to have forgotten the story from a year ago, because there were no pictures to hand. The pictures must be shown in the context of the story. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 11:28, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with your characterization of what the SPE showed. I would argue that the experimental subjects hardly acted as "monsters", and were rather fulfilling a perceived role. NOTHING, to my knowledge, explains the actions of the soldiers at Abu Ghraib other than their being the type of people who would commit these sort of acts. To assert that this is, in some way, explicable by the SPE, and to imply therefore, that these soldiers are "ordinary, humane people" who were acting in a certain manner because of a certain setting is, IMHO, laughable. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 20:52, May 3, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>See, subtle "orders" and willful negligence from the very top caused most of this. The SPE has nothing to do with orders. The "guards" of the SPE was not supposed to monitor each other's behavior because they were untrained. The SPE "guards" were not ordered to torture people. But they did. The Abu Whatever guards were supposedly ordered NOT TO torture them. And they were supposed to know the Big Brother is always watching. They did it because something must be deadly wrong from the top. It has nothing to do with the spontaneous torturing behavior displayed in the SPE.</dd>

<p>I think it's blantantly un-NPOV to have a link to Ausvwitz. Regardless of what the US soldiers did, comparing it to the government-condoned genocide of millions is inflammatory and counterproductive. I'd suggest removing that link and maybe adding links to prison abuse in general (the sanford prision is a good start) and to articles on international law concerning prisoners.</p>

<p>Attempt to remove the photos are unacceptable and will not be tolerated. These pictures are essential to not only understand the nature of the abuse itself, but also the public reaction. This article would be a stub or non-existent if these photos had not been released and only words had been used to describe the situation. However, I have moved the photos into the article proper and removed some <i>redundant</i> ones (a second body pyramid etc.) which, I think, we can do without. I have also added captions.</p>
<p>I'd like to know where the claim comes from that the prisoners in the pyramid were forced to masturbate. Did I miss anything?

<dl>
<dd>6. (S) I find that the intentional abuse of detainees by military police personnel included the following acts:</dd>
<dd>a. (S) Punching, slapping, and kicking detainees; jumping on their naked feet;</dd>
<dd>b. (S) Videotaping and photographing naked male and female detainees;</dd>
<dd>c. (S) Forcibly arranging detainees in various sexually explicit positions for photographing;</dd>
<dd>d. (S) Forcing detainees to remove their clothing and keeping them naked for several days at a time;</dd>

<dd>f. (S) <b>Forcing groups of male detainees to masturbate themselves while being photographed and videotaped;</b></dd>
<dd>g. (S) Arranging naked male detainees in a pile and then jumping on them;</dd>
<dd>h. (S) Positioning a naked detainee on a MRE Box, with a sandbag on his head, and attaching wires to his fingers, toes, and penis to simulate electric torture;</dd>
<dd>i. (S) Writing 'I am a Rapest' (sic) on the leg of a detainee alleged to have forcibly raped a 15-year old fellow detainee, and then photographing him naked;</dd>
<dd>j. (S) Placing a dog chain or strap around a naked detainee's neck and having a female Soldier pose for a picture;</dd>
<dd>k. (S) A male MP guard having sex with a female detainee;</dd>
<dd>l. (S) Using military working dogs (without muzzles) to intimidate and frighten detainees, and in at least one case biting and severely injuring a detainee;</dd>
<dd>m. (S) Taking photographs of dead Iraqi detainees.</dd>
<dd>...</dd>
<dd>8. (U) In addition, several detainees also described the following acts of abuse, which under the circumstances, I find credible based on the clarity of their statements and supporting evidence provided by other witnesses (ANNEX 26):</dd>
<dd>a. (U) Breaking chemical lights and pouring the phosphoric liquid on detainees;</dd>
<dd>b. (U) Threatening detainees with a charged 9mm pistol;</dd>

<dd>e. (U) Threatening male detainees with rape;</dd>
<dd>f. (U) Allowing a military police guard to stitch the wound of a detainee who was injured after being slammed against the wall in his cell;</dd>
<dd>g. (U) Sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light and perhaps a broom stick.</dd>
<dd>h. (U) Using military working dogs to frighten and intimidate detainees with threats of attack, and in one instance actually biting a detainee.</dd>

<p>Other than the fact that this article right now is not neutral in the least, it occurred to me that it may be more appropriate to put the description of the incident in a separate article linked to from the Abu Ghraib article. That way there would be no sense of bias due to the excessive description of American misdemeanors next to a very brief account of Hussein's butchery. Plus, who knows, perhaps this is not the last notable event in the history of this particular prison. <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatcher_5a47.html" title="User:Watcher">Watcher</a> 00:03, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Did it ever occur to you that there is, in fact, a difference between a brutal dictator like Saddam Hussein tolerating or ordering the abuse and torture of prison inmates, and soldiers of the United States army engaging in it? The US are an occupational force in Iraq; they have claimed to liberate the country and to move it towards democracy and human rights. That is why these acts - which were, to some extent, deliberately promoted for the purpose of interrogation - are widely considered so abhorrent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's the same reason that it raises much more awareness when Israel kills several women and children in an attack on civilian areas than when a suicide bomber does it. We <i>expect</i> terrorists to act like terrorists and brutal dictators to act like brutal dictators. That does not in any way excuse their actions, of course, but it means that they are in line with what we already know about them. That is why we fight them, after all. We have much higher standards for democratic governments and their armed forces, and when these standards are violated, that <i>should</i> ring the alarm bells, it <i>should</i> cause an outrage, and it <i>should</i> be fully investigated. That is the only way it can be prevented. And that is what happened here. We should be glad that the outrage exists to this extent, it is in fact a demonstration of our freedom. Wikipedia's purpose is not to endorse the idea of freedom or democracy, but we must accord the level of attention to a topic that it deserves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, the <i>type</i> of degradation -- primarily sexual abuse -- is particularly offensive to religious fundamentalists (many of them would condemn sexual abuse much more than torture or murder, especially when it is sexual abuse by a female). That is another key reason why the story of Abu Ghraib is receiving so much attention, it is threatening to do very serious long term damage to the already very bad image of the United States in the Arab world. Regardless, I would have <i>no</i> objection to writing more about what happened under Saddam Hussein, if there was a lot of information available -- there isn't. That is another effect of a brutal dictatorship. Neither the US nor the European media who condemned Abu Ghraib exist under such conditions.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 04:38, May 6, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I am not a <i>sincere loony leftist</i> but I happen to agree that, on average, soldiers tend to be hard and brutal - it's in the training. The evidence is plain: The average IQ is a little lower than the pop'n at large. It is difficult to have moral stature when you are trained to obey orders unquestionably. Remove command and control and what happens? When the cat is away the mice will play. Encourage misbehaviour (explicitly or tacitly) and the troops will misbehave, no encouragement needed. I am not surprised that US and UK soldiers have misbehaved. Soldiers always misbehave. And I am sickened too. In what way is any of that loony or leftist? None of my conservative sane friends think different either. M4-10 might be in the military or not. In any event I would like to make plain I am talking about soldiers on average, I am saying nothing about any individual soldier, and it would be stupid to think I am. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 20:41, 8 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Clarification: What is Rumsfeld (ostensibly) taking responsibility for? It has to be for not ensuring that this type of thing could not happen. That this was not done (by proper training, or inspections, or by example) is the tacit permission to which I refer. That the US govt and the Pentagon sanctioned some of these interrogation techniques is the explicit permission to which I refer. Very senior UK army officers have reported being disturbed by the very anti-Iraqi attitude of many US soldiers <i>and officers</i>. US soldiers are not naturally torturers and humiliators any more than any other army is, where did it come from? Any unsupervised group given power over others tends to cruel and inhumane treatment, as numerous psychological experiments testify. How do explain what has occurred? <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 00:38, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article needs to be split, for sure.

<dd>I, for one, have no desire to <i>bury</i> this article. My own bias is anti-Bush (which makes me hope this episode helps end Bush's political career.) But, as stated above, it is standard operating procedure to have separate articles on places (e.g. the Watergate Hotel, Attica prison, the town of Ghettysburg) from events or scandals that occured there, especially when those locations are important for other reasons. Of course the article on the Watergate Hotel mentions the Watergate scandal and links there, but the scandal is too big to fit on a page ostensibly about a hotel. Here, the article should mention the torture, give a brief description, and link there. But it seems to me that an article about a prison should be mostly about the prison itself; if an event or scandal that occured <i>at</i> the prison is important enough to merit its own article, then it should get its own article.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Qualification of pictures</span></h2>

I agree to your point, Delirium, that to qualify them as "disturbing" is telling people how they are supposed to feel about the pictures, i.e. quite strongly POV.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Muslim Humiliation"</span></h2>
<p>Okay, I made a cheeky edit, but I did it to make a point about a phrase which is objectionable and doesn't belong in an NPOV article. There is no "Muslim World", and if you can find evidence that coercive male nudity is considered shaming in that culture (moreso than in "The West") I invite you to post it with a credit to the source. If, alternately, you want to add a sentence or paragraph that the type of degredation that occured was deliberately aimed at a perceived cultural more (with evidence), then be my guest. As it stands it is strictly <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">opinion</a>. Of course if you accept that male nudity is in fact considered shaming in "The Muslim World", then it must have a reason, which can only be homophobia (likely caused by an inferiority complex born out of authoritarian rule). But I don't really believe that. Do you?</p>

<p>I don't think that being naked in front of dressed people is humiliating in muslim culture only. But I can very well think of a few reasons that it IS humiliating other than homophobia. For instance:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>we are dressed, so we are more <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> than you, you are an <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animal</a></i></li>
<li>naked person is usually more vulnerable than dressed one, <i>you are vulnerable, because we want you to</i></li>
<li><i>we can order you to do anything we want to, you are nothing, you are a <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slave</a></i></li>
</ol>
<p>There sure are many more. Male nakednes being more humiliating than female could be attributed to generally higher position of a man in muslim societies. If you have higher position, then bringing you down from that position hurts more.<br />
Attributing humiliation to homophobia only, or making it the most important reason is ungrounded. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatusz_a1b4.html" title="User:Matusz"><i>--matusz</i></a> 14:10, 8 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good points, and to clarify my whole point, I accept that nakedness, especially <b>coerced</b> nakedness <b>is</b> shaming (for the reasons you listed, amongst possible others), but that this kind of coerced nakedness and accompanying humiliation is no less humiliating for Muslims than anyone else, unless there is some institutionalized cultural reason why Muslims are <i>particularly</i> shamed. The reasons you stated are not culture-specific, except for misogyny. Therefore in the absence of these explanations, there is no reason to draw attention to "Muslim humiliation", only "Human humiliation". I'm going to make an edit to remove the sentence "Male nudity is considered shaming in some Muslim cultures, and particularly humiliating." If anyone disagrees I'd like a discussion here, or at least a more thorough justification in the article as to <i>why</i> it is considered shaming and particularly humiliating in "some Muslim cultures". --<a href="../../../m/4/-/User%7EM4-10_ee36.html" title="User:M4-10">M4-10</a> 02:04, 9 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your suggestion of summarizing the quotes is good general policy and in most cases I would agree with you, but I think that this is one of the exceptions where the vehicule is part of the message. Saying that Bush said this or that and interpreting/explaining it does two things; one, it's less precise and robs the president's words of their impact, like being told about something instead of seeing for oneself. Secondly, explaining and interpreting can and will bring POV into it. Just the quotes themselves are public facts and are not POV. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeCapone_8ccc.html" title="User:MikeCapone">MikeCapone</a> 03:11, May 9, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added the quote in the article and am very suspicious of whoever removed them. George W. Bush and his administration are in the middle of the Abu Ghraid situation and their position, past and present, is incredibly relevant. These quotes cannot be summarized without losing their impact. I demand that they be put back immediately and only removed when someone has correctly argued that they are not relevant instead of a vague "it goes against the conventions of good article writing" excuse. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeCapone_8ccc.html" title="User:MikeCapone">MikeCapone</a> 02:27, May 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They are Bush's words. They are a part of what he said <i>in public</i> and is directly relevant to the Abu Ghraid situation. Are you saying that Bush's own words are anti-Bush and that it is where the POV is? It's like, if I show the pictures of Abu Ghraib to someone without telling them anything about them; it's just a bare objective fact and if there's a POV, it's in the person who sees the photos' interpretation. The pictures themselves are not POV, they are just presenting a fact, as with those Bush quotes. If that fact reflect negatively on someone, it's just too bad for that person but being neutral is NOT about hiding negative facts. These quotes were pretty short compared to the article's lenght, and that's what a table of content is for, to navigate long articles, and complex situations often require longer articles. The quotes were relevant since there's actually a very big worldwide situation right now about war crimes and the president of the country at the center of that situation has said things about war crimes -- there's a direct link. I renew my request for the quotes to be reinstated, they are just giving more facts for the public to process. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeCapone_8ccc.html" title="User:MikeCapone">MikeCapone</a> 03:04, May 9, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rick, make your mind up. Is it "poor style" or is it "POV full stop". If something is "POV full stop" how can a summary of it not be? But Bush giving his own opinion as Bush, as the leader of the "free world", POV? Give over! The more I think about this the more I think my initial reaction to revert your deletion was correct. However I wonder if you are now reacting to my reversion. Listen to MikeCapone, he puts his point very well. I can do little other than repeat it. You need to supply a cogent argument.

But in this case, I know that he can get away with not explaining himself if he doesn't want to, and if I try to put it back in he'll just say that I'm the one asking for it and trying to make trouble and he or another proxy sysop friend will "whack" me.

The <b>opinion</b> of Rick, it cannot be a ruling, that it is not for Wikipedia to expose the dificult position of the President of USA using his own words is ridiculous. Nixon is identified here on Wikipedia as a schemer, Clinton as an adulterer and a dissembler, (Wikipedia says: <i>Clinton claimed "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky."</i> Rick, that reeks of POV!)

<p>I disagree with splitting this article before it exceeds the recommended maximum length for Wikipedia articles (35-40 KB). When it does, but only then, the section from the Taguba report could be split away into its own article. I am somewhat opposed to that and would prefer that it is summarized instead, as I prefer to have a coherent picture of what happened in Abu Ghraib presented in a single article. In the interest of our readers, we should ask: Will there be many people who will want to read an isolated article about General Taguba's report? Or will more people prefer to read a comprehensive article about the prison abuse scandal? Splitting an article into many pieces is often annoying to the reader.</p>
<p>As for splitting away the US abuses specifically from this article, I would only be in favor of doing that if the scandal extends beyond Abu Ghraib. As it stands right now, Abu Ghraib <i>is</i> the name under which this scandal is generally known, and there's absolutely no point in moving it to another, more difficult to find title. The images themselves should of course stay in the article and not be split away -- they are the central element of this story.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a></p>
<p>I think if we do split the article, the most relevant split would be between Saddam-era history and US-occupation-era history. The histories are fairly unconnected, somewhat accidentally sharing the same facility (mostly because it happened to already be there), so it would cause the least incoherence to split it along those lines.
