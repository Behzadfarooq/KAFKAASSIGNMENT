<dd>"And al-Zarqawi, al-Qaida operative, was in Baghdad. He's the guy that ordered the killing of a U.S. diplomat. ... There's no question that Saddam Hussein had al-Qaida ties."</dd>

<p>Your Zarqawi article contains the following sentence: "But, the established connection between Al Qaida operative, Abu Musab al Zarqawi and Iraq has and remains a credible link. "</p>
<p>In its context it suggests that Zarqawi was a good reason for the Iraq invasion in 2003. Yet it provides no evidence to back up the statement.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've fixed this in the article. By the way the information above about the audio tape is not quite correct; the tape did denounce Saddam as "secular, socialist, infidel" but did not actually call for his overthrow; MSNBC changed their report on that issue (follow your own link). But the point is still clear; there's no way al-Qaeda would have worked with Saddam.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 01:02, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Juan Cole (American Middle East expert and Prof of History) quotes a 2003 CBS report: "We have exclusive new details tonight on talks between the US and Iran, a nation the President said was part of an axis of evil. Iran can help the American fight against terrorism, but apparently they have named a price." NBC (Brown) adds, "These three, among the most wanted members of Al Qaeda. The alleged poison expert who got medical treatment in Iraq, [Abu Mussab al Zarqawi]. Bin Laden's third oldest son, [Sa'ad bin Laden], known to be planning new Al Qaeda operations. The Al Qaeda spokesman, [Suleiman abu Gaith], famous for introducing bin Laden in this videotape after 9/11. Many US officials believe that Iran is willing to turn them and other key Al Qaeda operatives over to the US or their home countries -- for a price -- in exchange for members of an Iranian opposition group called the Mujahadeen al-Khalq, or the MEK. The MEK has been attacking Iran's Islamic government from Iraq and is now there under US military control."<a href="http://www.juancole.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.juancole.com/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>

<p><a name="Death_of_Zarqawi.3F" id="Death_of_Zarqawi.3F"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Death of Zarqawi?</span></h2>
<p>All info relative to his alleged death months ago has been removed. What is up?</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, there were unverified reports from U.S. government sources that Zarqawi had died in 2002, killed by a missile in Afghanistan. (These reports came from Northern Alliance members who wanted to give good news to the U.S., so it may or may not have been true.) Even though the report was unconfirmed, it quickly became common knowledge that Zarqawi was dead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then Bush gave a speech in Cincinnati on October 7 (the day before Congress voted to give the Prez permission to go to war against Iraq) that proported to show al-Qaida/Iraq connections. Bush claimed that Zarqawi had not died, but had injured his leg in the attack, and went to Baghdad in 2002 to have his leg amputated. (This was his cheif example of how Saddam supposedly aided al-Qaida.) Powell repeated this claim in his famous speech to the UN, urging a resolution for war. (This information aparently came from Kurdish groups who wanted Saddam overthrown, so it may or may not be true.) It soon became "common knowledge" that Zarqawi had a wooden leg.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But then the Berg beheading was released on the Internet, and one of the killers (though he wore a mask) claimed to be Zarqawi, while reading a prepared statement. I don't know if it really was Zarqawi or not, but he didn't seem to have anything wrong with his leg. The U.S. was happy to believe this was Zarqawi, since that would indicate al-Qaida activity in Iraq, so the identity of the killer has rarely been questioned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then in March of 2004, an insurgent group in Iraq issued a statement that said Zarqawi had been killed in 2002 afterall. (Oddly, they said he was unable to escape the missile attack because of his wooden leg -- but I thought he had a wooden leg <i>because</i> of the attack. Weird.) Anyway, they had an obvious motivation to say this, so that the U.S. would stop demanding they hand over Zarqawi.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So I don't know if Zarqawi is alive or dead, whether he's ever had anything to do with Iraq or not, or whether he has one leg or two (or three). And I kind of doubt anyone in the U.S. government knows either. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell"></a> – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell"><b>Q</b>uadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_Request_for_assistance_8d8c.html" title="User:Quadell/Request for assistance">help</a>)</sup>[[]] 20:32, Sep 21, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One very interesting thing you forgot to mention though is that Zarqawi was allegedly captured by the Iranians, who held him at least for some time. They were going to hand him over to the US, together with several other highflying al-Qaeda types, in exchange for Washington stopping to support the <a href="../../../m/e/k/MEK_eed6.html" title="MEK">MEK</a>, an anti-Iranian terrorist/guerrilla group. The neo-cons were opposed to this deal, they want to see regime in Iran as well (since it was so successful in Iraq I guess...) and they plan to use the MEK for that. They managed to prevent the deal, by having this meeting in Paris with <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Franklin_4af7.html" title="Larry Franklin">Larry Franklin</a> and other Iranian anti-government groups, which was then somehow reported in the press, with the result that the Iranians weren't happy collaborating anymore on al-Qaeda. So basically, there is good reason to believe that al-Zarqawi is still held by the Iranian governments. <a href="http://www.juancole.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.juancole.com/" rel="nofollow">Juan Cole</a> suggests that one reason why Washington is talking up al-Zarqawi's alleged terrorist group in Iraq, is that the implication would be that Iran realeased him, just to create more problems for the US occupation. I haven't followed this very closely, but I think it's based on relatively sound evidence. Juan Cole seems to be very knowledgeable, well-informed and critical without being a conspiracy nut. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 21:49, 21 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Is there any clear evidence that Zarqawi is alive at all? And I'm not talking about grainy pictures of a hooded man claiming to be Zarqawi, or other similar claims and third-hand reports. Is Zarqawi just another global brand of terrorism?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Zarqawi/Iraq myth</span></h2>
<p>Alright, the whole story about Zarqawi being the mastermind and chief organiser of terrorism in Iraq is probably a myth, based on another intelligence "mistake". That's what an article in the respected conservative British paper <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Telegraph_dc47.html" title="Daily Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a> suggests <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/04/wirq04.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/04/wirq04.xml" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.

<i>How US fuelled myth of Zarqawi the mastermind</i> <i>By Adrian Blomfield outside Fallujah</i> <i>(Filed: 04/10/2004)</i></p>
<p><i>Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the terrorist leader believed to be responsible for the abduction of Kenneth Bigley, is 'more myth than man', according to American military intelligence agents in Iraq.</i></p>
<p><i>Several sources said the importance of Zarqawi, blamed for many of the most spectacular acts of violence in Iraq, has been exaggerated by flawed intelligence and the Bush administration's desire to find "a villain" for the post-invasion mayhem.</i></p>
<p><i>Zarqawi fuels his ambition with the release of a video of the beheading of Nick Berg</i></p>
<p><i>US military intelligence agents in Iraq have revealed a series of botched and often tawdry dealings with unreliable sources who, in the words of one source, "told us what we wanted to hear".</i></p>
<p><i>"We were basically paying up to $10,000 a time to opportunists, criminals and chancers who passed off fiction and supposition about Zarqawi as cast-iron fact, making him out as the linchpin of just about every attack in Iraq," the agent said.</i></p>
<p><i>"Back home this stuff was gratefully received and formed the basis of policy decisions. We needed a villain, someone identifiable for the public to latch on to, and we got one."</i></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Zarqawi and attacks in Iraq</span></h2>
<p>Today (or yesterday) the U.S. began lauching sustained bombing attacks against Falujah. The reason was that the Alawi government demanded that the people of the city hand over Zarqawi, and the people of the city did not. Given his unknown whereabouts, it seems reasonable to suspect that the city did not turn over Zarqawi because he wasn't there. Could this be incorporated into the article? caralho de buceta? Also, just today, the U.S. <i>finally</i> froze the assets of <i>Tawhid and Jihad</i>, the group allegedly tied to Zarqawi. That's right; until <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_15.html" title="October 15">October 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the U.S. had allowed T&amp;J funds to flow freely through American banks.

<dd>The first item hasn't really got much to do with Zarqawi. It's basically just the same propaganda trick they played with Saddam, saying he had to hand over the WMD or else he would face invasion, when it was quite obvious he couldn't hand them over because he didn't have any. Now they tell Fallujans they have to hand over Zarqawi, or else their city will be flattened, when it's relatively clear he's not in Fallujah. It's a cynical joke. Apart from the fact that it is terrorism in its purest form to use violence against civilians, to achieve political aims, the same old Nazi terror tactic of collective punishment. But then again, since Zarqawi seems to be little more than the pin-up villain that both Tawhid and Jihad and the "Coalition" use, maybe it does belong in the article.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>About the asset freezing thing: they did the same thing in the UK yesterday. It's also a sick joke, because there are almost certainly no Tawhid and Jihad funds in the UK, and I would guess the same is true for the US. I read their money comes from Saudi Arabia, and it's mainly about sending a signal to our Saudi friends. But it really belongs to the Tawhid and Jihad article. To be honest, all the Iraq war propaganda is of such bad quality that I'm beginning to feel insulted. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 03:01, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

In response to the paragraphs from "zarqawi myth" piece, I think it should be removed. A lot has happened since Oct 16, like Zarqawi's allegence to al-Qaeda and bin Laden's audiotaped endorsement of al-Zarqawi.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What's this Mabus Crap?</span></h2>
<p>I'm removing the story of Mabus and Nostradamus. The person who wrote it said "it is OK to report relevant views of people according to Wikipedia rules" but this is not a relevant view. The whole theory comes from a Nostradamus site which also lists Howard Dean and Dick Cheney as potential candidates for "Mabus." I just don't think this belongs here. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 21:40, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, it is true that there are many theories about MABUS, and one of them is that it is Bush. However, in his case that would not be so interesting or important to report, as it not so interesting fact that someone would have this theory. The theory about MABUS in the case of Abu Masub is however intriguing and interesting - some people do consider it (not just on that site) to be a case, and it is worth reporting it. If there is a prophecy about someone than this should be reported in the site, even if you think that the prophecy is nonsense (as it is in my case, but I find it a relevant fact that there IS such a prophecy, in interpretations of many people). The wikipedia should REPORT about believes of people, even if you disagree what they believe in. Some people (bilion or so) believe that Jesus Christ resurected, and it is OK to report that here. Some people (probably many milions) believe there is something in Nostradamus prophecies, and many more find them intriguing. There is a well known prophecy about MABUS, the third antichrist, and this should be reported in wikipedia - it has much more place than some arbitrary speculations about what happens in year 2634 (that is in Wikipedia too). So I am adding this back, together with the theory about MABUS.</p>
<p>I see what you're saying, but this is a biography piece. Things can be interesting, lots of people can believe them, and yet not be relevant to the particular page under discussion. Perhaps this would work more in the "MABUS" page - with a link to this one to show the biography of the person the theory is about. Maybe, and I express no opinion about it, with a link on this page to that. --<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeOrr_29bb.html" title="User:GeorgeOrr">GeorgeOrr</a> 02:42, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>But prophecies about people, or something that is viewed as such, IS relevant to their biography - it can often affect their lives and biographies significantly.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So far, it has NOT affected his life significantly, and it's basically a bit of speculation not very well-connected to his life. It certainly doesn't deserve an extensive treatment - at MOST a link to the MABUS page in a "See Also" section. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraft_fc33.html" title="User:Graft">Graft</a> 16:38, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>And what has been discussed seems to be leaning against inclusion. You say "it can often affect their lives and biographies significantly." CAN being the opperative word. Can you site a source that this particular prophecy has affected him directly? Is there any evidence that he even knows about it let alone is affected by it? --64.94.180.150 23:02, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be relevant to their bio if in fact it affected their lives significantly. It hasn't. A lot of people believe in Tarot readings, and find them interesting and believe them to be relevant. But if someone went to a local fortune teller and asked them to interpret the cards concerning Abu Musab al-Zarqawi I wouldn't expect to see the results posted here ... unless it was he who went or in some way had been affected by it. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeOrr_29bb.html" title="User:GeorgeOrr">GeorgeOrr</a> 02:02, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have been watching this page for a while, and the Mabus conspiracy/mythology gets inserted so frequently that I believe it should be included, either as a section of this page, or at mabus. Something brief! Anyone who wishes to expound on the Mabus-Zarqawi link should put it in the Mabus section.<a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeago_6121.html" title="User:Yeago">Yeago</a> 05:53, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Looking through Wikipedia I see a lot of pages have a string of one or two people constantly trying to add irrelevant sections. The rest of the community takes turns deleting it, patiently explaining why it's irrelevant, and then removing it again. One person, or even a few, repeatedly adding something irrelevant doesn't make it relevant. As you suggest, add it to a different page (like the Mabus page for instance) but not on a page where it has no relevance. I would completely change that view if someone could post on this discussion evidence that shows this prophecy has had a significant affect on the subject of the bio. --<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeOrr_29bb.html" title="User:GeorgeOrr">GeorgeOrr</a> 01:27, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess that's where I differ--I think this Mabus connection is an interesting piece of 'trivia', which neccessarily has absolutely no significance whatsoever. It would be highly unusual to make reference to Zarqawi in the Mabus article, but make no mention of Mabus in the Zarqawi article. Typically, articles cross-connect. I would agree with you if maybe 50 or more people were up for the Mabus award, but the Nostradamus prophecy has only been interpreted to be a select few people. You said one or two people but I believe several more have attempted to interject Mabus trivia. I am in favor of adding a small tidbit about Mabus, and then telling future Nostradamus nuts to keep it to the Mabus section.<a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeago_6121.html" title="User:Yeago">Yeago</a> 01:57, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've read through this discussion and I can't believe anyone is willing to defend this stuff. It makes Wikipedia look silly. It's fine to include your theories about Mabus on the Nostradamus page or the Mabus page, but not here. There's nothing wrong with a one-way link on the mabus page listing Zarqawi as one of the possible candidates for Mabus, but no mention of Mabus on this page. The same way you could have a page on Robert Fisk that mentions he wrote an article about Zarqawi, without putting Fisk on the Zarqawi page. No real encyclopedia would include such superstitions in a biography entry. I know wikipedia is different but it aspires to similar scholarly standards. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 06:58, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that people are only "Palestinian" when it suits their cause. The media refuses to label this terrorist, Zarqawi, as a "Palestinian" because of his obvious atrocities, however, they and Wikipedia continue to label Al-Arian and Arafat, born in Kuwait and Egypt respectively, as "Palestinians". Let's face it, they are Arab Muslim terrorists, lets just call them that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No; people are only "Palestinian" when they are actually of Palestinian origin.

<p>I also could not find any credible information reguarding a disinformation campaign. If this was really true, American and British press would have jumped at the chance to publish it. I cannot find it anywhere, except for questionable cites:</p>

<dd>I'm sorry but your objections to these sources is bogus. The Telegraph is a conservative paper, true, but that in itself does not impugn its credibility. You haven't even looked at the other link because you don't like the nickname -- it claims to be an alternative newspaper; a silly nickname alone is not enough reason for destroying its credibility. You also do not make any claims against the other article, which cites several newspapers. These stories may be just stories, but they are cited often enough they should not just be ignored here.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 21:40, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why does this story not appear in any mainstream publication? CNN, Fox News, BBC, none of them carry this story. Even the liberal papers like the New York Times and Boston Globe don't have anything like this. They all would have jumped at this kind of story. I am not familiar with the Telegraph, but that article was anything but unbiased. To me, parts of it read more like an editorial.</p>
<p>The quote from the article: "Yet it now seems that the intelligence on which such claims are based is haphazard, scanty and contradictory."</p>
<p>If this is true, why hasn't it been reported in the mainstream press? We can't assume that there's a huge, right-wing conspiracy over the US and Britian to keep it out of the news. That doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>The reason I question the 'war nerd' article is because I know that if I personally was using news articles to write anything academic, articles with a name like that probably wouldn't be acceptable sources. Even if the information is correct, it's very hard to take a source seriously when it comes from an 'alternative news' source. What is an 'alternative' newspaper? Does it give 'extreme' points of view? Is it read by people who like 'alternative' music? As I read down the page, porn links are popping up. '200 Beautiful Russian Brides a Week?' 'E-mail thousands of beautiful Russian ladies?' The only thing that I can say is that I should have opened the link earlier, I didn't realize that 'war nerd' is the name of the column.</p>
<p>Here are a few quotes from the front page. These are unedited and unexaggerated, and I include them to prove a point:</p>
<p>"How many Iraqis are trained up and ready to take over from the Americans? That number depends on how gullible - or high - you are. The eXile subjects a beer-drinking real estate agent to the whacky ups and downs of the Iraqi forces..."</p>
<p>""He liked to fuck whores in the ass, and not wear a condom, and then brag about it..." The incredibly sordid truth behind the bludgeoning death of Russia's spam villain..."</p>
<p>"The zany story of how the Washington Post's new correspondent, Peter Finn, helped sell a Pentagon-planted story about an Iraqi "victim" just in time to help shore up support for the war..."</p>
<p>www.exile.ru is clearly NOT a 'fair and balanced' news source.</p>
<p>I stand by my previous comments on calling Zarqawi and his 'insurgent' organization for what they are--terrorists. I feel this article should reflect the truth, reguardless of the validity of those news sources. <a href="../../../b/q/a/User%7EBQAggie2004_0e7d.html" title="User:BQAggie2004">BQAggie2004</a> 23:09, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Obviously there is no right wing conspiracy; this appeared in a right wing paper. The line you quoted is anything but inaccurate and while this particular story may not have been picked up, the intel failures surrounding all of this stuff certainly has. Also I heard Octavia Nasr, a CNN translator and correspondent, articulate these views at a conference on Al Qaeda in December 2004, so it is not that far off the mainstream. The quote you erased included info about the publications making these claims so it is not inaccurate to include it - if you want to add reservations or refutations from more mainstream publications that would be terrific. I personally do not endorse these views, but I do think they are notable enough for inclusion. As for the "war ned" thing, that is the guy's email address - it is not his name, which is clearly on the article page. An "alternative news" source such as the Village Voice or LA Weekly in the US can be very credible, though you're right, this Russian one looks like a tabloid. I'll take that source out, but the claims about disinformation and mythology surrounding Zarqawi are quite notable without this article. As for the question of calling him a "terrorist" - I agree, but it is wrong to erase the fact that he is <b>also</b> a "militant" and is part of the "Iraqi insurgency."--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 23:38, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure where British right-wing stands compared to American politics, I have heard that in general, the British are shifted either to the left or the right of what Americans call moderate, I'm not sure, I'm probably wrong.</p>
<p>Perhaps something should be written that could cast doubt on the 'myth' claims, if something should be found. My point is that if this was credible, it would be as well known as Bush's 'yellow-cake' reference in the State of the Union. That kind of news would be HUGE in the US. But as you said above, these were 'views.'</p>
<p>If you look at the web page, the name of the column is the 'War Nerd.' It might be his e-mail too.</p>
<p>Technically, I guess you are right about the 'terrorism' reference. After all, Ted Kyzenski (the Unibomber) was a terrorist, but I don't think he was a militant. It should be noted that Zarqawi is a 'gurrella leader' and a 'militant' and a 'terrorist.' I'd find facts to back my claims up, but they are already in the article. He's not just wanted for terrorism, he is a self-proclaimed terrorist. <a href="../../../b/q/a/User%7EBQAggie2004_0e7d.html" title="User:BQAggie2004">BQAggie2004</a> 00:17, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Terrorist or freedom fighter?</span></h2>
<p>In the very first line Zarqawi is referred to as a terrorist. Where do you draw the line between a terrorist and a freedom fighter? Is it not better to preserve objectivism by saying something like ‘freedom fighter/terrorist’ or ‘viewed by some as a terrorist while others consider him to be a freedom fighter’?</p>
<p>History is written by the ‘victorers’ and it can be hard to distinguish who the good/bad guys are. Were the founding fathers of The United States of America freedom fighters or terrorist? Hezbollah? Chechnyens? The list goes on…</p>
<p>Per</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nobody considers Zarqawi a "freedom fighter." Some extreme Islamists may consider him a proud warrior, but the notion of "freedom fighter" is simply inappropriate here. "Terrorist" is not objective, perhaps, but it is descriptive, and it is based on the facts in front of everyone -- the targeting of civilians, the deliberate use of terror as an instrument of warfare, etc. IMHO, "psychopath" might be a more accurate description, but "terrorist" is certyainly more consistent with the way most of the world sees him, as well as with the way he represents himself. He most certainly does not lay claim to the basically Western notion "freedom fighter."--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 18:32, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, from an Islamic prosepective, he is a criminal who has killed many civilians. Nevertheless, from an objective position, he is FIGHTING U.S. occupation of Iraq, which could make him a freedom fighter. He represents the Sunni side of the freedom fight, while Sadr represents the Shia side. I'm sure they both hate each other, but they both hate the US as well. And no matter how much you sugarcoat it, it is an occupation. Actually it's a lot like the British takeover of India (if you have studied both, compare them) British took over, said they were doing Indians a favor and saving them from despotic rulers and in doing so killed thousands , tortured them, ridiculed them, called the freedom fighters terrorists etc. So we can compare it to that. <a href="../../../f/k/h/User%7EFkh82_2ba6.html" title="User:Fkh82">Fkh82</a> 01:57, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're just making stuff up. The term "freedom fighter" is a Western creation that has no resonance in Sunni or Shia culture in Iraq. Many Iraqis might see the Iraqi resistance as a heroic opposition to Western domination, but that is not the same as using the term "freedom fighter." The comparison to India is not unreasonable, but it also doesn't make Zarqawi or the Indian independence movement anything like "freedom fighters." Also I think it is ignorant to lump Zarqawi's fighters with the Sunni resistance to US occupation -- the latter is native Iraqi, while the former is made up of Islamists from all over with a religious mission that may or may not intersect with the Sunni resistance.-<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 06:59, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Except that Berg was an israeli citizen, which the USA and Israel tried to keep secret, but the <a href="../../../h/a/a/Haaretz.html" title="Haaretz">Haaretz</a> newspaper leaked the info. Berg had known and hard proven links to one of the 9/11 hijackers (shared dorm room and laptop with him). There is every reason to believe that Berg was involved with <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossad.html" title="Mossad">Mossad</a>, which Zarkavi did indeed claim so.</p>
<p>So Berg was neither an American, nor a civilian. As a spy, he had no expectation to live and I have no problem with spies being killed, since <a href="../../../e/s/p/Espionage.html" title="Espionage">espionage</a> is an extra-judicary activity.

<p>I may be a bit of a biased source, but I do know Berg's family in the US. They were questioned following 9/11 and again following his execution, and no claims of his involvement with Mossad were ever made by the US government. Likely, you have no more information on this issue than the US government has (despite the US government's unreliability regarding intelligence), and if I were you, I would think twice before rushing to say that you have no problem with the execution of someone you don't know. <a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticfeline_4a27.html" title="User:Mysticfeline">Mysticfeline</a> 22:00, 15 December 2005 (UTC)Mysticfeline</p>
