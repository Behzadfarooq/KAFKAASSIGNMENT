<dd>Hi, Pat. The edit I did on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maradona.html" title="Maradona">Maradona</a> article was only for a better page display. I didn touched the contents. Yes, I know who Maradona is. I ever see him on a match in my city once, in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>. And yes, although I'm not very good at it, I have played football a lot of times.</dd>

<dd>For brazilian people the only player was Pele and that's all.</dd>

<p><b>Attilios</b>: Dear Abu, I didn't understand that cover images could be used only for articles about the magazine itself. I checked the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">Fair use</a> article, but it's rather legal.

<dd><i>It is believed that the use of <b>low-resolution</b> images of magazine covers <b>to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question</b>, with the publication name either visible on the image itself or written in the image description above, on the English-language Wikipedia, hosted on servers in the United States by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, <b>qualifies as fair use</b></i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, that image would be usable in a article about <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, but not about <i>Maradona</i>, nor <i>Football</i>, nor Sports, etc. ... --<a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu Badali</a> 13:15, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Attilios</b>: Thanks for the info about magazine covers, but I was referring to images in general. For example, how can I decide when a generic image taken from a site can be defined as "Fair use"? For example, a photo illustrating an artistic place when can be considered "Fair Use"? Ciao! Attilios</p>
<p><b>abu_badali</b>: Humm... the point is, it's not about the <b>image</b>, it's about the <b>use</b>. We can use copyrighted images the same way we use copyrighted texts in citations. Just like we can copy (cite) parts of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Selfish_Gene_d9b1.html" title="The Selfish Gene">The Selfish Gene</a> in a text about this book (a review, for instance), we can also use low resolution version of images when talking about this image. But if I'm writting about <i>selfish genes</i> (the concept) in general, and not about the book, I wouldn't be allowed to copy parts of the text under fair use. The same applies for images.</p>
<p>A great example of image fair use in Wikipedia is the article <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenna.html" title="Lenna">Lenna</a>. The article is about a copyrighted image, but it uses the image under fair use, as it is talking about that very image. The use of this image on the article on <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lena_Soderberg_b265.html" title="Lena Soderberg">Lena Soderberg</a> (the girl depicted on the picture) is questionable.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="../../../i/a/n/IANAL_268a.html" title="IANAL">IANAL</a>. But don't be shy to ask, whenever you think I may be helpful. --<a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu Badali</a> 16:57, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

But it would be nicer if we could use with lesser restrictions pictures present in the internet: for example, what a harm if we get a picture from a state-owned site (i.e., an official site of an Italian commune) and add their images to represent the commune itself on our encyclopedia? Another matter: I think Wikipedia should use some amount of money to pay for use of geographic maps and Atlas.

<p>No (not today) ;-) That is: no, it is not possible to simulate any natural process using a Turing Machine (and today Turing Machine is the most powerful machine). Example of natural process that is impossible to simulate by Turing is - human brain. Is that strictly provable? Yes, it is: human brain can decide whether Turing Machine will stop. Turing Machine cannot decide whether Turing Machine will stop. Therefore, Turing Machine cannot simulate brain performing action of deciding whether Turing Machine will stop.

<p>Hello, i noticed you quickly feedback at my page, and i want to state that i understand your point and i respect it. I wish you understand mine, and the fact is, Hwang Woo Suk article is a current event (or it was as of early 2006) and unfortunatelly there are not (GDF) or excent to copyright images related to that article, and because of this i uploaded those images. To removing them would leave the article with just words, and doing so would let the article quite boring (not counting the article has turned extremelly large) to the reader if it doesnt find graphic material which can give a visual concept of what's he or she is reading. I would try to find another images with friendlier copyright to wikipedia to replace the previous ones, but as i stated it is a pitty there are practically almost none pictures of photographs which can be used in Wikipedia relating to Hwang Woo Suk, if a fair use is not claimed. I hope you may understand. Best regards, HappyApple signing off. <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyApple_dadc.html" title="User:HappyApple">HappyApple</a> 16:49, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I ujust added this (where you asked your question): "I'm sure it's been addressed before, but my thought process was always that in articles about models, like the ones we've been discussing, the use of those images might be justifiable, as they're indicitive of the person's career, not just simply used to identify the likness of the person." I guess that's my take, thought I admit I do not have a strong opinion either way. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriGold_7a2c.html" title="User:AriGold">AriGold</a> 20:36, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Your edit of Brassiere</span></h2>
<p>Your edit of "14:17, 8 March 2006" on <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brassiere.html" title="Brassiere">Brassiere</a> was quite problematic, since you marked it as a minor edit, yet you appear to have substituted a completely different and much older version of the page (one which seems to be inferior in some respects, and which of course ignores all the edits made since that date). Furthermore, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Image%7EBust_supporter_1893_USpatent507373.png_eced.html" title="Image:Bust supporter 1893 USpatent507373.png">Image:Bust supporter 1893 USpatent507373.png</a> is really an unintentionally quite laughable piece of work, which has already been made fun of at <a href="../../../w/h/o/Wikipedia%7EWhose_Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_is_it_Anyway__241a.html" title="Wikipedia:Whose Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense is it Anyway?">BJAODN</a>, so that for you to put it back into the page is a severe disimprovement. Furthermore, I resent the implication that <a href="../../../1/8/8/Image%7E1881-empire-bra-vie-parisienne-henri-montaut.gif.html" title="Image:1881-empire-bra-vie-parisienne-henri-montaut.gif">Image:1881-empire-bra-vie-parisienne-henri-montaut.gif</a> is "unsourced" -- in fact, it's elaborately and ornately sourced, one could say sourced to within an inch of its life. So I'm going to revert your edit on "Brassiere", and if you have an issue with ANY SPECIFIC PORTION of the article, then please work on <i>that particular section</i>, instead of substituting in an older version of the whole page. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChurchh_dba4.html" title="User:Churchh">Churchh</a> 19:57, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry for that! It was an accident. I somehow managed to unintentionally use an older version of the article. I believe the mistake happened because I was browsing through the article history to find out what the last used <b>top</b>-image was. Sorry. My fault. Mea culpa. Great mistake.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, the "<i>unsourced image</i>" I was (trying to) talking about was the one on the top of the page, Image:SG1.jpg, that is so far, indeed, unsourced. What I believed I was doing when I destroyed the article was replacing this image by the previosly used one: <a href="../../../b/u/e/Image%7EBuestenhalter-2.jpg_459f.html" title="Image:Buestenhalter-2.jpg">Image:Buestenhalter-2.jpg</a>.

<p>I've notice you have been erasing everybody's images in Wikipedia. Don't you have other things to do?</p>
<p>Why don't you write a new article, or help other users to do better articles? Is your job here to erase what we post? Get a job!</p>
<p>All the images I post do have FAIR USE. Magazine covers do have fair use, and we can post them ANYWHERE WE WISH. There's nothing saying they only can be used to illustrate a magazine's article. NO, YOU SHOULD STUDY LAW BEFORING TRYING TO PLAY THE DETECTIVE HERE. If a person is on the cover of a magazine, no matter if the person is famous or not, anyone can use that cover for ANYTHING.</p>
<p>Go back to school, buddy!</p>
<p>And stop hunting me here!! I have notice you are looking all my posts in Wikipedia and anything I post here, the next person to post is you. Are you in love with me or something? Please, get out!!</p>
<p>And also, don't use other Usernames to erase what we post. Everybody knows it's you, because you are the only person here who erases fair use images.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a FREE ENCYCLOPEDIA, so since it is free, you don't have the right to erase other users's post, with no argument.</p>
<p>So isn't magazine cover fair use here to illustrate articles about celebrities?? So why does <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halle_Berry_1870.html" title="Halle Berry">Halle Berry</a>'s article has a magazine cover to show her face??</p>

<p style="margin-left:1em; font-style:italic">In reply to <a href="../../../a/b/u/User_talk%7EAbu_badali_00c9.html#STOP_ERASING_PEOPLE.27S_IMAGES" title="User talk:Abu badali">your comments in my talk page</a>:</p>
<p>Please, Xuxo, this is the second time you are rude torwards me. I have no interest in being your adversary. I want to colaborate with you, just like with any other wikipedian, to make this a great free encyclopedy.</p>
<p>Removing images we don't have the rigth to use, or that are improperly used is part of the job of improving Wikipedia. <b>Magazine covers</b>, as explained in the text shown in the {{<a href="../../../m/a/g/Template%7EMagazine_cover_ba3c.html" title="Template:Magazine cover">Magazine cover</a>}} template itself, can only be used <b>to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question</b> (see the 1st bullet there). This means, among other things, that magazine covers can't be used to illustrate the person portrayed on them.</p>
<p>Magazine covers are not <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_Use_83e7.html" title="Fair Use">Fair Use</a> per se. Actually, nothing is fair use per se. Fair use, as the name says, deals with the <b>use</b> of the image (or text, or any work). Using a copyrighted magazine cover to talk about a magazine is a fair use. Using a copyrighted movie poster (or scene) to talk about the movie is a fair use. Using a magazine copyrighted cover as a replacement for a picture we don't have (of some celebrity, or whatever) is not a fair use.</p>
<p>I share your sentiments that it would be really great if magazine covers could be used <i>anywere we wish</i>, for <i>anything</i>. But unfortunatelly it's not true.</p>
<p>About the article you cited, I would say that the use of a magazine cover in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halle_Berry_1870.html" title="Halle Berry">Halle Berry</a> is hardly justifiable (thanks for poiting out!). The <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakira.html" title="Shakira">Shakira</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Lopez_e5d1.html" title="Jennifer Lopez">Jennifer Lopez</a> uses of <b>album covers</b> may be arguably justified as illustration of their works (just like the <a href="../../../x/u/x/Xuxa.html" title="Xuxa">Xuxa</a> article has an album cover illustrating the <a href="../../../x/u/x/Xuxa.html#Brazilian_Discography_.26_Sales" title="Xuxa">discography section</a>).</p>
<p>I don't have others Wikipedia usernames and I never intentionally edit articles anonymously.</p>
<p>I never studied law, it's true. As a matter of fact, all I know about <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">Fair use</a> I learned from Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">Fair use</a>.</p>
<p>Don't be shy to <a href="../../../a/b/u/User_talk%7EAbu_badali_00c9.html#STOP_ERASING_PEOPLE.27S_IMAGES" title="User talk:Abu badali">return your toughts to me</a>. I'm completly open to talks envisioning the improvement of Wikipedia, but I may refuse to talk when people are overly discourteous to me.</p>
<p>I hope all personal misunderstandings are solved by now. Best regards, --<a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu Badali</a> 13:54, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Abu badali. I've read the discussion over at the <b><a href="../../../m/a/g/Template_talk%7EMagazinecover_a2b1.html" title="Template talk:Magazinecover">Template_talk:Magazinecover</a></b> and from what I gather there is no clear and conlusive restrictions reached that the magazine covers, in this case at the <b>Image:Anastasia Perraki1.jpg</b>, can not be used. Plus it mentioned the magazine in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anastasia_Perraki_e8f8.html" title="Anastasia Perraki">Anastasia Perraki</a> article since she worked as a model for it and the modeling agency she works for, from where the picture comes from is hyper-linked on the image page.

I've read the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Template%7EMagazinecover_03ec.html" title="Template:Magazinecover">Template:Magazinecover</a> template rules. Were are these specific Wikipedia policies in which the objections from the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Template_talk%7EMagazinecover_a2b1.html" title="Template talk:Magazinecover">Template_talk:Magazinecover</a> have all been refurted and resolved with images like the Image:Anastasia Perraki1.jpg are breaking the rules and have to be absolutely deleted? By the way, the magazine is not mentioned in the article just to justify the fair use claim policies. Its mention was in the article from day one, before I even picked which picture to up load for the article, because it talks about the modeling jobs she has had. I didn't even realize I was following Wikipedia rules when I did it since I just now noticed that such a rule for magazine covers exist.

<p>Why are you erasing the pictures I have posted here??</p>
<p>You have no right to do it! The <a href="../../../a/n/a/Ana_Claudia_Michels_d781.html" title="Ana Claudia Michels">Ana Claudia Michels</a>'s picture is a MAGAZINE COVER. Since then, I can use it in Wikipedia. You've been saying that it does not have fair use to illustrate a celebrity's article. YOU ARE THE ONLY USER who sais this lie in Wikipedia, because every celebrity's article in Wikipedia does have a magazine cover to illustrate it. But, I've noticed that you just erase MY POSTS, while there are thousands of articles with magazine covers, and you did not erase them. Why don't you go to <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Moss_480f.html" title="Kate Moss">Kate Moss</a> article and erase the magazine covers? And that about <a href="../../../n/a/o/Naomi_Campbell_a428.html" title="Naomi Campbell">Naomi Campbell</a>??? And how about <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heidi_Klum_f12a.html" title="Heidi Klum">Heidi Klum</a>. What do you say about <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudia_Schiffer_c6e0.html" title="Claudia Schiffer">Claudia Schiffer</a> and <a href="../../../y/a/m/Yamila_Diaz_69d5.html" title="Yamila Diaz">Yamila Diaz</a>. Why don't you go there and erase them and hunt their posters too? Answer me that!</p>
<p>And it is not only me, because in the Ana Claudia Michels article, I posted the magazine cover, then you came and erased the image. Then another use came and re-posted the image, arguing that is was a magazine cover used to illustrate the article and it HAS FAIR USE.</p>
<p>Saying again, you have no right to erase magazine covers image here, because they are not fobidden in Wikipedia. Don't you have other things to do in your life?? Do you work for those magazines??</p>
<p>Only one person could come here a erase a magazine cover: THE OWNER OF THE MAGAZINE. Since you are the owner, I do not know what you get with it.</p>

<p>Why do you and your buddy Ed_gs2 insist on posting that mug shot of Carmen Electra on her page? It is inherently biased. It carries the assumption that she's a career criminal. In fact, the charges for which that photo were taken, were dismissed. Your insistence on posting it amounts to pushing a point of view. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 10:01, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>"rv image removal without edit summary"</i> - You know very well what the issue is. I would like very much to hear your justification for promoting the point of view that this actress is a criminal. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:46, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, we'll see what you can come up with. Meanwhile, kindly explain why it being the only "free" image (lifted from a website notorious for scandal-mongering) <i>compels</i> you to post it. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:55, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Your last comment might have "crossed in the mail" with the above. Anyway, it's not so much that the picture is unflattering. If someone took a picture of her walking along the street in public, that would be fair game, even if it was not the best picture. But posting a police arrest photo is tabloid stuff and carries its own inherent point-of-view, which is to ridicule the actress. The only good thing is that this page has not been vandalized nearly as much as the pages of some other glamour-girls, such as <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamela_Anderson_9466.html" title="Pamela Anderson">Pamela Anderson</a>. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:00, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Look mate, what IS your problem with where images come from? They make wikipedia a better place, regardless of source (and for the record I think that ALL of my images qualify as fair use). You're actually working against everything that is good about wikipedia, systematically going after people and questioning everything they do. Who told you to do this? Why take the 'law' into your own hands? Ask yourself this: who are you protecting? You wanna play cops and robbers, go and joing the freaking police. Do something useful, rather than wasting your life on here. What is your job? Cos this ain't real life buddy, and if its your only hobby, I feel bad for you. I mean really bad. I thinks it's quite sad that your only reason for using wikipedia is to actively reverse what other people do, rather than to actively create content. I will review all the images you 'helpfully' tagged for me, but I'm getting real tired of you ducking me man.

<p><a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Fonssagrives_6331.html" title="Lisa Fonssagrives">Lisa Fonssagrives</a> was an early supermodel and the cover Image:LisaFVogue.jpg which is one of Lisa Fonssagrives' more than 200 covers on <a href="../../../v/o/g/Vogue_%28magazine%29.html" title="Vogue (magazine)">Vogue</a> would be representative of a significant impact of the magazine on both the field of supermodels, her individual career and her impact of style on the magazine. If this is clearly stated on the image description and within the articles for all three would this in your opinion qualify for fair use? Thanks. This whole image business is getting to be harder work than it is worth for many users, which is I think unfortunate.

<dd>The magazine Vogue is discussed in the Supermodel article as is the relationship between Lisa Fonssagrives and Vogue and that this issue is representative of the over 200 covers of Vogue on which she appeared. I have asked for your input here several days ago and you have chosen to ignore this request. I am more than willing to discuss this and would welcome your input. Short of this, I have done my best to meet the guidelines required by Wikipedia. This cover is not for 'decorative' purposes but to be illustrative of the importance of the model to the magazine and visa versa and their mutual importance to the existence of supermodels. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> 17:02, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It seems to me that all images could be considered decorative in some sense and that on that basis, if we should consider words adequate description then perhaps all images should be banned from Wikipedia. Images do, I believe help to define an article, and has been said many times "a picture is worth a thousand words."</dd>

<dd>The question here seems to me to be if we can meet the "fair use" standard, which, as I understand it requires showing the relevance to the article in question. The "look" and style of this model is pivotal to whole beginning of supermodels and the magazine and its relationship with this model, with that number of covers, is central to the magazines connection with forming future supermodels. While it might indeed be decorative to have a gallery of all 200+ covers, that would be unreasonable. I do believe that one cover can be representative of this mass and add more than words alone and as such qualifies as "fair use". If there is other or additional wording that I should add to the article, I am open to suggestion <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> 18:04, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my opinion, the image does just that. It defines the look, which few if any pubic domain images will do.

<dd>A Vogue cover, any Vogue cover with this model on the cover is iconic for these articles, in my opinion. No photograph other than a Vogue cover with this model could take its place. Yet your claim is that this disqualifies any Vogue cover. That's my point and I do believe that this qualifies for fair use. It is low resolution, it in no way compromises the value of the original or takes away any profit potential to the copyright holder and uniquely represents the relationship between magazine, model and the superstar it defines. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> 04:07, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

I would argue that it is used to identify Andy Creeggan and demonstrate his appearance in that video (just like a screenshot, say, of 24 may be used in an article about a character to ID that character, rather than to ID the show or episode...

<dd>Hi, TheHYPO. According to the <b>bold text</b> on the {{<a href="../../../m/u/s/Template%7EMusicpromo-screenshot_6aad.html" title="Template:Musicpromo-screenshot">musicpromo-screenshot</a>}} template you used on Image:Andag1.jpg, that images can only be used "<b>for identification and critical commentary on the music video in question</b>".

<dd>I understand that; My question is why you feel that identification of how someone appeared in that video does not qualify. Note the image Image:Jean-Luc_Picard1.jpg is also a TV screenshot; like thousands of TV and movie characters on wiki, the image is used to ID the character, though the image is not being used to specifically identify the episode or scene in question. I understand that the copyright for screenshots say 'and its contents' at the end, but it's the same fair use law for music videos as film and tv shots; and that phrase should apply equally to music video screenshots, which are tv screenshots; just because whoever made the template didn't use the phrase 'and its contents' shouldn't necessarily alter the qualifications for use. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 19:33, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hello again, TheHYPO. I believe when the template says "<i>identification</i>", it means identification of "<i>the music video in question</i>", not identification of anything desired. I agree that there are tons of fair use abuses on Wikipedia, but a thousand erros don't make a right. I also believe that when {{<a href="../../../m/o/v/Template%7EMovie-screenshot_f0bd.html" title="Template:Movie-screenshot">movie-screenshot</a>}} says "<i>it's contents</i>", it's not allowing us to use a movie screenshot just to illustrate an article on some person depicted on that screenshot. Also, these templates were not made at some editor's will. They should follow the <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFair_use_26b6.html" title="WP:Fair use">Wikipedia's Fair Use policies</a>. If we find something too permissive in some of the templates, it's going to be changed to match the policies.

<dd>So if the article discussed the music video in question, it would be an acceptable use? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 20:18, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That image is acceptable as fair use in any article doing <b>critical commentary</b> on the video. Just mentioning the video is no good. Some few lines about the video, is no good. (I'm not implying you intend to do that, I'm just warning you about a very commom type of Fair Use abuse on Wikipedia). The text should be the cause behind the image use, not the reverse.</dd>
<dd>Even if the article is changed to make a deep critical disscussion on the video, we should avoid using that image as the main image on the article (at the top), as it would be still being used to identification of the subject.</dd>
<dd>Of course, this is all my interpretations of the fair use policies on Wikipedia and I'm open to discussion.</dd>
<dd>TheHYPO, I appreciate your intentions to put an image on the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Creeggan_6adf.html" title="Andy Creeggan">Andy Creeggan</a> article. I agree that images greatly improve Wikipedia's article. But free images, although harder to get, are a thousand times better choice. Have you tried to find some free image for this article? I have had some recent success in findding freely licensed images to use in Wikipedia by searching pictures on <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flickr.html" title="Flickr">Flickr</a> and, when they are not already free, contacting the photographer and asking if he/she would be interested in having his work used on Wikipedia. You know what? Most of them love the idea and release their work freely. Why don't you give a try?

<dd>Unfortunately, Andy is no longer with the band, and basically is out of the public eye; this notably decreases public available images of him (particularly ones from a period of time when he WAS in the public image, pre-1995; There are band publicity photos, but not great quality scans of them from photos that old, and those photos would probably be just as fair use (though perhaps more applicable). I have a magazine the band was in back then that has a fairly good image of him, but again, is a magazine scan any better? There are very very few other-than-tiny scans of photos of him from back then, leaving public use images fairly sparse. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 20:49, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your message - its always better to discuss these things through, and you make more friends! I believe it was one of the highest fee's ever paid for a Playboy Centrefold model - not that I am a subscriber or an expert on this matter. Let me do some more investigation on that one - I have collected some references, but not one's I am fully happy with. My point on the artciles discussion page was: "How many super models do you know who have appeared in Playboy?" which is why she was paid so much. Hence why I believe inclusion of the image, much as though I hear your "fairuse" point, is allowed under the "illustrate a specific point" clause of Point8, which the words would not fully do/some readers would not believe without pictorial back-up. I am not a fan of gratuitous nudity, and believe that as a "family"/end user un-controlled orientated use media, Wiki should minimise use of such images/publications. But I do believe in this case it is worthy/allowed inclusion in the article.

<li>Hello Abu, thanks for your question. I don't think pictures are really needed on any articles at all. However, I think that one is as useful to that article as most pictures here. Her modelling for Sports Illustrated was certainly very important to her career. I see no reason we should not include a picture of her famous 25th anniversary Sports Illustrated cover in a discussion of that career. As I understand the law, the image is legal to use because it is small in size and small as an overall portion of the work. Since it is useful and legal, I don't see why we'd want to take it out. If we look at it another way, we could create an article specifically about that issue and how that issue was important to Kathy Ireland's career. Surely no one would object to the use of the image in such an article. However, there would certainly be calls to merge that new article into <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathy_Ireland_08f9.html" title="Kathy Ireland">Kathy Ireland</a>.

<dd>Well, some inclusionists would argue that Wikipedia does not have a specific policy that something has to be "notable". They would argue that if the topic is sufficiently important to be "verifiable" by reputable sources then it is necesarily fit for inclusion in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Some "mergists" would argue that the information belongs in Wikipedia, but that it should be merged into Kathy Ireland or Sports Illustrated. "Merge" seems to me to be the most common outcome of AfD's these days. That is why I think it makes sense to look at this as a hypothetical case where the articles have been merged. The logic path is: (1) the image is clearly fair use in an article about the issue of the magazine (2) the issue of the magazine relates to Kathy Ireland and content about that issue could be merged to her article (3) Regardless of how we title the article ("Kathy Ireland" or "SI 25th anniversary swimsuit issue" or "Depictions of swimsuits on the cover of sports magazines", the title does not change the fact that the picture is going alongside description/analysis of the issue in question.</dd>
<dd>I think this is on very firm ground not only in law but in Wikipedia policy. For example, WP:FU states "However, if that magazine issue itself is notable enough to be a topic <b>within</b> the article, then fair use may apply." (emphasis added).</dd>
<dd>I think that the 25th anniversary issue was notable enough to her career to include in the text about Ireland. Following WP:FU, that means that fair use could apply to the magazine cover <b>within</b> the article on Ireland.</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry to hear you feel that way. In a way I agree with you though. The image is helpful to the article. Whether we have to jump through some hoops to keep it is a matter of the beuracracy that we have created for ourselves as a project. I guess we should look on the bright side.

<p>Abu badali, if you continue to remove images from the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heathers.html" title="Heathers">Heathers</a> page and any other page on Wikipedia for that matter, you'll be blocked. I see this isn't the first time you've ran into trouble with removing content/images from Wikipedia, and if you continue it then you'll be blocked from Wikipedia for good.

<p>Hi Abu. I would rather discuss with you about appropriate links for the <a href="../../../g/i/s/Gisele_Bundchen_3b04.html" title="Gisele Bundchen">Gisele</a> article rather than having a link-off war. According to the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#Occasionally_acceptable_links" title="Wikipedia:External links">guidelines</a> for wikipedia it is appropriate to have a link to fan sites listing. The <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/giselebundchen" class="external text" title="http://www.squidoo.com/giselebundchen" rel="nofollow">Squidoo</a> lense is not my personal site and does not promote me. It is an regularly updated, appropriate web site which is used to keep track of interesting links and information relating to the subject matter.</p>
<p>If the <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/giselebundchen" class="external text" title="http://www.squidoo.com/giselebundchen" rel="nofollow">Squidoo</a> lense is not the best fan site listing then I encourage you to find a better one and let's use that. --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathweaver_f19b.html" title="User:Heathweaver">User:Heathweaver</a></p>

<dd>I see completely see where you are coming from (even though from your remarks and from the comments to you above I think you act as a bit of a purist and maybe go a little too far); but, after looking over the guidelines of Wikipedia links for fansites I think this issue is very gray. Quoting again: In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. (Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)</dd>

<dd>As the creator of the Squidoo lense I am, of course, bias; but, I don't see any really great fan sites that would be worth linking.

Maybe we could request for a consensus of which additional site to list that would serve this purpose.</dd>

<p>If you don't like his confrontational attitude, I suggest you vote to oppose it as I did. I have been contributing numerous articles on wikipedia dealing with the 1920's and early 1930's. This person has literally driven me away from wikipedia because he refuses to let me place a public domain image on the 1930s article that illustrates how fashion became more conservative in that decade and how long skirts became in 1930 whereas the year (1929) before they had been worn above the knee. This person (Abu badali) has me banned and I will no longer be contributing to wikipedia. I had hoped to complete the articles on all of the early Technicolor films produced in 1929-1933 as well as numerous articles on the early talkies. Unfortunately, due to his confrontational attitude and unwillingless to help me correctly tag the image I am no longer going to contribute to wikipedia. I think it will be a mistake if you make this person an administrator as he will only drive away people who are only trying to improve wikipedia and contribute articles to it.

<p>While I totally agree with your removal of those two images, you really shouldn't mark edits like that as "minor".

<p>Hi, Zanimum for the good work checking sources for the Gisele article. And thanks for updating the info on Image:Taxi2004.jpg. But still about this screenshot, I'd like to hear your opinion... do you belive the <a href="../../../g/i/s/Gisele_B%C3%BCndchen_c104.html" title="Gisele Bündchen">Gisele Bündchen</a> article needs this unfree image? The image doesn't seem to add much information about the movie... it's just an image of Gisele, and we have <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Gisele_Bundchen" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Gisele_Bundchen" rel="nofollow">lots of free images available for Gisele</a>. Don't you think we can get rid of it? What's the role of this image in the article?

<dd>I don't know. It is a different aspect of her life that isn't portrayed in any of our free images. I'd personally keep it for now, but keep a strong hand on any other images uploaded, since we do indeed have a surprising wealth of Creative Commons images available to us. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a> 15:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see. But what bothers me is this use of unfree images when we have lots of good quality free ones. The "movie career" is undoubtedly something that deserves mentionning, due to its peculiarity, but I don't see how what that image adds any new information. It's just "Gisele". And we already have so many "free Giseles". Would you have any objection if I remove the image? --<a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu Badali</a> 15:53, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have any objection to you removing the image, and I'll personally deleted it as a fair use orphan if you do. However, it does show she's "not just a pretty face", but can emote, something not really seen elsewise. Perhaps ask for another opinion on the village pump. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a> 15:57, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Did you revert my change to the Pele article because you thought I had restored the copvio picture? I didn't restore the copyvio picture, I restored an older picture than used to be on the page. Granted, this second picture is the subject of unknown provenance but it is not copyvio as far as I know. Could you restore my edit if you were mistaken? If you weren't, and were removing my edit as per policy (perhaps because the picture's dubious provenance means it cannot be in the article), then please accept my apologies. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Kemp_db60.html" title="User:James Kemp">Jim</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames_Kemp_4cf0.html" title="User talk:James Kemp">Talk</a>) 20:33, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, and thanks for contacting me.</p>
<p>I wonder what is wrong with the image you have orphaned now <b>twice</b>. Had your message to me not read, <i>If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. <b>You may add it back if you think that that will be useful</b></i>, I would have contacted you beforehand.</p>
<p>You may have realized that I put it in an article on Hester Prynne rather than Demi Moore, although either would have been legitimate: The photo does show Hester Prynne, a fictional character, doesn't it?</p>
<p>What do you want? Have one third of all the images on Wikipedia deleted?</p>

<dl>
<dd>Please stop that crusade of yours. It's bordering on the ridiculous. I've just been reading your current talk page, and you seem to have a long history of antagonising other contributors. Please get your priorities right. You'll hardly get any reward for this activity, whether within this community or outside. Wikipedia is a <b>collaborative</b> effort, and most of the things to be achieved here can be achieved through teamwork. Let us not work <b>against</b> each other.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As you correctly remark somewhere, you do not have absolute authority over what is going on here. Even the guidelines you so strictly adhere to are—you won't believe it—man-made (i e open to discussion and change) rather than God-given. Willing executioners, unconditionally obedient to a "real," imagined, or usurped authority, have not always played a laudable role in history.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know how old you are or what you do for a living, but you might want to check your actions here against your decisions in real life. Concerning Wikipedia, if you lay off for, say, a couple of weeks, other contributors will fill in for you if the task you're performing right now is really an urgent one. I suppose monitoring the gallery of new files to see if some newbies have uploaded copyrighted images or vanity photos or other contentious or unacceptable material is very necessary, but removing screenshots and magazine and book covers from articles after they have stayed there for months, if not years, should not be our priority.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, consider that there is such a thing as compromise. For example, instead of removing an image (usually without discussing it, which makes people put it back again in the first place) we could keep it and add a more detailed fair use rationale. (Some of the images I have listed have one.) Being confrontational and co-operative are not mutually exclusive, are they?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Baldness Treatments</span></h2>
<p>Don't understand the objections. The page I link too is not commercial and just contains a bunch of links to scientific papers, patents, etc. It is pretty benign compared to what else is on the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldness_treatments.html" title="Baldness treatments">baldness treatments</a> page. Also, with millions of out-going links from Wikipedia diluting page rank to nothing, a link to a particular website does no good with Google rank.

<dd>Are you in any way related to that site? If so, you should avoid posting links to it. Also, collections of links are rarely a good external resource. It's preferable to link to the real object instead. --Abu Badali 14:54, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps we interpret the rules differently. You shouldn't link to commercial pages. But where does it say you cannot link to non-commercial ones, review articles, etc.? Similarly, links to pages summarizing links are a lot tidier than listing each link individually. Pproctor 15:46, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dispute your removal of the screencapture of Kate Winslet as under the fair use rules it is perfectly acceptable as a participant in the film qualifies as part of "its contents".
