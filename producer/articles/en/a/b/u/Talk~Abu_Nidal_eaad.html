<p>Hi Grace Note, thanks for the edit. I think the <i>fedayeen</i> who became Black September were actually within Fatah, not just associated with it, though you're right to say the latter is probably safer and more NPOV. I can't find anyone to quote to you because I'm sitting here with half a dozen books open doing the rewrite, and now that I need it, I can't find the right place. They weren't just Fatah, though: they came from the entire rejection front: DFLP, PFLP, and later PFLP-GC, and as I hope to go on to say, the Abu Nidal group. If I can find the source, I'll put it here for you. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:02, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please note the following from <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_September_3efa.html" title="Black September">Black September</a>, added to that article by an editor called, let me see, erm, SlimVirgin seems to be the chap:</p>
<p>"In his book Stateless, Saleh Khalaf (Abu Iyad), who was Arafat's chief of security and a founding member of Fatah, wrote that: "Black September was not a terrorist organization, but was rather an auxiliary unit of the resistance movement, at a time when the latter was unable to fully realize its military and political potential. <i>The members of the organization always denied any ties between their organization and Fatah or the PLO.</i>" (my emphasis).<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:23, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I know that Benny Morris, the Israeli historian, has said BS were largely Fatah (and he is fairly even-handed). Mohammed Daoud, who says he led the Munich operation for BS, says they were Fatah (and he definitely was), and I believe (though I can't currently find it) that Patrick Seale says it too, using Abu Iyad as his source, but I'll have to check this. But I'm fine with associated anyway. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:30, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Arre, just a small point: we're not supposed to wikify years on their own. People do it because they think the Manual of Style advises it, but in fact it advises not to.

<p>I reverted Marsden's deletion of Seale, because he's Abu Nidal's best known biographer, a highly respected mideast expert, and the comment is attributed. He doesn't need to be a psychoanalyst to recognize that Abu Nidal was a psychopath, certainly in layman's terms and probably clinically, and that his childhood may have had something to do with it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:42, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What is the point of attributing the opinion to Seale if the opinion is only at layman's level? If a layman, such as the typical Wikipedia reader, can reach the conclusion based on the evidence, then shouldn't the article just present the evidence rather that giving an opinion from someone who has no particular expertise on the matter himself? Fill out the evidence, Slim. A psychologist's opinion that Abu Nidal is a psychopath would be encyclopedic; Seale's opinion on the matter is worth no more than any typicel reader's. There is no lack of evidence of Abu Nidal's behavior that any reader might use to decide -- with as much professional authority as Patrick Seale -- what manner of person Abu Nidal was. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 02:04, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, I take it that the "He later came to despise women" statement is from Seale. Please make that clear. This does not require a professional opinion, but it is clearly more encyclopedic to indicate where a particular judgement comes from. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 02:08, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I assume you've stalked me here, so you'll forgive me for finding it hard to assume good faith. Patrick Seale is one of two biographers of Abu Nidal whose work is regarded as the gold standard on him. For that reason, if he says in his book that, in his opinion, evidence suggests that Abu Nidal always wanted to be a ballerina, we may put that into the article, so long as we attribute it. We find respected experts in the field, and then we run with what they say. We don't pick and choose which aspects of the subject we personally regard them as experts on, because that would be original research. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:10, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Deciding that Abu Nidal always wanted to be a ballerina does not require or imply a professional opinion; deciding that Abu Nidal is psychopathic and that this is likely due to his unhappy childhood does. And anyway, there is already a quote from the Guardian, which clearly is not an authority on psychology, that he had become a psychopath; it is not so clear that Seale isn't either, though in fact he isn't. The article shows his adult behavior and his childhood situtation. Truly, Slim, the article is better if you don't try to steer the reader to a particular interpretation based in no more expert authority than the reader himself can supply -- what do you think when you read an article that tries to point you to conclusions? My reaction is generally to wonder whether or not the basic facts themselves haven't been massaged, and I'm sure I'm not alone in this. Don't let your animus lead you to making the article less good than it could be. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 02:31, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Every single authoritative source on Abu Nidal comments on his psychopathic personality, and speculates as to the reasons because it was so marked in him. He operated with no hint whatsoever of conscience, personal allegiance, loyalty, love, or respect for any other human being so far as those who knew him are aware. He suspected even his own wife of working for the CIA. Journalists; academics; members of his organization; Arab, Israeli, and Western intelligence officers; members of other Palestinian groups: they all said the same thing about him. It would be obtuse to leave it out of this article. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:46, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What do you suppose an expert in psychology would do that everyone else who knew him hasn't done? You seem to think a diagnosis of psychopathic personality disorder is a finely tuned instrument. It's quite the opposite. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:12, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, my inexpert guess is that an expert in psychology would pretty quickly decide that Abu Nidal had a paranoid personality disorder, which is far more consistent with his behavior (I think) than an antisocial personality disorder. And easier to diagnose, I would also think, because it requires a less thorough understanding of his internal mental state. Are you certain that you understand what an antisocial (psychopathic) personality disorder implies? I can't imagine how you could think it would be easily diagnosed. I encourage you to do a very little research on the matter if you think I'm wrong. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 04:25, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for finding this. We can certainly add it as a view along with Seale's.

<p>It seems clear even to my inexpert eyes that Abu Nidal really wasn't a "psychopath" -- there are worse things in the world than a "psychopath." Abu Nidal pretty clearly had a severe paranoid personality disorder, and this is largely incompatible with "psychopathy:" the paranoid views other people as powerful, motivated, and adversarial; the "psychopath" views them as pieces of furniture. The term "psychopath" has a journalistic sense that is inaccurate, and this is clearly the sense in which the Guardian used the term, and probably the sense in which Seale used the term (if he even used it -- are we sure that some Wikipedian didn't paraphrase his actual words? A direct quote, given that what is attributed to Seale now is likely wrong, would be better.). But encyclopedic standards should be higher than journalistic standards; someone called a "psychopath" in an encyclopedia ought verifiably to have traits consistent with an antisocial personality disorder. Anyway, it's on your head, Slim. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 13:47, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just went to add something using the article you linked to as a source (from military.com), but it's currently off-line.

<p>Is "ruthless terrorist" a factual observation?<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhase1_1e2e.html" title="User:Phase1">Phase1</a> 23:46, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Quite clearly it is not a factual observation. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagabund_aa69.html" title="User:Magabund">Magabund</a> 10:45, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, I would like to suggest using less charged word than "terrorist", like "militant" or smth (yes, I believe that he was a mercenary who essentially stamped others operations, but charged words do not help). Second I wanted to point out that sentence "The al-Banna family lost their orange groves, which were confiscated by the new Israeli government, and fled to the al-Burj refugee camp in Gaza" does look a bit vague. If we talk abot "ruthless terrorist" then sure we should talk about ruthless enemies who expelled this guy from home when he was a child. So what exactly happened to their home? Did jews expel them? Did jews rob them of their belongings? Etc. those questions should be better answered. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagabund_aa69.html" title="User:Magabund">Magabund</a> 10:54, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you have a reputable source for those details, by all means provide it. As for the word "terrorist," I use it sparingly, but in this case, he was as a matter of cold, hard fact regarded by pretty well everyone, Arab and non-Arab alike, as a ruthless terrorist, so it would be somewhat obtuse of us to hunt around for a kinder word. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 11:36, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
