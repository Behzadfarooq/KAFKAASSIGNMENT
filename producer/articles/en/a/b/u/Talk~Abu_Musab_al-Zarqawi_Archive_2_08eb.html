<p><a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComandante_c3ab.html" title="User:Comandante">User:Comandante</a> changed "terrorist" to "Islamist militant" in the first paragraph, User:Jgofborg called that "vandalism" and changed it back. "Islamist militant" is far more precise and less loaded then either of the terms discussed above, "terrorist" or "freedom fighter", so I'm about to revert again to Commandante's edit. It's not like Commandante completely purged the word "terrorist" from the article to make an ideological statement, but I think (s)he's suggested a better word choice for the intro. Please respond here with your reasoning if you object. --<a href="../../../d/o/w/User%7EDowcet_5242.html" title="User:Dowcet">Brian Z</a> 03:54, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On reflection, I can accept that - however, if you check out many of his other contributions which serve to trivialize or even remove the word terrorist from generally-accepted terrorists and incidents, you can see why I missed this as a possibly-valid change. This user's ideology and contributions perhaps made me overly suspicious, I'll admit that, and that this is a good call. JG of Borg 04:03, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>BTW, the intro needs cleanup - some more of which I'll do later... it really jumps around and repeats a lot (words like violence, etc)... JG of Borg 04:11, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I suppose it's OK to use some other word than "terrorist", but I would deeply object to using "Islamist militant" instead. It lends the cachet of Islam to this man's activities, and associates Islam with his actions. <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyland_7ffd.html" title="User:Shyland">Shyland</a> 19:23, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"Islamist militant" is far more precise and less loaded then either of the terms discussed above, "terrorist" or "freedom fighter"". This is a completely false statement. It is used by people and media sympathetic to the causes of terrorists. And as far as Islam being associated with the actions of Al Zarqawi, this is correct because Islam promotes violence in order to spread the religion. Read the Koran if you do not believe me.</dd>

The whole article needs cleanup. This is the worst page I've ever seen on Wikipedia.--216.110.81.34 18:48, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks user who doesnt have an account, I believe this article is actually pretty decent but there could be some clean up. As for Islamic Militant I would argue he is more of a terrorist then many Islamic militants as he has killed Civilians who are muslim by the THOUSANDS. He is a terrorist pure and simple.<a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJTaylorCU_4224.html" title="User:JTaylorCU">Jeffrey</a> 04:18, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah...whoever is going to such lengths to create questions about US involvement in Iraq: This is the wrong page for it. Furthermore, the person first states that the knife-wielder in the Nick Berg video is not Zarqawi (based on accent and other things), and then states that US intelligence claiming that Zarqawi recieved a prosthesis in Iraq was faulty intelligence, based on the fact that the man identified as Zarqawi in the Nick Berg video had no prosthesis. Someone is pushing a viewpoint at the expense of facts and quality writing. Jamesg 19:15, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Some user(s) keep changing militant, paramilitary, guerrilla etc. to terrorist. I don't go through the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contras.html" title="Contras">Contras</a> article and fill that with the word terrorist, despite the fact that the Nicaraguan Contras overwhelmingly targeted civilians.</p>
<p>And no one in the Western media seems to refer to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serb.html" title="Serb">Serb</a>-backed paramilitaries in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnia.html" title="Bosnia">Bosnia</a> (or the separatist Bosnian Muslim and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatia.html" title="Croatia">Croatian</a> security forces for that matter--from the Serb POV at least) as "terrorists"--possibly because they're considered more "army"-like in organisation or there was a "war" going on (isn't there a war in Iraq now?), despite their rampant ethnic cleansing</p>
<p>This is presumably why the <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebenica.html" title="Srebenica">Srebenica</a> <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre.html" title="Massacre">massacre</a> is not referred to as a terrorist attack, although it seems to qualify by most definitions: it was political violence against civilians by persons who were not official members of the Yugoslav National Army, but instead were Serb-backed insurgents against the Bosnian Muslim government (as recognised by the West).</p>
<p>The unqualified use of the perjorative word "terrorist" isn't good practice in an encyclopedia. The meaning of the word is just too slippery and filled with bias. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingal86_6781.html" title="User:Kingal86">Kingal86</a> 21:47, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

why do some american news persons (or others on tv) pronounce it "zuh-KAH-wee"? it's like brooklyn r-drop. that pronunciation is like a character out of a 40's or 50's film or something. There are funny rules for pronouncing the names of prominent militant- or terrorist-types. half the people can't seem to pronounce <i>zawahiri</i> either. it's weird. <a href="../../../k/z/z/User%7EKzzl_8d54.html" title="User:Kzzl">Ka-</a><font color="red">zizzl</font><a href="../../../p/h/o/Phono.html" title="Phono">Mc</a> 04:22, 27 April 2006 (UTC)<br />

<p>I guess the argument on how to pronounce his name would have more strength if he were alive to complain, but come on! when the word "france" and "paris" are pronounced correctly [frahns] and [pahree} then we can really argue about this, too. get over it.</p>

<p>Interesting how the Western (or at least Anglo-American) media show Arab corpses (e.g. Zarqawi, Hussein brothers, dead guerrillas, murdered prisoners) and not Western corpses (e.g. dead US soldiers, beheaded civilian hostages). Especially considering US outrage at Al Jazeera showing dead American troops.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is to provide proof of their (Uday/Qusay/Zarqawi) death</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes I know this particular Arab, Zarqawi, was a twisted fascist (i.e. anti-Shia) mass-murderer (and Saddam's sons were nasty pieces of work) and showing hostages being decapitated would be horrific and appalling. But I'm sure I remember seing a dead (possibly murdered) Iraqi prisoner wrapped in plastic on the news, and I'm sure his family would find that appalling and horrific.</p>
<p>And a lot of prisoners held by the occupation forces and "Iraqi Interior Minister" (i.e. Shia militias/death squads) are civilians innocent of political violence or common criminal activity--as innocent as Western civilians taken hostage by Zarqawi's thugs. And some of the thosands who are held without charge, trial or POW status have been beaten or tortured to death by their captors (which probably hurts more than being decapitated by Zarqawi's men). <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingal86_6781.html" title="User:Kingal86">Kingal86</a> 21:39, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>LOL, you are effectively claiming that NPOV is liberal. Remember the saying "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"? To me and you it's a fact that Zarqawi is a terrorist. But others reject that entirely. Therefore terrorist is not a neutral description, so you should not be asking for it. Militant is a good word to use. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETale_437b.html" title="User:Tale">Tale</a> 08:29, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>66.194.72.10 07:11, 9 June 2006 (UTC) Just a guess, and I'm no expert, but I'd say it was a 30 meter airburst from a Guided Mobile Missile Launch System. an airburst would pick up alot more dust over a wide area, hence the huge dust plumes. This would also account for alot of the trees still standing afterwards and a smaller crater -----&gt; Supermanagain. This would also account for the condition of the corpse. If a gps and a laster guided bomb both hit the house, there wouldn't be a corpse left, but an airburst would topple and crumble almost any structure, leaving a corpse to be found, kinda in the condition it was found in, a recognizable body for identification. but I could be wrong. not trying to be a consiracy theorist.</p>
<p>of course there's no reason why a gps or laser guided bomb couldn't be used as an airburst.</p>

<p>claims that a woman and child have died as well. How old was he?</p>
<p><br />
This puts a stain on this 'victory', I was happy to hear he himself was no longer a threat, but now I have doubts. One might argue whether one nameless kid wasn't worth saving so many other lifes, but you won't see me cheer anymore at all.</p>
<p>No it does not. An eight year old child would kill your infidel behind just as Zarqawi would. He was allied with this network and is an unfortuate but necessary casualty in the killing of Abu Musab, who has killed hundreds by his own hand, an inspired thousands more. It is a victory and the two other deaths are collateral damage necessary to win a conflict.</p>

<p>And the issue continues to be unresolved. The Zarqawi autopsy reports still claim he's dead, but dead men issue no statements regarding the circumstances of their supposed death. Usually, information from Islamist sources regarding the death of key personnel is more reliable than that issued by Pentagon sources; probably because for the latter, only the death of these individualks has propagandistic value, whereas for the former it can be spun to their satisfaction either way. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 16:25, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow, what an incredibly jaded reaction. Look, this is a globally significant event in which less than a half-dozen people were killed. It is therefore reasonable, from a stylistic point of view, to include some details about the other people concerned (i.e. ages, connection to Zarqawi). If 200 people were killed, it would be unreasonable to require specific details about them all, because that would be disruptive to the general goal of the article, which is about Zarqawi.</dd>

<dd>Followers of islam may not desecrate their body; that stems from the old testament, also a belief held by orthodox jews and christians.

<dd>He has not been an orthodox Muslim for all his life, just as GW Bush was not an evangelical Christian for most of his life. Zarqawi seems to have cared little about religion until he did time in the bin in his late teens or so. I guess it is not unusual for a Jordanian gangbanger to sport some tattoo, and removing it would certainly desecrate his body. Besides, some of the more radical Wahhabis claim that living a jihadist's life to the fullest does away with some of the moral tenets. Kinda like a general absolution; cf. some 9-11 hijackers partaking to alcohol and loosely-clad girls. AFAIK, Muhammed Atta held that particular view. Zarqawi, IONO, but at least it is possible; he certainly had the odd discussion with such people back in his Afghanistan days. at any rate, it is not impossible and given the man#s background, it may be quite likely even. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 12:54, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A thing on CNN said that when he was a young thug in Jordan he got a tattoo and drank alcohol, and only later became ultra-conservative. They interviewed a guy who was in jail with him, and he said that Zarqawi's story was that he woke up hung over one day and decided that he felt so sick because he had strayed from the path of God, and from that day forward became a religious zealot. It sounded kind of apocryphal to me, but it's certainly believable that he was a renegade as a young man. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 21:59, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Major General William Caldwell said Wednesday night was the first time US forces had "definite unquestionable information" they could strike Zarqawi without causing collateral damage to civilians .... US ground forces identified six persons that had been killed in that strike at that time. The dead included a woman and a child."</p>
<p>You see they contradict one of their words with the other. There was no collateral damage, cause woman and kids are combattants or what? If they really care about civilians, they would send a helicopter green beret commando instead of aerial bombardment, so they could select whom they kill. This kind of behaviour will only earn USA more hatred and resistance, just like napalm did in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Really? Women can’t be terrorist? What about the young boys (10-14) in several Africa conflicts I suppose they didn’t kill anyone with a gun as part of a “military action”. They are after all children and we have no details on age or sex of this child. They could be 16 for all we know, but I suppose you would hate the US anyway. I guess this gives you an excuse to hate anyway.</p>

<p>It seems unlikely a woman was a militant in Zarqawi's Islamist extremist group--not very feminist are they? (Although there have been female Palestinian suicide bombers). Although there are child soldiers, I think there's a difference between blowing up a child who probably isn't a combatant (and who doesn't pose an immediate threat even if he is) as part of a missile assassination, and killing an armed child soldier in self-defence.</p>
<p>If they sent a commando squad in, they could have attempted to capture Zarqawi and his associates, rather than just kill them (although they might have died in a firefight or blown themselves up). It's pretty hard to avoid "collateral damage" when you assassinate your enemies by dropping massive bombs from the air. If the same were done to the White House or 10 Downing St., the innocent families of the warlords Bush and Blair would perish as well. (Along with security forces personnel and ordinary employees).</p>
<p>Given Bush's (and especially Cheney's) enthusiam for torturing prisoners, I'm surprised they didn't try to capture Zarqawi. He's already sentenced to death in absentia in Jordan for bombings of civilians, so they could always have given him to them after they were finished "interrorgating" him. Or handed him to the (Shia-dominated) "Iraqi government" who would probably execute the butcher of Shia civilians and on the spot. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingal86_6781.html" title="User:Kingal86">Kingal86</a> 22:35, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Zarqawi himself has used female militants in his raids - such as the woman he intended to use to detonate a suicide charge in the Jordanian wedding. Collateral damage can be basically defined as causing unintended civilian damage in a strike. People in a safe house conspiring with Zarqawi do not count as collateral damage. Furthermore, it has been verified that there was no child in the safe house, that was an initial mistake. Ezedriel</p>

The US describes the bombing as "targetted killing", which is just another way to say "assassination". <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 12:57, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, the U.S. has been 'officially' at war with Iraq since 1991. They never 'un-declared' after the first Gulf War.

<dd>I actually agree as I'm still wondering where those <a href="../../../w/m/d/WMD_f3b3.html" title="WMD">WMDs</a> are but until an international tribunal is declared to hear a case against the United States, prima facie this was an act of war. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 13:06, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, he was not assasinated, as it also was not a surprise attack. It also does not conform to the "civilian" or "normal" thought of an assasination (dagger in the dark, or the like). I'd more have thought about it as "blowing the hell out of his building" but thats just my 2 cents...195.26.43.146 15:26, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It decidedly was a surprise attack - I daresay he wasn't expecting it - and I don't think just because this is the middle of a war, the word "assassination" is inappropriate. When the leader of a group is specifically targeted and killed, I'd call that an assassination. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraft_fc33.html" title="User:Graft">Graft</a> 17:40, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"When the leader..." - I wonder what exactly is the difference to this case, except if rumours are true, al-Z. was not really the "leader" of anything anymore. Basically it depends on whether one thinks "assassination" is a peacetime concept; it is at any rate obvious that the US tried to get their intel right, that the whole operation was designed to avoid civilian casualties as much as possible, and that the target of the whole act was the killing of this one person. "Targetted killing" sounds a bit like newspeak to me; I favor the old-fashioned "assassination". And why not? Guess that apart from the man's family and immediate associates there won't be a sad soul on the planed. Even Mullah Omar's response was rather muted.

<dd>No, no, I didn't refer to the "Mission Accomplished" banner at all, but to the phraseology "end of major hostilities". In that, he was clearly mistaken, albeit this is easy to say with the benefit of hindsight. Analysis of the "post-war" planning (or lack thereof) at that time certainly indicated that major trouble was still going to come, but it <i>might</i> have been averted.

<p>Of course he was assassinated. He was specifically targeted and killed in a safe-house (where he may or may not have been unarmed), not on a battlefield. Whether it was a legal act of warfare against a combatant or not doesn't change whether it was an assassination.</p>
<p>In a war, an armed general who specifically targeted by an enemy soldier because of who he is personally (not just because he is an armed enemy) is still assassinated, even though killing him was lawful. The BBC routinely refers to similar "targeted killings" of Palestinian militants by the Israeli air force as assassinations. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingal86_6781.html" title="User:Kingal86">Kingal86</a> 22:41, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's still more fuzzy than that.

<dd>Because Nelson happened to prance through the sniper's sights. The sniper was not specifically assigned to kill Horatio, but the F-16 pilots were specifically assigned to kill Zarqawi (though they almost certainly were not told until long after they dropped the bombs).

<p>The end of major hostilities *has* ended. Guerilla warfare is not classified as a "major hostility". There have been no battles with an organized military structure since his declaration, thus his claim has been exactly right. Ezedriel</p>
<p>Another thing I would like to point out is that a document titled a "Declaration of War" isn't required to allow the legitimate killing of enemy combatants, yes, even targetted. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was not a figurehead of any political factions, he was not a civilian, he was a declared combatant and militant waging a guerilla war against the United States. Insurgents of any type are considered valid military targets. The dropping of bombs on a position that are known to be his with the intent to kill him is a military objective, without that personnel, it is believed that operations of a militant organization will be severely hampered, and thus he was targetted. He was no less legitimate than Osama bin-Laden or al-Zawahiri would be.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Real role in Iraq</span></h2>
<p>I think the "terrorist and guerilla attacks" section should be expanded and retitled "Role in Iraq" or somesuch. Now that many claims he was a plant or whatever can be laid to rest, morer reliable information can be added. For example his chastizing by as-Sawahiri in OCT/2005, or his apparent demotion to "soldier of jihad" (which is quite possibly a courteous way to say "we've had enough of you, now go and seek a martyr's death!") early APR/2006. By the way, despite the US claiming there willl be a guy nicknamed "the Egyptian" ("al-Masri") to succeed him, the April rumours quite clearly state that the matter was settled by making one <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_bin_Rashed_al-Baghdadi_eef5.html" title="Abdullah bin Rashed al-Baghdadi">Abdullah bin Rashed al-Baghdadi</a> Zarqawi's superior once and for all. The latter is a rather unknown figure (no images apparently exist), but this would not contradict a role as the big man behind the scenes (as was claimed by the US al-Zarqawi alwyas was, but in fact never seems to have been.) <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 12:57, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To clarify: the current section title does aptly describe the "active" part of his role in Iraq (apart from being an Wahhabi poster boy courtesy of the PSYOP campaign gone bad). But what his real "job", or rank, or influence, or whatever, was in Iraq should be discussed in the article, and it is nowhere to be found presently. For what it's worth, we can still only say that he's dead, that he had 2 real legs when he died, and apart from that it's a lot of "possibly"s or "maybe"s. I think his role in Iraq very well illustrates the basically "opt-in" nature of al-Qaeda - from what is known, Osama really was mighty pissed at this half-wit firebrand upstart caring about tactics not badly, but messing up precious strategy all ways to Ramadan by declaring any and all Shi'a legitimate targets. The best bet for how he came to be what he eventually became is own initiative followed by merely surviving and pulling off some acts of violence, then being blown out of proportion by the US. It does not seem that anybody entitled or tasked him with doing what he did, and it can be considered fairly certain (as certain as these things go) that many Islamist "celebrities" really are quite happy to see him dead, as he was a major nuisance for the vision of Osama et al. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 13:07, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Before (dates are tentative) 2004, Z. was a small-time do-no-gooder from a refugee slum, with substandard writing skills (his handwriting is known to have been a child-like scrawl). Then came the PSYOP camapign which was rather lucidly admitted to be an utter backfire (how many times have you seen top brass not only talking freely about a PSYOP campaign but also admitting it was an utter failure?) which kicked the man into the limelight. In fact, it seems that the concept of "al-Qaeda in Iraq" was originally invented by the Coalition. So, everyone's talking about that new al-Q. chapter down where things are heating up (2004 was NOT a good year to be a Jarhead), and Osama, quite cut off from exercising what little command authority he'd want to exercise, jumps on the bandwagon and gives Z. the official thumbs-up. Later on, during 2005, Z. becomes more rogue, demanding Shi'a muslims to be eradicated (which Osama would rather postpone until the "crusader" issue is settled) and bombing mosques - too radical even for Osama and his gang. So there comes the "dear son" letter from Zawahiri late in '05. Early in '06, the PSYOP blunder is revealed (not surprising anyone who has checked out the biography of Z. - out of his own capabilities, the man would never have become a leadership figure; he could kill some helpless dudes and scrawl some bad Arabic and beat up people, that's about it). Later on, in April '06, Z. is "officially" disposed (not entirely proven, but makes complete sense) and told to go shut up, take the ole AK and see that he goes down in a blaze of glory. The story here is better than John le Carré stuff and too twisted even for Forsyth to invent. Basically, 2 years ago the PSYOP efforts saved Osama a lot of hassle and work trying to figure out, without any decent on-the-ground information, whom to choose as his local poster boy, but half a year ago, he probably regretted his decision nearly as much as the Coalition's MIBs regretted theirs. Z. was a man who managed to piss off both CENTCOM and al-Qaida proper, as he played by nobody's book except his own, and that book was not well written in style nor in content. It seems that he never controlled more than a few dozen guys from his own group, but he <i>inspired</i> hundreds, even thousands maybe, courtesy of the CENTCOM once again "misunderestimating" the mindset of Sunni Iraqis and the Wahhabi sector of the <i>ummah</i> in general. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysmorodrepanis_31ab.html" title="User:Dysmorodrepanis">Dysmorodrepanis</a> 13:31, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please refute my timeline with FACTS instead of accusing me of saying things that I never said. That "Al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia is not an American (or Coalition) invention" is nothing but YOUR OWN interpretation (quotation marks mark a quotation, that is why I put them there!); I am perfectly aware that it is a genuine organization. However, <b>the name</b> "al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia" was <i>almost certainly</i> invented by some guys in the Green Zone or Washington DC. The group's original name was <i>Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad</i> which by itself does not contain any overt links to al-Qaeda (save maybe the reference to <i>tawhid</i>, which is a concept most aggressively propagated by the disciples of Qutb - that is to say, the "leadership" of al-Qaeda proper). Only <i>after</i> the PSYOP campaign picked up steam, they themselves used the al-Q. moniker.</dd>
<dd>Generally, the image of Zarqawi as a "terrorist mastermind" is extremely at odds with the known facts about his social and educational background. The most parsimonious explanation is that the PSYOP campaign designed to heighten the profile of JTJ and Zarqawi to make Iraqi Sunnis be taken aback by their violence - basically, an <i>ad hominem</i> campaign - resulted instead in turning him into an inspirational figure he would otherwise have been hard pressed to become, if such a "celebrity status" would in fact have been possible to achieve for him at all. From his known background, he was nothing more than a particularly unpleasant fanatic of comparatively minor importance and below-average intelligence, and not particularly well-connected outside exile-Jordanian terrorist circles before 2004. As a matter of fact, JTJ and Zarqawi in person are directly responsible for sidelining the secular-nationalist/ex-Ba'athist guerilla groups in al-Fallujah during the summer of 2004 (which was when the group first attracted my attention. I have tried to follow their development since then and believe me, it is <i>extremely</i> unlikely that they would have gained such an appeal from their own power. You seem to think that I claim JTJ to be an American construct. Nothing would be further from the truth. The truth, I do believe, is far less straightforward than you seem to think however. Intelligence operations CAN fail and the Iraq war, notably Zarqawi's numerous "deaths" before his actual demise, prove that they do fail, at least in this particular cultural environment, fairly often. The "al-Qaeda in Iraq" operation can indeed be most precisely described with one of the more famous Bushisms: "misunderestimation" - the Coalition's MIBs <i>mis</i>estimated the appeal that their campaign would have on many Iraqis and many more foreign volunteers, and they <i>under</i>estimated the damage caused by this misestimation (the emergence of a solid power base for Wahhabi fundamentalism in Iraq, which is something of an anomaly given the rather semi-secular/mainstream past of Sunni Islam in that country. al-Anbar governorate was a bit more open to these interpretations of the Quran, but still it was a far cry from e.g. Saudi Arabia. Not anymore.) They thought that laying the blame for any particularly shocking incident, as long as there were no better suspects, on JTJ/Zarqawi would create the image of a devilish individual that is a liability to everyone who'd dare to work with him. Instead, they built him into a person with celebrity status whose rather small group of followers (a fact readily available to any Iraqi who'd be interested to know about it) was able to take on the entire Coalition and the Baghdad boys single-handedly. It remains to be seen whether Zarqawi's death will have any lasting benefits for the Coalition, but as of now it seems that JTJ was indeed little but a shining front with a somewhat meager reality underneath. FWIW, I'd rather wager that the Shura Council is the real power in the Sunni militant scene of Iraq.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>When you say <i>"It would be just like the Bush administration to fail to even consider this contingency."</i>, don't you really mean the U.S. Military and not the Bush Administration?? It is the U.S. Military who handles day to day security operations in that region with little input from the Bush Administration. Bush is not consulted on the daily activities of the military security operations...that is left up to the Commanders in the field (as it should be). So when you, or anyone else, think it necessary to criticize those types of operational decisions...remember (as I'm sure you're fully aware) that you're criticizing the U.S. military. When someone says, <i>"I'm pissed that Bush hasn't found Osama yet"</i>...what they really mean is <i>"I'm pissed that the U.S. Military hasn't found Osama yet"</i> If you think Bush handles the day to day tactical operations involving the search for Bin Laden...then obviously you know nothing of the Military or the Intelligence Services.
<dl>
<dd>Bush was the one who order the attack on Afgahistan (basically), supposedly because they were harbouring Osama and refused to hand him over. However, Osama has still not been captured. Bush was also the one who ordered the invasion of Iraq (basically). Also, although I'm not an American so I don't follow these matters that carefully, I would assume from what I've seen and heard that Bush has appointed many of those in charge of the miltary and intelligence service. Therefore, the failure of these people to carry out their jobs properly rests partly on Bush. In special case such as this, one would also assume that Bush would be able to give specific instructions to ensure necessary action is taken. Of course, ideally this should not be necessary but as the person ultimately in charge of the miltary and intelligence service (AFAIK), in this special case it would be ideal. NB, none of this is not unique in the world. It is fairly common for leaders to be held accountable for the actions (and failures) of those under them, especially in miltary campaigns. Even more so when these leaders continue defend those under them despite apparent evidence to the contrary. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 04:16, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm aware that daily operations are not micromanaged by Bush himself or even by his top civilian advisors. But in a case like this (the protection of a witness and his family) it falls to the civilian leadership to make good and sure those on the ground take these steps. This is not an emergent battlefield situation, which is the only situation, really, in which the military is the initiator (and even that is only true of operations in support of a general directive such as "take Falluja" coming from Bush). So, I think it's valid to worry that the civilian leadership (which boils down to Bush) may again show its astonishing lack of foresight in reading the implications of its own actions. This has been a pattern from the very beginning, when Bush failed to realize that U.S. forces would become, in effect, a national police force in Iraq facing the kind of underground insurrection that world powers have always found nearly impossible to defeat (unless you go back to Roman times and the willingness to kill and maim on a massive scale even in the leading city of the occupied country). It's tempting to say Bush has forgotten the many lessons from history showing the failure of even major powers as longterm occupiers, but one wonders if Bush even knew these lessons in the first place. I'm no pacifist or kneejerk liberal, and I was in favor of the invasion. But it's very sad we could find no better leader than Bush, an unlearned man with (to be charitable) a moderate intelligence. With all the brilliant, capable people in this country, why is this man the decision-maker? <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 18:12, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Addressing Depiction of the Deceased:</span></h2>
<p>Since there has been two or three entries to the talk page concerning the decision to display Zarqawi's post-mortem face, I just thought that maybe I would offer a suggestion to aid the dilemma.</p>
<p>I myself have come across corpse images on wikipedia before, and once an article did depict a graphic corpse, so much ot that caused me to stay away from the random article option, for fear that an uncensored wikipedia would bring up another visual representation of the deceased being addressed by the article.</p>
<p>However, I did get over that. But that experience was just a mild symptom of necrophobia, I guess most people have experiences with the latter on the internet nowadays. Perhaps when seeking an image of google, one clicks on an image icon that as a thumbnail appears to be a tanned and skinny man taking a nap, but when enlarged, turns out to be a full sized image of a decomposed, mutilated cadaver. (www.rotten.com, etc.)</p>
<p>Google hasn't really addressed that issue, but we could try setting a rule that states that a warning banner has to be placed ...maybe.. what, 1 whole page length prior to an image of a corpse? Or if the article is less than a page long, have a warning banner informing the reader of graphic material, appear in lieu of the page, and the "back" and "proceed to article" icons?</p>
<p>IT could serve a similar purpose as the spoiler warningsfor articles written on movies that narrate climaxes and conflicts that could potentially ruin the experience of someone who hasn't watched the movie yet.</p>
<p>It could also serve as a warning for pornographic material further down the page. More conservative readers would come back to wikipedia after stumbling across articles regarding the human phallus for example, or the human anus.</p>
<p>This is my suggestion. Please, if you have a view on this suggestion, please make yourself heard. --<a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOttokarf_af8f.html" title="User:Ottokarf">Ottokarf</a> 02:14, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I respectfully disagree. The quote corroborates the NBC News report. The idea that the president might have deliberately not killed Zarqawi, if true, would be a blockbuster and certainly belongs in the article.

<dd>Relevence? Surely Zarqawi's interaction/relationship with the United States government was a significant aspect of his life. And the idea that the Bush administration secretly abstained from killing Zarqawi for political reasons doesn't require a "hypothetical conspiracy theory." "Conspiracy theory" in the pejorative sense doesn't include governments plotting covert action (or inaction). Only the very naive would doubt that this happens all the time. Conspiracy theories unworthy of consideration involve many different organizations — scientists at universities and research facilities around the world and many reputable news organizations, for example — secretly coordinating their actions.Keithq 10:22, 14 June 2006 (UTC) Keith

<dd>The question is "would it be included for the purpose of explaining Zarqawi's personality type or would it make sense to be a part of his bio?" The answer is most likely know. It can be put under a special section maybe specifically tagged as "theories about Zarqawi", but it seems only to be put there to support an odd ball conspiracy theory that the Bush Administration somehow neglected killing him. As it stands, I've heard enough theories about us never reaching the moon that a claim like that is absolutely unimportant to an overall bio, and strikes more as a "let's put this in here for an agenda", and agendas should not be the goals of biographies. --User:Ezedriel</dd>

<dd>No. That <i>would</i> be an “oddball conspiracy theory,” because it implies a conspiracy of silence among not only government officials who are expected, as part of their jobs, to keep even explosive information from the public, but also among astronauts and a large number of ordinary blue and white collar employees -- folks like my father, who was an aerospace engineer. Even now, thirty-five years later, no reputable news organization has reported that any of the many thousands of people involved in the various moon trips has come forward with a claim that it was fraudulent -- not even a single deathbed confession. Moreover, there’s no believable motive for faking the moon shots. Contrast that with the Zarqawi case. Here, there would be no reason for ordinary civilian employees to know the truth, only a small group of government officials whose stock in trade is clandestine operations. But after only a couple of years, two reputable news organizations reported independently that both current and former government officials have come forward with detailed information about the Administration choosing not to kill Zarqawi, information that includes a rational motive. The two cases are completely different in these critical ways. 12.72.193.232 23:47, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reward</span></h2>
<p>Keep your eyes open who gets the reward, I have a feeling somebody sang, probably because they were sick of all the killings within their own sects. It's possible one of the arrested insurgents told the 'coalition' he will talk providing he gets paid, so now nobody wants to admit and they will probably give money in secret and relocate the guy to iran or america... But somebody said something, that's for sure. IT'S TIME TO COME CLEAN AND KEEP PROMISES!</p>

<dd>I added the Rep Mark Kirk quote about reward payments. (<a href="../../../s/o/b/User%7ESobesurfski_33ff.html" title="User:Sobesurfski">Sobesurfski</a> 22:32, 15 June 2006 (UTC))</dd>
