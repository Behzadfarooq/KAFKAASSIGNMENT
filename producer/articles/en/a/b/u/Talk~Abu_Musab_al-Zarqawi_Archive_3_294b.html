<p>Well, the bloody photo of his, still very bloody, should be removed, there are many others we can replace it with, of course, this has no taste and will piss some people off...</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would agree that the photo is in bad taste. I also don't see how it serves any informational purpose. It's just his face with some blood on it. This article isn't about blood, and we don't need a photo to constitue "proof" he's dead, we have sources for that. I'm very disturbed by the recent American obsession with gloatingly showing gruesome images of slain enemy leaders (reference the NY Post's disgustingly tasteless cover on June 9th). Wikipedia should not take part in such a three-ring circus. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 03:53, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">Anome</a>, you've restored an image of Zarqawi's body which is equally unencyclopedic, uninformative, and inappropriate. You claim that the photo is needed to prove Zarqawi is really dead, but we don't have such a standard for any other article on a person who is dead that I know of. In fact, we <i>don't</i> need a photo to prove he's dead. Text will work just fine for that purpose. Therefore there is no encyclopedic <i>purpose</i> for including such a shocking and disturbing image. The image is extraneous, not to mention tasteless. It, and any other variants, should not be included. Regards, <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 09:37, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The picture is relevant since it is of itself part of the story: as a propaganda tool for the U.S. government, both for Iraqi consumption (to prove he really was dead) and for U.S domestic consumption (for political purposes). In addition, the U.S. government may have inadvertently created an iconic rallying image for Islamist extremists, helping create an image of Zarqawi as a martyr for their cause, which is a major PSYOPS own goal. All of this was commented on by the mainstream media at the time: see the cites I have provided. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 09:53, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm. I see that we should report on the propaganda issue, but is it necessary to include the image? Can't we just say "images of Zarqawi's body were used for propaganda purposes by the US and Al-Qaeda", source it with links, and be done? The image still doesn't actually contain any real information, and, since you raise the point of propaganda, it raises the real problem of Wikipedia becoming part of said propaganda efforts. When a different solution is easily available - a text-only description of the situation which is enecyclopedic - why should we choose an image-based solution that runs such risks? <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 17:36, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why, indeed? The decision whether to include an image ought to be based on whether the image is essential to telling part of the story of the article, or at least whether it adds something substantial to the discussion. It's becoming pretty apparent that those who are pushing for inclusion of this picture are intent on adding heat, not light, to the matter. This is related, in a distant way, to the "man from Mars" habit a lot of people have in this so-called encyclopedia of linking every term in an article, as if we didn't know what a (insert name of common object here) was. Same with this picture: I'm confident that all readers of this article can conjure up an image of a somewhat bloodied human head if need be. Otherwise, it adds nothing to the discussion, apart from satisfying morbid curiosity. ==<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 18:03, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I've gone ahead and removed the image for now. ILike2BeAnonymous and Pacific Coast Highway seem to be in agreement with me (at least, I <i>think</i> PCH is in agreement, his comment seems a bit vague). <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 08:17, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think we should include the picture. There is an entire section called 'Death'; showing his corpse would be highly relevant. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinnyweed_5519.html" title="User:Skinnyweed">Skinnyweed</a> 21:31, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Why? What information content does it carry? Anyone can lie down, put red fluid (cow's blood, perhaps) one one's face, close one's eyes, and be photographed. It would result in an equally "informative" image. Note that I am not claiming the image is a fake, or that Zarqawi is alive, or that the image doesn't show what it says it shows. I am saying that we don't need an image of his corpse to "prove" he is dead. The image doesn't prove anything, because you can't tell a person is dead from an image unless there is some obvious, visible massive trauma that could not be survived. And even <i>then</i> it would not be appropriate because it is extraneous, unneccessary. His death is fully explained by text. I am not in favor of censoring Wikipedia, but when there is no encyclopedic or informational purpose for an image that may be shocking, there is no justification for including it anyway. Additionally, as Anome has pointed out, the display of the image of Zarqawi's body has been part of propaganda efforts by both the U.S. and Al-Qaeda. Wikipedia should be a part of that. The image is inappropriate for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 22:41, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_Himmler_4919.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>'s dead body photo will need to be removed from his page as well, and also the image of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring_6dc0.html" title="Hermann GÃ¶ring">Hermann GÃ¶ring</a> dead in his cell. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, and "bad taste" is not a valid reason to have an image removed. It shows that he was indeed captured and is dead, which is an important point to make in the article. I'm going to re-add the image, at least for the purpose of reviving this discussion. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomf688_3308.html" title="User:Tomf688">tomf688</a> (<a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomf688_b319.html" title="User talk:Tomf688">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Tomf688_7179.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Tomf688">email</a>) 01:10, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, those images <i>should</i> be removed. And I understand and agree that WP is not censored; trust me, sometimes I have to wield WP:NOT like a cudgel defending pages like <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudity.html" title="Nudity">Nudity</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">Circumcision</a>, and <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">Sexual intercourse</a> from nice nellies, moralists, and other do-gooders.</dd>
<dd>So what's the difference? The images I defend on those pages are notable; they contain useful information content. They show something that no words could describe (at least, not easily). The images of Himmler's and Zarqawi's corpses have <i>no information content</i>. From all we can tell looking at those photos, they might merely be asleep. It's not possible to tell someone is dead from a photo unless there is some sort of obvious discoloration or massive trauma. Note that I am <i>not</i> claiming these men aren't dead. I am pointing out that the images do not <i>serve a purpose</i>. Therefore there is nothing to defend them against the charge of bad taste; there is nothing to give us a reason to continue to shock readers with them; all we are doing is shocking, not educating. If we want to prove Himmler and Zarqawi are dead, we cite a reliable source who says a three-word sentence: "(subjectname) is dead". Simple as that.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, there is the added complexity that both men are notable as being villains loathed by millions. It is important to avoid any appearance of Wikipedia joining in any particular nation's (such as America's) propaganda or PSYOPS efforts. This article itself notes that use of Zarqawi's image for propaganda purposes is well established. How then can we justify becoming (however unwillingly) a part of that propaganda, when we don't even have a compelling reason to show the image in the first place?</dd>
<dd>I've already made all these arguments before in this section, so either you didn't read them or you did read them and didn't find them sufficient. I'm anxious for your reply.

<dd>I agree. The conspiracy theorists claim lots of things and the more information that is collected and archived in the form of an encyclopedia, the less likely the nutjobs will be able to rewrite with absurd claims. Keep the photos so that we can show he is dead. It is illustrative and informative and historical. Not sure why anyone would propose deleting it. There are many works of art that depict a dead Jesus Christ with blood, crucifiction, torture, etc, etc, yet "good taste" is not a valid reason to destroy them or keep young children from seeing it. Yes, Jesus might have been just "asleep" but the image DOES serve a purpose. The Zarqawi and Himmler images also serve A purpose. Even if it is just to serve a propaganda purpose for the U.S. Government, it is a A purpose. WP is not censored even when the material would be considered propaganda. If it does not serve YOUR purpose it doesn't mean that it doesn't serve A purpose. Those photos were taken and released by the U.S. Government for a purpose. They are historical, and some might say the most important picture in Zarqawi's life. Keep them. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 07:23, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What purpose is served by the image that text cannot fulfill? We can say, using text, "Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is dead", and reliably source it. They say a picture is worth a thousand words... why do we need a picture to replace a mere five words, when the picture is a.) not necessary to explain the fact of al-Zarqawi's death, b.) is known to have been released for propaganda purposes, and c.) is gruesome and shocking?</dd>
<dd>Therefore, you are proposing that the photo contains <b>so much information</b> - information that, by your logic, could not be equally well expressed with text - that it is worth our taking part in a propaganda scheme <i>as well as</i> offending and revolting our readers. And yes, I know WP is not censored, but that doesn't mean we should go around inserting unnecessary shocking images and then claim they should be protected under WP:NOT. The image serves no useful purpose and is unencyclopedic. It should go. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 07:10, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I believe the "distastefulness" is a largely U.S. or Western centric view. It was specifically created and released to appeal to a highly distrustful Arab society. The "Arab street" is where the news is either believed or not and it doesn't matter what is said or written. The same reason that the U.S. released photos of Uday and Qusay Hussein is why they released photos of Zarqawi. Namely to convince the "Arab street" that they are dead with visual proof. The photos are historically relevant for this purpose alone. It is an admittedly overt attempt to convince the masses that he is dead and that is historically relevant for both its content and method. Not including the photo is trying to record history in a manner that didn't occur using Western sensibilities/morality. It was a <b>photo</b> that was used to convince the street, not words or a sentence. While a sentence may be adequate in Western countries to prove a leader is dead, it is not adequate for a world historical record of events such as wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 05:51, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're correct. He was a rival to bin Laden until 10/04. At that point he took the bayat; prior to that he may have been a "fellow traveller" of sorts, but he was a rival to the obl network.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Did the US make al-Zarqawi into the terrorist he was?</span></h2>
<p>As far as I am aware, al-Zarqawi was actually given a platform from which to launch his terrorist actions <i>by the US</i>; when Colin Powell cited him as the link between Al-Quaida and Saddam (which there is very little evidence that he was, if indeed there was a link <i>at all</i>, which looks increasingly unlikely), he gained enough influence and power to begin building his terrorist network, when beforehand he had been little more than a petty criminal. Correct me if I'm wrong here. I don't see anywhere in the article that this is mentioned (unless I missed it).</p>

<dd>Well, Mr. Duck. I'll correct you because you're mostly wrong. Zarquawi didn't make his fame because an American spokesman mentioned him. He made his fame with extraordinary showy brutality. He was a media master, not unlike Yasser Arafat, but much more pesonally brutal. He knew how to play the western press and do those things which would have the maximum effect in stirring anger, such as bombing Shi'a holy places. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 19:53, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He made his fame for being a thug long before bombing Shiite temples. And Ron is flat out wrong about Zarqawi above, and this has been pointed out to him over and over again. He was a rival to al Qaeda, not a member, until 2004, and he never worked with Saddam. Stephen Hayes would like us to believe that Zarqawi got his leg amputated by Saddam's surgeons with his knowledge. The OIF documents show that Saddam was not sure whether he was in Iraq at all. And it's pretty clear from his dead body that he doesn't have a prosthetic leg. Ron is simply spreading misinformation that he has been informed about already.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 04:25, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It should be pointed out that a video in late June 2006, Ayman al-Zawahiri praises Zarqwi as a "prince of martyrs".</p>
<dl>
<dd>It should also be pointed out that a power struggle within the ranks of al-Qaeda that results in the opposition being murdered would be rather embarassing (this would also be why he was "martyred" rather than just executed).

For about a month (as I recall) Zarqawi seemed to abide by their decision, but then he resumed his public role as leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq. A month or so later, he was dead, his location revealed by an informant. It is not unreasonable to conclude that the informant was acting on orders. The above almost certainly constitutes original research, but there are probably people other than me who have come to (and published) the same conclusion, which could be cited. I probably won't have time to look for sources, but hopefully somebody else does. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiMarshall_d5e9.html" title="User:WikiMarshall">WikiMarshall</a> 09:29, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Really???? I donÂ´t remember on any Western military forces before the War on Irak on the Islamic World, (he was a terrorist before this war).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd suggest doing some further historical research. Iraq was <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html#Modern_history" title="Iraq">founded by westerners</a>. Egypt was <a href="../../../s/u/e/Suez_Crisis_2713.html" title="Suez Crisis">invaded</a> by a coalition of western nations supporting Israel. To be blunt, the Middle East hasn't been entirely free of western meddling for centuries, and has had western military forces in it for generations. Saudi Arabia has relied on U.S. military aid for years now, and the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Saudi_Arabia_fee9.html#Terrorism" title="History of Saudi Arabia">stationing of American troops</a> in the "holy land" has infuriated many Islamists. I'm guessing this (the presence of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia) was, previous to 9/11, the largest single factor arousing the antipathy of people like Zarqawi.</dd>

<li>It has been argued that the image serves no encyclopedic purpose. It carries no information that cannot be expressed in the simple sentence, "Abu-Musab al-Zarqawi is dead". It does not constitute "proof" that he is dead, because the image is not sufficiently illustrative of cause of death. Further, there are no requirements on other articles of photos of the corpses of other famous decedents to establish their mortality.

<li>The image may be considered to be highly disturbing and shocking in nature. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is normally a defense against censorship, but, it has been argued, only in the case of images that provide information gains to the encyclopedia. It has been argued that, in this image's case, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> argues rather for the image's removal. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_experiment_in_anarchy" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a forum for unregulated free speech</a> apply. All images included in mainspace are expected to serve an encyclopedic purpose.</li>
<li>In response to the argument that the image itself is a matter of notability (in that it has been reported on or has historical notability), the following argument has been made: This is a matter for subjective opinion, and the argument for removal is that inclusion of text <i>mentioning</i> the image's propaganda/historical use would serve a purpose, but inclusion of the image <i>itself</i> would not outweigh the negative effects detailed above.</li>
<li>In response to the argument that, were the image to be removed, other images of the bodies of famous persons would also need to be removed, the following argument has been made: There is no reason why a blanket rule should prevail, or why one image should not be considered more informative or less shocking than another. Perhaps some other such images might considered sufficiently informative to outweigh their shocking nature. Therefore there is no reason to apply a general rule, when the editors on each article can come to their own consensus.</li>

<li>Keithq 18 September 2006 I see no encyclopedic purpose.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This image was released by the U.S. government regarding Zarqawi. It is like any other government document and is encyclopedic as it relates to Zarqawi regardless of whether some people find it distasteful - see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> Censored. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 05:35, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as (1) Wikipedia is not censored, (2) the photo is iconic, and (3) there is controversy surrounding the photo (i.e. as to whether its genuine) and it illustrates/provides evidence in that debate. - <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 04:16, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Keep the photo. He was a cold blooded murderer and he died a killers death.</p>
