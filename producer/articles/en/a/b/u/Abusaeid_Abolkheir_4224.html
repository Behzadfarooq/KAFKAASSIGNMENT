<p>The book, which is an important early Sufi writing in Persian, presents a record of his life in the form of anecdotes from a variety of sources and contains a collection of his words.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/u/Abusaeid_Abolkheir_4224.html" title="Edit section: Mysticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mysticism</span></h3>
<p>His <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysticism.html" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a> is a typical example of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Khorasan_3eb9.html" title="Greater Khorasan">Khorasani</a> school of <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufism.html" title="Sufism">Sufism</a>. He extracted the essence of the teachings of the past Sufis of this school (and to some extent other schools as well) and expressed them in a simpler, and in a sense deeper, form without the use of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>.</p>
<p>He held a special reverence for earlier Sufis, especially <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayazid_Bastami_6189.html" title="Bayazid Bastami">Bayazid Bastami</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallaj.html" title="Hallaj">Hallaj</a>. Moreover, in <a href="../../../a/s/r/Asrar_al-Tawhid_78b8.html" title="Asrar al-Tawhid">Asrar al-Tawhid</a>, Tazkiratul Awliyā and Noorul Uloom it has been written that Shaikh Abusaïd went for the visit of Shaikh <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abul_Hassan_Kharaqani_746f.html" title="Abul Hassan Kharaqani">Abul Hassan Kharaqani</a> and got deeply influenced by his personality and state.</p>
<p>His system is based on a few themes that appear frequently in his words, generally in the form of simple emotional poems.</p>
<p>The main focus of his teachings is liberation from “I” , which he considered the one and only cause of separation from God and to which he attributed all personal and social misfortunes. His biography mentions that he would never call himself "I" or "we" but “they” instead. This idea of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selflessness.html" title="Selflessness">selflessness</a> appears as <a href="../../../f/o/t/Fotovvat.html" title="Fotovvat">Fotovvat</a> (a concept very near to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chivalry.html" title="Chivalry">chivalry</a>) in his ethical teachings and as <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaamat.html" title="Malaamat">Malaamat</a>, a kind of selflessness before the Beloved which he considers a sign of perfect love in his strictly mystical teachings.</p>
<p>Both of these concepts in a certain sense are spiritual forms of warrior ethics. Despite their simplicity he believed that the full application of these teachings to one's life requires both divine grace and the guidance of an experienced <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufi.html" title="Sufi">Sufi</a>, and is impossible through personal efforts alone. His picture as portrayed in various Sufi writings is a particularly joyful one of continuous ecstasy. Other famous Sufis made frequent references to him, a notable example being the Persian Sufi poet <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attar.html" title="Attar">Attar</a>, who mentions Abusaeid as his spiritual guide. Many miracles are attributed to him in <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufi.html" title="Sufi">Sufi</a> writings.</p>
<p>A few sayings of Abusaeid quoted from his biography Asrar al-Tawhid&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>The veil between man and God is not the world, is not the throne of God, it is the illusion of "I", pass beyond yourself and you are there.</li>
<li>Anywhere the illusion of “I” exists is hell, anywhere “I” is absent is heaven.</li>
<li>If you are not going to sacrifice your self do not spend your time with Sufi nonsense.</li>
<li>Sufism is fixing the gaze at One and living towards One.</li>
<li>The meaning of Sufism is to put down what is in your head and to spare what is in your hand and not to shake when calamities befall you.</li>
<li>Holding a grudge is heresy and attributing things to any cause but God is idolatry and joyfulness is duty.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/u/Abusaeid_Abolkheir_4224.html" title="Edit section: Poetry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Poetry</span></h3>
<p>Many short Persian poems are attributed to him and he is considered one of the great medieval Persian poets. The attribution of these poems has always been doubtful and due to recent research, it is generally believed that he wrote only two poems in his life. The attribution of so many poems to Abusaeid was due to his great fondness for poetry. His love for poetry can be seen from the fact that he usually used love poetry written by non-Sufis in his daily prayers. Even his last words were a poem, and at his funeral instead of the recitation of <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%E2%80%99an.html" title="Qur’an">Qur’anic</a> verses, he requested the following poem.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>What sweeter than this in the world!</i></dd>
<dd><i>Friend met friend and the lover joined his Beloved</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>That was all sorrow, this is all joy</i></dd>
<dd><i>Those were all words, this is all reality.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Another example of the poems attributed to him.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Love came and flew as blood in my veins</i></dd>
<dd><i>Emptied me of myself and filled me with beloved.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Each part of my being she conquered</i></dd>
<dd><i>Now a mere name is left to me and the rest is she.</i></dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/u/Abusaeid_Abolkheir_4224.html" title="Edit section: Abusaeid and Islam">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Abusaeid and Islam</span></h3>
<p>Abusaeid insists that his teachings and <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufism.html" title="Sufism">Sufism</a> as a whole are the true meaning of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. He based his teachings on the mystic interpretation of verses from <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%E2%80%99an.html" title="Qur’an">Qur’an</a> and some <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadiths</a> and was considered a learned <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islamic</a> scholar. Nevertheless his interpretations of <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%E2%80%99an.html" title="Qur’an">Qur’an</a> were different from the mainstream Islamic thought of the time.</p>
<p>Also at his time the Islamic legitimacy of Sufi dance was a matter of debate among the scholars and some attempted to try him and his followers on charges of un-Islamic innovations, dancing and use of poetry in public sermons, but they failed to do so because of his popularity. Similar legal troubles had dogged other Sufis, notably <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attar.html" title="Attar">Attar</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Hallaj_4b06.html" title="Al-Hallaj">al-Hallaj</a>.</p>
<p>Another important fact is that he never fulfilled the pilgrimage to <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaaba.html" title="Kaaba">Kaaba</a>, called <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajj.html" title="Hajj">Hajj</a>, which according to all schools of Islamic jurisprudence is one of the <a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_pillars_of_Islam_d462.html" title="Five pillars of Islam">five pillars of Islam</a> and an obligation upon all Muslims. In his biography Asrar al-Tawhid, he writes: “God knows – and this word is worth a hundred oaths – that everyone for whom God opened the way of pilgrimage to <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaaba.html" title="Kaaba">Kaaba</a>, was already rejected by him from the path of truth.”</p>
<p>To this day this has been one of the causes of criticizing him from a religious point of view. In general he was bold in expressing his mystic opinions as can be seen from his praise of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallaj.html" title="Hallaj">Hallaj</a> who was considered a heretic by most of the Sufis and all of the non-Sufi Muslims of the time, although the common opinion about <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallaj.html" title="Hallaj">Hallaj</a> changed in time.</p>

<p>There is evidence that Abusaeid and <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avicenna.html" title="Avicenna">Avicenna</a>, the famous Persian physician and philosopher, corresponded with one another. Abusaeid records several meetings between them in his biography. The first meeting is described as three days of private conversation, at the end of which Abusaeid said to his followers that everything that he could see (i.e in visions), <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avicenna.html" title="Avicenna">Avicenna</a> knew, and in turn <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avicenna.html" title="Avicenna">Avicenna</a> said that everything he knew Abusaeid could see.</p>
