<dd>Asserting something does not make it so. Do you claim that the images are an inaccurate presentation of what happened? If so, how? If not, then they are clearly factual and thus perfectly acceptable in accordance with our policies. If you don't like what happened because it conflicts with your preconceived notions of how the world should be, then that is unfortunate, but unrelated to Wikipedia policy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Media coverage</span></h2>
<p>This story has been receiving widespread coverage in the UK and presumably many other countries. But we are told that it is receiving little attention in the US and failed to make the front pages of pretty much every newspaper in the USA (page 22 of the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a> according to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4_News_dd55.html" title="Channel 4 News">Channel 4 News</a>). So I'm proud that Wikipedia has this on the "In The News" section. Now of course we have new pictures of British soldiers mistreating prisioners splashed across the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mirror_c617.html" title="Daily Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>. It's a shameful business. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 23:17, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>CNN.com did not show the images and the thrust of its reporting has been "European media are in a frenzy" (in fact right now they are showing European newspapers). Furthermore, it has not been the top story all day -- at least three other stories have taken the top spot during the day, including Michael Jackson and Jayson Williams.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 23:39, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That does seem to be the way it's heading now, which is unfortunate. When I first checked CNN (I don't usually, but I wanted to see how they handled this case) at around 1pm US Pacific time, it was the top story and illustrated by an image similar to Image:AbuGhraibAbuse05.jpg. It also gave more article space to "Bush says it's bad" than to the European media it's currently focusing on. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 23:43, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The following <i>"Sir Michael Jackson, chief of the UK general staff, said similarly, "if proven, the perpetrators are not fit to wear the Queen's uniform and they have besmirched the Army's good name and conduct."</i> is in completely the wrong place. Mike Jackson was referring to the the incident that is depicted on the front of the Daily Mirror, which is a completely different incident, not occuring in Abu Ghraib prison. So I'm going to remove the text on this basis. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 23:27, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, sorry about that. The BBC article was confusing, and didn't mention where the other incident took place, so being that it was in the same article, and the issue was raised on the same day, I assumed it took place in the same location. Perhaps we should move all this to a separate page on mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners by the coalition, regardless of location, and link to that article from here? --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 23:34, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this should go in a separate article, possibly with a link from here, and I'm not too sure about it entirely—it seems a little bit like original research. We could do these sorts of analyses for all sorts of events: for example, do Israeli suicide bombings get covered more or less prominently in some countries than others? How was the WTC covered the first day after the attacks in various countries? How were was the UN oil-for-food corruption scandal covered in various countries? All interesting, but seems like a job for a media watchdog, not us, and then we should report the results of such a study. Perhaps someone like <a href="../../../f/a/i/FAIR_e903.html" title="FAIR">FAIR</a> will issue a report we can link to? --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 00:16, May 1, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I think this is interesting analysis, and the fact that the British media has been saying that this isn't being covered in a big way in the US, it might be difficult to prove a point with this about the resot of the world. Most of Europe is covering the enlargment of the EU as the main story. The British media on the other hand is focussed on the Iraq situation because we are actively involved in it.

<dd>Hardly. In my experience, these kind of people do not even argue - they just try to remove whatever information they don't like. Question number 1: Which are the largest papers in the US, the UK, Germany, France, ..? Question 2: How did the coverage differ in these papers? These two questions are objectively answerable with source research only, the kind of research encyclopedists conduct constantly, and the answer to these questions is unambiguous and factual.

<dd>There's no point in editing the page because the information in question is not yet included. We're still collecting. It seems absurd to me when an attempt is made to do serious <i>source</i> research -- something we should do a lot more of when everyone just uses Google -- this is immediately torpedoed with what I consider to be a very weak argument at best. The "no original research" policy is for fringe physics theories, vanity pages or controversial interpretations of source material, it is not intended to stifle the collection of data from paper-based sources.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 01:02, May 1, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A study of media bias is very much original research, and is actually a very active field of academic research. I don't trust Wikipedians to be competent to make claims of media bias unless those claims are published in a peer-reviewed journal (as many such claims have been, and those claims I'm much less suspect of). There's a lot of methodological issues that are commonly dealt with by serious research in the field, and which I doubt would be properly dealt with here. Some of them include: an unbiased and representative selection of the sources to survey; controlling for the non-political biases of the sources (for example, the paper's domestic vs. international focus, or sports vs. non-sports focus, and so on), and lots more. If, for example, it were found that US papers downplayed this story to the exact same extent that they typically downplay non-US stories (US papers typically are biased towards events that happen within the US's borders), that would be uninteresting. If they downplayed it <i>more</i> than usual, that would be interesting. Basically, I'd be very interested in a carefully controlled, peer-reviewed study of the matter, but I don't expect Wikipedia to be the place it's published. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 03:13, May 1, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Rape.</b> The Guardian reports: "[A]ccording to several sources with detailed knowledge of the case, [An American contractor] raped an Iraqi inmate in his mid-teens."</p>
<p><b>Widespread abuse.</b> Major General Antonio M. Taguba found that between October and December of 2003 there were numerous instances of "sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses" at Abu Ghraib. Taguba's report listed some of the wrongdoing:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Breaking chemical lights and pouring the phosphoric liquid on detainees; pouring cold water on naked detainees; beating detainees with a broom handle and a chair; threatening male detainees with rape; allowing a military police guard to stitch the wound of a detainee who was injured after being slammed against the wall in his cell; sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light and perhaps a broom stick, and using military working dogs to frighten and intimidate detainees with threats of attack, and in one instance actually biting a detainee.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Other evidence.</b> Staff Sgt. Ivan L. "Chip" Frederick II faces a court marshall for Abu Ghraib, mailed his diary home. It lists detailed, dated entries that chronicle abuse and name names. Excerpt:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>They stressed him out so bad that the man passed away. The next day the medics came in and put his body on a stretcher, placed a fake I.V. in his arm [to suggest he died under medical care] and took him away. This OGA [prisoner] was never processed and therefore never had a number."</i></dd>

<p>I thought this link was appropriate. Very questionable, but that's what external links are for, questioning. The rape may be out of context but the last two show more believable photos of naked prisoners being led around outdoors somewhere, possibly unrelated to Abu Ghraib, but possibly related to the significance of this story (U.S. war crimes in Iraq.) Plus it seems to be the only non-western site linked, and I've always found Arabic media (while lacking the NPOV) of interest in getting a better understanding of the situation. I think this link should be kept, with a disclaimer of it's questionable nature. If nothing else it's an example of anti-U.S. propoganda, that the rape images are included with only "these pictures were e-mailed to albasrah" as a source. Very telling of what the Abu Ghraib incident has done for US/Iraqi relations to say the least.

<dd>Sublime Sovereign of the Chelonians, whatever else I was doing in my previous message, I certainly wasn't playing the blame game about who reverted. My point about discretion in naming names has been made – and if it fell on deaf ears, then that was probably because of the USA's extraordinary openness about such information, compared to the countries I'm more familiar with.
