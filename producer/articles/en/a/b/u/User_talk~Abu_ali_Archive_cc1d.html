<dd>There are no evidences to suggest that was the case. All you’re basing your argument on are assumptions and speculation. What there is evidence for is the fact that her mother was a Persian Jew. You are in no position to judge these sources. They have been used before for other articles and are considered valid and reputable sources. Until you have something beside hearsay that would back your argument please refrain from taking the Persian Jew out.<a href="../../../k/l/y/User%7EKlymen_c80c.html" title="User:Klymen">Klymen</a> 07:47, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

No one can prove that what has been said in the guardian was taken from wikipedia. If you have further issues regarding this matter we can summon an admin to settle this dispute.

<dd>I just want to make sure you understand the difference between my argument and your argument. I’m saying Sacha Baron Cohen’s mother is a Persian Jew and am supporting this claim by four reputable sources. You’re claiming that whatever is said in these reputable sources have been taking out wikipedia. Yet you have no evidence to suggest such event has taken place. Thus by default are basing you argument on speculations. Until you can prove that your argument is true please refrain from editing the article.</dd>

<p>I also would like to note that, other people sharing your opinion does not make you right. It doesn’t matter if there are three or four other users who believe the same thing. Until you can prove that the guardian and the other sources took their material from a vandalized wikipedia article you have no grounds to take the Persian Jew out. <a href="../../../k/l/y/User%7EKlymen_c80c.html" title="User:Klymen">Klymen</a> 11:22, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello again. I not that you reverted by edit putting in the edit summary "Abu Ali is challenging the credibility of four reputable source simply out of his own personal speculations." This is dishonest to say the least. I do not intend to challenge the credibility of your 4 sources. But users such as Mad Jack have put forward a very convincing argument that they are incorrect in this instance. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 11:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Jack’s argument follows nothing but simple speculation. He has no evidence or proof to suggest that The Guardian, a very respectable and reputable news agency has used wikipedia as a source. I have already discussed this matter with him and he has no problem with leaving the Persian Jew in the article. This is due to the fact that he knows that the argument lacks the evidence to dispute the “Persian Jew” origin. He is currently looking for a way to verifiably prove that the four sources have taken their material from wikipedia. If he was to find one, I would have no problem with taking the Persian Jew out. However until such evidence is provided, what is referenced and verified should stay. Also there is nothing dishonest about what I said, you are challenging the credibility of the four sources that say Cohen’s mother is a Persian Jew by removing them. You have no evidence or proof to back your argument. I would like to remind you that you’re taking verified facts out of the article and editing it based on your own belief and assumption. <a href="../../../k/l/y/User%7EKlymen_c80c.html" title="User:Klymen">Klymen</a> 12:30, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Klymen, You obviously feel very strongly about this. I think think that the Persian mother thing is wrong. But I don't want to spend time in an edit war on this issue. There are more important things in life. And good luck with your finals! Let me know when your finals are over and we will talk about it again. Until then I won't remove the Persian connection. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 13:10, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reverted your edit, because in your edit you removed all wiki formatting and the protection notice, and because the version you reverted the article to didn't seem to follow the policy of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a> - not the least because it didn't contain the criticism section. - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 21:27, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes - the other version was little more than promotional. If you believe that there is something wrong with the article, please don't just unilaterally revert to your favourite version; rather, make your case on the appropriate talk page and seek consensus of other editors. - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 21:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I could tell you a fair amnont. Most informed observes know about the racism inherent in the Israeli Law of return, the israel lands administration, the treatment of foreign workers, the denial of the right of family unification for Arab citizens who are married to Palestinians from the territories, the treatment of jews from Arab countries, etc...

<dd>Hi ሀላካሕ, I am not sure what you mean by win here. I will feel that I have won when the list of racism by country is empty, not because of censorship, but because racism has been eliminated. The battles people fight on WP are in reality pretty unimportant. But if someone gets angry enough to decide to do something about the problems and injustice in the real world, then the enterprise is not a total waste of time. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 09:07, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is quite infuriating, becuase somehwere in my house there IS a file with newspaper clippings from the court martial. But it was nearly 20 years ago, I have an enormous lot of boxes with all kinds of papers and without a very good system, and searching would take some months which I don't have becasue there are many other important things, personal and political, to take care of. So, I know for sure that the affair got a lot of press publicity, but how to prove it? I might make an appeal anyway, the worst which can happen is that the article remains deleted, but must think some more on what arguments to present and how. Any ideas?Adam Keller 00:13, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The key question is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">notability</a>: is the court martial important enough to justify inclusion in an encyclopedia?

<p>Unfortunaately, I don't know of such books. By the way, the Guardian quite was brought up in the original deleteion discussion but was disregarded, though the Guardian is a significant British newspaper. It might be releavent to mention that this Mr. yellow Up seems to have a consistent policy of hounding me and trying to get rid of whatever I write which does not fit his political opinions, he does it also in the Hebrew Wikipedia. There are some more points which I thought of. The argument of Yellow Up that "This is just one of thousands of trials against military evaders" which was rpeated by Danntm "just a simple, unimportant court-martial" is factually not true. It is very exceptional for the IDF to grant a political objector a full court martial where he can be defended by a lawyer and call witnesses (and make political speeches). It does not happen more often than once in a decade. The usual procedure is "disciplinary proceedings" where you are judged by a commaning officer in his bureau, with no lawyer or witnesses, and it lasts about five minutes - but the officer can only give a maximum of 28 days, unlike the full court martial which can give years. But the descision to have a full court martial is far from routine, it is taken on the highest levels. Then there is the fact that the act which the trial was about - a soldier writing "subversive" graffiti of 117 tanks and other military vehicles - is far from routine, it is certainly unique in Israel and I think quite exeptional for armies worldwide. And finally, Majorly jusitifed the decision to delete by stating "The vast majority were delete comments, and there seemed to be consensus to delete" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Majorly#Deletion_of_Adam_Keller_court_martial" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Majorly#Deletion_of_Adam_Keller_court_martial" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Now, I took a look at the deletion log of article submitted on January 8 together with mine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2007_January_8" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2007_January_8" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. As far as I could see, virtually all of those which were fianlly deleted had a real ovewhelming majoroity in favor, many of them complete unanimity. The court martial artcile had nine in favor of deletion against five opposing deletion (if you don't count my own objection, with it there would be nine to six). I saw that another article which was put up for deleteion in nearly the same time <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnie_Ginsburg_97d0.html" title="Arnie Ginsburg">Arnie_Ginsburg</a>, the result was "no concensus, default keep". [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2007_January_8#Arnie_Ginsburg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2007_January_8#Arnie_Ginsburg" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>]. I have a feeling this could have been the resut also with the Court Martial article. I don't know if I should try myself to put up all these arguments, it seems like a person trying to defend his own work is discounted.Adam Keller 12:57, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that these are valid arguments and that you should open a deletion review.

<dd>Thnaks for the enocuragement. But how do you think I should relate to the existing procedure of history-only undelete? Should I open a seperate proceeding, or should I introduce these arguments in the same discussion? Obviously, if the request for history-only undelete is rejected, all the more so a request for a full undelete. (I have done quite a lot of work in Wikipedia, but I have hardly any experience of these kinds of struggle.)Adam Keller 19:42, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You are right. A history only undeletion is a distraction. I'll do a deletion review when I get a few minutes... <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 23:12, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Many thanks for the help. I also felt a bit uncomfortable with coming out myself as asking for undeletion. There are two more points which occured to me today and they might be useful: aside from betraying a political bias, the statment that it was "one of the trials of evaders" is just factually not true. It was not the trial of an evader, it was the trial of a soldier who punctually answered the call-up order, came to the desginated place at the designated time, put on a uniform and then went out in the night and wrote grafitti on 117 tanks and other vehicles. This is not "evasion" - it is worse by the military legal code, but it defintely in not "evasion". (It was by the way not planned in advance, it was a spontaneus reaction to a young Palestinian being electrocuted when soldiers forced him to climb a electricity pylon to take down a Palestinain flag). Second point: I did write the article, but I did not describe my own actions on these two nights in my own words. I gave the exact wording of the military prosecutor, and he did not write it to faltter me but to get me into prison for as long as he could. Anyway, thanks again for the help.

<p>Hello, I'm responding to the message you have left in my talk page. I had time only to go briefly over the debate in the deletion review. I don't know much about Adam Keller, but a quick search in Google (in Hebrew) shows that he is the spokesperson of the Israeli left-wing movement "Gush Shalom". As far as I understand, he was sent before a martial court in 1988 because he committed an offense against army orders when acting as a soldier. He was a reserve soldier, but on active duty, and therefore subject to martial law. Had he done the same thing as a civilian, I doubt if he had been indicted at all, and if so, he'd probably get a much easier punishment (in order to be fair, I'd say that being a WASP in Israeli terms, probably helped him when brought before a martial court, and would probably have let him off the hook had he done it as a civilian). I am not sure this case is special enough to sustain an article in its own right. It is mentioned in <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refusal_to_serve_in_the_Israeli_military_9a94.html#The_Adam_Keller_Court_Martial" title="Refusal to serve in the Israeli military">Refusal to serve in the Israeli military#The Adam Keller Court Martial</a>, and it seems to be enough, considering it was not that unusual. Perhaps the background of the beginning of the first Intifada encouraged the Hebrew press back then to deal with this subject intensely, but with time perspective it doesn't seem a major event. Nevertheless, you could write an article about Adam Keller himself. Regardless of his views (about which I am not going to comment) he sounds like an interesting person. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrork_a20a.html" title="User:Drork">drork</a> 21:53, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That wasn't the point there. They called the article "The Israeli agression on Lebanon". I don't subscribe to this view, but so be it. What made me lose my temper is a paragraph trying to justify the use of the term "agression" by citing the Council of Europe and G8 statements. In fact, these statements were totally misinterpreted, and I suspect this was done intentionally - people see a statement backed with a source, the chances that they will actually check the sources are slim. I tried to correct the misleading interpretation and to introduce a citation from the Security Council resulution 1701 suggesting that the first move was done by Hezbollah (my intention was to show that by no mean is there consensus about the term "agression"), but my edits were reverted. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrork_a20a.html" title="User:Drork">drork</a> 12:24, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We disagree with our characterisation of Israel's actions in Lebanon. But we would agree about the characterisation of the UN and council of Europe which effectively backed Israel's actions and refused to call for a cease fire till 11 August. If these bodies had called for an immediate cease fire, then many Arab and Israeli victims of the war would still be alive today. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 12:49, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, again that's not the point. We could talk about the way this crisis was handled, but that's another story. The point it, you cannot say the Council of Europe called the Israeli actions "agression" while in fact this word was never used by any representative of the Council. Quite the contrary in fact, as you mentioned above. What happened in the Arabic Wikipedia is that they took an article which cited the source and interpreted it quite freely and in a misleading way, and brought it as a proof that the COE saw the Israeli actions as "agression". Furthermore, they rejected a citation from the Security Council resolution that indicates that the international community didn't adopt the view of Israeli "agression". You must agree that you cannot put words into people's mouthes. It is regretable that this is the case in the Arabic Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrork_a20a.html" title="User:Drork">drork</a> 14:01, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you Abu-ali for helping me out with the Second Intifada. I'ts nice to finally have an ally on wikipedia who supports the palestinians. It frightens me sometimes how many mad pro-zionists there are at this place. However, in this case I think you made a tiny mistake. It is the Institute for Counter-Terrorism, not the Institute For Combatting Terrorism. In this case Isarig was right. However, I still think it was wrong of him to erase the section that showed the Palestinians objections.</p>
<p>Do you know anything about this Institute For Counter-Terrorism or about this study they did comparing the number of non-combatants killed on both sides. Isarig and I have been arguing about this for the last few days and he insists there a reputable organization. I pointed out that they were founded by a former head of Mossad, but do you know anything else about them.</p>
<p>If so let me know. Also lets try and stick together and maybe we can change the Pro-Israel bias at Wikipedia. annoynmous 17:12, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi annonymous, I must admit that I had not heard of the ICT before. I had a look at their web site and found it quite interresting. It looks like one of these Acedimic/Military research institutes/think tanks. Former generals, secret service personel and accademics get together to analyse what is going on in the Arab world and examine different strategic responses. It looks like the ICT has a more military slant than the better known Jaffe Centre for Strategic studies. But they seem to be fairly serious and their material is better researched than the crass propoganda produced by the Israeli foreign ministry, and more interresting as an aid to understanding the thinking of the Israeli military elite. They are obviously a partizan body (all their experts on Arabs are jews). So it may be well to take their version of the facts with a pinch of salt.</dd>

<dd>I liked your edits to the Ilan Pappe article. It is amazing how much our "pro-Israeli" friends hate this Israeli who refuses to swallow the official line.</dd>

<dd>Regarding the mad pro-zionists out their, remember that they are the ones who are frightened. Their speed to censor your edits shows their fear of the truth. Let them rant and rave at us. Let them expose their true character to all around. Yes there are a lot of them on Wikipedia. But if you look on the ground in the middle east, there are a lot more of us. Just don't waste too much time online. The key battle is on the streets, to open peoples minds to what is going on around them and how they can organize to do something about it. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 22:24, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am actually believe it or not American. I know that the stereotype is that were all clueless about anything outside of America and although I am buy no means an expert, I have become much more knowledgeable over the past few years. Seeing that your an Israelie you probably have much more first hand knowledge than I do.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you, I often hear polls cited that say that the majority of Israel's citizens agree with there governments actions. Is this true or false? If so is it because there propogandized like we are here in America or is there another reason. annoynmous 23:19, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Abu ali, that was my mess-up, however it was based on another users. I had been confusing it with another stat I had read regarding Israeli Arabs killed during suicide-homicide bombings. Here is my problem with it now: The 12 Arabs were violent rioters who had been assaulting Jewish citizens and shops. They did in fact, initiate hostilities. Since, in general, the other incidents like the Shafram attack the victims were completely innocent, I am just wondering how it would fit in context. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamir1_b434.html" title="User:Shamir1">Shamir1</a> 22:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I remmember correctly some were bystanders. They were all unarmed. One was a kid who was active in Jewish/Arab coexistence/peace groups. None were killed in the vacinity of Jewish shops. All were killed in Arab areas. They all have names and their indiviudal circumstances which can probably be found in the Or committee report. And whether you think the shooting was good or bad, the fact remains they were all shot by the Israeli police.

<p>Salam Abu Ali.</p>
<p>I'm very happy with meeting you in this article. I've editted it since July and I can help you with it. Also I can answer why there isn't anything about demonstrations. Please be careful. <strike>This article is very sensitive and we should try not to participate in editorial war with jews like Elizmr and Isring.</strike>--<a href="../../../s/a/2E/User%7ESa.vakilian_5dc3.html" title="User:Sa.vakilian">Sa.vakilian</a> 05:05, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Sa.vakilian, I would not use jews as a pejorative word. Some are reasonable people. Others like Isring are incapable of compromize and lash out in all directions to obliterate facts they find inconvinient. Isring is a living example of Zionism in action and gives all those he meets a real feel for what Zionism is all about. If he did not exist then we would have had to invent him:-). I will be careful when introducing stuff into the Hezbollah article as I do not know the history of the article and what compromises have been made in the past. But why is there nothing about the recent demonstrations? <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 11:29, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, you misunderstood. Why do you think I used it as a pejorative word but our POV about issues are absoluletly different.</dd>

<p>The 7 children killed on a Gaza beach were not killed by an Israeli shell as Palestinians reported. Investigations find that it the blast most likely occured due to an unexploded ordinance buried in the sand. You can see the statement from the IDF <a href="http://www1.idf.il/DOVER/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&amp;id=7&amp;docid=53169.EN" class="external text" title="http://www1.idf.il/DOVER/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&amp;id=7&amp;docid=53169.EN" rel="nofollow">here</a> and part of the analysis <a href="http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/critiques/Gaza_Beach_Libel.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/critiques/Gaza_Beach_Libel.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Similarly, Palestinians gunmen recently claimed that an explosion was caused by an Israeli airstrike. This has not been proven and the IDF has rejected this allegation. The explosion occured because of technical mishaps with the rockets they were trying to fire (which they do not deny). The incident, as told by the gunmen, was initially published by Al Jazeera and other news sites however, like the incident earlier in Gaza, most have corrected, revised, and/or published new articles with the present facts. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamir1_b434.html" title="User:Shamir1">Shamir1</a> 10:31, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Listen. For starters, you inserted the incident in the wrong section. It is already taken note of the incident. As for IDF "whitewash", it is been FAR more accurate than Palestinian sources have been. By far. For starters, the video on PA TV allegedly depicting the incident was proven to fraud. And again, just recently, Palestinian gunmen who were attempting to fire rockets (which they say they were doing) claimed that the IDF striked them. Very easily, the claim was proven false. Although they probably know that, their goal is probably to persuade other Palestinians. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamir1_b434.html" title="User:Shamir1">Shamir1</a> 08:38, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hello Shamir1,</dd>
<dd>Truth is the first casualty of war. When the IDF investigates itself, its findings can be predicted in advance. In the case of the Gaza beach massacre, very few people believe that the IDF was a neutral party or that the results of its "investigation" carry any weight.

<dd>Shalom Avraham, My comments are not a personal attack on anyone, merely an explanation why a certain group is carrying out a shameful personal attacks on Naeim Giladi attempting to associate him with white supremacists and antisemits. This is part of a campaing of villification against all those who criticise Israel. (e.g. Israel Shahak, Norman Finkelstein).

<dd>Please see response on the article's talk page. Further, intimating that a group of editors are a "lobby" is a personal attack. Bringing undisputably undeniable data in an article is not.

<dd>The use of the word "lobby" is not a personal attack. But if you are at all offended by the word, I will be happy to oblige and not use the word in future. On the other hand what you describe as "bringing undisputably undeniable data" is a smear campaign using Nazi sources against someone you disagree with this is a personal attack of the vilest nature.

<p>All I can do is urge you to tread carefully. The POV warriors on "the other side" are adept at using the policies of Wikipedia to their political ends. Keep very cool in dealing with them, no matter how provoked you are. Try to avoid long revert wars. If you are outnumbered, and you often will be, do not consider it a virtue to keep fighting past the point at which anyone reasonable would consider a compromise. Move on to another article.

<p>Abu ali, Culverin has responded on my talk page. He has offered to retract the warning if you appologise for your remarks (on your talk page). I think this is excellent resolution, as a number of users <i>have</i> been offended by it - the comment promotes a "us versus them" environment. I'd actually suggest going a step further than just apologising if you are willing, and striking out your the original comment that caused the problems (just put &lt;s&gt;...&lt;/s&gt; tags around it. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChovain_e53a.html" title="User:Chovain">Chovain</a><sup>(<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChovain_b912.html" title="User talk:Chovain">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chovain_178c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chovain">c</a>)</sup> 00:53, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have been falsely accused by user Brilliance of advocating suicide bombings. Brilliance contacted culverin who falsely accuses me of racism and now of antisemitism. If either of these gentlemen would be kind enough to show where in my comments (private comments to another editor) I have advocated sucide bombing, and have been racist and antisemitic, I will apologize <i>unreservedly</i> because I oppose terrorism racism and antisemitsm. But if Brilliance and culverin can not substantiate their allegations, they should have the honesty to admit that they are false and withdraw them. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 09:42, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you didn't on your own, see my comment on Chovain's talk. I hope I didn't cause a problem. I know this puts you in a difficult position, however, where you're unable to speak openly, which sucks. In any case, I might suggest removing your comment (if this is allowed) in the interest of a resolution, since it does probably go outside the spirit of editing on WP.

<p>Hello again. I'd just like to update on you on where things seem to be at. There're a few last remaining releases of steam, but things are settling down. At this point, I think the most important thing is that all parties do all they can to prevent further conflict. Brilliance recently made an edit to my user page that made me nearly escalate the whole matter, but I've decided to treat it as him just letting off a bit of steam, so will forgive and forget. I urge you to do the same if you find yourself in a similar situation. An RfC is going to hurt everyone involved at this point. Let's just let it go. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChovain_e53a.html" title="User:Chovain">Chovain</a><sup>(<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChovain_b912.html" title="User talk:Chovain">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chovain_178c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chovain">c</a>)</sup> 09:52, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The state of my approval or disapproval (check yes next to disapproval) of Katzav is non-related to the subject which is <i>"defamation on zionism"</i>. Mr. Katzav is not even a spec on the history of zionism but you made him your primary (and only) link - not to mention your later abuse of my username which showed lack of good faith (which you claim i mis-attacked you over??). i suggest, same as before, that you discard this counter-productive use of wikipedia.

<dd>Moshe Kazav was elected president of the state of Israel not by me but by the Knesset. The president has few powers but his main function is to serve as a symbol of the state.

<dd>Abu, you don't have to keep those warnings on your talk page. There's no consensus about that, and one school of thought is that if you remove them, that is an acknowledgment that you've read them.

<p>Hi Abu, I simply moved the warnings from your user page to your talk page as I simply thought you would not want them there. With regards to advising User:Jaakobou on his talk page about giving final warnings, this was because he posted a comment on <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> asking for help regarding your edits. The reason why I advised him was because 1)AIV should only be used to report users not get advice regarding them and 2)users should only be reported once they have been given a final warning. I wasn't in anyway implying that I thought your edits were vandalism, I was simply advising on the appropriate course of action to take with regards to reporting users.

<p>Whether Jaakobou is zionist is not important. Listing it on your userpage when he objects, however, is counterproductive and could be considered an attack when you use it to judge his Wikipedia edits. Please refrain from listing users by their political convictions. If people want to do that, they can do so on their own userpage. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:56, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>the issue of israel being deleted from this section and being stubbed in <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> is becoming an issue.

<dd>I think it reflects very accurately on Wikipedia. Israeli society is riven with racism, against Arabs, Mizrachi jews and foreign workers.

<p>I am now back in action (which does not mean I can devote all my time to Wikipedia, i have many other things to take care of). I took a look at the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> and Racism by Country aricles. What is in them about Israel at the moment is reasonble, though it can be improved. I have some ideas but I think anything I change must be very clearly sourced, so I should not do anything hasty. (I have tangled with mr. Humus Sapiens before. Regardeless of the Israel specific issue, by the way, I think the two articels should be merged - either the Racism by Country merged into the general articles or the sections on specific countries in <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> should be removed to the other one and where both had a section on the same coutry these should be merged into one. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Keller_28af.html" title="User:Adam Keller">Adam Keller</a> 00:31, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Welcome back. From my limited knowledge of your BIO I am amazed that you find time to even look in Wikipedia. Don't waste too much time here writing stuff which is liable to be deleted by right wingers. (The appear to have organized to finnish off the Shmuel Yerushalmi article. They can barely conceal their hatred for the guy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Shmuel_Yerushalmi&amp;diff=109502518&amp;oldid=109365010" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Shmuel_Yerushalmi&amp;diff=109502518&amp;oldid=109365010" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>). These guys hate me. But this is nothing compared to their hatred of their fellow Israelis who are working for peace.)

<p>You might be interested in this. Not sure if you're familiar with this issue, but the media secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain was recently accused of sending death threats to an American right-wing blog. The bloggers self-investigated and ultimately could not prove their allegations, but because of a single mention of the incident in Ynet, some users here feel that it warrants mention in this man's Wikipedia page, citing <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. I contend that it runs afoul of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, as it was an unsubstantiated allegation and extra care should be taken with such matters in pages of living people.

<dd>I was wondering if you know anything significant about her so that I could expand the criticism section on her article which as it stands is pretty slim. I saw her on Real Time with Bill Maher last night and just something about her pissed me off. In a way I almost prefer out and out rascists like Daniel Pipes because at least there direct and honest. You know where he's coming from, no matter how revolting his views may be. Whereas people like Ali and Irshad Manji play this extremely disengious game of claiming to speak for Islam and yet reputating it at the same time. I'm an atheist myself, but I try to remain careful that my secularism doesn't dovetail into a militaristic rascism.</dd>

<dd>The reason I mention this to you is that if you read the article on her you notice several passages of her gushing over what a great liberal democracy Israel is and how the palestinian disenfranchisement is mostly there own fault because of corrupt leaders like arafat. I think we need to more directly address these academic hacks because there real purpose is not enlightened discussion, but to give justification from everything to racial profiling, Guantonomo Bay, the Iraq war and the Israelie policy in the occupied territories. They are so called "House Muslims" who in the words of Tariq Ramadan "tell westerners what they want to hear. annoynmous 13:34, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>For the heads up. But man, I am being stalked. Tewfik is now chasing me around to articles like <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Peoples_ad3b.html" title="Indigenous Peoples">Indigenous Peoples</a> and elsewhere. Did you see my note in talk about the criteria to designate a group indigenous on Wikipedia? It is at, or linked to the Category:Indigenous Peoples page. Now, he's deleting my addition of Palestinians to all those pages even though I provided a source from the UN that designates Palestinians as indigenous. Abu Ali, what should I do? Where can I get help to stop his repeated deleting of this factual information? Help. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 17:11, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, I know you are right. And I do do that sometimes. But it sincerely irks me that editing articles related to the Middle East has to be such a battleground where the first casualty is the truth. I mean it's obvious Palestinians are indigenous to what is now Israel and the occupied territories. But with the amount of noise they make, you would think it was about as controversial as claiming that we never went to the moon. Thanks for keeping a cool head and putting things in perspective.

<p>I don't know if you're Palestinian, Abu Ali. But I know that as a fellow human being, you share my pain at the state of the world. And I share yours. That's what moves me to write. My love for all people which begins with love for myself, then my neighbours, my people, and expands outward from there, everywhere. And if that's wrong, if passion is forbidden, and free-thought is dead, then let me die with them. For then, there is nothing in the world left to live for. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 20:54, 2 March 2007 (UTC) (Ahhh, the melodrama of our "Orient". Obviously passion and free-thought continue to live, and death is hopefully still way way off in the future. No need to worry, not planning anything crazy. Just thought I would clarify since once I read about this Palestinian guy at a University in Montreal that said he "was going to be famous one day", and the Zionist he was arguing with started shouting "So, you want to join Hamas?" assuming that he meant he wanted to become a suicide bomber. He was charged with making death threats, though the case was eventually dismissed after one of the witnesses admitted to writing both witness statements that were used against him and which in fact were identical. I know it sounds "conspiratorial", but it is actually true: <a href="http://www.theconcordian.com/news/2003/03/19/News/Sphr-Member.Arrested.On.Campus-395043.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theconcordian.com/news/2003/03/19/News/Sphr-Member.Arrested.On.Campus-395043.shtml" rel="nofollow">[29]</a><a href="http://www.montrealmuslimnews.net/nidal.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.montrealmuslimnews.net/nidal.htm" rel="nofollow">[30]</a><a href="https://masses.tao.ca/pipermail/act-mtl/2004-June/000456.html" class="external autonumber" title="https://masses.tao.ca/pipermail/act-mtl/2004-June/000456.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 21:09, 2 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Thanks for the barnstar. I have never got one before, and am far more accostomed to recieving final warnings. And thanks again for the poetry!
