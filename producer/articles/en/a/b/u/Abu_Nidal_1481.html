<p>Part of the secular, left-wing, Palestinian <a href="../../../r/e/j/Rejectionist_Front_64fd.html" title="Rejectionist Front">rejectionist front</a>, so called because they reject proposals for a peaceful settlement with Israel, the ANO was formed after a split in 1974 between Abu Nidal and <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasser_Arafat_cf67.html" title="Yasser Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a>'s <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatah.html" title="Fatah">Fatah</a> faction within the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_Liberation_Organization_12a1.html" title="Palestine Liberation Organization">Palestine Liberation Organization</a> (PLO). Setting himself up as a freelance contractor, Abu Nidal was based over the years in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Egypt, and is believed to have ordered attacks in 20 countries, killing or injuring over 900 people. <sup id="_ref-StateDeptprofile_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-StateDeptprofile" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ANO's most notorious attacks were on the <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Al_26f7.html" title="El Al">El Al</a> ticket counters at <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome_and_Vienna_Airport_Attacks_e6c2.html" title="Rome and Vienna Airport Attacks">Rome and Vienna</a> airports in December 1985, when Arab gunmen doped on <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphetamine.html" title="Amphetamine">amphetamines</a> opened fire on passengers in simultaneous shootings, killing 18 and wounding 120. <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Seale_2586.html" title="Patrick Seale">Patrick Seale</a>, Abu Nidal's biographer, wrote of the attacks that their "random cruelty marked them as typical Abu Nidal operations." <sup id="_ref-Seale243_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seale243" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

Abu Nidal was born in the port of <a href="../../../j/a/f/Jaffa%2C_Israel_45aa.html" title="Jaffa, Israel">Jaffa</a>, where he was raised in a large stone house near the beach. The building is now an Israeli military courthouse.</div>

</div>
<p>Abu Nidal was born in May 1937 in the port of <a href="../../../j/a/f/Jaffa%2C_Israel_45aa.html" title="Jaffa, Israel">Jaffa</a>, now part of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tel_Aviv_6d0d.html" title="Tel Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>, on the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean.html" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> coast of what was then the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Mandate_of_Palestine_86c7.html" title="British Mandate of Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a>. His father, Hajj Khalil al-Banna, was a wealthy merchant who made his money from the 6,000 acres (24 km²) of orange groves he owned, which extended from the south of Jaffa to Majdal, today <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkelon.html" title="Ashkelon">Ashkelon</a> in Israel. He raised his large family in luxury in a three-storey stone house with a large porch overlooking the beach, now used as an Israeli military court. <sup id="_ref-Melman46_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman46" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to Abu Nidal's brother, Muhammad Khalil al-Banna, their father was the richest man in Palestine. He told journalist <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yossi_Melman_3aab.html" title="Yossi Melman">Yossi Melman</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[My father] marketed about ten percent of all the citrus crops sent from Palestine to Europe — especially to England and Germany. He owned a summer house in Marseilles, France, and another house in <a href="../../../i/s/k/%C4%B0skenderun_1be4.html" title="İskenderun">İskenderun</a>, then in Syria and afterwards Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most of the time we lived in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to swim in the sea. We also had stables with <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabian_horse.html" title="Arabian horse">Arabian horses</a>, and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think we must have been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool. <sup id="_ref-Melman47_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman47" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al-Banna told Melman that the family also owned orchards in Majdal, <a href="../../../y/a/v/Yavneh.html" title="Yavneh">Yavneh</a>, Abu Kabir, and near the village of Tirah. The Ramat Hakovesh <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibbutz.html" title="Kibbutz">kibbutz</a> contains a tract of land to this day called "the al-Banna orchard," he said. "Of course this used to belong to us. My brothers and I still preserve the documents showing our ownership of the property, even though we know full well that we and our children have no chance of getting it back. <sup id="_ref-Melman47_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman47" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>Khalil's money meant he could afford to take several wives. According to Abu Nidal in a rare interview with <i>Der Spiegel</i> in 1985, his father had 13 wives, who gave birth to 16 sons and eight daughters. <sup id="_ref-SpiegelMelman_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SpiegelMelman" title="">[13]</a></sup> Abu Nidal's mother was the second wife, according to Abu Nidal's British biographer <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Seale_2586.html" title="Patrick Seale">Patrick Seale</a>, and the eighth, according to Melman. <sup id="_ref-Melman46_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman46" title="">[11]</a></sup> She had been one of the family's maids, a young <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alawite.html" title="Alawite">Alawite</a> girl just 16 years old when Khalil married her against the wishes of his family. She gave birth to Sabri, Khalil's 12th child. Because the family disapproved of the marriage, Abu Nidal was allegedly scorned from an early age by his older half-brothers and half-sisters.</p>
<p>Khalil sent him to Collège des Frères, a French <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> mission school in the Old Jaffa quarter, the records of which show he completed the first grade, according to the school keeper, although the school administration refuses to allow journalists to view them. <sup id="_ref-Melman47_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman47" title="">[12]</a></sup> However, when Khalil died in 1945, when Abu Nidal was seven years old, the family turned his mother out of the house. The older brothers, more devout <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> than the father had been, took Abu Nidal out of the mission school and enrolled him in a Muslim school in Jerusalem, now known as al-Umaria, at the time one of the most prestigious private schools in the country. He attended the school for about two years. <sup id="_ref-Melman48_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman48" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Seale suggests that Abu Nidal's unhappy childhood, and the early loss of both his father and mother, explains his difficult personality, described by journalists as <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychopath.html" title="Psychopath">psychopathic</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranoia.html" title="Paranoia">paranoid</a>, and as "chaotic" by <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Iyad_053c.html" title="Abu Iyad">Abu Iyad</a>, the late deputy chief of Fatah. <a href="../../../i/s/s/Issam_Sartawi_5928.html" title="Issam Sartawi">Issam Sartawi</a>, the late Palestinian heart surgeon, called him a psychopath <sup id="_ref-Melman3_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman3" title="">[15]</a></sup> whose mental world was one of plots and counterplots, <sup id="_ref-Melman52_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman52" title="">[16]</a></sup> which was later reflected in his tyrannical leadership of the ANO, trusting no one, and at one point suspecting even his own wife of working for the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Intelligence_Agency_295c.html" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a>. <sup id="_ref-Colvin_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Colvin" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>When the Arabs rejected the <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_29.html" title="November 29">November 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_Partition_Plan_17da.html" title="UN Partition Plan">United Nations partition plan</a> — which aimed to partition Palestine into two states, one Jewish, one Arab — war broke out between the Palestinian-Arab and Jewish militias, and Jaffa found itself under siege. Life became unbearable, according to Melman, and the disruption of the citrus fruit business hit the family's income. Booby-trapped cars were exploding in the center of Jaffa and there were food shortages. The al-Banna family had had good relations with the Jewish community. Abu Nidal's brother told Melman: "My father was a close friend of Avraham Shapira, one of the founders of <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hashomer.html" title="Hashomer">Hashomer</a>, the Jewish self-defense organization. He would visit [Shapira] in his home in <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petah_Tikva_24fa.html" title="Petah Tikva">Petah Tikva</a>, or Shapira riding his horse would visit our home in Jaffa. I also remember how we visited <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaim_Weizmann_e21e.html" title="Chaim Weizmann">Dr. Weizmann</a> [who became the first president of Israel] in his home in <a href="../../../r/e/h/Rehovot.html" title="Rehovot">Rehovot</a>." <sup id="_ref-Melman48_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman48" title="">[14]</a></sup> It was war, however, and the relationships didn't help them.</p>
<p>The family fled Jaffa and moved into their house near Majdal, intending to be away from Jaffa for only a few days, but the Jewish militias arrived in Majdal too, and they had to flee again. This time they ended up in the al-Burj refugee camp in <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza.html" title="Gaza">Gaza</a>, then under the control of Egypt. There the family spent nine months living in tents, dependent on <a href="../../../u/n/r/UNRWA_d89c.html" title="UNRWA">UNRWA</a> for their weekly allowance of oil, rice, and potatoes. The experience had a powerful effect on Abu Nidal, who was used to wealth and servants, but who now found himself living in abject poverty. <sup id="_ref-Melman49_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman49" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The family's skill in commerce, and the small amount of money they had managed to take with them, meant they were able to set themselves up in business again as merchants, although the orange groves had gone, now part of the new <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Israel_88e9.html" title="State of Israel">State of Israel</a>, which had declared its independence on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_14.html" title="May 14">May 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>. They decided to move to <a href="../../../n/a/b/Nablus.html" title="Nablus">Nablus</a> in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>, then ruled by <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, where Abu Nidal spent his teenage years. He completed elementary school and graduated from high school in 1955. Melman writes that he loved reading, particularly adventure stories, and was regarded as studious, although not particularly bright. <sup id="_ref-Melman50_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman50" title="">[19]</a></sup> Seale writes that his education was elementary and his childish handwriting a source of great embarrassment to him throughout his life. He applied to study engineering at Cairo University, but returned to Nablus after two years without a degree, although he would later describe himself as having one, part of his constant embellishment of his past, according to Melman. <sup id="_ref-Melman50_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman50" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>He joined the Arab nationalist <a href="../../../b/a/27/Ba%27ath_party.html" title="Ba'ath party">Ba'ath party</a> when he was 18, but <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Hussein_of_Jordan_6a15.html" title="King Hussein of Jordan">King Hussein of Jordan</a> closed the party down in 1957.

<p>Abu Nidal remained very close to his mother and returned to Nablus from Saudi Arabia every year to visit her. During one of those visits in 1962, he met his future wife, Hiyam al-Bitar, whose family had also fled from Jaffa. They had a son, Nidal, and two daughters, Bisan and Na'ifa. Decades later, in the 1980s, he boasted that his daughter Bisan had no idea he was Abu Nidal. <sup id="_ref-Melman3_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman3" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>In Saudi Arabia, he helped found a small group of young Palestinians who called themselves the Palestine Secret Organization. His political activism and vocal denunciation of Israel drew the attention of his employer, Aramco, which fired him, and then the Saudi government, which imprisoned, tortured, and expelled him as an unwelcome radical. <sup id="_ref-Hudson_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hudson" title="">[20]</a></sup> He returned to Nablus with his wife and young family, and it was around this time that he joined <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasser_Arafat_cf67.html" title="Yasser Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a>'s <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatah.html" title="Fatah">Fatah</a> faction of the PLO, although the exact timing and circumstances are unknown. <sup id="_ref-Melman51_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman51" title="">[21]</a></sup> He worked as an odd-job man until June 1967, committed to Palestinian politics but not particularly active, until Israel won the 1967 <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Day_War_87dc.html" title="Six Day War">Six Day War</a>, capturing the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golan_Heights_4b58.html" title="Golan Heights">Golan Heights</a>, the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>, and the <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza_Strip_3c76.html" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a>. The sight of Israeli tanks rolling into Nablus, after he had already been forced to flee from Jaffa because of the war, and from Saudi Arabia because of his activism, was a traumatic and pivotal experience for him, according to Melman, and his passive involvement in Palestinian politics was transformed into a deadly hatred of Israel.</p>

<p>He moved to <a href="../../../a/m/m/Amman.html" title="Amman">Amman</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, setting up a trading company called Impex, and joining the Fatah underground, where he was asked to choose a <i><a href="../../../n/o/m/Nom_de_guerre.html" title="Nom de guerre">nom de guerre</a></i>. He chose Abu Nidal, in part after his son, Nidal — it's a custom in the Arab world for men to call themselves "father of" (Abu), followed by their first son's name — but also because the name means "father of the struggle." <sup id="_ref-Melman53_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melman53" title="">[4]</a></sup> He was described by those who knew him at the time as a tidy, well-organized leader, not a guerrilla; during skirmishes in Jordan between the <i><a href="../../../f/e/d/Fedayeen.html" title="Fedayeen">fedayeen</a></i> and King Hussein's troops, he stayed indoors, according to Seale, never leaving his office.</p>
<p>Impex soon became a front for Fatah activities, serving as a meeting place for members and as a conduit for funds with which to pay them. This was to become a hallmark of Abu Nidal's business career. Companies controlled by the ANO served to make him a rich man by engaging in legitimate business deals, while acting as cover for his political violence and his multi-million-dollar arms deals, mercenary activities, and protection rackets.</p>
<p>Seeing his talent for organization, Abu Iyad appointed him in 1968 as the Fatah representative in <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khartoum.html" title="Khartoum">Khartoum</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudan.html" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>, then to the same position in <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> in July 1970, just two months before <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_September_in_Jordan_1667.html" title="Black September in Jordan">Black September</a>, when King Hussein's army drove the <i>fedayeen</i> out of <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, with the loss of between 5,000 and 10,000 Palestinian lives in just ten days. Abu Nidal's absence from Jordan during this period, where it was clear that King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians, raised the suspicion within the movement that he intended only to save his own skin.</p>

<p>Just before the PLO expulsion from Jordan, and during the three years that followed it, several radical Palestinian and other Arab factions split from the PLO and began to launch their own military or terrorist attacks against Israeli military and civilian targets, as well as civilian targets overseas. These included <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Habash_9efc.html" title="George Habash">George Habash</a>'s <a href="../../../p/f/l/PFLP_1a59.html" title="PFLP">PFLP</a>, <a href="../../../d/f/l/DFLP_11f7.html" title="DFLP">DFLP</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Liberation_Front_efb0.html" title="Arab Liberation Front">Arab Liberation Front</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/-/As-Sa%27iqa_cf07.html" title="As-Sa'iqa">as-Sa'iqa</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_Liberation_Front_b372.html" title="Palestine Liberation Front">Palestine Liberation Front</a>, at that time headed by <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmed_Jibril_020b.html" title="Ahmed Jibril">Ahmed Jibril</a> who went on to set up the radical <a href="../../../p/f/l/PFLP-GC_3e05.html" title="PFLP-GC">PFLP-GC</a>, and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_September_%28group%29_7b50.html" title="Black September (group)">Black September</a>, a group of radical <i>fedayeen</i> associated with Arafat's Fatah, who carried out operations using Black September as a cover.</p>
<p>Shortly after King Hussein expelled the <i>fedayeen</i>, Abu Nidal began broadcasting criticism of the PLO over <i>Voice of Palestine</i>, the PLO's own radio station in Iraq, accusing them of cowardice for having agreed to a ceasefire with Hussein, and during Fatah's Third Congress in Damascus in 1971, Abu Nidal emerged as the leader of a leftist alliance against Arafat. Together with Abu Daoud (one of Fatah's most ruthless commanders, who was later involved in the 1972 <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_September_%28group%29_7b50.html" title="Black September (group)">Black September</a> kidnapping and killing of <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich_Massacre_e81d.html" title="Munich Massacre">11 Israeli athletes</a> at the Olympic Village in <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a>) and Palestinian intellectual Naji Allush, Abu Nidal called for Arafat to be overthrown as an enemy of the Palestinian people, and demanded more democracy within Fatah, as well as violent revenge against King Hussein. Seale writes that it was the last Fatah congress Abu Nidal would attend, but he had made his mark.</p>

Seale writes that one of the hostage-takers later admitted that his orders had been to fly the hostages back and forth until the Non-Aligned Conference had ended. After a three-day siege and the intervention of the PLO, the gunmen surrendered, though not before the Kuwaiti government had agreed to pay King Hussein $12 million in exchange for Abu Dawud, according to an interview the latter gave to Seale. <sup id="_ref-Seale92_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seale92" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

<p>Abu Nidal originally chose the name Black June for the group, in order to mark his disapproval of the 1976 Syrian intervention in Lebanon in support of the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christians</a>, but changed it to Fatah-Revolutionary Council when he switched bases from Iraq to Syria in 1981.

<p>Each new recruit was given several days to write out his entire life story by hand, including names and addresses of family members, friends, and lovers, then was required to sign a paper saying he agreed to be executed if anything was found to be untrue.

<p>By 1987, Abu Nidal had turned the full force of his terror tactics inwards on the ANO itself. Members were tortured until they confessed to betrayal and disloyalty. According to recruits who were able to escape, victims were buried alive, fed through a tube forced into their mouths, then finally killed by a bullet fired down the tube.

<p>Abu Nidal started his move from Syria to Libya in the summer of 1986. He was <i>persona non grata</i> in Syria as a result of his operations, which brought embarrassment and danger to the Syrian government. His own operations apart, Abu Nidal was taking credit for operations he had nothing to do with, adding to Syria's unease.

Abu Nidal had a steady sponsor, while Gadaffi had a mercenary in place for any operations Libyan intelligence could not carry out directly.</p>
<p>Seale reports that Libya brought out the worst in Abu Nidal; whereas before he had been dictatorial, in Libya, he became a tyrant. He would not allow members to socialize with each other; all meetings between members had to be reported to him, the prohibition applying to even the most senior members. An unreported meeting could mean death. He ordered all passports to be handed over to him. No one was allowed to travel without his permission. Ordinary members were not allowed to have a telephone; the leadership were allowed to make local calls only. Anyone traveling overseas had to stay away from duty-free stores; even the purchase of a bar of chocolate at an airport could lead to trouble. Seale writes that the pettiness was Abu Nidal's way of consolidating his power through humiliation. <sup id="_ref-Seale258_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seale258" title="">[30]</a></sup> His members did not know where he lived, knew nothing about his daily life. If he wanted to entertain a guest, he would commandeer the home of another member, whose wife was expected to cook and serve the meal at short notice. <sup id="_ref-Seale260_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seale260" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

<p>It was with the help of Libyan intelligence, while still living in Syria, that Abu Nidal carried out his most spectacular operation, and the one most damaging to the PLO.

The man who organized the attacks was the ANO's head of the Intelligence Directorate's Committee for Special Missions, Dr. Ghassan al-Ali. Sources close to Abu Nidal said that Libyan intelligence had supplied the weapons.

<p>According to Atef Abu Bakr, a former senior member of the ANO, Gaddafi asked Abu Nidal to organize a series of revenge attacks against the U.S. and Britain, in cooperation with the head of Libyan intelligence, Abdullah al-Senussi. Abu Nidal first arranged for two British school teachers, Leigh Douglas and Philip Padfield, and an American, Peter Kilburn, to be kidnapped in Lebanon. Their bodies were found in a village east of Beirut on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_17.html" title="April 17">April 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, wrapped in white cloth and with gunshot wounds to the head.

<p>Allegedly angered by this failure, according to Atef Abu Bakr, Senussi told Abu Nidal to supply a bomb and Libyan intelligence would arrange for it to be placed on a flight.

The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> has written that he was Hasan Sabri al-Banna; the <i>Middle East International</i> has said he was Muhammad Sabri al-Banna. According to Stewart Steven, who has written about the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossad.html" title="Mossad">Mossad</a>, he was Sabri Khalil al-Banna or Mazan Sabri al-Banna. The name Khalil comes from his father; it is an Arab tradition that the father's name be added to the son's. Al-Banna means "the builder."
