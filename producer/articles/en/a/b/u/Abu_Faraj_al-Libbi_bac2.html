His real name is thought to be <b>Mustafa al-'Uzayti</b><sup id="_ref-odniAbuFaraj_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-odniAbuFaraj" title="">[1]</a></sup>. He was arrested by Pakistan's <a href="../../../i/n/t/Inter-Services_Intelligence_9c5f.html" title="Inter-Services Intelligence">ISI</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2.html" title="May 2">May 2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mardan.html" title="Mardan">Mardan</a> (30 miles north of <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshawar.html" title="Peshawar">Peshawar</a>). Finding al-Libi was a joint effort of the United States and Pakistan. He is now in American military custody in the <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp_1ca5.html" title="Guantanamo Bay detention camp">Guantanamo Bay detention camp</a><sup id="_ref-odniAbuFaraj_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-odniAbuFaraj" title="">[1]</a></sup>, having previously been held at some secret location<sup id="_ref-admitted_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-admitted" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In August 2004 Pakistani officials stated that al-Libbi (also known as Abu Faraj Farj) had become "number three" in al-Qaeda as "director of operations", a rôle once filled by <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalid_Sheikh_Mohammed_74f4.html" title="Khalid Sheikh Mohammed">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a><sup id="_ref-CTV_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CTV" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-MSNBC_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MSNBC" title="">[4]</a></sup>. Upon al-Libbi's arrest U.S. and Pakistani authorities continued to claim him as the third most important figure in al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> report, he was riding <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pillion.html" title="Pillion">pillion</a> on a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorbike.html" title="Motorbike">motorbike</a> when he and his driver were ambushed by Pakistani agents, some of whom were wearing <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burqa.html" title="Burqa">burqas</a> <sup id="_ref-BBC2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC2" title="">[5]</a></sup>. While being apprehended, al-Libbi tried to destroy a notebook, which U.S. officials are now trying to decode. The events leading up to the ambush began with US agents intercepting a mobile phone call made by al-Libbi. They zeroed in his location to a busy road a quarter of a mile away on the outskirts of Mardan, about 75 miles northwest of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamabad.html" title="Islamabad">Islamabad</a>, and tipped-off Pakistani authorities. Plainclothes Pakistani agents arrived in Mardan and hung out, waiting for him to arrive.</p>
<p>Abi Faraj al-Libbi was named by <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistani</a> authorities as the main planner of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_transatlantic_aircraft_plot.html" title="2006 transatlantic aircraft plot">2006 transatlantic aircraft plot</a><sup id="_ref-Guardian_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Guardian" title="">[6]</a></sup>.

<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/s/_/US_District_Court_a227.html" title="US District Court">US District Court</a> Justice <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joyce_Hens_Green_0521.html" title="Joyce Hens Green">Joyce Hens Green</a> ruled that the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were unconstitutional.

<p>The transcript for Guantanamo Abu Faraj Al Libbi was eight pages long. It said that he did not choose to attend his Tribunal.

An enemy combatant has been defined as "an individual who was part of or supporting the Taliban or al Qaida forces, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.

The same source also stated that the detainee managed the guest house, and the guest house also served as the Kabul communications hub for Al-Qaida. The detainee was the supervisor of an al Qaida communications site in Afghanistan, in 2002. The detainee was a senior al Qaida facilitator. His primary duty was the care of al Qaida families residing in Pakistan. Additionally, the detainee was involved in vetting and transporting al Qaida fighters to Afghanistan. Individuals wanting to fight in Afghanistan were required to be sponsored by an al Qaida member and be interviewed by the detainee to verify their bona fides. Once the detainee, a former commander in Afghanistan, was comfortable with the individual's background, the detainee would arrange travel to Afghanistan for the individual. The detainee would arrange travel to Afghanistan for the individual.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Faraj_al-Libbi_bac2.html" title="Edit section: Statement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Statement</span></h3>
<p>Abu Faraj al-Libbi asked his Personal Representative to read the following statement to his Tribunal:</p>
<p>Mr. President and board <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup> members of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal; I Mustafa Al Libi thank you for your time. It is my opinion the forming of this Tribunal is a good initial step towards justice and righteousness. I was informed by my Personal Representative that this Tribunal is purely a military administrative procedure and is not based on the Judicial Procedure of the United States. In regards to this issue I offer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Tribunal should have been a procedure in accordance with the Judicial Procedure of the United States. I have been held by the United States for over two years without any indication of how the judicial system is going to deal with my situation. This is a very long period of time without being subject to a court of justice.</li>
<li>The handling and reviewing or determining of my Enemy Combatant status and legality of my detainment by the United States is a judicial matter and not administrative as described in the Combatant Status Review Tribunal are incomplete for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>No lawyer, either assigned to the detainee or by the detainee's choosing, has been made available to the detainee to assist in determining the nature of the evidence against him, its legality and its validity as evidence. The detainee needs legal guidance as to what kind of testimonies and statements are enough to refute the evidence presented against him.</li>
<li>The lack of protections against detention or other legal or administrative actions make it impossible for me to produce any witnesses in my defense. For example the definition of Enemy Combatant includes the verbiage "supporting the Taliban or al Qaida forces, or associated forces". If I am classified as an Enemy Combatant, it is possible that the United States will deem my witnesses are Enemy Combatants and judicial or administrative action may be taken against them. It is my opinion the detainee is in a lose-lose situation.</li>
<li>If not classified as an Enemy Combatant the detainee may not get released immediately. I was informed by my Personal Representative that the detainee would be released once arrangements could be made. This means from military custody. It is possible the detainee would still be retained by the United States.</li>
<li>If the detainee is classified as an Enemy Combatant, he won't be transferred directly to the United States Judicial System but will remain under supervision of the Military. He will then meet the Annual Review Board indefinitedly to review the detention status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr. President and members of the board <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup>, to summarize, I don't find myself attending the Tribunal unless the above mentioned factors are resolved such as being represented by a lawyer and legal protection for myself or my witnesses. I am extremely keen to exercise my rights fully according to the law of the United States.</p>
<p>This process, the processes associated with my detention are extremely important to me and my family and could prove detrimental to our well being. I am not prepared to have this matter linked to a mere "administrative procedure" where I don't fully understand the ramifications and extent of the process.</p>
<p>Finally, I do not believe the Combatant Status Review Tribunal process is a complete process. The United States Government is fully represented while I have not been given the same opportunities. Mr President and members of the board <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup>, thank you for your attention and consideration during my statement.</p>
<p>I affirm that these words are my words and truth as I know it, signed and dated.</p>
