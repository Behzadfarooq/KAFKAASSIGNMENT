<p>Shi'a have a very dim view of Abu Sufyan, seeing his conversion as nothing more than a act of necessity. Shi'a also note that Ali refused his helped during the succession of Muhammad, and also note how Abu Sufyan's son became a ardent enemy of Ali.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The logic of Abu Sufyan's acceptance of Islam is believed to be more of a political one than a serious change of heart or sudden spiritual enlightenment.

<dd>I removed the non-Muslim view, since i didnt put it there, but the Sunni view is easly confirmed by going to the highligheted link. The Shi'a view is actualy quite bening compared to the real Shi'a view. I dont remeber right now witch book i saw the "helping ali" part, but that is a undisputed Shi'a view. I know it must be better sourced, but please consired how ill sourced the rest of the article is, and also that it can be hard to find sources for detailed maters. Its not like i added anything controversial. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 17:11, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Striver, The link you've referenced is an internal link to another Wikipedia article and Wikipedia cannot be a reference for itself. Besides, the article linked to isn't exactly verified by a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable source</a> as the views appear to be primarily based on [<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/1424/Sahaba.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/1424/Sahaba.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> link to a Geocities site. As for the Shi'a view, it has nothing to do with how benign the view is or whether it is controversial... it has to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiably</a> referenced by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable sources</a>. If you can remember the book name, then the text can be added back with an appropriate reference (and if you don't know how to add a cited reference from a book to an article, I'd be happy to show you), but it has to be cited first before it gets added back into the article. Yes, the whole rest of the article needs to be better sourced as well, but that isn't an excuse for adding in more unsourced material. Like I said above, I dumped the text here so it can be added back easily once sourcing is found, but sourcing <b>has</b> to be found before it is added back to the article.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:53, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Because the rest of the article is rather long... it will probably take me a few days to get through the whole thing, read the sources provided, find additional sources, and edit the article down to verifiability. Please don't take it personally... to be honest I had no idea that section was your only addition to the article until you stated that here.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 02:01, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I couldn't find anything to support either of those claims.

<dd>Bro, thanks for alerting me on the talk page. I did see that, and i made some leghty effort to compare it with on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abu_Sufyan_ibn_Harb&amp;oldid=39686710" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abu_Sufyan_ibn_Harb&amp;oldid=39686710" rel="nofollow">of my previous versions</a>. Im quite confindent i did a good job, but ill take a second look. I am quite familiar with Abu sufyans life and geneology, so i if i decide to leave something unsourced, chanses are good im so sure its right that wikipedia wont risk anything by keeping it. But ill take another try at it. I appreciate our coopeteration! --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 20:24, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I just read the family section, and its 100% safe, it just mentions his wife and daughter, and his geneology back, and that is comon knowledge for those in the field. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 20:27, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Striver, I reverted your change because it looks like you took the article back to the version that attributes information and quotes about Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith to Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, which is what I'm trying to clean up here. Probably a better thing to do would be to take the version I have right now and add to it with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> information rather that revert back to earlier versions that contain factual inaccuracies.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:09, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've tagged 2 things that need cites. I'm not concerned with if the information is controversial...

<dd>I truly agree that they need to be sourced. It is probable that i added them in the article sometime, and added a references to it at that time to this or some other article, but i cant find it now&#160;:( However, i am <b>sure</b> that i have read that, so let it be taged till i stubmle on those lines again. I gave it a short search, and found something else to add. As for lineage, ill keep it mind and i will add it as stumble on the references while i research. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 15:57, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, wait a minute! Muawiyas article says he was born 602, while Ramlah's article says she was born in "c. 595".

<p>It was me that added it. Since it is souced to a non-Shi'a source, i have to say that i have a hard time accepting your arguement. It is true that i found the reference in Answering-Ansar, but the original references goes to the <a href="../../../m/u/27/Mu%27tazili.html" title="Mu'tazili">Mu'tazili</a> <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Abu_al-Hadid_e8a3.html" title="Ibn Abu al-Hadid">Ibn Abu al-Hadid</a>. See <a href="../../../l/a/y/Layla_binte_Harmalah_a479.html" title="Layla binte Harmalah">Layla binte Harmalah</a> for all the references. I can understand that you object to the statment, but you need to substantiate it. Give me a source that disputes this, and we will move it into a "view" section. As for "Removed another blatent slander, everyone who opposed Ali must be a basterd!!" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abu_Sufyan_ibn_Harb&amp;curid=2183689&amp;diff=62380270&amp;oldid=62378928" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abu_Sufyan_ibn_Harb&amp;curid=2183689&amp;diff=62380270&amp;oldid=62378928" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, ill just quote a Sunni scholar:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Imam of Ahl'ul Sunnah Qutubadeen Shirazi in his book "Nizhaath Quloob Munkool az Isthakhsa al Fahm" page 981 states:</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"A child born out of fornication is better due to the fact that a man does so with complete effort and enjoyment, whilst a child conceived legitimately only pleases his wife. A child born from fornication is more clever, that is why Amr bin Aas and Mu'awiya bin Abu Sufyan were great politicians and are counted as amongst the people of deception, the greatest politician from this group was Ziyad bin Ubayya".</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Is site where i found the material biased? Sure. Is it polecmic? Sure. But the sources are there, and they are hundreds of years old. I know that the Sunnis belive in the <a href="../../../u/p/r/Uprightness_of_all_Sahaba_4418.html" title="Uprightness of all Sahaba">Uprightness of all Sahaba</a> and rather not thing that they practiced fornication, but if they did not, then why do Sunnis insiste that Nikah Mut'ah was a shortly lived necesity solution since they could not control their urges?</p>
<p>I have given sources, i have quoted a Sunni scholar that agree and i have pointed out that Sunnis belive that somce of the Sahaba had such a great problem controling theyr chastity that they needed to do Mut'ah.</p>
<p>I ague that what i have presented suffices for including the sources in the main article as fact, as long as no other sources reject them. Dont forget that fornication is nothing special in un-Islamic societies, in the west, its does not even raise a eyebrow to be a out-of-wedlock child. What make you think the Mushrik enemies of Allah cared? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 17:16, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It was between you and Isotope, so it was you! do you fulfill the image I painted? Was I close? So instead of Shi'a sources it were heretics that you were quoting!! Should I cry or should I laugh? Anyway I don't care who they were, they are not a historical source, do you have a historical source (eg. <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarikh_al-Rusul_wa_al-Muluk_0b1a.html" title="Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk">Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk</a>)?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If YOU claim something, you have to "substantiate it" and not with a LINK to some book, by someone <i>unknown</i> but to a real history, a real recording of events as told by one man to another!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Sunni scholar" what does that mean?? <b>This guy isn't an Islamic scholar</b>, a <a href="../../../u/l/e/Ulema.html" title="Ulema">Alam</a>, this is some writer at the end of an era, at a time of decadence and decay writing blatant apostasy, probably to get in favor with some rich bastard, by praising all basterds! "Sunni scholar" he is not, you can quote his complete writings, won't do you any good.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So you admit that the material is "biased" and "polemic" and yet you want to add it to the middle of an encyclopedia article without any context! "Sources" are not just links to articles on some website, come on...be fair my friend, whether Sunni or Shi’a let us at least be fair!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You have given links to "biased" websites, quoted some degenerate decadent writer who happened to be descended from Sunni’s, come on, be fair...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What you presented does not suffice to slander people who lived 1400 years ago, no matter who they were! It does not matter what other people think of fornication (Name the country where fornication is normal? I hope you won't say the USA, because it is NOT) it was bad in their own culture (even before Islam), you can't present slander and then demand that I present sources that "reject" it, <b>NO</b>, you have to give a real historical source (not just a link to an English page! Who translated all these works?) that quotes real people who knew these people, then demand whatever you want!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I hope we can work together to improve this page, you shouldn't take what I say as anything personal and you should know that I consider all Muslims as Muslims (and all human beings as human beings) without further distinction.

<dd>If someone should come to this page by chance he would think of the two major figures who opposed the Imam Ali: <i>One was a bastard son of a whore and the other a bastard son of an adulteress</i>! Can you with all fairness and honesty, and God as your witness, say it is not political slander; that was only thought of after the death of the Imam Ali?!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The funny thing is if the Imam Ali himself heard you say such things, he would give you eighty lashes for each claim, even if he knows that it’s the truth! Because you simply can’t produce four good Muslim men who saw the fornication for themselves, anything less is <i>technically</i> slander (Qathif)!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I, personally, don’t like to repeat such “political slander”, even when it concerns, for example, the last <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_of_Hesse_d151.html" title="Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse">empress of Russia</a>, I was very upset when a film about <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rasputin.html" title="Rasputin">Rasputin</a> enacted some of the slander told about her in her time, and she he had the blood of millions on her hand!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Are you so sure of your place in heaven that you so confidently claim this and that about those who prayed behind the <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed.html" title="Mohammed">Rasool</a>? Abu Sufyan lost both his eyes to God, his son led the first of four armies sent to Syria by Abu Baker, his daughter was a mother of the believers, and his other son wrote the Quran down from the Rasool personally! And the Rasool himself pardoned Hind and accepted her Islam and even blessed her herd!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With all due respect, my friend, you can’t even read the Quran and understand it for yourself! Instead of repeating slander, go <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Arabic" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Arabic">learn something useful</a> for your life and afterlife. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelftUser_6de3.html" title="User:DelftUser">DelftUser</a> 12:16, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry for the late answer. Bro, as for "Can you with all fairness and honesty, and God as your witness, say it is not political slander": I can say that i am <i>not</i> confident that it is political slader.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Point one: This is about jahiliya customs.</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, this kind of acts represent the infedility of the mushrik Meccan. You seem to imply that this kind of behavior is totaly unaccaptable. Bro, lets step back a few steps. First of all, they were not even Sahaba at the time of those events. And not even that, they were not even enemies of Islam, the event occured even before that, in the Jahiliya. You know, the period of time when <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a> was a drunk and used to worship idols. That period.</p>
<p>Why do you think it was called jahiliya? You think they ignored everything, but were chaste in regards to sex? In sweden, they call themselves Christian, but they <i><b>openly</b></i> advocate homosexuality:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Under the amendment intended to take effect March 1, 2000, non-Swedish homosexual couples who have lived in Sweden for at least two years will be eligible for registration. <a href="http://www.ilga.info/Information/Legal_survey/europe/sweden.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ilga.info/Information/Legal_survey/europe/sweden.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>They even <i><b>sue</b></i> anti-homosexual priests! Look at <a href="../../../%C3%A5/k/e/%C3%85ke_Green_3d99.html" title="Åke Green">Åke Green</a>, he was sued for condeming homosexuality. I assure you, in sweden, they do '<i><b>not</b></i> regard zina as least objectionable, they show pornographic material to children as part of "sexual education" clases and they <b>encourage</b> them to have pre-maritial relations, they even hand out free condoms in schools.</p>
<p>There are plenty of societies that do not regard zina as objectionable, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution_in_Germany_8790.html" title="Prostitution in Germany">Prostitution in Germany is legal and widespread</a>. And we are talking about so called Christian contries, what makes you so convinced that the Jahilya mushriks were so much better?</p>
<p>I want a answer to this, what makes you belive that it was a unthinkable crime for the jahiliya mushriks to comit zina?</p>
<ul>
<li>Point two: You regard even pree Khaybar Sahaba as having problem from keeping from Zina.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the jahiliya mushriks really viewd zina as objectionable, then please answer why you regards the Sahaba so incapable of keeping from zina that you belive the Prophet had to give them permision to make Mut'ha`? According to your scholars, Mut'ah was forbiden in Khaybar or at the conquest of Mecca, and your scholars argue that the reason it was practiced two-three times is that the Sahaba were (astakhfurillah) <i><b>unable'</b> to withhold from zina! And we are not even talking about Abu Sufyan, he was not even among the Sahaba then, but we are talking about pree-conquest Sahaba!</i></p>
<p>I want a answer to my second question, if zina was considered so objectionable during the jahiliya, why do your scholars view the Ansar and Muhajireen as unable to withold from zina?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Point three: It is not slander if they endorse it.</li>
<li>Point Four: Why did he not consider it objectionable <i>while</i> being a caliph?</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding "anything less is <i>technically</i> slander". It is not "my slander", i am citing sources. And in any case, it is hardly slander when they do it in the open, did'nt Muawiyah declare <a href="../../../z/i/y/Ziyad_ibn_Abihi_0e9f.html" title="Ziyad ibn Abihi">Ziyad ibn Abihi</a> as his brother, in direct violation to the shariah? If he was able to declare a open zina-born as his brother <i>while</i> being a caliph, what makes you think it is so unthinkable that he himself was ibn zina?</p>
<p>Please answer point three and four.</p>
<p>Regarding "I, personally, don’t like to repeat such “political slander”". Well, who does? But we are writing a biography, arent we?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Point Five: are we supposed to ignore such reports?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
As for: "Are you so sure of your place in heaven that you so confidently claim this and that about those who prayed behind the Rasool?"</p>
<p>First of all, he was not praying behind the rasool at that time, he was praying behind Hubal or some other ghayrallah. At that time, Umar was occupied strangliing her five year old daughter and buring her. It is <b>that</b> time we are talking about. <b>I</b> am not claiming Abu Sufyan did zina, i would never claim anything about people. What i am doing is presenting the reports of people. Now, please answer me, are we supposed to ignore such reports? Are we supposed to censure wikipedia of any <b>reports</b> of zina on the grounds of Sharia? please read again how i formulated it:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>He was <b>rumored</b> to have a relation with Layla binte Harmalah, the mother of Amr ibn al-A'as</i></dd>
<dd><i>However, <b>controversial</b> Muslim <b>sources state</b> that the marriage to Muawiyah's mother was arranged since</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Is that slander by me, or reporting controverial relevant facts on notable characters? Please do note that nowhere does it state that he <b>did</b> zina, just that there are (true or false) controverial reports and rumors to that effect. Bro, he might have done a thousand good things, but i do not belive in expunging biographical data. I try to build a <i>comprehensice</i> encyclopedia. If there are "objectionable" reports on say, Imam Ali, i would not oppose its inclusion in a NPOV manner.</p>
<p>As for "With all due respect, my friend, you can’t even read the Quran and understand it for yourself! Instead of repeating slander, go <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Arabic" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Arabic">learn something useful</a> for your life and afterlife."</p>
<p>Lets not use <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_hominem.html" title="Argumentum ad hominem">argumentum ad hominem</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, now that it is said, lets instead focus on finding a solution that keeps us all happy. Here are my questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is the article not accurate and disputed as it is now?</li>
<li>How can we solve thos problems?</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you find some source that disputes this claims, we should add those sources to the article.</p>

<dd>Further, let us that have a expertise in the area determine what must be deleted if unsourced, saying that "Shi'a do not like Abu Sufyan" demands just as little sourcing as stating "the Sun is bright". --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 13:37, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Sorry Striver, that is not how it works. In fact, it is just the opposite. If it requires "expertise" in an area to determine if something is factual or accurate than it most definitely <i>must</i> be sourced. Remember, you are not writing for an encyclopedia, not some arcane work. Things that are unsourced should be deleted and if you disagree you need to find sourcing for it, then add the text back along with the sourcing (like you did in this case). Remember, just because a statement appears obvious to you <i>does not mean it is obvious to the average person viewing an article</i>. The average reader of en.wikipedia can go outside and see that the sun is indeed bright, but without sourcing they have no way of verifying, quanifying, or finding out why the Shi'a have such a negative view of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb. That is why the sourcing is imperative... and sorry on the Refs and External links sections; looks like I missed them when I was reformatting it.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:49, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
