<p>I have deleted the {{quotefarm}} template at the top of the page, which was unnecessary and inapplicable. For reference, this template looked like:</p>
<div class="messagebox cleanup metadata">This article or section <b>seems to contain too many quotations for an encyclopedia entry</b>.<br />
<span style="font-size:90%">Please improve the article or discuss proposed changes on the talk page.<br />
You can <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEditing_dd53.html" title="Help:Editing">edit</a> the article to add more encyclopaedic text or link the article to a page of quotations, possibly <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse" class="extiw" title="wikiquote:Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse">one of the same name</a>, on Wikiquote. See Wikipedia's <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">guide to writing better articles</a> for further suggestions.</span></div>
<p><br />
<b>Every</b> quotation on the page is relevant and on-topic. Many of the quotes are first-hand accounts from victims of, witnesses to, or participants in abuse or torture. The "Reactions" section is perhaps quote-heavy, but that's the whole point of the section.</p>
<p>The text "You can edit the article to add more encyclopaedic text or link the article to a page of quotations, possibly one of the same name, on Wikiquote." seems to indicate that the template was not intended for this usage, anyway. The article as it stands is not short of encyclopaedic text, and it is not a "page of quotations". (A page of quotations relating to Abu Ghraib might be perfectly reasonable on WikiQuote, but it wouldn't look very much like this article.)</p>
<p>As for whether it is encyclopaedic in style, one could equally well argue that the style of printed encyclopaedias is too sparing with quotations, at least for some topics. -- DavidHopwood 02:46, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I notice that there are a lot of assumptions here, such as that it is TRUE that people were fed into plastic shredders and so on at this site. Have there been any bloody plastic shredders found? Any evidence aside from the claims of Saddam's opponents? I hate to be devils advocate here, and thats not even what I'm trying to do. I just think we should maintain some objectivity and not just assume that just because the country that most of us live in has invaded Iraq, means that everything bad we hear about Iraq or Saddam is true.</p>
<p>Also, note that Ahmed Chalabi and the INC have at least partially admitted that they knowingly fed the US false information about such things. Lets make an effort to produce facts rather than repeating propaganda. Thanks.</p>

<p>At some point, the fact of allegations, specifically what they are and where they originate, ought to be included, even if controversial and even if the actual events are not yet verifiable by means commonly available. Specifically, some latitude is needed when corroboration is merely hearsay. At some point after all, much of what we think we know depends on a level of trust in the source, especially if we do not have the physical proof in front of our eyes. I think stating that these serious allegations exist is vital -- with the caveat that they are also questioned in some circles (along with any basis of those questions). Otherwise, simply ignoring the topic can only incite distrust, and hinder the fleshing out of substance when more solidly verifiable facts are known -- which could take a while. -- rg</p>

Votes, preferably with short comments explaining the reasoning behind the vote, are invited from every registered user of Wikipedia. (Unregistered users can comment.) A consensus is (theoretically) required to delete an article. As I write, besides the implicit delete vote of the nomination, there are four <b>delete</b> votes and one <b>keep</b> vote. I'm abstaining, myself, until more watchers/editors of the main article here share their opinions.

<p>By my count the VfD for the no-pictures version got 25 delete votes, 3 keep votes and 1 abstain vote. Furthermore, many of the delete votes specifically cited <i>philosophical</i> disagreement with the existence of the page rather than simply worrying about the practicalities of how to keep the two versions in sync. The Cool Hand Luke technique is very clever, yes, but I don't think it solves the basic problem many people have with this no-pictures version and IMO the results of the VfD should stand. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:16, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I created a "no pictures" version of this article using the article itself as a template. Two template parameters are enbedded in this article, {{{morbid warning}}} at the top of the page and {{{suppress image}}} which is included in each potentially objectionable image tag after the pixel width.</p>
<p>Thus, the uncensored article pulls up with Template:Morbid warning at the top of the page in between curly brackets (this is default for named parameters). I've made the brackets unnoticeable in by turning them white. The image tags are rendered with garbage in them pointing to the non-extant "supress image" template. However, this does not affect the article because it's thrown out by the image tag parser. Therefore, the article is almost unchanged in presentation.</p>
<p>However, I've enclosed all potentionally objectionable images in <code>div</code>s. When the censored version pulls up, it displays text that would be under each image without any horizontal constraint. Thus, to prevent censored image descriptions from spilling across the censored article, I put them all in constraining divs.</p>
<p>Censoring works because the "supress image" parameter is set to "-5px" in the censored version, causing image display to error out. The "morbid image" parameter is set so that a completely different box at the top of the censored article informs readers that it is such and points back here.</p>
<p>This solution is clever because both versions use the same article for content. From the censored version, heading editing works normally, but if a user attempts to edit the whole article I've inserted a comment explaining that they must do it here. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke"><font color="purple">Luke</font></a> 04:51, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article is special becuase the pictures positively must be in the article, but said pictures upset enough users that they created a fork of the page. This was naturally unnacceptable, but because of the graphic nature of these photos (many of which were not run in major news outlets), a warning has been on this article since summer. Adding a link to template mirror seemed a harmless afterthought.</dd>

<p>I don't really understand where we got this "the pictures upset a lot of people" rationale for omission of pictures or putting additional warnings up. This is an encyclopedia, not a television program. People come to this article precisely <i>because</i> they are interested in the abuse, rape and murder of prisoners at Abu Ghraib by US armed forces, CIA members and contractors. If they think they might be upset, they don't have to read the article. We have site-wide content disclaimers on every page, explicitly stating: <i>Wikipedia contains many different images, some of which are considered objectionable or offensive by some readers. For example, some articles contain graphical depictions of violence, or photographs of human anatomy.</i> --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:58, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I too am at a loss. When I voted to delete it the second time, I complained that it was bad precedent to set up something like this, and that there were plenty of other articles that this philosophy would apply equally to that were currently without uncensored versions. Alkivar tried to reassure me that this mechanism would be applied to those other articles over time as well. But that's exactly what I was complaining about, that's what "<i>bad precedent</i>" means. This is a fundamental disagreement with the philosophy of what's been done here, and I am only becoming more convinced of that. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 17:34, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>By what authority has someone (Cool Hand Luke or whoever) decided what pictures should and what pictures shouldn't be censored? Why is is that there is no insistence that we have censorship around the picture A, but we MUST have censorship tags around B? <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 11:46, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, due to the number of pictures here and the fact that someone cared enough to make a fork of this page (which was completely unacceptable), I thought a novel solution might satisfy those that wanted this version (and there are quite a few), while simultaneously avoiding the problems inherent to a fork. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke"><font color="purple">Luke</font></a> 21:52, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This point is 100% moot, the Lynching photo is not a legit image according to wikipedia standards. Its copyrighted to a point where we cant use it, and will likely be deleted at the end of the week. Besides that fact, I believe this should not be included either. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a>™<a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 02:52, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tell me which of those pages has a stable (tacit consensus) content disclaimer. This solution requires one, so any page that does not have one could not use this solution.

<dd>Why should it have a content disclaimer, and more than any of the other pages? What difference does that fact make anyway? What is so special about the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse page that means it deserves this special treatment. What is so disturbing about image B in particular that it requires censorship? <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 09:07, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I notice that there are a large number of pictures on this page, not just B, and the volume of pictures presumably merited the disclaimer (I can't speak for all the other editors that didn't remove it). I now think the only satisfactory way to offer an alternate version is to turn all of the images off in the alternate. That resolves the POV problem to an extent and allows moving back to "(no pictures)". Unless there are objections, I think we should do that. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke"><font color="purple">Luke</font></a> 09:17, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No it does not resolve the POV issue at all it merely obfuscates it. You are still declaring that one or more of the images are too "shocking" to show. That is your POV. This censored page , whatever you call it can have no justification under NPOV. The declared aim (so that children or people of a nervous disposition can read it) is not justified when viewed in relation to the numerous other articles on Wikipedia that contain images that might be seen as more shocking by one or more people. I would draw your attention to the article at <a href="../../../e/r/e/Erection.html" title="Erection">Erection</a>, shall we have Erection (no pictures) for the same reason? In some cultures it is "shocking" for a woman to be seen with uncovered hair. Must all of the pages on Wikipedia that contain pictures of women with uncovered hair, have "(no picture)" duplicates if a large enough and vocal enough minority object to it? <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 09:33, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No: we are declaring no such thing, these pictures are obviously not too shocking to show. The article shows the pictures, and I think that in this case people <i>ought</i> to view this pictures—it's important to understand the horror of what happened. However, I also realize this is my POV, and if demonstrably not shared by other editors. Actually censoring articles (as is done here by bluring the pictures) should not be done, but allowing a sizable group to see an article in a more useful form helps a collaborative encyclopedia. Ultimately software will make this moot, but until then, <i>yes</i>, every article with such a significant minority should qualify for an alternate presentation. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke"><font color="purple">Luke</font></a> 09:53, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You say "slippery slope arguments are not strong" - but you have also said "every article with such a significant minority should qualify for an alternate presentation" - you have thereby said that this article has set a precedent by which others may follow - if this isn't a slippery slope then I don't know what is. You say "Editors who object would have the alternate version." - but in order to make any significant changes to the article editors must edit (and therefore view) the uncensored version.

<dd>Well, a slippery slope argument implies that something will get <i>worse</i> in the future, and you specifically offered such a scenario—claiming baselessly that the fundamentalist might form a union and demand these versions all over the place. I find that a very tenuous slippery slope argument. However, I believe precedent for this solution as an interim measure for hotly contested articles is quite desirable.</dd>
<dd>Actually, one <i>can</i> edit the article without viewing it by using section editing. However, one is shuttled to the full version after saving, which might surprise some editors, but that's the limitation of this temporary solution. I don't expect the benefit to be yeilded on these articles anyhow; the reward is keeping contributers here in general. I doubt those offended by pictures of a <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">clitoris</a>, for example, will have much to contribute there, but on other subjects they may be very valuable to the project. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke"><font color="purple">Luke</font></a> 10:17, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some may claim that, that what you claim to be baseless is already underway, but not from fundamentalist Muslims but from fundamentalist Christians and Jews. You just have to look at the arguments raging on pages that they tend to edit. One might argue that the conventional North American Christian viewpoint permeates right through this encyclopaedia, albeit hotly contested on certain articles. As I stated on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Democracy_on_Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#Democracy_on_Wikipedia</a>, and as a number of people have concurred, on many articles if one doesn't conform to the conventional mores and norms of the United States there is a tendancy for one's contributions to get shouted down. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a>

<dd>I don't see this solution as POV, but you seem to believe that consensus decision making—one of the core wikipedia principles—will fail us. I'm not so pessemistic, but I certainly believe in opposing problems when they arrise. With few exceptions, the Christians who dominate articles about their own religion have not paid much attention to censorship. Moreover, they're typically ineffective with dogmatic insistance, say, that an image is pornography. If and when the fundamentalist come out of the woodwork to censor everything in sight, I'll oppose them with you. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke"><font color="purple">Luke</font></a> 19:39, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do believe that the consensus decision making process is flawed because it can be hi-jacked by certain interest groups. As far as I'm concerned this is exactly what has happened here. By pandering to this vocal minority you have violated the principles of NPOV. You have decided that we must have a censored version and you have made a blanket decision that all of the pictures of abuse should be censored out, that none of them can be shown on the censored version. Good gried the Pentagon wanted to spuppress the pictures before their original publication and put heavy pressure on CBS not to show them. These pictures were splashed across the front pages of every newspaper in Europe and most of the world. It appears that only in the USA were these pictures and the story surrounding them suppressed in some way. Look at <a href="../../../a/b/u/Talk%7EAbu_Ghraib_prison_archive1_c8b8.html#Media_coverage" title="Talk:Abu Ghraib prison/archive1">Talk:Abu_Ghraib_prison/archive1#Media coverage</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/u/Talk%7EAbu_Ghraib_prison_archive1_c8b8.html#News_coverage_data" title="Talk:Abu Ghraib prison/archive1">Talk:Abu_Ghraib_prison/archive1#News coverage data</a>. Although various people objectied to the pictures being included in Wikipedia and acted to suppress them in the article, NPOV triumphed. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 23:32, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm very glad that it did. There were also attempts to limit the number of pictures by saying <i>X article only has 8 pictures</i> and so forth, but this article is exceptional in my view. I think this is an unusually important article, and don't believe users should have any excuse not to look at it, but if they don't want to the text alone ought to be available; it's better than nothing. I don't wish to be dogmatic with my POV that people (especially Americans) <i>should</i> see the whole article. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke"><font color="purple">Luke</font></a> 04:04, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All the images we can present on this case should be made available. If there are specific problems with the content black boxes can be employed. Naturally we can present the link with a content warning, but that would be likely to attract attention of children etc. The current solution to mention that further material is on wikimedia and showing images that were on newspaper covers should be no problem. Being on a cover(children do see covers) or in an article of a freely available(no age restriction) international magazine can be used as a criteria to determine what can be presented and what not. Similar would be articles on pornography where we don't have to show things in all details. Naturally there are cultural variations, but with BBC, newsweek and the like we probably cover the mainstream. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 22:59, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's probably my mistake, I uploaded the (<a href="../../../upload/shared/6/6a/Abu_Ghraib_56.jpg" class="internal" title="Abu Ghraib 56.jpg">Media:Abu Ghraib 56.jpg</a>) version, however the site it came from stated it took place at Abu Ghraib. It could be from Guantanamo, however <a href="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/" class="external free" title="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/</a> has it listed as published by the Washington post, and all of the rest on the whole page is Abu Ghraib. Easy to see why it could be a mistake. Other than that I couldnt tell you which its actually from. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a>™<a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 00:04, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looks like Abu Ghraib to me. The sickening thing is that similar torture and intimidation happen at both. The other photos don't show orange jumpsuits at Abu Ghraib, though they were often naked. This picture is included in some galleries (<a href="http://billandkent.com/gallery/abu-gharib-torture-photos" class="external autonumber" title="http://billandkent.com/gallery/abu-gharib-torture-photos" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.american-buddha.com/abu.ghraib.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.american-buddha.com/abu.ghraib.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), and more importantly the Gaurdian says it was first published in <i>Washington Post</i> in May as an Abu Ghraib picture <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/gall/0,8542,1211872,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/gall/0,8542,1211872,00.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. They even have a story dated in may concerning it<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1221726,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1221726,00.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. This explains why the picture isn't showing up on the many articles detailing the authorization of dogs and other torture at Guantanamo Bay. Logically, the military would not want these to get out because, as you've said, it's easier to ignore without the photos. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke"><font color="purple">Luke</font></a> 00:09, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello --</p>
<p>I notice that the title for the article follows the practice of the major US news outlets in referring to "prisoner abuse."</p>
<p>This is <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphemism.html" title="Euphemism">euphemism</a> in a political context and with a clear political intent, bordering on <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doublespeak.html" title="Doublespeak">doublespeak</a>. It is neither accurate nor neutral.</p>
<p>If we were to ask 100 persons what single word best describes the following acts ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting attack dogs upon prisoners</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Beating detainees (in some cases to death)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Slamming detainee against a wall, thus creating a wound requiring stitches</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Attaching wire to detainee's penis</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Raping female detainees</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sodomizing male detainees with objects</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Urinating on detainees (see NEW YORK TIMES January 12, 2005)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jumping on detainee's leg (a limb already wounded by gunfire) with such force that it could not thereafter heal properly (see NEW YORK TIMES January 12, 2005)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Continuing by pounding detainee's wounded leg with collapsible metal baton (see NEW YORK TIMES January 12, 2005)</li>
</ul>
<p>... the most popular descriptive word that would come back would not, I think, be "abuse."</p>
<p>"Abuse" suggests (to me) rough language or perhaps incidental unpleasant physical contact. Abuse is part of what happened, perhaps, but not an accurate description of the totality of the event.</p>
<p>It's rather like describing a plane crash into the side of a mountain as a navigational failure. True as far as it goes, but clearly inadequate.</p>
<p>Consider: A school principal calls a parent and says, "We have had reports that your son has been abusing other students."</p>
<p>Does the parent assume that the son has been raping other students? Or setting attack dogs upon them?</p>
<p>"Physical assault," "sexual assault," "battery," or "torture" are much more accurate words to describe the actual events under discussion, whether or not it suits the purposes of major media outlets to use these words.</p>
<p>I propose that we change the title of the article to:</p>
<p>Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse</p>

<p>This title has zero google hits. The previous title has 36,000. I don't disagree with this move enough to move it back, but I'd like to point out that <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a> says we should keep articles at their most common usage, the name that most people would type into a search, even if this name does not reflect the most recent scholarship.

<dd>Okay, I see your point. FYI -- "Abu Ghraib torture" (which is, one can argue, really the most accurate title of all) has 26,300 Google hits. Given the points you've raised (and that I should have looked up), perhaps we would simply be better off with "Abu Ghraib scandal" (67,000 hits). My personal opinion is that putting the "prisoner abuse" thing in the title is intellectually dishonest and offensive -- like listing the "ethnic cleansing" under "ethnic strife" or something. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 21:53, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think for many readers (maybe primarily outside of US/UK) there is an important difference between what can be expected from an article on a <i>Abu Ghraib scandal</i> compared to an article on <i>(Alleged) Abu Ghraib torture</i> — in the former case, the focus is on the perception and reception in the US, in the latter case, the focus is on what actually happened in that Iraqi prison (and, of course, indirectly in many other US custodies overseas). I guess a changed title will reflect also in a changed sense of what's the proper scope of this article. /<a href="../../../t/u/o/User%7ETuomas_bc49.html" title="User:Tuomas">Tuomas</a> 07:34, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>"In 2004, reports emerged of numerous instances of abuse, torture, and murder of prisoners in the Baghdad Correctional Facility..."</b></p>
<p>This statement is wrong in several ways. First of all, there were not "numerous instances" of murder. There was only one reported death, that of Manadel al-Jamadi. Also, the death was not an execution, as "murder" would suggest; he death was due to injuries suffered during interrogation. (Not that that makes it any less horrible. They still killed him, even if it was unintentional. It disgusts me to even think about it.)</p>
<p>Yes, the death should be mentioned in the article, but it needs to be stated in a way that is not misleading. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 18:51, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>p.s. Just for the record, I'm not trying to defend or justify or "tone down" the crimes that happened at Abu Graib; just trying to be accurate.</p>
<p>Thanks for doing some more research. Murder does not imply execution. Torturing a man to death (which is what was alleged, as a matter of fact) is murder. The Senate Armed Services Committee questioned Rumsfeld over this in may, and afterwards one of its members (a Republican) told the press that the US public ought to wake up, that this wasn't just torture they were investigating, but rape and murder.

<p>If you are going to censor images, i.e. use the {{{suppress image}}} template, then at least limit the use to "photographs of torture, nudity, and a deceased person". Don't censor pictures of Al Gore, Iraqi graffiti, London graffiti, and a Cuban billboard.

<ul>
<li>What about blurry images, black-barred images, photos of photos, or artists' renditions of the suppressed images? Should an image be suppressed while attempted duplicates of the image are posted? These questions are part of the rich behind-the-scenes discussion of this issue, which is not as easy and objective as it might appear. At the time that I examined the wiki, <b>two versions of the page were available</b> -- one with all photos visible, the other with essentially all photos suppressed. That makes sense to me. On the suppressed version, I see no incentive to fiddle with subjectivity just so that some disturbing photos are available. The <b>entire purpose</b> of the "no pictures" mirror page is to suppress disturbing visual content. Rather than second-guessing the viewer, it think that it is much easier, safer, more sensible, and more effective to suppress all of the event depictions. (In exchange for providing that service, in my opinion there is a tacit acceptance that the offendable user can seek out their own pictures of Iraq or Al Gore. The benefit-value of the neutral photos on that mirror page is negligible.) At the top of any page that image-suppresses, there should be a link to a page [[How to Turn Off Images]]. That page would tell the user how to turn off their browser's autoloading and how to load images individually by hand, allowing them to make their own decisions about viewing individual images on any Wikipedia page. --Brokenfixer 20:36, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Censorship" is a complete red herring when the primary version of the page displays all images by default. A link at the top of the "(no pictures)" mirror entry immediately takes you to the primary entry, where the pictures are shown. On a fundamental level, Wikipedia acts as provider of these images. You are viewing these images because Wikipedia has placed them here for your viewing. These images are passively countenanced, sanctioned, endorsed, confirmed, and what-have-you by Wikipedia itself. Calling {{{suppress image}}} "censorship" (especially when that image is not suppressed in the primary wikipedia entry) does not contribute to discussion. --Brokenfixer 20:36, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think this is the place for wider debate which has been had many times elsewhere. I think Ajshm just meant that {{{suppress image}}} is designed to be attached to images that may plausibly be offensive. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 22:36, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That makes sense to me. In my opinion, the two sites currently look well-executed: images of graffiti are being shown even on the no-pictures site. It wasn't my intention to ignite non-existent controversy. My intended point was just that we can use a loose interpretation of "plausibly offensive" for the secondary site without risking a censorship act, since the primary site, with all the pictures, is obvious and accessible. --Brokenfixer 08:54, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is very POV and one sided. The entire article is 99% written from one POV and doesn't actually represent much in critical response to these accusations. It relies excessively on the report from one guy and uses no criticism of it. It makes various unsourced or poorly sourced accusations (like those of rape/urination). I'd like to see a copy of this NYTimes article. It even glosses over the fact that Hersh blatanted lied about his accounts. The article uses euphimistic language to do it. He didn't lie, instead he "changed facts and events for audience consumption." The language used automatically assumes that everything is abuse or torture, which is also POV. Oh and the pictures are lovely too, the whole page is plastered with 11 pictures relating to "abuse and torture", even articles like the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">holocaust</a> have nothing like that.</p>
<p>Please don't remove the NPOV tag until these issues have been address.

<p>Bear in mind that the report is corroborated by the guilty pleas, by detainees, by ex-General (now Colonel) Karpinsky, and by photographic evidence. This is a topic that should not be brushed under the rug, and because this torture is probably still continuing in Iraq and in eastern Europe it is quite topical. Without the photos it would be a lot easier for folks to disbelieve the entire account. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukiari_01d8.html" title="User:Sukiari">Sukiari</a> 03:57, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"The language used automatically assumes that everything is abuse or torture"</p>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines torture as "the action or practice of inflicting severe pain on someone as a punishment or to force them to do or say something, or for the pleasure of the person inflicting the pain."</p>
<p>It is clear that this is what was happening there. This isn't POV, it's simply proper use of language. This is a little more serious than 'hazing', despite what some would have us believe.</p>

<dd>No, it's not clear that that's what is happening here. Most of those listings don't involve inflicting any pain at all, they're psychological in nature, not physical. If we use the "to force them to say something" out of context like that, forcing someone to say "hello" would be torture. So would making them do jumping jacks. And if they are corroborated, then you should present evidence of that, you are required to cite sources, otherwise it doesn't get included. The goal of Wikipedia isn't to make people believe things and the fact that you admit you're trying to make people believe things shows your motive to trying to s upport a POV. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

<p>You really don't want to use the proper English term for what's going on here do you? It's torture. I'm sure being kicked, stacked in a pile, beaten, attacked by dogs, raped with a chemlight, having a sandbag (usually 40 lbs.) placed over your head while you stand on a box and are probably shocked (the report may say 'simulated' but you'd have to be a jackass to believe that), sat on until you die, chained to the floor in the cold until you die, and the other 'listings' as you so euphemistically call the torture aren't really painful at all.</p>
<p>In fact, because they aren't painful at all, maybe you should try a few at home, just to prove how gentle and merciful the captors were actually being.</p>
<p>Talk about POV. Using the proper English term for what was happening (TORTURE) is not POV, it's just good sense.</p>
<p>I will add a section about other tortures along with sources, that should hopefully put an end to this ridiculous 'simulated' and 'threatened' business. Mind you that the OED definition for torture is: "the action or practice of inflicting severe pain on someone as a punishment or to force them to do or say something, or for the pleasure of the person inflicting the pain." They do not include a caveat that only PHYSICAL pain is required for an action to be considered torture. What about water torture? Or is water 'listings' now? Or when that guy was forced to watch his children get tortured (listed?) in order to provoke him to talk. Is that torture? Or just another 'listing'?</p>

<dd>You seem to have missed the word 'severe' there. It's a subjective word, which makes the whole qualification of 'torture' subjective. I can pinch someone, and it will hurt, but will it cause "severe pain"? Hardly. Is making a guy walk around in women's underwear constitue infliction of 'severe pain'? Hardly. It's not "good sense" to qualify things as torture as you please and as NPOV is an absolute policy, there is no compromise regarding this, especially considering it is widely contested what constitutes torture. NPOV policy requires that articles reflect widely contested views as such, so your personal opinion on the matter doesn't matter. Lastly, read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> you are absolutely FORBIDDEN from speculating, no matter how obvious you think it is. And quite frankly, your speculation is completely unsubtantiated anyway. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 22:01, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's good to be frank. But calling this speculation is not accurate, as it substantiated by reports from the torturers themselves, their victims, photographs, and written evidence of torture. Raping someone anally with a chemical glow stick is not to be equated to a pinch. Neither is attacking somebody with a dog. There are many corroborated reports of this activity, including beatings so severe that they result in death. Being sat upon until you suffocate is equivalent to a pinch? Being forced to simulate or actualize homosexual activity is equal to a pinch? Severe pain could, and indeed has, be easily effected even by a pinch.</p>
<p>I will add a section, backed by credible reports and even testimony under oath, to hopefully counter the POV spin of 'simulated' rape, forced sex acts, and electrocution, and 'threatened' beatings, torture, and murder, to this article to hopefully provide readers with the tools they need to make informed decisions regarding this torture.</p>
<p>But beyond the photographic and other evidence of torture, as a human being, doesn't it bother you that we are running the same kinds of rape and torture facilities that were paraded in front of the public as one of the strongest and most compelling reasons to go to war? My personal point of view is that this represents a most heinous crime, and the new evidence that the orders came down from Old Rummy himself are quite damning to the whole spin cycle about this torture.</p>

<dd>There are no reports from the torturers themselves that they used electricity (as opposed to simulating it), so you can't substantiate it. The reports of rape were from contractors, not soldiers and represent the minority of cases anyway. These reports aren't corroborated, in fact, people have ended up retracting them because it was found they were either flat out lying or grossly exaggerated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And no, you won't add even more POV to the already POV article. This article is already ridiculously unbalanced as it is, representing only one side. You fail to address the fact that most of these acts of "torture" are really just humiliating incidents involving nakedness and in some cases simulated acts, that don't involve rape or beatings at all. Oh and cold water--brrrr, torture. Slapping, owwy, torture. I also note that you stopped trying to defend the argument that torture is, by definition, objective.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your intent here is very clear--to make the POV article even more POV. What you call "spin" is actually liberal sources of information, which constitute most of the information in this article, so my only guess is that you intend on adding wild speculation from some ultra-liberal, conspiracy-theory sources of some kind. Calling the taguba report conservative spin is laughable, when it's actually quite the opposite--the whole report was very harsh about what happened there, why do you think it's one of the prime sources of information cited by liberals regarding alleged torture? <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 01:33, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There ARE in fact reports from many sources corroborating the torture, and I WILL add them in a section. It is not POV to point out plain facts, despite the agenda that you are clearly pushing here (the 'torture isn't torture, and didn't happen anyway despite the evidence agenda). What is the 'other side'? That torture didn't happen at all, and these photographs, the guilty admission by the torturers, the testimony and reports from the tortured and other witnesses, and other corroborating evidence is in fact imaginary or somehow is being taken the wrong way? That the dead bodies, who died after severe physical assaults (or listings?) are not to be considered victims of torture? That the DOD has admitted that at least 23 prisoners were killed while under interrogation by US troops or contractors is not evidence for torture? Which people in particular have retracted their reports of anal rape with a chemlight?</p>
<p>I see no need to defend or attack the definition of torture - it is clear enough to anyone with the stomach for these photos and the other evidence that torture did indeed happen. Is this another "depends on what the meaning of 'is' is" argument? Because that's what your argument is shaping up to be. I am not calling the Taguba report spin, I am calling the euphemisms 'simulated' and 'threatened' spin. And I notice that you haven't defended your claims that sitting on somebody until they suffocate isn't torture. You also betray your motivation by the use of the word 'liberal'. I'm no liberal, and I don't think John McCain or other Republicans would be considered liberals either.</p>
<p>Once my addition is complete and added to the article, you can discuss it with others here on the talk page. I will make every effort to present only facts, and leave conclusions to others. However, to threaten to delete whatever I add before I even add it, and before examining the corroborating facts, seems to betray an agenda here that is quite POV oriented. Your juvenile attempts to re-classify physical abuse and torture as 'brrr' and 'owwy' betray your agenda as well.</p>
<p>Be assured that I will add more facts information to the article which evaporate the claims that the torture carried out in Iraq was only simulated or threatened. The Taguba report is only one source of reports of these tortures, and may not even be the best source.</p>

<dd>Actually, you don't understand <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy at all. Even if you found factual sources, which is doubtful, it wouldn't be NPOV to simply put them in. I suggest you actually read that page. It's not enough for them to simply be facts, it's the context and how you present those facts that's important too. The other prevailing point of view is about the extent and severity of the torture, as well as what constitutes torture. By blanket labelling everything torture you're obviously just represnting one POV. Plus given that you don't understand the difference between speculation and fact, I have extreme doubts that you can find any reliable sources of information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you had actually been reading news sources, you'd notice that what constitutes torture is contested. This has nothing to do with the definition of 'is', I even explicitly explained what the problem is, but you deliberately ignored that it engage in an argument which I never made. Your own definition uses the word 'severe', which is obviously a subjective word, which makes torture subjective. If you can't even acknokwledge that the word torture is subjective and that there is gray area, then you shouldn't be editing this article, PERIOD.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And by calling those "euphimisms" spin, you are calling the Taguba report spin, since those are direct quotes from the Taguba report. Or are you making some argument about the word "is/are" here, where those quotes ARE'nt actually part of the Taguba report? If they didn't actually run an electrical current through those wires, then it IS a simulation, the only way to argue otherwise is by arguing the definition of 'is.' You can use circular logic all you like, but it won't make what you say any more true. And I'm not going to address a few isolated incidents when the overwhelming number of cases were just some guys being forced to do something while naked or being *threatened*. Honestly, you think having cold water poured on you is torture? I've had that done to me as a kid as a prank and I forgot about it minutes later, but according to you, it was torture and I should have post-traumatic stress.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And stop labelling your talk page edits 'minor.' The minor tag is for minor edits, not every edit you make. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J. Yoder</a> 17:47, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Please don't tell me what I'm doing. The Taguba report, damning as it is, clearly held back to some degree.</p>
<p>But your continued refusal to back up your claims that certain reports of torture were retracted, and your refusal to discuss other tortures such as dog attacks, suffocation resulting in death, and other clear torture techniques does betray an agenda that is hardly interested in facts. There is no 'circular logic' being employed here. If anybody is guilty of sophistry, it is you - rather than confronting the dog attacks, muscular and skeletal stress torture, mental torture (taking into account the fact that most of the victims are Muslim), beatings, anal rape with various objects, etc. you will only mention slapping and water dumping, and in a dismissive way as if these are the only torture techniques that have been substantiated at Abu Ghraib. Obviously torture doesn't bother you - that's a lamentable position to take, but you have the right to have whatever opinion you want. But if we allow our government to employ torture, we open a Pandora's box that we may never close again, as other countries and NGE's will clearly see that there is no longer any reason to refrain from torture if we won't.</p>
<p>You begin this section by accusing the article of being 'one-sided'. I haven't heard you describe what other sides there are to this scandal. Unless you can describe the other side's view (?) your accusation rings rather hollow.</p>

<dd>the only specific accusation of POV is about the word "torture", by a single user who bases his objection on the fact that some of the less severe offenses committed against prisoners are mere abuse; in particular, slapping, pinching and the use of water. This objection is addressed by the current title of the article - "torture and prisoner abuse" - clearly both types of behaviour occurred. It is absurd to argue that anal rape of a bound prisoner with a chemical light or interrogation ending in death are not torture, so clearly the title is factually correct. This point has been made by other users, but the NPOV accuser has not addressed it at all. The accusation is unsubstantiated. A single accusation without backup or cogent argument is not sufficient to support an NPOV tag, otherwise the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_cube.html" title="Time cube">time cube</a> guy would have his claims of NPOV on the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a> article upheld. Further - the NPOV tags are inserted in specific sections of the article, but the accusation does not relate to those specific sections. Perhaps the tags were merited in earlier versions of this article - there is a trail of cogent discussion on how to remove POV sections above. However all of the objections raised appear to have been dealt with to the satisfaction of all commenters, with the exclusion of a single non-specific accusation that does not bear even cursory logical examination. I'm surprised to be able to say it on such a potentially contentious issue, but there is really no need for the NPOV tag on this article. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EViveka_0fe5.html" title="User:Viveka">Viveka</a> 12:38, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Njyoder has attempted to employ every tactic in the book to somehow disconnect the word torture with the torture that has gone on at Abu Gharib and continues to this day in other American held or operated facilities around the globe. Pure sophistry. It's hard to assume good faith in such a situation. This story continues to develop, and as I mentioned above, many of the tortures mentioned as simulated in the Taguba report were not simulated at all, but really took place. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukiari_01d8.html" title="User:Sukiari">Sukiari</a> 04:36, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

With the new Pentagon programs that have been initiated with the purpose of sanitizing and altering online blogs and other forums (Wikipedia is included in this as well no doubt) we have to be doubly vigilant, because the reality is that the Internet has become an online propaganda battlefield. The kinds of edits these Goebbels type clowns will make will be easy enough to spot, though. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukiari_01d8.html" title="User:Sukiari">Sukiari</a> 23:21, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I fight Goebbels in another battlefield (Punic Wars) and it isn't that easy. Especially when they can use sources that are hard to get or a great volume to read. On the other hand if we once catch any official interfering in our business he and his institution are likely to be so burned that the risk is too high. I think there are enough people with strange opinions in the net and wikipedia is a magnet for them. It is far easier and safer to cast opinions on some more POV profile sites and let the dogs out. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 23:58, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I changed a few of the examples of the POV in the list of torture techniques to eliminate the POV 'simulated' torture spin.</p>
<p>The DOD has lied about everything they could get away with, and more on this issue. Let's be open to the possibility that the electric torture and other tortures weren't NECESSARILY simulated.</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't quite realize what I was doing. BE BOLD, right?</p>
<p>There should be added a caveat that perhaps the tortures weren't just 'simulated', and that perhaps prisoners weren't just 'threatened' with the various forms of torture. It is more than probable that there tortures weren't just simulated and threatened, but actualized.</p>

<p>It's hardly speculation to disbelieve that the torture was simulated. The only reason why it can't be proven to be real is because you can't really see sparks flying from this guy.</p>

<p>(initial disclaimer/apology: this is my first talk page entry, apologies if I edited the article or added anything incorrectly)</p>
<p>From the section "Reports of abuse," I removed the sentence accusing Ford of delusions and various lies. The linked article <a href="http://sec-global.com/services/ctp/vsg/news/041218.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sec-global.com/services/ctp/vsg/news/041218.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> makes several accusations but contains no references to support them. I searched for further substantiation of the claims but only found one other article <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1306991/posts" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1306991/posts" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, and it appears to be based primarily on the first one.</p>
<p>The addition seems (like the linked article) merely to exist as a baseless citation to counter the Sergeant's story and probably as a weak smear campaign against Ford.</p>

<dd>Do you know of an authoritative source for this factoid? Bush apologists keep repeating this. But no one, that I am aware of, has substantiated this claim. I challenge you to find a single reliable authoritative source for this claim.</dd>
</dl>
<p>&gt;Funny how you demand 'authoritative sources' for the highly plausible claim that terrorists are trained to resist interrogation and make false claims of abuse, yet you swallow whole without circumspection that the prisoner's allegations are true. Thanks for showing your true colors. No "Bush apologists" are excusing the behavior at Abu Ghraib which is clearly criminal behavior. It is your frothing conspiracy theory of a Bush connection to this isolated crime, committed by a miniscule percentage of soldiers, which is most laughable.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Remember the bush apologists who advance this claim are the same crowd who swore that Saddam had a vast arsenal of WMD that represented an imminent deadly threat to the USA, and that the Iraqi people would welcome the American liberators with flowers and kisses.</dd>
</dl>
<p>&gt;Saddam DID have a vast arsenal of WMD. The question is where that arsenal is NOW. He did not prove he destroyed it as required under UN Resolutions. BTW, American solders were, and ARE, welcomed by Iraqis as liberators with flowers and kisses. Try looking for the evidence of that and you might actually find it. Better yet, try serving in Iraq to dispel your ignorance.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The disproof that all abuse claims are bogus fictions, based on al Qaeda training is that detainees who are clearly innocent of any ties to al Qaeda also claim abuse.</dd>
</dl>
<p>&gt;NO ONE is claiming that Al Qaeda training disproves abuse claims by prisoners. There is no doubt that the abuse occurred and that it was illegal. The Army was investigating it BEFORE the scandal was leaked to the public. There is also no doubt that some of the prisoners have been trained to resist interrogation and lie about abuse. Captured Al Qaeda training manuals and the experience of our Miliary Intelligence personnel prove this. We're sorry that George Bush hasn't personally come to your house with the evidence. In all cases, the prisoners have an incentive to lie: for propaganda, sympathy, or legal claims. You seem completely unconcerned by this, demonstrating your default judgment against the United States, its Army, and its president in favor of our enemies.</p>

<p>As to "alleged abuse and torture" - is there really anyone anywhere who can make an honest and reasoned case that <i>no</i> abuse or torture took place? Isn't the debate now over 1.) the degree of severity of the abuse and 2.) who was responsible? If some people think there was abuse but maybe not torture, we could say "abuse and alleged torture". I really don't think we have justification at this point, given all the evidence that's come to light, to continue to cast the abuse as a mere allegation. -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 17:22, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I see a lot of debate on this page about the censorship and censored page, but I would like to question the number and frequency. There is currently no part of this page, when scrolling through it, where a graphic image is not to my right. I realize that these pictures are important to the article, but this article is simply blanketed by them. There are a lot of gruesome things that have wikipedia articles, but they do not have pictures of them like an article carpet. Also, the positioning of the pictures is not in sync with the text on the left (particularily the international law section) <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 66.188.253.213 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.188.253.213_1257.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.188.253.213">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd>do you really think that photo is excessive, given the context? Much worse photos have been released. I haven't seen them on many US web sites, but I live in Australia, and here they're playing on TV - on SBS, a government funded public broadcaster. Two nights ago I saw on TV an image from the latest leak of Abu Ghraib photos of an interrogation cell in which the CIA had tortured a prisoner to death. The walls and ceiling were entirely coated with blood. I saw a close-up of a prisoner with his throat slit. I saw images of men who had clearly just been anally raped, bleeding profusely. I think that if you follow this issue, you'll see them too, and this image of a man covered in faeces will start to look very tame. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EViveka_0fe5.html" title="User:Viveka">Viveka</a> 13:02, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are all sorts of pictures of nudity on wikipedia. A few of them are actually screen shots from porns. This has been debated endlessly, and the result has always been that wikipedia should not be censored for the protection of minors. The scandal at Abu Ghraib had nearly as much to do with the leaked pictures of torture as they did with the actual torture, and thus these pictures are extremely significant to the article. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 16:24, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Well I understand that, I'm not debating on having the pictures censored or removed since it is demonstrated in a factual and educational page on Wikipedia, yet a "<b>Warning</b>" should be labeled on the top of the page (incase minors or sensitive people view the article). There are too many pictures of torture and I believe people get the idea of the horrors that took place at Abu Ghraib prison. I find pictures of torture far worst than pornography (sex is natural). In fact pornography is so accessible I have no problem with it.--King of the Dancehall 16:55, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've altered the wording, since it is clearly wikipedia policy that censorship for minors is not our business. I've altered it to simply warn that there are explicit images of abuse and torture.</dd>

<dd>You should be advised that if wikipedia makes the mistake of censoring for minors in *some* articles, then we open ourselves up to legal liability over *other* articles.

I am so glad we have a democratic forum on which this sort of thing can be portrayed.

<p>I thought things were supposed to be discussed when it came to making decisions like lifting a warning. I know we discussed it when we put it on there. I think Administartors are abusing their power. This is not censorship. It's a warning that there's some fucked up pictures in the article. You've already gotten rid of the image free version. At least give people the opportunity to not see the pictures before they get absolutely grossed out. <a href="../../../c/h/c/User%7EChcknwnm_ed3c.html" title="User:Chcknwnm">Chuck</a> 02:11, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For what it's worth, I completely agree. The warning is not cencorship; it is comparable to when newscasters (I'm thinking of UK news here, don't know if you get this in the States etc) say "the following report contains footage which some viewers may find disturbing". In this sense, keeping the warning at the top of the page allows people to make up their own mind as to whether they see the images or not. I really don't see what the problem is in keeping the warning and the version of the page without the images, as long as it is clear that the images have been removed. In a sense, removing the "no image" version is itself a form of censorship, as it prevents the presentation of a certain version of the article. To preempt the counterargument that "certain versions" of articles are always denied presentation (i.e., articles which have been re-edited), I think it should be noted that these articles are always available as part of the article history - the "no image" version of this article is not.--<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Kemp_db60.html" title="User:James Kemp">James Kemp</a> 01:48, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I just stumbled upon this page and found the warning more offensive than the pictures. Pixelized representations of photographs don't torture people; people torture people. It's also obvious that the box is ridiculously oversized (it takes up half a friggin' page!!) and internally contradictory: it says "For details and discussion of this dispute, see the talk page.", but the rest of the template doesn't mention a dispute! The rest is merely a statement of (unnecessary, but accurate) fact; if the template is meant to state that there's a dispute about the article's content or images (or about the template itself&#160;:)), that should be mentioned instead, and it should be mentioned <i>on the talk page</i>, not on the article page. The warning is condescending, absurd, ugly, and unnecessary. If anything, it should only be <i>included</i> after its achieved consensus for adding to the article; it shouldn't require consensus to <i>remove</i> a contentious userbox from articlespace, at least until the dispute is resolved! Anyway, in the meantime, I've compacted it a bit by bringing it more in line with a typical <a href="../../../n/p/o/Template%7ENPOV_75c8.html" title="Template:NPOV">Template:NPOV</a>. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 02:47, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

If they suddenly don't like what they're seeing they can hit Alt-F4 and be gone. — <small>Feb. 17, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[03:07] &lt;<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture__f15d.html" title="User:Freakofnurture/">freakof</a><a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">nu</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA">r<sub>x</sub></a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">ture</a><a href="../../../i/p/b/Special%7EIpblocklist_2536.html" title="Special:Ipblocklist">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">talk</font></a>&gt;</b></tt>

<dd>This is a current events article, not an article entitle <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">Penis</a>. People will come to this article expecting to find out about the situation, as it is national news. They are not neccesarily going to visit the page to see the pictures, nor will most people expect to see the pictures. I believe some disgression is advised being this is such a popular topic, both with sickos who want to view disturbing images, and with people interested in the news. Thank you very much. <a href="../../../c/h/c/User%7EChcknwnm_ed3c.html" title="User:Chcknwnm">Chuck</a> 03:17, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, and as part of a major current event, these photographs have already been broadcasted on the news, published in magazines and newspapers, and diseminated virtually everywhere. What makes us so special in terms of standards? The fact that, on Wikipedia, <i>the readers <b>are</b> the writers</i>? Better yet, what makes the photos themselves so special? The fact that they show middle easterners being abused? Or the fact that they show Americans misbehaving? Neither is a compelling argument for censorship. — <small>Feb. 17, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[03:30] &lt;<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture__f15d.html" title="User:Freakofnurture/">freakof</a><a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">nu</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA">r<sub>x</sub></a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">ture</a><a href="../../../i/p/b/Special%7EIpblocklist_2536.html" title="Special:Ipblocklist">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">talk</font></a>&gt;</b></tt>

<dd>But there is no censorship here...just a warning. All of the pictures are still here and people can see the Iraqis getting abused and the Americans abusing them, but now there's the warning (which without it would be censoring the fact that there is disturbing images (which we can all agree upon)) which allows people to be there own censors, and leave the page before they see the pictures if they want. You're correct the readers are the writers. But not all of them are. For instance, if you google search "Abu Ghraib", the fifth result is this article. People who probably never even heard of Wikipedia will be seeing this article, and at no point when you click on the link (other than the warning I added) do you see that there are graphic images. In fact you can't even see the Wikipedia disclaimer about images when you first click the link. So, I believe considering the audience, and the fact that the pictures are still very easily accesible (by simply scrolling down), a warning is not too much to ask for. <a href="../../../c/h/c/User%7EChcknwnm_ed3c.html" title="User:Chcknwnm">Chuck</a> 03:39, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia already has a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_disclaimer_8d69.html" title="Wikipedia:Content disclaimer">general content disclaimer</a>. It is true that most casual readers won't look at that, but that's their fault. Why have a general disclaimer, if not to keep from having to put individual disclaimers on every potentially objectionable article? If this gets a disclaimer, what other articles do? Who decides what might shock someone? No, this is not a precedent which should be set, and a splice is simply absurd - what happens when one version is updated? - not to mention it explicitly goes against <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. --<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 03:55, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not a matter of them not viewing the general disclaimer before they read the article (how would they do that anyway when the google link takes them directly to the article, not a disclaimer. Pornography websites have disclaimers on the top of a page before you enter, and news organizations make an announcement before they show disturbing images like, say...images from the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. This is certainly not censorship. It does create a problem as to which articles should have a disclaimer, but this one should, or else the grotesque pics should be taken down. <a href="../../../c/h/c/User%7EChcknwnm_ed3c.html" title="User:Chcknwnm">Chuck</a> 04:04, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't buy the argument that this is somehow different than <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">Penis</a>. I'm sure that there is a picture of a penis at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">Penis</a>, just as most people would assume that there is a picture of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse at <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse_c72a.html" title="Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse">Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse</a>. Likewise, although I've never been to <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> or <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, I have a feeling that both of those articles have pictures of the things that the Klan and the Nazis did... things that I consider to be "offensive." Anyone with any common sense could figure that out. In any event, the whole thing becomes POV because what is offensive to you may not be offensive to the next person. It also raises all sorts of cultural problems, seeing as Wikipedia is international. For example, suppose someone starts tagging thousands of pages with something that says "This article contains pictures of women's hair. Certain viewers may find this to be sinful." Are you going to go along with that? Or is the western point of view the controlling one? When all is said and done, it's just best not to go down that road. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 05:20, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that it's not censorship. It's just a terrible idea. Something doesn't have to be censorship to be useless and biased. By putting a content warning here, we implicitly endorse the content of every <i>other</i> article on Wikipedia, implying that <i>this</i> one is universally offensive and no <i>other</i> page is, and suggesting that people who are offended by any <i>other</i> page have a right to complain or order us to add a disclaimer like the one here! A double-standard here will cause nothing but more trouble. Let the article speak for itself: the images are small and plain enough that they shouldn't cause any more shock or horror than, say, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, which we can surely agree doesn't need a disclaimer notice warning about relevant, illustrative photos in its pages, horrifying though they may be. The same reasoning for that article applies here! And even if we <i>do</i> someday have templates like this for horrific articles, they should only be added <i>after there is consensus for them</i>. Wikipedia is run by consensus, not individual attempts to rewrite Wikipedia policy on a random specific article. Propose a new Wikipedia policy or guideline or whatnot for including a template like this on any article where there is a general agreement that one is needed. (Which there isn't here anyway.) Until then, putting the template on a page is an embarrassment to Wikipedia and a disservice to our readers. Would Britannica put a garish, childish warning notice about an illustrated Abu-Ghraib article in its contents? -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 04:28, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The minor "abuse" of terrorist prisoners at Abu Ghraib is NOTHING when compared to the attrocities committed by the terrorists: Mudering innocent civilians, suicide bombings, destruction of religious sites/mosques/churches, cutting off people's heads, etc. The Arab terrorists act and operate much like the communists did in Viet Nam.

<p>The man in this picture appears to me to have a banana in his anus. I think that if this is the case, the article should definately reflect it, because this would be the most clear-cut sexual abuse that we have documentation on. However, I'm not exactly sure that it is indeed a banana, and I don't want to write anything about it unles I'm sure. Does anyone think that this is not a case of sodomy by banana? If so, what is going on in the picture? --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 06:19, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would guess it is a banana, but I would use the term "foreign object", because it's hard to tell what it actually is. It could be a yellow broom handle or some similar object. I do agree the article should mention the photographic evidence of sodomy at Abu Ghraib, but I do not believe the article needs to be that specific: in other words, it isn't necessary to specifically mention bananas. I also want to go on the record as saying how horrible this is.</dd>

<p>One thing that makes me cross is when someone slaps an {npov} tag on an article, without fulfilling their responsibility to initiate a discussion of the instances of the expression of a biased point of view. The guy who placed the tag did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40884634" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40884634" rel="nofollow">offer an explanation</a> of sorts. But it is not a very serious explanation.</p>
<p>The critic writes that the use of word "defenders" instead of "supporters" illustrates the <i><b>"automatic assumption the administration is guilty of something"</b></i></p>
<p>I fail to see how refering to those who defend the administration as "supporters" instead of "defenders" would be more biased - or less biased. I think the critic who applied the tag is unaware of their own unconscious assumptions. If a patriotic American realizes that there are those who challenge one of their President's policies they then have a choice. Once they educate themselves about the issue they can choose to support the President's policies. Or they could choose to oppose the President's policies; Or they could decide the issue wasn't important to them, and leave the President and his supporters to fight it out with his challengers without taking a stand.</p>
<p>But the critic writes as if the only choice was "support". They seem to have forgotten that American critics of the Bush administration's policy can disagree with the President and yet be critical of his policies. They seem to have forgotten that agreement with the current President's policies is not a requirement for an American to be regarded as a patriot.</p>
<p>A single two sentence paragraph falls far short of the obligation an article's critic should feel before the place a tag like {npov} on a large article like this one.</p>
<p>I encourage them to put some serious effort into naming specific instances of bias. And I encourage them to offer serious, considered arguments for each of their instances.</p>
<p>I am going to repeat that I think neither the choice of the word "defenders" or "supporters" shows a bias, one way or the other. Tagging the entire article, giving only this inadequate explanation falls short of the seriousness I would like to expect from other wikipedia contributors. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 20:23, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Valid and compelling reasoning. You don't have to be a supporter of George W. Bush or his policies or administration to defend him on this specific case, nor are all supporters of GWB or his policies or administration also <i>defenders</i> of him with regards to the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse trial. Neither term is inherently POVed, as long as they're used accurately; if anything, "defenders" is less POVed than "supporters" for the reasons given above. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 20:32, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is a ridiculous NPOV tag. In a criminal trial, the "defense" doesn't assume its guilt -- in fact it assumes its innoncence. In a game of basketball, the defense doesn't assume that the offense is going to make a basket, in fact they work to prevent that. I could go on and on.

<dd>The "administration" has not been accused of a crime by anyone one of any importance regarding Abu Ghraib abuse. Naysayers on the internet do not count.

<dl>
<dd>P.S. If you look at the paragraph in question: "The U.S. Administration and its defenders argued that the abuses were isolated acts committed by low-ranking personnel, while critics claimed that authorities either ordered or implicitly condoned the abuses and demanded the resignation of senior Bush administration officials."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This quote is contrasting the idea that the administration is guilty of committing crimes or allowing crimes to happen with the administration and others (weasel word) defending themselves against the allegations. That is a POV. The paragraph also mentions critics (weasel word. Who? Only one rant by Al Gore with no supporting evidence is given. "Critics" should be changed to "a lone defeated political opponent")</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, look at this quote: "methods explicitly mentioned as being sanctioned are sleep deprivation, hooding prisoners, playing loud music, removing all detainees' clothing, forcing them to stand in so-called "stress positions," and the use of dogs. The author also claimed that the Pentagon had limited use of the techniques by requiring specific authorization from the chain of command. The author identifies "physical beatings, sexual humiliation or touching" as being outside the Executive Order. This was the first internal evidence since the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse affair became public in April, 2004 that forms of abusive coercion and <b>torture</b> of captives had been mandated by the President".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Where on God's Earth do you get "torture being mandated by the president" from an EO giving guidelines on interrogation methods to be used? By calling "hooding prisoners and playing loud music" torture you are demeaning all real victims of torture and, most importantly here, violates the NPOV policy, in my opinion. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayzel68_b0f1.html" title="User:Jayzel68">Jayzel</a> 03:24, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Perhaps by seperating the charges into categories there would be a lot less animosity (sp?) toward this article.

<dd>I might force somebody to do 50 or 100 pushups, and I might be able to do that number myself. But to an unfit person the situation could be entirely different. It might even result in a heart attack. If I am on the receiving end of things, any little inconvenience might get called torture. If I am on the delivery end of things, anything short of death might not be considered torture. Drawing boundary lines on both ends but closer to the middle would be more useful for communicating information, but different people will draw lines in different places. So the idea of having a catalog of what is actually being done to people would give the article a much more objective stance.</dd>

<dd>In the past there have been experiments done to measure degrees of subjective discomfort. If I remember correctly, intense infrared light was focused on an inch-diameter area on a subject's arm and the power of the lamp was gradually brought up until the artificially induced pain measured the pain of things like the worst moments during labor, etc. It should be possible to gain the measure of things like the application of the most painful aikido hold, but those measurements would be "for the moment." It is difficult to see how one figures in a multiplication factor. Perhaps one can tolerate a certain pain for a minute but will go mad in the pain continues for an hour or some longer period of time.</dd>

<dd>If I ever get caught on a battlefield by an enemy soldier, I'll let you know how things went, smarty pants. Question for you: What is your definition of "interrogation method" and compare and contrast it with your definition of "torture". And why do the two of you reject the suggestion the allegations be seperated into categories oof "abuse" and "torture"? Is it because you are afraid people will see that the actual allegations of "torture" are so few? --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayzel68_b0f1.html" title="User:Jayzel68">Jayzel</a> 10:54, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, it's because I believe all of the events in question were abuse. (It seems clear to me that, systemically, Iraqi prisoners were regarded and treated as subhuman by their captors.) If you oppose "torture", then oppose it in the article title. I'd say the article title should give a summary of what will be contained within. Currently it says the article is about "Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse". Therefore, non-abuse activities at Abu Ghraib, such as the weekly bingo game and calls home to mom and pop in Ohio, are off-topic and should not be included. The only remaining question is, which activities qualify as "torture".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My definition of "interrogation method" is anything done to elicit information from a person. There are a lot of ways this can be done without abuse. For instance, you have a lawyer present, and you sit down with the person, and you take their statement. If they refuse to speak, then you note that down and return them to their cell. My definition of "torture" is any application of cruel, degrading, or inhumane treatment to a being. I'd define it more narrowly if I didn't know that the Alberto Gonzaleses of this world are always looking for a loophole to avoid having to be ethical. -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 12:33, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know this isn't going to make sense to you, Jayzel, but you're in an extreme minority on this issue. The vast majority of people in the world believe that what went on at Abu Ghraid was at a <i>minimum</i> abuse, and possibly also torture. The argument is not over whether the actions at Abu Ghraib were delightful party games or abuse. The argument, <b>world-wide</b> (except in your mind), is over how bad the abuse really was.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Your reading comprehension skills are atrocious. Where did I say there wasn't abuse? I completely agree with your statement "Abu Ghraid was at a <i>minimum</i> abuse, and possibly also torture". My argument is that the actual allegations of "torture" are so few and thin that this article should be renamed <b>Abu Ghraib Scandal</b> with subheadings detailing <b>abuse</b> and <b>torture</b> to put the various allegations into perspective. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayzel68_b0f1.html" title="User:Jayzel68">Jayzel</a> 10:54, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You might want to check out a book from your local library. It's called "The Gulag Archipelago", by Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn. He was a political prisoner in Stalin's prison system (he was arrested for making critical statements about Stalin), and the book describes the Stalinist penal system in great detail. The section on interrogation methods you might find particularly interesting, since it reads more or less like this very article... The same methods are used, because they're very effective (sleeplessness, loud noises, discomfortable situations). Can you honestly tell me, Jayzel, that having our military prisons run Stalinist-fashion doesn't give you even a moment's pause? Are you really that willing to suspend your reasoning and cling to this belief that "America does not torture", simply because a man who has admitted he doesn't have all the facts says so? I'm very interested in your reply. -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 03:26, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am well aware of The Gulag Archipelago. I read all of the volumns 12 years ago. Thanks for the reading suggestions anyhow. Once again I ask you for your definition of "interrogation methods" against enemy soldiers picked up on the battlefield and compare and contrast it with your definition of "torture". Then compare those two definitions with your definition of "political prisoners". --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayzel68_b0f1.html" title="User:Jayzel68">Jayzel</a> 10:54, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll make a deal with you. I'll do your compare and contrast, if you compare and contrast the methods known to be okayed by Gonzales (that is, anything that doesn't cause lasting physical harm) with the Stalinist methods of Gulag Archipelago (sleeplessness, etc.). Not all torture leaves a mark, a wound, or a broken bone. All torture is mental in nature, it's just the more obvious kinds that use physical beatings to cause that mental anguish. There are other kinds - such as the "interrogation methods" employed at Abu Ghraib - which skip the physical middleman and go straight to the mental anguish. That's not only torture, it's a much more effective and pure form of it, as the NKVD learned.

<dd>First off, the CAT definition of torture is ridiculous. Clearly the work of a committee, in my opinion. I'd first like to deconstruct the UNCAT's view on torture. Then I'll explain why even under the UNCAT, I feel the activities qualified as torture.</dd>

<dd><i>"when such pain or suffering is inflicted by... a public official"</i> What a wonderful loophole; just offer up the torturers as "rogue agents" and you can then honestly claim no torture ever occurred... this section is custom-written to help nations escape charges of torture. It's beyond me why the UN thinks only public officials ever commit torture.</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental lawful sanctions"</i> This is too subjective to be workable, the escape clause is a mile wide. Inherent? Incidental? Are there any two people anywhere in the world who can agree on what is an acceptable amount of "incidental pain or suffering" arising from lawful sanctions?</dd>

</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore in my opinion the UNCAT is a work of unmitigated bullshit. My definition is a lot shorter and simpler for this specific reason; the more verbiage you add, the more loopholes you leave. When a little boy tortures a cat, do we investigate his motives before we decide it was torture? Do we try to figure out if he was interrogating the cat, or if the pain and suffering of the cat was "incidental and arising from" legitimate cat-hurting activities? Of course not. We take the cat away from the little boy. Torture is deliberately inflicting suffering on another (typically for personal gratification, though this is generally rationalized in some way). This is what I call the "common sense" answer.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your first comment, that the sex simulation etc are not torture, is clearly contradicted by the clause on "intimidating or coercing", which was clearly done in order to get the Iraqi men to simulate homosexual acts. The first paragraph of the UNCAT, horrendously ill-written hunk of garbage that it is, is a run-on sentence seperated only by commas, so it's not possible to definitively say which clauses might be sub-clauses and only effective upon certain others. Therefore I am forced to assume that the definition <i>"the term “torture” means any act by which..."</i> is modified by every succeeding clause, including <i>"or intimidating or coercing him or a third person,"</i>. Strangely, this makes the UNCAT even more hardcore than my own personal definition of torture, since I personally don't consider all forms of coercion to be torture. Apparently they do, though, so therefore the prisoners were tortured under UNCAT standards.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your second comment strikes me as nonsensical, so I have to assume I must have misunderstood you. You say "acts of humiliation are not considered torture.", yet in (b) you quote <i>"outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment..."</i>, which is <i>"prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever, whether committed by civilian or by military agents"</i>.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So I'm having a hard time seeing how your point is not flatly contradicted by your own source! Are you trying to tell me you don't think "outrages upon personal dignity" is <b>not</b> synonymous with "humiliation"? Being forced to simulate sexual acts was not an "outrage upon personal dignity"? You've earned my respect already, please don't throw it away by taking such a completely nonsensical stance.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I must admit to being very confused. You have provided sources which seem to do nothing but disprove your own claims. The UNCAT, though a horribly worded and leaky definition, does manage to cover the activities at Abu Ghraib, despite all its efforts to bend over backwards for despots with escape clauses. The Geneva Convention, of course, I have never had a quibble with, considering it one of the more noble attempts ever made at establishing international ethics standards.</dd>

<dd>I'd also just like to take the time to rebut a point you made much earlier, in reply to someone else. You claimed that calling the Abu Ghraib activities "torture" demeans U.S. soldiers who experienced physical beatings, for instance in Viet Nam. I strongly disagree, and think this sort of silencing tactic is about the lowest someone can go in this debate. If you're so concerned over whether calling Abu Ghraid "torture" offends real soldiers who have been through "real torture", how about you check up on what Sen. McCain thinks on the issue? Does he now deserve censure for "demeaning all real victims of torture"? But wouldn't that be demeaning <i>him</i>, a "real" victim of torture?</dd>

<dd>I must conclude that you're not examining the facts with an eye towards actually understanding <i>what torture is</i>, but that instead your goal is to find a conceptual and legal framework to support your pre-decided notion that what the U.S. did was not torture. As long as you continue to accept only the facts that support you, we're not going to be able to see eye-to-eye.

<dd>P.S.S. (Sorry, I'm on a delayed roll) In the <b>reactions</b> section why are there no reactions from Iraqis themselves? They were the most affected, yet there are no quotes whatsoever. I'm going to bed shortly so I will have to look this up some other time, but I distinctly rember reading quotes from Iraqi citizens saying basically "Big deal". If there were Iraqis who felt differently, forgive me. At least show me the quotes to prove me wrong. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayzel68_b0f1.html" title="User:Jayzel68">Jayzel</a> 03:56, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One last point, I SWEAR!&#160;:) Look at this quote from the article: "Alberto Gonzales, who described provisions of the Geneva Conventions that provide prisoners "commissary privileges, scrip, athletic uniforms, and scientific instruments" as "quaint," and wrote that the "new paradigm renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners," was nominated by President Bush as the Attorney General of the United States, the nation's chief law-enforcement official. He was confirmed on February 3, 2005."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is borderline fraud. The quote from Gonzales about "a new paradigm" refered to the fight against Al Qaeda not towrd the war in Iraq. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayzel68_b0f1.html" title="User:Jayzel68">Jayzel</a> 04:00, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the remark was misconceptualized and you can find a citation to back your contention up, then it would be very helpful to correct the record.</dd>
<dd>It should not be that difficult to find reactions from Iraqis, either. The only problem would be how to determine whose opinions on the matter are suitable to this article. My usual preference would be to get to know a large number of people, not push them for a reaction, but listen for the reactions that do come out. In this case, the people are not in a situation where most of us can talk to them. Are any independent firms doing opinion surveys? Are there Iraqi elder statesmen, people who are old enough to be on the sidelines and who have a track record for not being in anybody's pocket? And do we have any way of hearing what they have to say? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 00:21, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why does this article contain no mention of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse before the invasion (the first sentence implies torture began there in 2003)!

<p>Okay, I should have said this before, but prisoner abuse basically explains that there is torture involved. Therefore Torture should be taken out of the title.

<dd>All torture is abuse of some kind, but not all abuse is torture. So taking torture out of the title won't work because people may think the article is just about bad tastes in the water, poor ventilation, bugs in the rice, etc. On the other hand, if abuse of a sort not hurtful enough to be called torture (and Bush seems to think nothing happened that was "true" torture), then the bed bugs or whatever else was permitted to happen should be listed and explained. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 00:53, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are jesting, no? Or perhaps you insist on objective evidence in the form of some kind of painometer attached to the nervous system of someone enduring a "stress position"? I have willingly undergone some of those stress positions in martial arts training -- with the knowledge that I could stand up and straighten out kinks at any time. Even knowing that I could terminate the experience at any time, it still hurt. I did it to make my body a more adept agent of my will. I have also endured the pain of joint twisting, etc., but, again, with the knowledge that I could "slap out of it" whenever I feared damage to my body or felt the pain intolerable. I also once put an aikido/qin-na hold on someone who was extremely sensitive to joint twisting of that nature, and he screamed in pain. There was <b>no</b> physical damage, but I don't think he would agree that there was no pain.</dd>

<dd>When you people get around to the edit of this topic you might want to watch the HBO Documentary 'Ghosts of Abu Ghraib'first. Many of the accused and convicted soldiers walk the viewer through much of what happened at Abu Ghraib prison. They speak very plainly of what they did and what they had seen. One other question... I watched the House Arms Committee investigation into the accusations of torture brought about due to Ms. Sabrina's photos, Duncan Hunter deserves a mention as he completely dismissed any chance of wrong doing, furthermore sent a clear messege to the Army by majority vote 'Do not send us military problems such as this in the future'... the US Presidential hopeful deserves a mention here for his historic leadership in this investigation, wouldn't you think?ooeat0meoo 01:07, 7 March 2007</dd>

<p>Sergeant Samuel Provance from Alpha Company 302nd Military Intelligence battalion, in interviews with several news agencies, reported the sexual abuse of a 16-year-old girl by two interrogators, as well as a 16-year-old son of an Iraqi general who was driven through the cold after he had been showered and who was then besmeared with mud in order to get his father to talk.[citation needed] He also pointed out several techniques used by interrogators that have been identified as being in violation of the Geneva Convention. He spoke to the media, even against direct orders, about what he knew about at the prison (largely from conversations and interactions with the interrogators). He explained that he did so because there was "definitely a cover-up" underway by the Army. He was administratively flagged and had his top secret clearance suspended in retaliation by the Army.[citation needed]</p>
<p>In her video diary, a prison guard said that prisoners were shot for minor misbehavior, and claimed to have had venomous snakes bite prisoners, sometimes resulting in their deaths. By her own admission, that guard was "in trouble" for having thrown rocks at the detainees.[8] Hashem Muhsen, one of the naked men in the human pyramid photo, said they were also made to crawl around the floor naked and that U.S. soldiers rode them like donkeys. After being released in January 2004, Muhsen became an Iraqi police officer.[citation needed]</p>
<p>It was discovered that one prisoner, Manadel al-Jamadi, died as a result of abuse, a death that was ruled a homicide by the military. One detainee has also made charges of rape under supervision of the soldiers.[citation needed]</p>

<p>Unsupported claims should not be present in an introductory paragraph. Since the claim regarding CIA officers being involved is not addressed elsewhere in this article (and particularly since it is unsupported), it probably should not appear in the introductory paragraph.</p>
<p>The inclusion of CACI in the introductory paragraph is equally a problem, particularly in light of no supporting reference. Please see the Talk page for the article on <a href="../../../c/a/c/Talk%7ECACI_74b4.html" title="Talk:CACI">CACI</a>, which reveals that this is not only the subject of debate, but that CACI has filed a lawsuit against someone who made this claim.
