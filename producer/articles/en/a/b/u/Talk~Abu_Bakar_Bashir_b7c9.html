<p>can he be retried if additonal evidence found for same crime. I just did some copyediting. thouhgt was there to start with. Maurabu removed it said it was pointless. Not necessarily. In Indonesian law, there may not be double jeapordy. It may be possible to retry someboby twice for same offense.

<dl>
<dd>I agree with a re-write - but that could make it worse, lol. I don't know about double jeopardy in Indonesia, although hasn't he been tried twice already? As for removing the "pointless" section, i just didn't think it added anything - notwithstanding double jeopardy (in which case the article shoud specifically state that), wasn't it kind of obvious but added no value? --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 01:22, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the U.S., U.K., and presumably Aus, a defendant could not be tried twice for the same crime by thesovereign for the same offense. So the statement in question added info of value providing double jeap doesn't exist in Indo. that's the uestion still unresolved. Going back to the larger question, a biography should be more than an indictment by detractors, it shuld be balanced. Obviously he is a mero in his own country, albeit a fundamentalist.

<dd>Do you mean a "hero" rather than "mero"? That is not at all obvious. He is strongly pushing for Indonesia to be run on sharia lines but that is only supported by a minority of Muslims in that country and this has been the case for decades. Just cos you see a few hundred people crowding around him on the news, doesn't mean he speaks for the other 200million. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 11:51, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>People don't have to come and crowding around him to show their supports. Quite a big number of Muslims in Indonesia support sharia, though it have not reached 2/3 portion to be able to amendment the law. You can check the last election result and you will see Islamic parties got a big number. And very little people in Indonesia regards him as terrorist. This article is very POV, because the lack of Indonesian sources that can be cited, so the article becomes pro-Australia biased <b><a href="../../../n/i/e/User%7ENielswik_fd59.html" title="User:Nielswik">Nielswik</a></b><sub><a href="../../../n/i/e/User_talk%7ENielswik_2384.html" title="User talk:Nielswik">(talk)</a></sub> 12:05, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is way off 2/3 majority. THe two biggest parties at the last election were secular based scoring roughly 20% each. The next three parties were 2 Islamic parties and another secular party that combined got 25%. THese were all moderate Islamic parties supporting the continuation of a secularly run Indonesia. One of them included the party of former president <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gus_Dur_c3bf.html" title="Gus Dur">Gus Dur</a> the esteemed, but unfortunately ineffectual former president. Those parties advocating Sharia and other strict forced <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamist.html" title="Islamist">Islamist</a> influences for Indonesia performed relatively badly. Not surprising really given the devoted but moderate interpretation of Islam held by most Indonesians. This was a great result for Indonesian democracy that shows that reasonable and tolerant Islam has a place in democracy (well, that is my take on it). See <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elections_in_Indonesia_5221.html" title="Elections in Indonesia">Elections_in_Indonesia</a></dd>
<dd>As for the original question re double jeopardy, it is my understanding that it doesn't apply in Australia like in the US. I might be wrong though. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 12:23, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that is roughly correct. But my point was that only a few of these parties are advocating Indonesia be run along strict Sharia lines (or similar) and of the seven they are the least popular. I think it is ineviteble Islam has an increasing influence in INdonesian life and that is fine, but as for saying it will become a strict Islamic state, I can't see that happening and is against the majority of Muslims' opinions. Sure, they are devoted to Islam, but in their Indonesian way. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 13:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry about the bad spelling, DJ only applies to the same soverign. For example in the U.S. you could be retried in Federal court even after being acquitted in a state court(does not aply to hung juries). Or even called back up to military duty and tried in a military court. I'm sure it applies in Oz as a daughter country of the Mother U.K. but how about Indo? We don't know? We need to identify the persons on this forum with knowledge of Indonesia and defer to them or their sources. NielW appears to know something about Ineasa.

<dd>I am Indonesian, OldRoy, but i have no idea about DJ in indonesia.

<dd>About Indonesian election, 2 of the seven (National Awakening Party and National Mandate Party) don't say explicitly that they are going to implement sharia, but They resemble 2 biggest Islamic organization in Indonesia, <a href="../../../n/a/h/Nahdlatul_Ulama_a264.html" title="Nahdlatul Ulama">Nahdlatul Ulama</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammadiyah.html" title="Muhammadiyah">Muhammadiyah</a> respectively.

<p>The application of law anywhere and everywhere is unclear. That's why defendants hire expensive laywers. To believe different is ethnocentric. After conviction of a capital offense, the average length of time on death row in the United States while cases are on appeal can last 15 years! Indonesian law is said to be based on <i>Civil Law</i> and not on the <i>Common Law</i> and therefore not based on <i>stare decisis</i> or precedent but I think that's bullcrap. I"m sure they have annotated statues and don't reinvent the wheel in every fresh case.

<p>The present problem in Indo appears to be retrospective laws. Apparently they passed laws after some terror acts which applied post ex facto or after the fact. This in general is not a good thing to criminalize conduct after its ocurrence. A person should be on notice prior to an act that its action is proscribed. that seems to be the problem in what I've been reading.

<dd>Well, from a <b>technical legal</b> point of view, what odlroy says is correct, but from a <b>moral</b> point of view you are surely not suggesting that knowingly bombing such venues with the expectation of killing people is somehow OK as these laws were not in place? Surely that is no excuse for mass murder? it is an interesting point though. A year or 2 ago, there was discussion as to whether prosecutors had made an error in using the new terrorism laws to prosecute. A fair point was made that existing <i>murder</i> laws were fine AND much less likely to subject to appeal. I know there were appeals arguing retrospective laws were invalid. Even it that is legally correct, i think we all know would have been bulls**t to release people who had admitted to killing 202 people. Murder is murder whether there are anti-terror laws in place or not.--<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 23:41, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Murder is opinion, killing is fact. Murder is killing plus. The plus part has the added dimensions of unjustified, intentional or acting with substantial certainty of a forseseeable result, without excuse which elements have to be determined judiciously. For example, some would argue dropping millions of second order ( second order means there is a seconday explosion) cluster munitions upon a civilian population within the last 24 hours of war after a cease hostilites U.N. resolution is signed is "Murder" but Olmert, Dan Halutz, and Peretz have not yet been charged. Millions of these cluster bomb duds are laying around to maim children and farmers. They are far more horrendous than the Bali bombing I&amp;II. Often Westerners get on the soapbox about "morals," when their interests are involved and ignore the other sides perspective which drives violence spirals. The wise men have always said it all started in the middle east and that's the place to fix it. OZ minister Howard strongly supported Israel in the recent fracas. The whole issue of retrospective punishment was raised at the Nuremberg trials, ex post facto laws, the justice of the victors. It's time for universal peace and quiet.

<dd>wow. Talk about off topic. Mine was a fairly simple question - no need for all the rest. I really can't be bothered talking with people who seem to be suggesting that killing civilians is somehow justified and a matter of "opinion". I don't think anyone can justify the killing of one group of people because another did it. It's not about westerners vs. whoever it is you think you speak for - what's with the "them and us" business? It's about people. Simple. Murder is murder wherever it is and whether it is 1 or 1 million people. As for your claims of a "soapbox", i find that funny given your previous post.--<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 13:44, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess this has been off topic, if you guys are still interested this discussion can be moved somewhere. And if you do it, don't forget to put a move notice below this discussion. I agree with OldRoy on double standard, and i agree with merbabu on the bali bomb perpetrator should be punished. But i believes the perpretrator is not only the so-called JIs, but also foreign agencies who wanted to blame Indonesian muslims. And sure, what Israel did is really bad. And to make it worse, people still call Palestinians (who suffer from Israeli occupation, full embargo, and ruthlessness) as terrorists. They have their lands invaded, bombed and occupied, their family killed in brutal way, and they fight back with anything they have. And for this resistance they are called terrorists. Poor Palestinian. Poor Lebanese. Poor Iraqis. Poor Afghanistani. Muslim suffers everywhere. But people call them terrorist. I also feel sorry for Australian kiled in Bali, American killed in WTC, and any other terrorist actions, but at least people dont call them terrorists --<b><a href="../../../n/i/e/User%7ENielswik_fd59.html" title="User:Nielswik">Nielswik</a></b><sub><a href="../../../n/i/e/User_talk%7ENielswik_2384.html" title="User talk:Nielswik">(talk)</a></sub> 14:25, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As you think that sounds stupid, i think i have to explain you. Bashir believes that Indonesian bombers was involved, but CIA knew this in advance, and then, place more powerful bombs (the "mini-nuke" bombs) to maximize the effect, and justify its claim that Indonesia is a "sarang teroris". In fact, the Indonesian bombers confessed that they bombed using <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potassium_chlorate.html" title="Potassium chlorate">potassium chlorate</a>, and I read this material couldnt have caused such a great explosion which killed 202 deaths and destroyed building several blocks away. And that also explains why US consular building wasn't much affected, though it was one of three location of the bomb-blasts. <b><a href="../../../n/i/e/User%7ENielswik_fd59.html" title="User:Nielswik">Nielswik</a></b><sub><a href="../../../n/i/e/User_talk%7ENielswik_2384.html" title="User talk:Nielswik">(talk)</a></sub> 14:55, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The bombers have also confirmed all the clear evidence that the Paddies bomb was a backpack bomb, and that the second Sari Club bomb was in a van. They found bits of the truck, and the prosecutors built a replica of the bomb, which the bombers gladly described on freely transmitted TV. I don't why people are so quick to believe whacky conspiracies. Furthermore, i don't believe accepting the truth is any way a slur on Islam, Muslims or Indonesians - who like any group of people are overwhemingling decent. Of course, the question of whether ABB was involved is a completely seperate question, and I admit, is less clear than the question of what sort of bombs were involved. regards --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 23:53, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
