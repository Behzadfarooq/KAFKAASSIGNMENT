<p>Jesus! Nice work, mate. Image and everything. I reckon that the next thing we need to do is see what the general opinion of this idea is (we could just wait and see what comes up on AN), find a few more people willing to take this on, and then go live. You've done a great job, cheers!</p>
<p>We could rig this so that it runs like <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a> run now, as in rather than having a load of subpages, like AfD, just having a template at the top of the page explaining the policy and how-to, and then a list below. It seems to me like that'd be a less complicated setup and as more likely to avoid confusion. What do you think? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(talk)</a> 22:39, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My hope is that each case will only have one subpage (I used two for example purposes, so I could have one with just the investigation report and a second with the contact summary); I opted for subpages because it will allow the contact to direct the person they speak with directly to a page with all the information. (My experience is, the person you talk to wants a summary, and linking them to a page like this would be perfect for that.) Some of the stuff could be simplified down; rather than having a /In Contact and /Under Investigation page with all the cases listed, and transcluded into the page, they could just be listed directly. (I'm a big fan of transclusion.) I think <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> works well with everything on one page because it's designed to be quick; list, look, block, move on. As a heavy user of RfCU, I can say that having it all on one page is a big pain to me personally; if I could come up with a good way to use subpages, I'd do it. My experience with RfM and the use of subpages is that it's best to have the initial reporting done directly on the page, with the investigation phase (under investigation and further) put on a subpage. It keeps down the number of subpages while at the same time keeping everything organized. I'm going to do a bit of restructuring to make it a bit easier to follow. <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small><font color="#7B68EE">)</font> 23:05, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</font>

<p><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE">I'd like to point out that what I've been doing at the Internet for Learning IPs might be interpreted as a change to the blocking policy of Wikipedia.

I have no desire to set precedents for unilateral changes to Wikipedia policy. I need to know my actions are accepted and supported.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE">Up to now the policy has been to block shared IPs, if at all, for as short a time as possible, so as not to prevent legitimate users from contributing. What I'm proposing for the Internet for Learning IPs is to set LONG blocks, possibly even indefinite blocks, and that legit users will have to request an unblock. I think this makes sense in light of the sheer volume of vandalism coming from these IPs, and the ratio of vandalism per solid contribution. However I am well aware that not continuing to give these IPs the benefit of the doubt is in some ways opposed to the spirit of wiki. My defense is that I see this as a temporary solution until a better solution can be found, such as the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_proposal_01f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy proposal">Wikipedia:Blocking policy proposal</a> mentioned by Hughcharlesparker. But I'm a bit suprised that nobody has raised any objections yet. I've been setting 1 month blocks on each new Internet for Learning IP that pops up on my watchlist with a vandalism warning. I've also been adding my proposed template, which does not caution against long-term blocks. If someone thinks this is wrong, please speak up. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 10:13, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</font></font></font></p>

On the other hand, though, we have to protect ourselves against vandalism, and we have to be very careful not to assume that the people who work so hard against vandalism will continue willingly to do so no matter how bad the problem gets. We have to take what measures we can to stop off the worst sources of vandalism, even if that means that in certain places anonymous users can no longer edit.

Block the IP for two, three weeks and have it be recognized that CP and Sceptre are allowed to unblock themselves to avoid these blocks (and these blocks only, of course). Contact the ISP and see what that brings. Once BPP comes through, if the vandalism continues and the contacting hasn't helped any, block the IPs with BPP for six month streches, log the blocks, help out valid users who are caught in the crossfire, and that's that. I don't see a problem with long blocks of majorly vandalising IPs. However, you do need to be available for so that valid editors can talk to you, register accounts, and thus get around the block so they can edit productively. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(talk)</a> 18:17, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</font></font></font></dd>

<p><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE">Mates, it's brainstorming time. We've got two main problems here, and here's what they are as I see it.</font></font></font></p>
<ol>
<li><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE">We don't really know what to do if the vandalism doesn't stop after contact, if we're ignored, or if we get an unsatisfactory response (basically, anything that doesn't stop the vandalism).</font></font></font></li>
<li><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE">Backlog.</font></font></font></li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE">Those are the big ones. As for the first, here's my thought. In the case of unresponsiveness, warn the ISP that if they don't address the problem that they'll be permanently blocked. If that doesn't work, close the case. After the next case of vandalism, six month block. Keep adding the block back on and on ad infinitum, but each time you renew the block, check to make sure that the IP hasn't moved, etc. If you feel comfortable, unblock the IP and see what happens. If it vandalises, put it back in the hole.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE">There are some major downsides to this, but I don't know of any alternative solutions, and WP will have to deal with this prepetual vandalism problem eventually. The downsides are largely that registered/good faith editors will be unable to contribute. My solution to this is, once <a href="../../../b/p/p/WP%7EBPP_ddbe.html" title="WP:BPP">WP:BPP</a> goes through, block the IP and allow for account creation and regusers to edit. That's that fixed (well, sort of, anyways). If account creation becomes a problem, disable it for that IP.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE"><font color="#7B68EE">The second problem is slightly bigger. First, if you take on a case, please finish it. Don't drop it for someone else. Secondly, one of the things I was thinging of is asking for the reporter to investigate the case himself, and then have investigators flesh the reports out. Naturally, the problem with that is that it discourages reports, however, the thought is there.</font></font></font></p>

Sorry for the cursing, it wasn't out of frustration or anger but out of a hope to get people's attention. I think that long blocks are where we need to move, even for IPs. The blocking policy says, <i>For static IPs, such blocks should initially last 24 hours, but repeat violators may be blocked for a maximum of one month.</i> I disagree with the blocking policy, and would like to change it pending some talks with you fine lads and the fellows over at the blocking policy's talk page. Naturally, I'll respect the consensus on it, but just because it's policy doesn't mean it's perfect. This is germane to this page as if that policy remains the same, then we can't do these long blocks, and there's no point in bringing this up at WP:BP if it turns out that we don't want this solution here.

Re-adding a month block as soon as the old one expires is, well, gaming the system, and waiting for the inevitable continuation of vandalism seems to me to be a poor choice when there's already twenty blocks in the log. These long blocks are for vandals who don't stop, won't stop, have had block after block after block, and would have been long since banned if they had a registered user account.

Basically, what's wanted in an investigation are the answers to these questions: Should there be an abuse report, what's the situation, and who do we contact? The answer to question one is, use your discretion, folks. Basically, at least five blocks, preferably way more, evidence of continued vandalism, no chance of stopping. Everything else's failed.

Subst in {{<a href="../../../a/r/_/Template%7EAR_report_18bf.html" title="Template:AR report">AR report</a>}} and build on that.
