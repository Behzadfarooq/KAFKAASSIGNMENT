<p>When I initially joined Wikipedia, about 2 years back, I did upload a handful of images under the Fair Use criteria without fully understanding it. Eventually, most of them got rightfully deleted while a lot others remain. Your dedication to remove images tagged as Fair Use but not meeting the Fair Use criteria is inspiring. I will try remove the remaining Fair Use images in my free time.

<p>I'm curious as to what you mean by "highly replaceble" for all these images you are tagging. You're using a "fair use criteria" as your reasoning, but I'm not seeing how this is applying to the images you are tagging. I just looked at a couple of them and they seem to come from screencaptures, and not from photographs that that are attempting to be sold, thus requiring a "free version" to be found. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 19:50, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can only assume when you say "more specific" you mean could I give you an example of an image. The first one I saw was the Rob Van Damme image; I think it was the one where he was holding two belts. I followed the source link back and it was from a set of images from one of the WWE shows. I was curious as to how this was something that needed to be replaced with a "free version," because it appeared to be a screencaptured provided by the WWE itself. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 21:18, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is what I am asking you. Where do you see that it is a "non-free license"? I'm curious if you are taking the time to find "equivalent" images that are "free," or if you are just tagging them because they aren't. Wikipedia wants free images, but sometimes there are not "equivalent" images that can be found or created that are free. I'm curious if you are taking the time to actually find an equivalent image, or if you are merely going through and tagging. I only say this because your contributions are riddled with nothing but tagging, and I hardly see anywhere where you have contacted all of the editors that submitted the works to find out if they have an equivalent. Not everyone goes through and finds every single Wikipedia policy, or even understands it for that matter, and if you do not properly explain what it is that you are telling them to do you cause conflict, as with Mikedk9109. You mentioned there was another version of the Rob Van Damme picture; where is it? I looked on his page but only saw the images you tagged. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 22:43, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I never claimed that you don't upload images, or that you don't like images in any sense. What I said was that it appears you are merely going about tagging any image without actually looking into it. It appears that you expect people to run out and stalk these people till they can get an image of them doing something that actually fits into the article. Has someone created an image for RVD of him and his two belts? The image itself works with the article, because it's quite an accomplishment, and noting that with an image can help a page. Are you saying that people should by ticket after ticket till they get a picture of him with his two belts? I'm not up on the wrestling world, but if he doesn't currently have the belts any longer, and you needed an image of him with the belts, how do you propose creating that image? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 23:30, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So now you think that articles should be restricted to a single image? As for it violating #8 on the fair use, if him winning two belts in the WWE is significant (I don't really watch wrestling so I can't begin to assume anything about it) then a photo of the event when he wins the second belt would be "significant" as described by fair use rule #8. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 23:57, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand most of your image tags, because they appear to be profile pictures of people, but this "free image" question wouldn't really apply if it was an image of some person in the act of doing something. If the image is attempting to illustrate a significant event (i.e. Like RVD's double belts....if that was significant..again don't follow it) then it cannot be claimed that the same image could be "created", because it is an event that is in the past; unlike a living person that can easily have their picture taken by anyone (hence why I can agree with having RVD's infobox image replaced with that type of image). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 23:44, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You said "holding a prize" wouldn't be significant...probably not if was just one, even though becoming a Champion is a significant accomplishment in other sports why not Wrestling, so him gaining two belts should be even more of an accomplishment in the wrestling world. An image of him accomplishing that goal is hardly "eye candy". It would be like images of wrestlers performing their "signature moves." It isn't eye candy, it's meant to help illustrate what is being said. I'm not trying to save the RVD image, it is just the first one I saw, thus it has been my example image as we've discussed this. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 23:57, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems it would be harder to prove that it doesn't pass the FUC#8, as its "significance" can be rather opinionated. One can say "it isn't significant to the text" and someone else could say the opposite. What is "significant" to one might not be to the other; it isn't as clear as a profile picture not being "non-free". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 00:34, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A good way to judge this is to read the article itself. If the event or belt is mentioned in passing as part of a paragraph, it most certainly is not notable enough. However, an entire paragraph dedicated to explaining the event and why the win was significant to the person's career, or even a whole section (i.e. several paragraphs) on this, would indicate that it is significant. It would likely be reasonable to use an image to depict something significant enough that the discussion spanned several paragraphs. For an event significant to have a single paragraph, it's debateable but I'd lean toward allowing it. Less than a full paragraph consisting of several sentences, it's clearly not significant enough. In any event, we need to limit the number of fair-use images. Some projects set the limit to a maximum of one per article. There's no hard and fast rule on this but admins tend to get antsy when there are more than two or three fair-use images per article, or more than one per page (that is, more than one per PgDn in your browser). --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 02:21, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In my understanding, it is possibly reasonable to use a fair-use image depicting when a person <i>won</i> a title as this depicts a specific event. The only debate is whether a free image could exist. However, it is not reasonable to create one in the future as the event only happened once. Here, I believe we should err more toward the permissive end of the spectrum. That said, we could only use a fair-use image attached to a paragraph specifically discussing that event and how important the event was to the person's career. Additionally, a hand-written fair-use rationale would have to explain that this was a one-time event of significance to the person's career. On the other hand, an image of a person just holding a prize would generally <i>not</i> be significant (it would be entirely suitable just to discuss this through text, the image adds nothing meaningful), however, nor would it not be replaceable. The person could again pick up the prize and have a photograph taken. Or the person's agent could release the image under a free license. The key point is that a person winning a prize or a belt or something is a significant event (well, assuming the prize or belt is significant to the person's career). A person holding a prize or belt that they won earlier is not a significant moment in that person's life. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 02:17, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Smallville images</span></h2>
<p>There are two images on Smallville that are hidden. Please do not put an "abandoned" tag on them. They are hidden until the episodes that they correspond with air. Screencaptures were released early and I felt they shouldn't be viewed till the episode airs, sort of like plot summaries not being written till after the episode airs.

<dd>Both are used in the same practice as every other episode image, as an image that is illustrating the episode. There is nothing "special" about them other than the same thing that is "special" about every other episode image on every other television show page. I merely "hid" them until the episode airs, one airs this thursday, and I think the other airs next thursday. I personally felt they shouldn't be shown until we have a plot to go with them. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 16:21, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So what exactly are you claiming is wrong with the pictures? They have their sources provided, they aren't "eye candy" because it isn't like they are useless images, they are used to illustrate the episode just like a film uses an image to illustrate itself. You keep saying they are "unfree" images, but you cannot actually acquire personal images of filming taking place. Screenshots do not fall under the "unfree image" of "easily replaceable with a free version" as they are images depicting fictional settings and characters, and kind of restricted access. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 16:35, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What part of "Screenshot" isn't making it? It has nothing to do with "unfree images;" it's a screenshot. There can be a million different screenshots, each one "replaceable" by the next, but the fact is that they would all come from the same source. Your argument makes no sense. "Ask yourself, can it be easily replaceable"....Yes, Sure...so could the next screenshot. That is why it is a screenshot. When I say "there is nothing special about it" I mean that I do not plan on including any other picture besides the one you tagged for that episode. "Special" as in there isn't something specific (other than it being the image for the episode) that is going to be used for. I.E. We aren't using one image for the episode and another image for something that happens in the episode that was significant and needs to be shown. Another example would be the episode "Sneeze". Now, One could have used an image to illustrate the episode as a whole, and then gone on to use another image of Clark and his "superbreath". This could easily create a problem because there is no need for two images, especially if one could do the job, hence the reason the one used is the one of him using his superbreath, because that was what the episode was about. "Rage" is about Oliver Queen using some type of drug to increase his strength and invulnerablity, hence the screenshot of him using a needle; "Static" is about a Phantom ZOne criminal (Batista) that is looking for Clark, hence the image of Batista. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 16:46, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You aren't even making sense in your argument. First you say "if it can be replaced then it isn't free", which means you think it should be replaced. THen you go into removing it period. The only reason you are even arguing about this is because the image was hidden from view until the episode aired. That doesn't take away from it's "freeness". You are attempting to apply one policy to everything and you cannot do that. There are other things at work here, like the fact that this is a fictional television show article, and not some living breathing thing whose image can be easily attained/created. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 16:50, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, considering that I'm following Wikipedia's policy on screenshot sourcing, I won't worry about it. Considering that it has been accepted practice to include an image for episodes, I won't worry about it. If you think that episodes should not have an image then I think you should take that up with every other television show episode that has an image, here's a though, why not start with all those Featured Lists of Episodes that have an image for every single episode. I believe there is a Featured List for the Simpson's episodes, and that's something like 17 seasons and counting, that's a lot of images for one page. You are trying to impose a policy for one set of articles that can't always apply to every type of article. These are not images of things that "can be easily obtained in a free manner". They aren't images of "living people or non-fictional objects" that any person with a camera can just walk up and take a photo of. These are images of fictional things that can only be obtained one way. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 23:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Abu badali,</p>
<p>I believe that the magazine cover image of the December 1986 Sports Illustrated that you removed from the <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Paterno_b1ef.html" title="Joe Paterno">Joe Paterno</a> article is relevant to the article in question. I also believe that it is allowable Fair Use material under the very rule that you said it was disallowed under.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7. An image of a magazine cover, used only to illustrate the article on the person whose photograph is on the cover. <b>However, if that magazine issue itself is notable enough to be a topic within the article, then fair use may apply.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While there is not an entire subsection of the article devoted to said magazine issue, the issue does hold significance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In December of 1986, Paterno was named by Sports Illustrated as their "Sportsman of the Year". <b>He was the first college coach to be so honored.</b>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The December 1986 issue of Sports Illustrated was the first issue in which a college football coach was awarded "Sportsman of the Year". Furthermore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is believed that the use of <b>low-resolution</b> images of magazine covers</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question</b>,</li>
<li>with <b>the publication name</b> either visible on the image itself or written in the image description above,</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
on the English-language Wikipedia, hosted on servers in the United States by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, qualifies as fair use under United States copyright law. ... Note: It is not acceptable to use images with this tag in the article of the person or persons depicted on the cover, <b>unless used directly in connection with the publication of this image</b>."</blockquote>
<p>The image in question seems to comply with these rules. If I have misunderstood something, please do not hesitate to let me know. I will not use the image in question until I can confirm with you that you agree that Fair Use applies. If you will not agree, then I will not use the image; I am not looking for trouble, just clarification. - <a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGodfoster_0318.html" title="User:Godfoster">Godfoster</a> 15:55, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

See my comments on <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarnildo_0cba.html#Missing_information" title="User talk:Carnildo">User_talk:Carnildo#Missing_information</a>. Who in the hell has time for this picyune crap? And my edit summary was calculated to call it as I see it so do take a look in the mirror I provided you with that, and think about how your acts here impact other's time. Don't be a time stealer, but someone that adds value. As it is, I traded emails, including one at length with KingJeff on getting GNU or PD images to replace that one so that everyone can be 'happy', if that applies in this juvenile exercise of ill-judgement and ill-will. In the iterim, the article is now going to be missing a photo that is defacto in the public domain for all intents and purposes. Doesn't that strike you a bit wrong that you can maintain an strict rules oriented action based on a rule which never had an existance as a rule, but is one guideline among many‚Äîmany of which are in conflict? If you care so little for your own time, try feeling guilty about wasting mine. I have far too little free time for this nonsense. // <b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fra</a></b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html" title="User talk:Fabartus"><font color="green">nkB</font></a> 21:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for the above requested fix up. Why didn't you point out this over all matter <u>was</u> a new policy when I'd said otherwise above. (I gave Jimbo an earful on the tagging for Policy being too similar to the ever present endless verbiage in guidelines as an aside to the WP:AN thread linked above.) So maybe that little good will come out of all that hot air.</li>
<li>(Sigh) Apparently some apologies are in order--you must have been patrolling a lot of images, not just taking juvenile aim because I spoke in defense of <a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKingjeff_611b.html" title="User talk:Kingjeff">Kingjeff</a>'s image, though your timing leaves that open to question as well.<br />
<br />
I'm removing the tagging on <a href="../../../g/e/r/Image%7EGerman1_shepherd_German_States_Before_and_since_the_French_Revolution_I_Baden_.jpg_0de7.html" title="Image:German1 shepherd German States Before and since the French Revolution I Baden .jpg">Image:German1 shepherd German States Before and since the French Revolution I Baden .jpg</a> which you tagged that night as well. I'm usually good (Anal, really) about adding links. Sorry‚Äîthe bad blood on the image had me figuring you were one of the edit warring partisans.<br />
<br />
I assume there is no review process on these, so I can clear the tags on these as I add the source links should any others show up. Do acquaint yourself with the University of Texas Library in general, and the key Atlases and authors of same. 'Shepard' should have been good enough, may he RIP!<br />
<br />
When did this policy go into place??? (I've been off in real life, and if my car hadn't been totaled, would be still) Hopefully Jimbo is finally growing a backbone and sees the matured project needs some consistency.

<p>Hmm... your edits to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crazy_8%27s_1e56.html" title="The Crazy 8's">this page</a> are not improving it at all! I'm going to, once again, assume good faith on your part, and hope that the reason you are being so very, very strict on this obscure Wikipedia article is because you have a genuine desire to improve the article... and not because, gasp!, it was created by someone you have a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">separate disagreement with</a>. Because, you know, that would be pretty petty, and very un-Wikipedialike. In fact, you've taken what was a pretty good starter article on a regional band, and destroyed it with your edits. This, too, is contrary to the Wikipedia spirit of cooperation and consensus. But, I know you would never operate in a way that is contrary to that. So, I guess I'm puzzled by your actions here. Oh well... it was a good article, for a while. Thanks for your "help"! <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenolen_a9f9.html" title="User:Jenolen">Jenolen</a> 03:05, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recently you reverted my edits explaining how a number of images were not replacable and told me to follow proper guidelines. I then progressed to opening up a discussion on a talk page of one of the articles to open up debate. The image was then DELETED within 24 hours. This is incredibly sneaky, and frustrating for people like me who are trying to play by these new rules. I would reccomend that next time this happens you do not revert unless the person refuses to discuss the matter, because images (and their talk pages) could get deleted in the time it takes for a discussion to occur. We are trying to make Wikipedia a better place, but if actions such as these continue to happen, a lot of good hard working Wikipedians may become too frustrated to continue, at the projects integrity will suffer. Now I will have to go through all the trouble of re-uploading the images, and then having to debate them once again when one of you warn me about re-uploading deleted images! -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 19:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The images that were deleted were similar images. Here is why they are not replacable (including the one you just tagged as being so.) They are promotional images depicting the team for a past event. The event is in the past. We can no longer aquire images from a past event. Therefore they are not replacable. The image is being used for an article profiling this past event. We cannot replace the picture with a newer one, because it would not make sense to use a photo from 2006-07 for an event from 2005-06. We have already determined with <a href="../../../b/o/b/Image%7EBobrae-premier.jpg_a9cf.html" title="Image:Bobrae-premier.jpg">Image:Bobrae-premier.jpg</a> that photos of living persons from the past are not replacable. -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 19:27, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I had opened a discussion, but the image was deleted before anyone could put any input in. That's the problem with the method that is being used, and is something I would like to see addressed. But anyways, these images are of curling teams, and curling teams change over time. Think of it this way. If we had a picture of the 1995-96 Ottawa Senators, would you put it up for deletion saying it was replacable? Certainly not! You cannot replace an image of a team from a past season. Curling is much the same. -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 20:05, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I'd say it is essential to illustrate the people involved in an event.

<p>Hey, I doubt the photographer in Switzerland knows Portuguese but I do think the german url you sent me will help. I will let you know as soon as I get more information on the results of my license inquiries and show you what gets done. If you know someone who speaks German, it might be helpful but I may not have to go to that point. I want the guy to know what he's doing if he licenses a photo though.

<dd>None of the flickr photos of Rae are CC-BY, I've yet to hear back from anyone I contacted, urging relicensing. Because a random Wikinewsie applied to attend a Liberal event early the campaign, and didn't show up, we're unlikely to be able to get into this weekend's leadership vote. Rae will either become the leader of the federal opposition party, and be extremely hard to get a hold of, or he will lose, and disappear into private retirement. Additionally, his campaign manager personally encouraged the image's usage. Until Monday, there's no hope in heck I'd be able to converse with them, to ask them to relicense the image, due to the busy last minute campaigning. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a> 22:30, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Your refusal to explain your image claims reflects poorly on the claims you make and on youself</span></h2>
<p>Please note that if the uploader believes in good faith that the image is usable under the FU clause and the uploader provided a gf rationale for such use and gave a source, the image may still be questionalbe, true enough, as the uploader may have made a judgement error. However, the courtesy and common sense demands that if you find this to be the case and you question the image's rationale, you provide the uploader and the rest of the interested users with the explanation at image talk on why you think his/her rationale is faulty. Such explanation belongs to an image talk similar to the dispute points raised by the user who tags the article as uncompliant with Wikipedia NPOV policy. No such tag can be added without explanation and there is no single case when I removed the tag when such explanation was provided by you or whoever.</p>
<p>Your dispute claim should address specific rationale given by the uploader as applies to the specific article rather than be a generic sentence pasted into hundreds of pages as done frequnetly by Quadell. Without such elaboration your FUD claim is meaningless and impossible to address by the user however much he is willing to satisfy you. Similarly to other disputed tag, your favored tag is meaningless if not accompanied with a specific explanation that is likely different in each an every case. Besides, using generic Quandel style "dispute" via pasting the same paragraph to hundreds of pages is also incivil. But completely disregarding the given fair use claim is worse than uncivil, it is disruptive.</p>
<p>I did not remove a tag in a single case where you or anyone gave an explanation on what exactly you dispute at the image talk. I did remove the tag in cases where no such explanation was given. If you want your tags kept, provide an image specific explanation at talk on why the FU claim is invalid rather than run <b>sterile edit wars</b> to force your tags in.</p>
<p>Please note that the current wording of the RFU tag that dictates how it is to be dealt with (responded with RFUD and never removed under any circumstances) is placed at the tag arbitrary, is not dictated by any policy and was not achieved by consensus. The tag being protected impedes the possibility of clearing this up. The tag disputes the compliance with policies the same way as the NPOV tag as explained above. Both are subject to 3RR. There are very narrow cases where 3RR does not apply outside of simple vandalism. Such are removal of good faith AfD tags, true. But AfD is in no way similar to RFU. An equivalent to AfD in image splace would be IfD. The analog to RFU in article space is "PROD" and note that PROD may be removed at any time and may not be replaced. Nevertheless, I do see an argument to treat RFU similar to POV or ACCURACY tags. But no way you can make a case for similarity between AfD and RFU. As such, RFU certainly falls under 3RR policy. At the same time, it should not of course be removed or added by sterile edit warring. Removal is acceptable, similar to NPOV or ACCURACY tags, if there seems to me a clear majority formed on the particular case or the tagger failed to explain his/her problems with the image. This is exactly the case why your tags where removed. Taking no position on the issue of the good faith of their placement, such objections are unexplained and cannot possibly be addressed, unless the image lacks source, rationale or rationale/source are frivolous.</p>
<p>Also, from the mere common sense it follows that if the fairuse image has an elaborate and/or self-evident rationale, whoever questions it needs to explain how s/he disputes such rationale. As such, the tagger should initiate a discussion and tagging the page without initiating such discussion is both uncivil and meaningless as users would have no idea what exactly is disputed. Yes, the burden lies with the FUI uploader to justify the image. However, once justification is provided, the common courtesy as well as common sense requires the tagger to state what exactly is the problem if he sees any in a non-frivolous, non-generic way but specifically in connection with the image in question. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 03:14, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, I did not revert your tag readdition expecting you to add your comments to the given rationales at talk pages. However, I am a bit surprised that you resorted to all sorts of editing activities except providing such explanations? Not only I will not delete the RFU tags if they are properly explained, I will restore them if someone else deletes. I am looking forward for your good faith explanations of what's wrong with the original rationale that is tied to each specific case made to a specific image for a specific article.</dd>

<p>Such considerations cannot be made in the edit summary and the summary is also hidden in history. There are good reasons why we have talk pages.

<dd>The edit summary will not get hidden in history if the tag was not removed. You criticise Quadell (and myself) for repling the concerns at talk pages with using a repeated text, but do you notice the <i>disputes</i> are almost always the same? Most of the time it is Either "<i>Its a valid promotionional image</i>" or "'I have permission to use this image<i>" or "</i>The copyright holder will not sue us<i>". Rarely, the replaceability is really disputed. I see nothing wrong in using a template reply.

<p>You assertions are false. First, the edit summary is not visible by the user who gets to the image from the article. Second, disputes are very different AND fairuse claim's validity very much depends on the specific articles.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re tagging and stalking</span></h2>
<p>You have been repeatedly asked to provide meaningful good-faith explanations when you challenge the images with various tags. Unless you provide the tags with the specific explanations at the image talk pages, they will be removed.</p>
<p>If the purpose of your activity is the removal of information from the Wikipedia articles, such activity is unencyclopedic and has no place in Wikipedia. If the purpose of your activity is Wikipedia's being both informative and compliant with the policies, which permit fairuse on case by case basis, your unexplained tags do not help to achieve that goal. Worse, they contribute to the perception of the uploaders as being attacked for no apparent reason by the user who makes it his main activity to pick on users selecting them for various unrelated reasons and dig into months of their work in order to harass them and discourage them from contributing. Such activity is strictly prohibited by <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHarassment_adc0.html" title="WP:Harassment">WP:Harassment</a> and for a good reason.</p>
<p>Wikistalking is defined as the editing habit aimed at "causing annoyance or distress to another contributor" regardless of their "stated goal". Standard methods of image patrolling, if this is what you are interested in doing, are many. Some patrol alphabetically, some by topic, some by licence and some at random. It is also acceptable to check the contributions of the known problem users. This is not what you have been doing either. You stalked the editors you chose as your victims for whatever reasons going through the months of their contributions with an exclusive aim to avenge their disagreement with you on totally different matters as has been shown conclusively at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Abu_badali_b366.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Abu badali">your RFC</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_comment_Abu_badali_3c1c.html#WikiStalking" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment/Abu badali">its talk</a>.</p>
<p>However, your stalking is a separate issue from refusal to add tags and it will be addressed separately as appropriate. For now, I would like first of all to remind you that tags that challenge the specific image's being appropriate for a specific article have to be content and image specific as the user who ascerts the image's usability needs to know what exactly you dispute. The unexplained tags are pure disruption. Before you continue your tagging acitivity, as I can see this is the only activity that interests you in Wikipedia, you are requested to add <i>non-generic</i> case by case explanation to the images that you already tagged. Thank you in advance for your cooperation in this matter. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 07:20, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think you're completely worthless. You made me a better editor. Granted, it was taking a steel bar and smashing and twisting it until it bends to your will, but at least your cruel tutelage had some postive things come out of it. Know I know how to be craftly and manipulative. I fear admins no more! And you always gave service with a smile. Right before you slaughtered my images.</p>
<p>But I don't think you're helping your case with that grotesque demonic pic on your profile&#160;:/</p>

<p>1) If you know nothing about the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crazy_8%27s_1e56.html" title="The Crazy 8's">The Crazy 8's</a>, perhaps other articles on Wikipedia are more deserving of your attention? I, however, was a West Coast college radio station program director, and experienced much of the content in that article first hand. Yep, it's slowly slogging toward appropriate sourcing, and as soon as we can get some Oregon types interested (which, by the way, having the article in existence is a good start), we should see the content of the article improve. Not all pages reach featured status in a day. Let this one simmer.</p>
<p>2) I re-uploaded that Giuliana picture because it was part of the inappropriate <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">User:Betacommand</a> "Oops, I deleted all these images and never read the talk pages" incident of 11/27/2006. Okay, his bad --- but repeated requests to reinstate the image got nowhere. The talk page did get archived; I waited a while for things to cool off, I re-uploaded, ignoring the roadblock "improper fair use" tag, since I intended to make a proper fair use claim; and made that claim. Asked someone to read it. Put up the "holdon" tag to prevent speedy deletion -- put on the "Replaceable Fair Use Disputed" tag -- and, what do you know, it was speedily deleted anyway. So, I guess there can be no discussion on that image. After all, what's right RIGHT NOW is right forever? (Well, I mean, what was right when I originally uploaded the image, and had an admin make sure it was tagged and sourced properly, that was "right" right then, too. Tough to keep up with rules that can be changed on a moments notice.</p>
<p>3) I really thought you needed to post some sort of response at the "Request for Comment" in your name. It told me a lot that you wouldn't/didn't...</p>
<p>4) Let me give you some free advice; it's advice <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wooden_d704.html" title="John Wooden">John Wooden</a>'s father gave to him: <i>Never cheat, never steal, never lie. Don‚Äôt whine, don‚Äôt complain, don‚Äôt make excuses. Just do the best you can. Your life will be a lot better for it.</i> Think about how you can apply that to your Wikipedia editing. Are your edits something you're proud of? At the end of the day, do you sit back in the Badali-chair, and sigh, "Ahh, I made Wikipedia better today." Please don't pick fights for "fun." And cool it on the WikiStalking. It's just really, really uncool.</p>

<p>Hi. I'm posting this on your talk page because I have noticed that you are often active in one or more aspects of our image use and/or image deletion processes.</p>
<p>I would like to propose <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_rationale_guideline_7257.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline">Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline</a> as a guideline to detail the necessary components of a "non-free image use", or "fair use", rationale. At present, it's kindof a moving target. Some image description pages have a detailed, bulleted rationale, while others have a one sentence "this picture identifies the subject". Patroling <a href="../../../a/l/l/Category%7EAll_images_with_no_fair_use_rationale_7ce8.html" title="Category:All images with no fair use rationale">Category:All images with no fair use rationale</a>, I've seen image pages that explicitly have something of a rationale that have been nominated for a speedy.</p>
<p>This is not an attempt to change or influence the image use policy in any way - and I would like to steer it away from becoming a rehash of the arguments over recent changes to the fair use policy. The only purpose of this guideline is to assist users who upload fair use images in correctly and adequately documenting what they feel to be the rationale for using the images.</p>
<p>So I would like for us to formalize what is required. I have also created <a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFair_use_rationale_05b3.html" title="Template:Fair use rationale">Template:Fair use rationale</a> and I would like to propose that we use it or something similar as a template to assist users in creating an acceptable rationale. I have no particular attachment to the proposal as it stands now - I have created it only as a starting point. Please see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_rationale_guideline_7257.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline">Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline</a> and the associated talk page to give your thoughts and ideas.

<p>Hey - I see you've plastered SportsAddicted's talk page with four pretty much identical warning messages. It wouldn't be a better idea to list them all together in one message, which fulfils the purpose of listing all the images for his interest, informs him what is wrong, as well as not annoying people with having to scroll through a lot of identical boilerplates?

<dd>First of all I agree with Sam Vimes, second of all in my understanding any picture that is not able to create anymore (due to the people being dead, or whatever other reason) would qualify to be accepted unde fair use including the tag added by me together with the source. Anyways, apparently this is not the case and if that's true I'm fine with that and let me know, but please do not mess up my talk page. Anyways, if this is the case I won't fight the decission and you can delete them right away. Please take the time to also remove the pictures from the articles when you delete them. May you find more pictures uploaded by me, which are copyrighted like this (I uploaded more pics of death people) feel free to place the copyright violation tags to it, but now I do know why don't mention them on my talk page as I will see them appearing on my watchlist anyways.

<p><br />
I don't see what's wrong with the picture on the article for <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvia_Browne_e770.html" title="Sylvia Browne">Sylvia Browne</a>, I think this adequately qualifies for fair use criteria. This image appears on at least two of Sylvia Browne's book's (see the image description page for more information), and is to be appearing on Sylvia Browne's new book "Father God" To be coming out in early January.<br />
As you are no doubt aware, when the image you use appears on a publicly distributed book, it qualifies as fair use under Wikipedia Standards. Feel free to contact me with any other questions regarding this issue, thanks!<br />

<p>1) Image:DNAtree.gif - "This work is copyrighted and unlicensed. It does not fall into one of the blanket fair use categories.." Comment: seems an outright copyright violation</p>
<p>2) Image:Unlabeled Renatto Luschan Skin color map.png - "This is a derivative work ..." Original work cited cannot be found</p>
<p>3) Image: National Geographic - King Tut face.jpg - "This image is of a magazine cover, and the copyright for it is most likely owned by either the publisher of the magazine.." Comment: Article already contains several other images. This doubtful copyright adds nothing and seems more for decoration.</p>
<p>4) Image:African Genetics (primal).jpg - Made by cutting down and rotating Wikipedia Commons Image:Map-African-migrations.gif. Comment: The Wikipedia commons image map referred to is nowhere to be found</p>
<p>5) Image:Woman redhead natural portait.jpg - "Woman with natural red hair Creative Commons Attribution licensed by cloud dinner ((- cc-by-2.0 -))" Comment: no record of any attribution license or by a cloud dinner</p>

<p>You recently removed Image:Danica Patrick.jpg from the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danica_Patrick_f4a7.html" title="Danica Patrick">Danica Patrick</a> article, and then tagged the image as an orphaned unfree image.</p>
<ol>
<li>Should not the tagging of the image have waited until there was a chance for feed back on its removal from the article?</li>
<li>The cover in question is from a book by and about the subject of the article, hence the article itself is in a fashion about the book. This is no different than including a DVD cover on a page about a film, the topics are inexorably linked.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">violation of WP policy</span></h2>
<p>you deleted my pic and, following WP policy to the letter, I had another admin undelete it and place it in the delete consideration list so others could comment on it first.</p>
<p>You then bypassed that process and deleted it directly from the consideration list mere hours after it had been placed there, not giving others a chance to comment.</p>
<p>please put it back per WP policy; that is what the image delete consideration list exists for.</p>
<p>What you did is the equivalent of being a judge who found someone guilty, then bursting into the courtroom during the appeals hearing shouting "guilty! guilty!" and ordering the guards to drag the accused back to his cell and that the hearing be stopped.</p>
<p>the proper thing to do would be to leave your MESSAGE about why you think the image should be deleted, not unilaterally disrupt and destroy the deletion review process.</p>
<p>please respond on my user talk. note that "I think the image should be deleted" is insufficient response, as it ignores the issue under discussion. The issue under discussion is that the delete consideration list is the WP procedure for appealing a deletion, and you have disrupted that procedure.<br />

<p>I am going to make this short and sweet, cos i believe other users have tirelessly remind you that there must a valid clear reasons to remove pics. I understand the removal of the main pic of the Spice Girls article is absolutely unnecessary as it has already been cleared that that image is under fair use as in the past, many people put in promo, calendar, album covers that do not qualify for main pic insertion.</p>
<p>Also do not unncessary tag the Geri Halliwell pic as unfair rationale as it is clearly a screenshot of her at the Brit Awards in 1997, under the illustration of British pop culture... If u are going to tag uch pics, firstly, do your homework by finding fair use images to replace instead of removing and leave blank, it doesnt do good for other users... much appreciated. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStealthusa_96e2.html" title="User:Stealthusa">Stealthusa</a> 15:52, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologize for the sharpness of my comment. But I'm afraid I still have no idea what you're talking about. The article discusses Andrade's relationship with the landscape, and asserts that the photograph demonstrates that relationship by showing his own body in the landscape. The photograph is necessary to illustrate the point. This is as clear fair use as you can get. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 18:32, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I went and asked Emir about it, but all I got as a response was rampant incivility and many personal attacks. Even after I explained that the anon could not have been me, since the IP is located in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> an I live 900km away in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mackay%2C_Queensland_89de.html" title="Mackay, Queensland">Mackay</a>, he continued with his wild accusations and personal attacks (although, I must admit, by this time I made a few personal attacks of my own - I sometimes lose my temper, remember;)). I'll have to warn you though; judging by the user's block log, contributions and the content of his "discussions", he is a nationalistic fanatic, and seems to have little understanding of English, so you may get some odd responses from him. I'm telling you man, I'm on the verge of just completely losing it, and it all just started out with me asking him a question about a false edit summary. Yeah, this probably would sound like a weird request, since a lot of your edits concern images, but I think he may calm down after speaking with a respectable user, who also happens to not be a native English speaker.

<p>Thank you for finally resorting to discussion after editing articles many times without any discussion. Your personal campaign to remove images from Wikipedia that you do not even seem to bother checking up upon is not in the spirit of the Wikipedia project.</p>
<p>Thank you for your advice on the possibility of being blocked but I doubt if I should take advice from a user who has been blocked previously and has a history of Wiki-stalking and disruptions.</p>
<p>The original images for the Yu Darvish article were without a doubt public domain until you disrupted the page.</p>
<p>The Osama Elsamni pictures were taken by a fan that has made them public domain and they are in wide use.</p>
<p>The pictures for Aria Jasaru Hasegawa are one fair use image and one promotional picture released by his club to the press.</p>

<dd>I have absolutely no idea what the rationale is, since I merely re-uploaded an image that was uploaded before that date, after optimising it. Unless your genius can somehow decipher how I might magically know the rationale of the actual uploader, who uploaded it before that date (might I reiterate), then I would appreciate if you wouldn't tag images I've merely optimised the compression of after that date for deletion. If you need anal proof, then turn both revisions into uncompressed bitmaps and checksum them. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETene_aa9c.html" title="User:Tene">Tene</a> 03:19, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your concerns were invalid in these cases. I examined your claim, examined the information given about the images, and determined that the images comply with policy and can be kept. So, yes, I have addressed your concerns by considering them and finding them not to be cause for deletion of the images. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 04:45, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know what else to tell you. They comply with policy. They should not be deleted. Let's move on to images that are clearly violations. I've found several others that are not OK. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 04:51, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fansites do sometimes receive material from the commercial entity of which they are fans. More tellingly, I have seen several of those images used in reliable publications such as the San Diego Tribune. Glossys of those photos have also been distributed at Star Trek Conferences and at ComicCon. They are used as promotional images. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 05:11, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>These particular images have been widely distributed. They have been included in promotional packets for journalists. There is ample evidence they are promotional images meant to be distributed. Again, I say our time would be better spent working on other issues. Truly problematic images await our attention - not to mention the articles that we aren't improving while we are talking to each other.</dd>

So you're not going to find this image on his current new site (which has yet to be updated at all). However, since it's on an old congressional site (and the picture was taken by a congressional staff member), this photo is still public domain, regardless of whether or not the site is still in existence.

<dd>Ok, no problem. I really wanted to hear some opinion. For stub-templates, I believe silhouette images work better than million-colors jpg images because (1) they scale better to &lt;=50px and (2) as they are black&amp;white, they are discreet. Do you agree with that? But as this specific silhouette image is unsuitably ugly (that's a valid point of yours), I will try to find a better one in Commons (there are a plenty of them there). If you don't mind, I'd like to present you a list of them before adding it to the template. Would you help me to choose one (if there's at list one usable)?

<dd>I had a look at the commons but could not find anything suitable. You are correct that millions-of-colours images do not scale well to a small size, but maybe we can get someone to scale a more suitable image and convert it to a 256-colour web compatible sized gif.

<dd>One and two colour images are pretty dull for such an exciting project, even if it is for the stub.
