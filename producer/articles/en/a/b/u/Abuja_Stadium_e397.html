<p>The Abuja National Stadium main bowl is designed to accommodate 60,000 spectator seats covered by a lightweight roof construction. The main characteristics are the two overlapping spectator tiers; the lower tier accommodating 32,000 seats and the upper tier 28,000 seats. The lower tier also incorporates 56 corporate suites with viewing terraces and one presidential lounge for 50 guests. All functional and secondary areas are accommodated in the entrance building which provides a gross floor area of approximately 25,000 m². This building is arranged below the concourse level which serves as the spectators‘ distribution level and therefore provides several kiosks, banks, first aid stations and toilet buildings. The structure of the stadium is a combination of insitu and precast concrete elements. There are 36 towers supporting the upper tier and the roof structure. These towers are founded on 140 bored piles with diameters of 1.30 m and 1.50 m in a depth of 8.00 m to 30.00 m. Precast concrete elements varying between 13 and 15 meters in length are placed between the towers, forming the spectator stands. A total of 6,300 precast elements were produced in the company’s production yard 15 kilometers away. The towers are connected on the top by a 2.50 m high and 2.00 m wide hollow concrete ring beam with a wall thickness of 0.35 m. The roof structure is fixed on 36 massive concrete points to the ring-beam. For the first time in the world, the ringbeam for this kind of roof structure was made of concrete. The roof structure itself is a cable construction with a weight of 800 tons carrying a 28.000 m² membrane.</p>

<p>Although Nigeria had several stadiums scattered throughout the country, there was a lack of stadiums that met international standards. The capital city of Nigeria, Abuja, was selected to host the 8th All Africa Games in 2000 (a regional multi-sport event held every four years, organized by the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA)) despite having no facilities for such a major sporting event. The Federal Government of Nigeria embarked on a multi-million dollar project for the construction of a state-of-the-art stadium and games village to be completed in time to host the All Africa Games. The contract was awarded on the 18th of July, 2000 from a choice list of about 80 different bidders. Construction of the complex was initiated.</p>
<p>Citizens and athletes had doubts as to whether the completion of the stadium was feasible before the games. However, construction went very smoothly and ended up being ahead of schedule. As a matter of fact, the stadium was scheduled to be the host center for the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_World_cce2.html" title="Miss World">Miss World</a> <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty_Contest_eea4.html" title="Beauty Contest">Beauty Pageant</a> that took place later in 2002. Unfortunately, the stadium not being fully completed by then as well as an uprising amongst citizens forced the pageant to relocate to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. The construction of the main bowl went on from its inception in September of 2000 to its completion in April of 2003, well in time for the games. The Games Village construction went on from September of 2000 to August of 2003.</p>
<p>The official commissioning of the complex was on the 8th of April, 2003. Following its commissioning was the final leg of preparations for the games. The games that year were the largest in All Africa Games history<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>; 6000 athletes from 53 countries competed in 22 sports, watched over by 1200 officials. Over 1500 journalists reported for the world's media. The games took place from the 4th to the 18th of October 2003 and was deemed successful by many. The host country, Nigeria, accumulated a total of 226 medals, emerging as leader of the games that year.</p>
<p>Apart from the All African Games, the stadium has hosted important football matches, such as World Cup qualifiers between Nigeria and other countries. The first game played at the stadium was a football (soccer) match between two local rival teams; the Shooting Stars of <a href="../../../i/b/a/Ibadan.html" title="Ibadan">Ibadan</a> and Sunshine Stars of <a href="../../../a/k/u/Akure.html" title="Akure">Akure</a> on the 8th of April, 2003<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The first goal scored in the complex was from Shooting Stars' striker Shakiru Lawal who scored the only goal of the game after just five minutes.</p>
<p>The complex has given the country confidence to bid for various up-coming international events. The Federation of International Volleyball (FIVB) has given the Nigeria Volleyball Federation (NVBF) the provisional hosting rights of the 2007 World Youth Championship beacause of the facilities the stadium possesses. Also, Nigeria is currently bidding for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and for the chance to host the <a href="../../../2/0/1/2018_World_Cup_de75.html" title="2018 World Cup">2018 World Cup</a> as well as the <a href="../../../2/0/1/2012_Olympic_Games_2ff3.html" title="2012 Olympic Games">2012 Olympic Games</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from its function as a sports center, the Abuja Stadium serves as a home to cultural and religious events. Its capacity attracts various events such as concerts, and religious conferences, events which sometimes have preference over sports. Nigeria is a highly religious country with a population split almost equally between <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. Due to this fact, several religious events occur each year that attract a lot of citizens and require a large capacity arena. For example, in September of 2006, the Nigeria Football Association was rendered helpless over the Presidency's preference of a religious event in the main bowl of the Abuja Stadium to an international football match against Rwanda.</p>
<p>Some citizens are however concerned about the use of the stadium for such large events. Similar events held at the Stadium in Lagos resulted in its demise. The management of the stadium, however, intends to keep these events coming. Cost of maintenance is an issue and renting out the facility for various events is a strategy that has been employed to cover these costs.</p>

<p>The successes brought by the 8th All Africa Games in 2003 served as a medium for exposure for Nigeria, proving they could host a major international event such as the All Africa Games without too many complications.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> The games were successful with more than 6,000 participating athletes; a number larger in size than any <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Games_09a6.html" title="Commonwealth Games">Commonwealth Games</a> ever held. Since the completion of the games, Nigeria has had its eyes set on hosting the <a href="../../../2/0/1/2014_Commonwealth_Games_615e.html" title="2014 Commonwealth Games">2014 Commonwealth Games</a>. General Yakubu Gowon, an ex-leader and current head of the Nigeria bid team, called for all Nigerians to support the games for the "glory of Nigeria". According to SportsChampion, a local newspaper, Abuja was given such deep consideration because of its serene environment and sterling facilities. "Abuja was considered as the host city because of avalanche of ultra-modern sporting facilities such as the National Stadium, In-door Sports Hall, amongst others...Other advantages include its serene and beautiful environment, cosmopolitan nature and the availability of road and air networks which is linked to other parts of the world". The 2014 Commonwealth Games would be an integral part of national celebration plans for Nigeria's centenary.</p>
<p>The Abuja bid has received strong support from African commonwealth members, which make up a large proportion of the commonwealth, as well as Australia, in what would be the largest multi-sport event to be held thus far on the continent. Other bidders for the event are Glasgow, Scotland and Halifax, Canada.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/b/u/Abuja_Stadium_e397.html" title="Edit section: Maintenance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Maintenance</span></h2>
<p>Considered a third world country, several issues have risen concerning the maintenance of the sports complex. The National Stadium in Lagos, the most populous and industriallized city in the country, built for the 1972 All Africa games started off like the Abuja Stadium but today, is way below any standard facility-wise and environmental-wise.</p>
<p>The Federal Government of Nigeria, who owns 100% equity on the property at the moment has faced a lot of agnosticism both locally and internationally. The average estimate for annual maintenance since its inauguration has been about $7 million, a number considered high by many standards. Due to the high cost of maintenance, the Federal Government has been seeking options for privatization of the facility. Through the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), the Federal Government of Nigeria intends to grant a concession to a sole Concessionaire who will enter into an investment commitment, and essentially operate the stadium with a primary goal of generating revenue from the proceeds of sporting events, concerts, religious activities, corporate sponsorship, corporate advertising and other promotional activities.</p>
<p>The Concessionaire has the choice of assuming the role of Facility Manager for the property encompassed in the National Stadium and the Indoor Sports Complex, or employ a firm to perform the task. The BPE will act as the monitor in the arrangement, and the Concessionaire will report to the Federal Government through the BPE. A minimum tenure of 20 years was recommended, subject to review every five years. Maintenance of the Stadium and its external areas will be the responsibility of the Concessionaire.</p>
