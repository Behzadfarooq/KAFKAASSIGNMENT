<p>I've noticed you putting up a few images for speedy deletion (no source, copyright holder, that kind of thing) with complex reasons. Speedy deletion really isn't meant to handle that kind of request. If no source / copyright holder is given <i>at all</i>, or if no fair use rationale is provided, that's one thing. But if they're provided and you think they should be deleted anyway, the best thing is to go to <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 20:07, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, could you provide examples so I'm sure I understand which cases you mean? I'm not saying what you saying is baseless, I just want to better know what kind of deletion nominations you think are unsuitable.

<dd>Humm, just noticed ypu reverted a nomination here Image:SamWinchester.jpg, do you think it's a complex issue when the site given as source explicitly claims it doesn't owns the image's copyrights? First step is to remove the misleading source info, second step is to tag image as no source. --<i><a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu badali</a> <sup>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</sup></i> 20:38, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, that was one of them. I deleted another one anyway (wrestling image, you were point-by-point refuting the fair use criteria... but it also had no source info other than WWE.com. Maybe that promo image should be deleted, but not because of the source, honestly. It's more because we shouldn't use a promo image for that purpose, it makes more sense to use a screenshot and comment on its contents at the same time. If nothing was listed for a source, I would have deleted it even though I would have known the source could be found.. basically, people just aren't very responsive on that issue. The source given was probably the (immediate) source of the image, though, so, basically, the uploader satisfied the requirements and should have the chance to let the community decide. The CSD no-source criterion is there to eliminate large classes of abandoned contributions, not to give the idea that flawless source information must exist for every image. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 20:51, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"<i>It's more because we shouldn't use a promo image for that purpose</i>". <b>No</b>, the point is that, without a valid source, we can't be sure that image is really a <b>promo image</b>. Fansites (like the one given as "<i>immediate source</i>" for this image) are not a source for promotional material at all. They rarely have the license to use the images they use (engaging in copyright violation) let alone to redistribute the images for others to use.</dd>

<dd>The image is likely from <a href="http://www.cwtv.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.cwtv.com/" rel="nofollow">CW Television</a>, as one can see by its watermark (bottom right). A quick look at CW's <a href="http://www.cwtv.com/page/termsofservice.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cwtv.com/page/termsofservice.html" rel="nofollow">terms of service</a> shows that their images are not promotional at all: "<i><b>Using any Material on any other web site or networked computer environment is prohibited.</b></i>"<a href="http://www.cwtv.com/page/termsofservice.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cwtv.com/page/termsofservice.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
<dd>This image is one more case of "<i>I found it on the Internet, so it must be promotional</i>". Do each of those images on Wikipedia go through ifd, no matter how invalid the source info is?</dd>
<dd>Or to make things simpler... If I see an image whose source information is cleary bogus (like a fansite), can I remove this invalid information?</dd>
<dd>Or maybe... If I see an image tagged as promotional but with no info on when/where was it released as promotional, may I remove the invalid licensing tag? Does it helps if the image's copyright holder has a historic of forbidding such uses of such images?</dd>

<dd>I see your points. I view the no source/no license/no copyright holder <i>speedy</i> deletion criteria as requests that uploaders give us some basic information so that others don't have to do all the work... and if they don't, we can delete the images <i>without trying to fix the issue.</i> If they do what they're supposed to, their uploads could still be deleted but at least we should let someone volunteer to fix the issue first, which means posting it at IFD: to me, it's an issue of fairness and being welcoming. Don't worry about a deletion request at IFD not going through: it will, they almost always do if there's any kind of reason, and usually without any debate. I myself just feel more comfortable not using speedy deletion where it doesn't strictly apply. As to this image, I'm going to delete it now that the issues are all clear. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 21:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, the Lufthansa image I actually disagree with you about: that needs debate, it's sufficiently unique and possibly important that someone may know where it came from if it's posted on IFD. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 21:26, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Jenny Lind signature: it's clearly public domain, she died over 100 years ago. Sorry, but the reason we worry about source is so we can verify if an image is free.

I don't care to debate them any further, I made these judgements quickly while clearing out a backlogged category almost 3 weeks old that wasn't even showing on <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a> anymore. If you think my general approach is wrong, point me to a policy discussion that says so. As for my objection -- a lot of admins may speedy delete non-obvious images but some won't, so I recommend sending non-obvious ones to IFD: take it or leave it. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 21:48, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Abu, (may I call you Abu? it's been so often that we talked lately that we must in the end as a minimum be on a first name basis!), anyway, this time you did your homework well and I respect that. If faced with this kind of facts we must alter the strategy. Good research stands on its own merits and you did well. So I would like to ask you, if I reduce the image size by 70, 50 whatever percentage could that help? I gave MangoJuice the link last time and there is a special category for reduced images. Could you let me know? BTW from last time we had a bit of a debate, and I want to let you know that after the first impressions I have come to respect your capable contributions here. Take care. <a href="../../../t/a/s/User%7ETasoskessaris_38af.html" title="User:Tasoskessaris">Dr.K.</a> 19:02, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Abu, thank you very much for your advice and your kind comments. Indeed I accept your well made argument that we should not compete with the original website. However given that the scientist is dead and pictures are no longer available, I will experiment with some downsizing. If you find it acceptable then it would be ok, if not then it's over.

In theory, however, it should not matter whether or not media is actually "promotional" or not, because there is nothing about something having "an implicit license to reproduce [but not modify]" that should matter in terms of en:'s <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">Wikipedia:Fair use criteria</a> policy; the claim ("rationale"), in theory, needs to be just as compelling for this material as it does for any other unfree content. Of course, we are substantially less likely to get contacted by an irked copyright holder if the media really is promotional, but this should be beside the point. In any case, as I am sure you are aware, the board is doing some thinking about the role of unfree media on the various projects, and it may be that we will get some direction on the larger issue at some point in the not-too-distant future. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 23:38, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To take the last point first, you're quite right that we need to take responsibility for cleaning up our messes, and not wait around for some statement from the Board that will magically make problems go away. Your main point is something that we haven't really explored in all of the discussion about unfree media at en:. Most people know, I think, that we should immediately delete any media that comes from stock photo providers, because the commercial impact is very easy to show. Some people are clear that we shouldn't be using media from information content providers, like CNN, AP, or the BBC, because it is difficult to show that our use is transformative and there is an argument that their value is being similarly impacted. Your position is that other websites depend upon having traffic driven to them, and our use may impact that traffic. I have some sympathy for that argument, but it immediately leads to some very big questions, which I would sum up as "should we [uploaders] be worried about <i>Castle Rock vs. Carol Publishing Group</i>"? -- it is not obvious to me why our image use is significantly different than our publishing of text about other people's intellectual property. I think that we would all agree that we are not in the business of entertainment, but instead that we are offering educational material about our subjects, and our use is in that spirit. If our policy is actually followed, this will be immediately obvious; our claim should be so compelling that even the copyright holder wouldn't disagree with it. In practice we have not yet found a very good way to help users make sure that their uploads are following policy. I therefore suggest that the best way forward in cleanup is to do more or less what we do already -- identify any ways in which individual files may fail policy and tag them for deletion, and take questions about use to discussion forums (like talk pages, project pages, or IfD). All of that said, and I've said quite a lot, we need to be clear on what policy actually is -- replaceability has become quite misunderstood. The point with replaceability should not be "Would it be relatively easy to get a freely licensed image", but, instead, "Is this image absolutely irreplaceable for the article" whether by some other image, text, a diagram, etc. This is precisely where we could use some leadership on the issue, because this makes many users unhappy, and will not be agreed with merely through repetition, reminders of our mission, or pointers to the various (fascinating through repugnant) reuse of our material that is already happening. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 02:11, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apologies if my observations are not welcome but might it have been easier if Captain scarlet would have simply added an appropriate tag once this had been brought to his attention. There seems to be little point in a continuing debate about this as I would suggest that adding copyright tags are best left to the original uploader as they will have the best idea as to how the image meets the fair use requirements. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambro_fced.html" title="User:Adambro">Adambro</a> 23:21, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reverted you. Don't add it back again. The imagevio tag is for identifying images that are claimed to be free but which are actually copyrighted by someone else. The image is identified as copyrighted, the copyright holder is identified, and a fair use claim has been made. If you dispute it, there are proper channels, namely <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a>, but that's where this is going to have to go. The imagevio tag is NOT for general use to try to delete any fair use image you want deleted. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:44, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BTW, you said "Please, understand that "historically significant photo" are "generally permitted under fair use" when used in an article or section about the photo itself." I do understand that, actually, and there were a number of image deletions I got involved with where that was the specific issue. (I can dig out the specific instance if you're interested.) At the time, I actually asked Jimbo about his thoughts on the issue because the guidelines seemed to contradict one another. His response (which I can also dig out if you're interested) was that he didn't see a big deal in using a "historical use" photo without specifically discussing the photo, just as long as the photo is really irreproducible. In the batch of debates that came up at that time, several of the images were deleted, and this one may be as well, but the issue was controversial and attracted a lot of debate for an IFD, so it needs a process where open discussion can take place. However, I do really think, based on my experience on this issue, that a photo of him at some significant moment, like winning the Nobel Prize, would likely be kept. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:59, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My memory was a little fuzzy. Here's a diff of my own edit, but Jimbo's relevant response is in the same section: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99776538" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99776538" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. He actually sets out some boundaries that are kind of obvious: on the one hand, any random picture of a very famous dead person like Elvis should definitely not be considered irreplacable. But on the other hand, he refutes the idea that the photo itself has to be significant, although he prefers to give the example of a depiction of an event in an article about that event, rather than a famous person that wasn't photographed very much. I hear what you're saying about replacability being only one concern, but there's a difference between having an argument against an image and it being necessary to delete that image.

<dd>I do think the image I suggested finding would be appropriate for Wikipedia, yes. The article on Chandreskhar isn't just about him winnng the Nobel Prize, but that event is quite important to the subject, so it's pretty close to the kind of use Jimbo endorses. Plus, Jimbo's opinion isn't the only thing that matters: it also seems quite reasonable to me. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 21:04, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An article that I'm trying to improve is constantly being vandalized. Specifically people keep removing a picture from it for baseless personal reasons. The article is <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodybuilding.html" title="Bodybuilding">Bodybuilding</a> and the image is the 1st one listed in "Areas of Bodybuilding" with the caption "Natural bodybuilder posing." The image isn't the best image in the world but it's the best FREE image I have that fits the description listed. So can you keep an eye on it for me? I have a feeling it will be removed from new users pretty frequently and I can't watch it 24/7. So if you see that it's been removed can you add it back as it was?

<p>I bet the blurry one is legitimately CC-licensed. From the rest of the pictures, it looks like he went to this event and sat pretty far away. I imagine he downloaded some professional photos (including the good naomi campbell one) and stuck them in the flickr set to let other people know what was going on... asking on flickr would probably be a good solution. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalliopejen_5e93.html" title="User:Calliopejen">Calliopejen</a> 16:56, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your take on what is and is not acceptable for photos is an interesting one.

Though the picture used in the infobox does not seem to be acceptable under your standards it was included when the article got featured article status. Doesn't the existance of this photo prove that your take on fair use is mistaken?</p>

<dd>In general, you can only use this material if the author (assuming he's still the copyright holder) would agree to give permission for anyone to use the material for any purpose. Simply giving "<i>permission to post materials of his book on the web</i>" is not enough for Wikipedia. --<i><a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu badali</a> <sup>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</sup></i> 16:41, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The phrase "<i>for a straight public domain</i>" was used by WP advisor in response to my above question.

<p>If you dislike any images that I have placed in an article please delete them as quickly as possible and I hearby give you persmission to do so without cluttering up my talkpage with notifications. It seems likely that Wikipedia will soon instigate the same photo policy as wikinews which bans any photos that claim fair use at all - allowing only free images.

<p>Abu badali, I have confirmed that Chandra images, if not tagged on the site as including information from ground-based telescopes which are not under the control of NASA, are, in fact, completely public domain for all purposes, including commercial, so long as NASA-endorsement is not implied through their use (which is actually a completely different issue from use).

<p>I think I'm starting to understand your rationale for wanting this photo deleted. "Abu" is a title frequently used by Palestinian terrorists (Abu Daoud, Abu Nidal, Abu Mazen and Munich's Abu Halla come immediately to mind). Nobody wants to be constantly reminded - especially by photograph - of innocent victims of their ethnic group's crimes. Would you rather I had posted a photograph of the blown-up helicopter? Would that make you feel better about this whole thing?</p>

<p>Abu badali, I'm curious, have you ever come across a promotional image that was from a press kit or a site indicating in the terms of use that the image may be used for promotional- or press-related things. A while ago when I picked thirty or so promotional images at random, most of them did not include a source, those that did were from an official website but weren't promotional, and think that there was one I thought might actually be a promotional image. What have been your results? --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User_talk%7EIamunknown_bbeb.html" title="User talk:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 03:12, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe I have once see a source for real promotional image for the Lost tv-series, but I'm not sure. I also have the impression that I once was pointed to a source of real promotional image for Comedy Central's produtcions.</dd>
<dd>But the fact stays that 90% of the images claimed to be promotional in Wikipedia simply are not. I wonder if we could get a bot to tag for deletion all images claimed do be promotional but whose source is in a blacklist we would provide, containing the most common mistaken sources, as imdb.com, tv.yahoo.com, abc.go.com. fox.com. wbtv.com, sony.com, starwars.com, startrek.com... --<i><a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu badali</a> <sup>(<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>)</sup></i> 03:36, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would be nice, though I'm not sure how easily it would go down. People seem resistant to the idea that "Oh, an image on an official website!" is not necessarily a promotional image, no matter how much you want to believe it is. To get around that resistance, we individually could create a list of image description pages that link to those domains, create a list of image description pages that are in Category:Promotional images and its sub categories and then intersect the two lists and go through them manually (preferably with api.php or query.php) (ugh). --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User_talk%7EIamunknown_bbeb.html" title="User talk:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 03:44, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
