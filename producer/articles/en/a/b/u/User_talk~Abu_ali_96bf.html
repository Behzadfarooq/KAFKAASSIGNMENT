<p>the link between zionism and moshe katzav shows both your stance and lack of knowledge on zionism and i suggest you refrain from such obvious bias presentation on a whole ideaological concept by attaching it to an alleged (not yet put on trial) criminal... even if it's "just" for fun purpouses on your own userpage.

<p>i'm afraid you did not only refuse to remove your obvious connction of an alleged sexual offender from the "Zionism" title, but you made sure that my username stay after it was removed by an admin - your activity has shown that you have the intention of using this platform in a destructive manner even after being given fair warning - this is your third warning. Jaakobou 21:54, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sir, your warnings are totally inapropriate. My alledged offence in your eyes is to have a link to the prezident of the state of Israel on my user page. If you do not like the fact that Katzav is prezident of the State of Israel, then please direct your complaints to those that elected him. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 06:48, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The state of my approval or disapproval (check yes next to disapproval) of Katzav is non-related to the subject which is <i>"defamation on zionism"</i>. Mr. Katzav is not even a spec on the history of zionism but you made him your primary (and only) link - not to mention your later abuse of my username which showed lack of good faith (which you claim i mis-attacked you over??). i suggest, same as before, that you discard this counter-productive use of wikipedia. Jaakobou 08:10, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Moshe Kazav was elected president of the state of Israel not by me but by the Knesset. The president has few powers but his main function is to serve as a symbol of the state. I had other Israeli leaders on the list but they were deleted by <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">User:MacGyverMagic</a> who was responding to your complain about me on WP:AIN. Thank you for your kind suggestion regarding what I should have on my userpage. I think we will have to agree to disagree on this. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 10:01, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Abu, you don't have to keep those warnings on your talk page. There's no consensus about that, and one school of thought is that if you remove them, that is an acknowledgment that you've read them. Seems kinda nutsy for you to get a warning, anyway, for a content dispute (and for what it's worth, I'm Jewish and don't find your userpage offensive). <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 08:22, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I will keep them as they do illustrate the agressive tactics used by certain editors on Wikipedia. I am glad that you don't find my userpage offensive. (Although it is not as well informative and well thought out as yours!) Maybe one day I will have time to add some more information, (assuming Jaakobou and his friends don't succeed in getting me banned). <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 10:01, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Abu, I simply moved the warnings from your user page to your talk page as I simply thought you would not want them there. With regards to advising User:Jaakobou on his talk page about giving final warnings, this was because he posted a comment on <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> asking for help regarding your edits. The reason why I advised him was because 1)AIV should only be used to report users not get advice regarding them and 2)users should only be reported once they have been given a final warning. I wasn't in anyway implying that I thought your edits were vandalism, I was simply advising on the appropriate course of action to take with regards to reporting users.

<p>the issue of israel being deleted from this section and being stubbed in <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> is becoming an issue.

<dd>I think it reflects very accurately on Wikipedia. Israeli society is riven with racism, against Arabs, Mizrachi jews and foreign workers.

<p>Hi, regarding <a href="../../../r/a/c/Talk%7ERacism_by_country_7d69.html" title="Talk:Racism by country">Talk:Racism by country</a> well, I´ve seen it more times that I can remember&#160;:-( As you may conclude from my userpage: pro-Israeli editors "outgun" anybody else here. (Another favorite is to try to delete biographys about people who are critical of Israel....they are for some reason "non-notable"....) Anyway, I think all the editors running around inserting the total garbage of <a href="../../../s/h/m/Shmuel_Katz_de47.html" title="Shmuel Katz">Shmuel Katz</a> is worse...I just have to take three steps back and laugh of the whole thing...</p>

<p>I am now back in action (which does not mean I can devote all my time to Wikipedia, i have many other things to take care of). I took a look at the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> and Racism by Country aricles. What is in them about Israel at the moment is reasonble, though it can be improved. I have some ideas but I think anything I change must be very clearly sourced, so I should not do anything hasty. (I have tangled with mr. Humus Sapiens before. Regardeless of the Israel specific issue, by the way, I think the two articels should be merged - either the Racism by Country merged into the general articles or the sections on specific countries in <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> should be removed to the other one and where both had a section on the same coutry these should be merged into one. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Keller_28af.html" title="User:Adam Keller">Adam Keller</a> 00:31, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Welcome back. From my limited knowledge of your BIO I am amazed that you find time to even look in Wikipedia. Don't waste too much time here writing stuff which is liable to be deleted by right wingers. (The appear to have organized to finnish off the Shmuel Yerushalmi article. They can barely conceal their hatred for the guy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Shmuel_Yerushalmi&amp;diff=109502518&amp;oldid=109365010" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Shmuel_Yerushalmi&amp;diff=109502518&amp;oldid=109365010" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>). These guys hate me. But this is nothing compared to their hatred of their fellow Israelis who are working for peace.) Regarding the Racism article, to my amazement an Israel section has been added to the article and has not yet been deleted. We will see how long it lasts....

<p>You might be interested in this. Not sure if you're familiar with this issue, but the media secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain was recently accused of sending death threats to an American right-wing blog. The bloggers self-investigated and ultimately could not prove their allegations, but because of a single mention of the incident in Ynet, some users here feel that it warrants mention in this man's Wikipedia page, citing <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. I contend that it runs afoul of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, as it was an unsubstantiated allegation and extra care should be taken with such matters in pages of living people.

<dd>I was wondering if you know anything significant about her so that I could expand the criticism section on her article which as it stands is pretty slim. I saw her on Real Time with Bill Maher last night and just something about her pissed me off. In a way I almost prefer out and out rascists like Daniel Pipes because at least there direct and honest. You know where he's coming from, no matter how revolting his views may be. Whereas people like Ali and Irshad Manji play this extremely disengious game of claiming to speak for Islam and yet reputating it at the same time. I'm an atheist myself, but I try to remain careful that my secularism doesn't dovetail into a militaristic rascism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reason I mention this to you is that if you read the article on her you notice several passages of her gushing over what a great liberal democracy Israel is and how the palestinian disenfranchisement is mostly there own fault because of corrupt leaders like arafat. I think we need to more directly address these academic hacks because there real purpose is not enlightened discussion, but to give justification from everything to racial profiling, Guantonomo Bay, the Iraq war and the Israelie policy in the occupied territories. They are so called "House Muslims" who in the words of Tariq Ramadan "tell westerners what they want to hear. annoynmous 13:34, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hey, I know you are right. And I do do that sometimes. But it sincerely irks me that editing articles related to the Middle East has to be such a battleground where the first casualty is the truth. I mean it's obvious Palestinians are indigenous to what is now Israel and the occupied territories. But with the amount of noise they make, you would think it was about as controversial as claiming that we never went to the moon. Thanks for keeping a cool head and putting things in perspective.

<p>I don't know if you're Palestinian, Abu Ali. But I know that as a fellow human being, you share my pain at the state of the world. And I share yours. That's what moves me to write. My love for all people which begins with love for myself, then my neighbours, my people, and expands outward from there, everywhere. And if that's wrong, if passion is forbidden, and free-thought is dead, then let me die with them. For then, there is nothing in the world left to live for. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 20:54, 2 March 2007 (UTC) (Ahhh, the melodrama of our "Orient". Obviously passion and free-thought continue to live, and death is hopefully still way way off in the future. No need to worry, not planning anything crazy. Just thought I would clarify since once I read about this Palestinian guy at a University in Montreal that said he "was going to be famous one day", and the Zionist he was arguing with started shouting "So, you want to join Hamas?" assuming that he meant he wanted to become a suicide bomber. He was charged with making death threats, though the case was eventually dismissed after one of the witnesses admitted to writing both witness statements that were used against him and which in fact were identical.

<dd>Shortly after you helped me with Kurt Nimmo I got a ban. Isarig complained to the notice board an slimvirgin banned me for 2 hours. I got banned for an edit war I was having on the Dershowitz-Finkelstein affair with Isarig. I actually had two edit wars going on with Isarig in that article and the one on Nimmo. I'm going to continue with my edits, but I'm afraid that Isarig and his intimidation tactics will get me banned again. Can you give some back-up and talk to slimvirgin or some other administrator to keep Isarig from banning me.</dd>

<dd>Also could you continue with my edits if I get banned again.annoynmous 05:46, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hi annoynmous,</dd>
<dd>Apealing to slimvirgin to restrain Isarig looks to me like a total waste of time, as she will always back Isarig up however outrageous his behaviour, and will use any opportunity possible to block anyone opposing Isarig. I am not going to get involved in these edit wars because life is too short, and also because I am not sufficiently knowledgeable about either of these two issues. Don't edit war. Make watertight arguments on the talk pages, invite fresh editor involvement via RFC. Allow your opponents to expose themselves by their own unreasonable actions. And don't give our friends any pretext to block you. Good luck and take it easy. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">ابو علي (Abu Ali)</a> 10:06, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. There is an interesting discussion at the ANI. One of your diffs was cited, and 'educational' blocks have been threatened. See <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive211_fc8e.html#Personal_attacks_and_claims_of_COI" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive211">Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive211#Personal_attacks_and_claims_of_COI</a>. For some reason, the threatening user, <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">User:Jayjg</a>, did not notify the people he was considering as targets. Somehow that seems contrary to the 'educational' objective.

Conflict of interest can be personal, religious, political, academic, financial, and legal. It is not determined by area, but is created by relationships that involve a high level of personal commitment to, involvement with, or dependence upon, a person, subject, idea, tradition, or organization.</p>
<p>Closeness to a subject does not mean you're incapable of being neutral, but it may incline you towards some bias. Be guided by the advice of other editors. If editors on a talk page suggest in good faith that you may have a conflict of interest, take seriously what they say and consider withdrawing from editing the article. As a rule of thumb, the more involved you are in a particular area in real life, the more careful you should be to adhere to our core content policies — <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> — when editing in that area.</p>
<p>There is no tidy definition of what is meant by "too close" in this context, and editors should use their common sense in deciding whether this guideline applies. An article about a little-known band should preferably not be written by a band member or the manager. On the other hand, an expert on climate change is welcome to contribute to articles on that subject, even if that editor is deeply committed to it.</p>

<dd>I appreciate your comments Abu Ali. I know that it's almost not worth it to continue trying to add balance to those pages, but the funny thing with me and fairness, truth and justice is that I just can't let it go. Thoughts create reality my friend. So I work mostly on trying to get distance when things get heated and keeping my head up and my wits about me. It's true I waste so much time fighting just to get a couple of sentences added. But it must be worth it. What's that saying about innovation being 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration?

<dd>The injustice on these pages is nothing compared to the injustice you can see every time you look out of your window. So you have to keep a sense of proportion. Thoughts are important. But irrespective of the efforts of our friends here on Wikipedia and their little victories, they are loosing the war. Israel is the most hatred country in the world. More people see Israel as a threat to world peace than any other country. And this is not the result of "Palestinian Propoganda" but of the actions of Israels own leaders.

<dd>Thanks for both the offer to check it out and the best wishes to the fam (my husband comes home tomorrow thankfully so that I can take a break form this crazy editing schedule) and the kittens (I want to eat them they're so cute!). I had never hear of him either, and only came upon his name when investigating the origins of Israel's <a href="../../../h/a/f/Hafrada.html" title="Hafrada">Hafrada</a> policy. As I was reading, I realized just how important he is to policy formation, particularly over the last decade.

<dd>By the way, do you know anything about the late Proffesor <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Shahak_0de1.html" title="Israel Shahak">Israel Shahak</a>. His bio page on wikipedia is devoted slandering hime as an antisemite and attempts to smear him by association with neo nazis. (sounds familiar?) Huldra removed a particularly offensive passage about him being a too of neo-nazis, and after her edits were reverted, I opened a discussion on the talk page about this. I used to read his reports, but that was before the days of the internet and can not find them on-line. Do you know if there is a collection anywhere? <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">ابو علي (Abu Ali)</a> 16:12, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I do know Shahak's work (and it's terrible that people keep trying to marginalize his serious and important body of work). I remember that my Baba used to have books and articles of his in the expansive Middle East collection he kept. I will try to find Internet sources and I'll ask my dad if he remembers where they ended up. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 16:46, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>This is a review of the book, <i>Anti-Zionism: Analytical Reflections</i>, <a href="http://www.middleeastbooks.com/html/books/tekiner.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.middleeastbooks.com/html/books/tekiner.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> in the WRMEA that quotes and discusses one of Shahak’s essay. You might find this quote very relevant to the issue at hand:
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Zionism, writes Shahak, "can be described as a mirror image of anti-Semitism," since it, like the anti-Semites, holds that Jews are everywhere aliens who would best be isolated from the rest of the world. Moreover, "both anti-Semites and Zionism assume anti-Semitism is ineradicable and inevitable."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>This article <a href="http://hnn.us/articles/10866.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://hnn.us/articles/10866.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> at the History News Network entitled, "Poisoning the Well: The False Equation of Anti-Zionism and Anti-Semitism" by Professor Irfan Khawaja addresses the smears laid against Shahak and a slew of others. She say there is a broad trend of
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>… reflexive equation, by defenders of Israel, of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, itself part of the emerging literature on "the new anti-Semitism." Focusing on the undeniable fact that many anti-Zionists are anti-Semites, and that anti-Zionism can easily be used as a disguise for anti-Semitism, writers in this genre simply insist over and over that no one can be an anti-Zionist without simultaneously being an anti-Semite ... What is at work here is less a discernible principle than a robotic sort of cut-and-paste procedure: Come up with a list of people who a priori must be anti-Semites; then cast about for ‘evidence’ of this claim by finding sentences here or there to which you give an anti-Semitic interpretation regardless of the intention of the author or the context of the utterance. Where the evidence is simply too thin to support a straightforward accusation, insinuate that anti-Semitism is at work without actually making an assertion that it is. Repeat the process until you run out of people.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>And finally, this is an article about a talk that Shahak gave with Chomsky <a href="http://www-tech.mit.edu/V114/N55/chomsky.55n.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www-tech.mit.edu/V114/N55/chomsky.55n.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> that described the debate provoked by their analyses:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>We are doing to Palestinians what Christians have done to [Jews]," Shahak continued, tracing the history of the oppression of Jews throughout European history. "It is quite common that a persecuted group becomes a persecutor," he said. … In reply to the audience's hostility, Shahak said that Jews who perpetuate a "denial of common humanity" are "Jewish Nazis." Another audience member angrily responded to Shahak, "You were lucky you survived [the Holocaust], but 6 million Jews didn't." Several others said that Shahak's use of the phrase "Jewish Nazis" was disrespectful to the memory of the Holocaust. Shahak maintained that "Jews can become Nazis."</p>

<p>Abu ali, it would be really helpful if looked at the discussion on the Talk: page before reverting. The obituaries you claim were "deleted" are already listed on the page <b>twice</b>. Are you saying these articles are so special that they actually must be listed three times? It's certainly not done in any other article I've seen, nor have I ever seen and "Obituaries" section in an article. Please try to follow Wikipedia conventions, and participate in the talk page rather than reverting. Thanks. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:10, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, that's me (RolandR, not RonaldR. As I used to say when I was trying to learn Arabic in Jerusalem many years ago, and everyone called me Ronald, "Mish zay ar-rais" – ie Reagan).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, having noticed that the article on <a href="../../../i/l/a/Ilan_Halevi_bdba.html" title="Ilan Halevi">Ilan Halevi</a> was mistakenly linked to <a href="../../../m/a/a/Maavak_Sozialisti_6f89.html" title="Maavak Sozialisti">Maavak Sozialisti</a>, I have created a new article on <a href="../../../m/a/a/Maavak.html" title="Maavak">Maavak</a>. I hope to do more on other descendants of Matzpen, as time allows. Do you have any knowledge or information to contribute?</p>
<p>Please join me for a cup of coffee and a baklava.</p>
