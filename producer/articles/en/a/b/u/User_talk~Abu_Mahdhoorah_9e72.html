<p>I have <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prod.html" title="Prod">prod</a> tagged yout article creation, Where is Allah, because it's not really an encyclopedia article. It's an essay that violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<p>I'll try... how do I even reply to these messages? I'm such a newbie! Also, I opened up the discussion forum for ideas, hopefully that should make the article more NPOV --Abu Mahdhoorah 21:16, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I responded to your query on Talk:Where is Allah. To be completely honest, I know rather little of the intracacies of Muslim faith or where the differences in opinions lie between the various branches. I'm afraid I won't be much help content-wise, but, as I suggested on the talk page, the article may be salvagable if you can:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Make clear the subject addressed</li>
<li>Make it an academic discussion</li>
<li>Remove some of the language that makes it overtly POV</li>
</ol>

<dd>One more note--it is strongly discouraged to remove warnings that other users have given you (for vandalism and such). Anyone can actually look in your edit history to see that you've removed them, and seeing such actions may make other Wikipedia editors less likely to trust your actions and intent, despite <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. From <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAN_11b1.html" title="WP:VAN">WP:VAN</a>: "users generally are permitted to remove and archive comments [from their talk page] at their discretion, except in cases of warnings, which they are generally prohibited from removing, especially where the intention of the removal is to mislead other editors." If you feel that you've been given warnings that were undeserved or the product of a misundertanding, you should ask an <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">admin</a> to clear them off for you (with an appropriate edit summary).

<dd>They take up so much space on this page, that's why I removed them. I thought, hey it's my page right? I get your point though since many people may think I'm trying to hide something, etc. Thanks for looking out. --Abu Mahdhoorah 21:43, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Assalamu Alaikum. I don't think it's a good idea to link the Where is Allah article from <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> until you can make significant improvements to it. Right now, it looks like an essay from only the Salafi point of view. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><font size="0" color="#FF0000"><i>talk</i></font></span></a></sup> 21:17, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hold on... before anything, explain how you send messages like that. I'm having trouble. Thanks --Abu Mahdhoorah 21:18, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Send messages like what brother? Do you mean typing a message on another user's talk page? Just click on their name, then click "discussion", click "edit this page" and then you can type your message to them. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><font size="0" color="#FF0000"><i>talk</i></font></span></a></sup> 21:18, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Wa alaiykom Assalam wa rahmatuallahi wa barakatu. Oh... you're just adding to my discussion page... and then it's notifying me that I have a new message. I get it now. Also, let me ask you a serious question. Why is it considered an article from the "Salafi" point of view when the evidence is clear from the Qur'aan and the Sunnah? I can bring more than enough evidence from other scholars (the 4 imams) and others. In Islam, there ARE point of view that are completely incorrect. If we open the doors up for anyone to write whatever they want, and then someone tries to write something correct and is accused of holding a point of view, then where are we going? Backwards! We cannot put up an article for example about what consitutes faith in Islam, with proven evidence, and then be accused of having a biased point of view because someone else believes there is a difference. For example, the idea that faith neither increases nor decreases is completely incorrect and goes against the basis tenets of Islam. So then, an article should be written to show the correct and INCORRECT view point, but they're put at the same level? I'm trying to honestly, and sincerely understand how things work. It is diffucult to put up an article and be accused of having one POV since all other points are not considered (which conflict with the creed of Islam). Thanks --Abu Mahdhoorah 21:24, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think that if I ask most Sunnis, that they would agree in saying that Allah(swt) sits up high on a throne. I don't know how Sufis would regard this principle either. I know that all Shi'a would outrightly reject it. You have to remember that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia though - so it cannot make judgements on what is right or what is wrong, it's simply here to present neutral information. Please feel free to ask me any more questions. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><font size="0" color="#FF0000"><i>talk</i></font></span></a></sup> 21:29, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't agree that Allah sits up high on a throne either. This is not what the article says at all. Rather, Allah "istawaa" above the throne (ascended in a way that befits his Majesty). As Imam Maalik says, The istawaa is known, the faith in it is obligatory, the how is not known, and asking about it is innovation. So no one is saying Allah sat or whatever, we cannot say this. Rather we can only say that which Allah says, or his messenger says, that Allah ascended upon the throne in a way that befits his Majesty. That said, I agree that there are many Sunnis that do not agree with this, which is unfortunate because it is what the Prophet and his companions were upon (in matter of creed). Of course Sufis would completely disagree and Shiaa would call me kafir before I open my mouth (hehe). So I guess, to rewrite this article I would have so say "Other beliefs regardint the matter" and then list them? What do you think? And it is not easy to list them without indicating that they are not correct from a daw'ah perspective. --Abu Mahdhoorah 21:34, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that would be the way to go. But there are a few other problems as well. Right now, the article seems to make conclusions from certain hadith or suras without presenting who came up with these conclusions. That looks like original research, although I'm sure there are sources out there that do say this. What you need to do then, is cite them. Also, it presents the information as a matter of fact. You can resolve that after reading Wikipedia's policy on neutral point of view. I would suggest you start reading some of the information in help. Try to take a look at the articles listed under "article standards" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents/Policies_and_guidelines" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents/Policies_and_guidelines" rel="nofollow">here</a> before you proceed. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><font size="0" color="#FF0000"><i>talk</i></font></span></a></sup> 21:44, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
