<p>What kind of benefits was he recieving? The vaugeness of this statment could be misread as POV? For exemaple, he only has one hand (having lost it in the Afghan war with Russia), so most likely as a resident he was entitled to some kind of diability benefit. The implication of the text is that he was recieving unemployment benefit while working, or perhaps some benefit fraudulently acquired? --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalimfadhley_a4fd.html" title="User:Salimfadhley">Salimfadhley</a> 12:54, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
"Getting benefits" is not in itself a crime, and therefore it is pretty much an irrelevant point to make in a description of an individual. The statement appears to have been made purely to imply that Hamza must have been getting the benefits fraudulantly, or to imply that giving benefits to such a horrible person is waste of "tax payers' money". I would suggest that the author of the article has no knowledge of the facts regarding any benefits that Hamza may or may not have received, and is simply regurgitating shock-horror headlines from tabloid newspapers. (unsigned)</p>
<p>I'm going to remove "Abu Hamza was at one point gaining £1,030.65 a week in benefits." as it's not sourced, and seems very unlikely. There is nothing wrong with claiming benefits you are entitled to and the figure is way in excess of the benefits amounts people actually receive. The government hasn't charged him with benefit fraud as far as I know. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 16:28, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The point is, of course, that Hamza, who is relying on the British govt not to extradite him to the USA, and is funded by the UK taxpayers, uses his position to attack his host country. Or so it is alleged.</p>
<p>Exile 18:03, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well having worked in benefit office, it is possible that he was claiming that much benefit a week. It is a sad case whilst now he is in prison that it is costing the tax payer £25,000 a week to protect him.</p>
<p>Whilst most of you would not appreciate my view, he should be deported and tried for past crimes in any country that can provide evidence that he has commited any sort of crime.</p>
<p>If he hated this country so much, why did he stay here?</p>
<p>It's comfortable, and he likely saw it as a way to bring down the enemy from within. Which is, after all, the Islamists' best chance of destroying the West (and could be working). We all know how they'd fare in any form of open combat.</p>
<p>Because we are mugs here, and always will be. He should have been bundled onto the next CIA flight to pass through the UK the moment the US asked for him.</p>
<hr />
<p>I feel that the first few lines of the 'State support' section should be further reworded to be more factual and less POV. Perhaps also this section should be moved to further down the article, taking its place after more significant information. The current wording and position suggests priorities slightly more akin to the Daily Mail than Wikipedia. 194.73.118.78 19:04, 9 February 2006 (UTC)CA</p>
<hr />
<p>I would like an update to the status of his second wife and her further entitlement to social housing (after the original property was bought under the buy to let scheme and another property brought with the proceeds transferred ownership and then rented out in the private sector). It would be good if the following article was verified and not mere heresay. I can understand the need to be factual rather than Daily Mail speculation but there is a social housing crisis in the country and it is human interest to understand if this scarce resource has been fairly and legally allocated. It is alleged that she qualified for further social housing because of the breakdown in her relationship with her husband but this is disputed.</p>

<p>The statement <i>"However, as part of the European Union the United Kingdom is party to an agreement whereby extradition should be refused to any country which has the death penalty."</i> is slightly incorrect.</p>
<p>EU countries do extradite to the USA, however, they insist that the recieving country does not pass a death sentance. <a href="../../../c/s/m/User%7ECsmiller_404b.html" title="User:Csmiller">CS Miller</a> 12:37, Oct 19, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this redirection should be replaced by a disambiguation, since there are (where) two notorious Abu Hamzas.

<p>There are two different names given for his wife in the article, "Valerie Fleming" and "Valerie Traverso". Either one is incorrect or it's not clear he was married twice to different Valeries.</p>

<p>In the Arabic spelling of Abu Hamza's name, the alif on the far left should be on the far right, to the right of the ba' (before it in Arabic&#160;!). I have tried to move it but the font defeats me.</p>

I'm not saying that it is completely irrelevant to this article, but it should be no more than an observation that accusations of double standards in British Law have been fuelled by comparisons between the court cases of Abu Hamsa &amp; Griffin. And then <b>only</b> if sources can be provided. <a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeerathon_3766.html" title="User:Beerathon">Beerathon</a> 11:02, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article needs severe trimming, it currently reads like a collection of red-top tabloid factoids (and we all know how honest tabloids are) - I would do it, but to trim back to only leave what is sourced would mean an article (that is currently linked to front page) looking particularly thread bear. It is also going to be difficult to get exacting sources on much of this stuff anyway, given the controversial nature of the man subjectivity in source material tends to goes out the window, and hence the sources themselves would be fairly useless in providing validity to the article.<a href="../../../s/f/c/User%7ESFC9394_9d0f.html" title="User:SFC9394">SFC9394</a> 14:51, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I cannot find any sources that prove the existence of a substantial debate regarding double standards in British Law that directly relates to the Hamsa/Griffin cases. I've heard people alluding to the idea on TV a couple of times, but I cannot find any particular focus on the issue (except in this article). Reviewing the article's history, it appears that once the section was added, it was jumped on by numerous users who have expanded on and edited without regard to being relevant article's core subject. The result is a load of usubstantiated waffle and conjecture. If someone can locate some source material on this subject then maybe we can reconsider its inclusion in some capacity (see my comments in the Sources? section above). In the mean time I am going to remove the section. <a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeerathon_3766.html" title="User:Beerathon">Beerathon</a> 12:21, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK. I have noted comparisons with Griffin under the section covering Hamza's court case, but I did not make specific reference to the idea that it has sparked a debate over racial bias in the British Courts System. The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4690132.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4690132.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC source</a> shows that the Chairman of the Islamic Human Rights Commission believes that the differing verdicts may suggest 'that controversial figures in one community might get treated differently than others', but this does not constitute any kind of formal accusation. <a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeerathon_3766.html" title="User:Beerathon">Beerathon</a> 15:12, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This comparison I think is pretty superficial. The main charges against Hamza were incitement to murder - a markedly different thing to incitement to racial hatred. Griffin was acquitted on only half of his charges and faces a re-trial. The charges he was acquitted on related to a speech about Stephen Lawrence. Most people would find what he said was objectionable and racist, but the law is not against racist speech per se. The jury must have felt that the crucial element of incitement was missing - at least thats how I read it. It should also be noted that Hamza was acquitted on a few charges of the same offence.

<p><i>According to a POPULUS survey from December 2005, Muslims in Britain oppose his views by a factor of two-to-one; however, among the age group 18-24, the figures are reversed, and 2 out of 3 who expressed an opinion agree with his views. <a href="http://www.populuslimited.com/poll_summaries/2006_02_07_times.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.populuslimited.com/poll_summaries/2006_02_07_times.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></i></p>
<p>Presumably that refers to "Younger Muslims are also more likely than those in general to agree with Abu Hamza (by 27% to 13%)" in the reference. But that isn't what those numbers mean. The 13% is the %ge of all who agree, not the %ge of 18-24 who disagree. The latter figure is not given.</p>

<p>This article is in desperate need of a cleanup - at points the article becomes frankly unreadable. There have obviously been some recent edits which are extremely badly written. I note for example the references to abu hamza's bigamy. The article is becoming an embarrasment.</p>

<dd>Reviewing the changes made this morning, to what was a pretty decent article, i can find no improvements. For that matter, aside from the confusing explanation of bigamy and occasional&#160;?notes to self?, there was little new information added.

<p>This man is notorious for his levels of state support and yet this article doesn't mention them. Every article on Hamza mentions it. THerefore this article completely fails to comply with NPOV as it does not mention this issue, which is one of his best known attributes</p>

<p>'Hamza had snapped up the flat for £75,000 under "right-to-buy" laws and then gave it to his son after the council moved him to a bigger property nearby.</p>
<p>But despite the deal, which generated a £150,000 windfall, British-born Mostafa is still demanding his £200-a-month Jobseeker's Allowance.</p>
<p>Mostafa, 24, who served a jail sentence for terrorism in Yemen, attended a job centre in Wembley, north-west London, to sign on for his money.</p>
<p>Last night politicians demanded an investigation into Mostafa's finances.</p>
<p>Hamza, jailed earlier this month for incitement to murder and race-hate offences, is estimated to have cost taxpayers more than £4million in state handouts, police costs and legal aid.</p>
<p>Tory MP Greg Hands said:</p>
<p>"The son sounds like he is exploiting our benefits system in the same way that the father did."</p>
<p>Mr Hands, whose Hammersmith and Fulham constituency covers the area where Hamza and his family live, added: "This family have been doing this for years. '</p>

<p>"Housing benefit pays the rent for their £550,000 five-bed council home in Shepherd’s Bush, West London — while the £34.61 weekly council tax is covered by another allowance.</p>
<p>Nadjet, who wed Hamza in 1984, receives income support of £379.46 a week, child tax credits worth £200 a week and £62.60 child benefit. Her children are 18, 17, 15, 12, ten, nine and six."</p>
<p>"Abu Hamza al-Masri, currently in British jail on incitement to murder charges, plans to sue the government for the £200 a week in welfare he says he is owed for almost three years. According to the Sun, which broke this story, Abu Hamza already is getting plenty of other benefits:</p>
<p>£2 million of taxpayer funds to pay for his now-seven-year legal battle against deportation; Special help in jail to bathe, dress, and eat due to his disabilities, as well as a personal nurse who visits him daily; and A new hook (on which, see the Oct. 20, 2004 update of this entry)" <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.9.39.187 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.9.39.187_f45a.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.9.39.187">contribs</a>) 14:47, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>The real debate about Hamza is concerning his status as a citizen, as a possible refugee and about his status under international and domestic law. Perhaps someone with some knowledge of these issues could write about them. For this, of course, more detail will be required: when, and under what circumstances did he enter the UK.
