<p>What the hell? Born in 1973, and <i>In the 1980s he operated a popular terrorist training camp near the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan</i>?

<dd>News sources variously indicate that he was born in 1971, 1972, or 1973. The 9/11 Commission report says:
<dl>
<dd><i>By this time [1992], Bin Ladin was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists. . . Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. . . For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with Bin Ladin in the early 1980s. . . Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan.</i></dd>

<dd>I think this was misconstrued as "in the 1980s" when it should say "by 1992".

<p>I added the phrase "though there are doubts of his power and connections due to the fact that most information came from interregations where Zubaydah was known to vastly exxagerate his and al-Quaeda's role in international terror" to avoid contradiction and hopefully reflect the tenuous nature of Zubaydah's testimony. I hope this will be satisfactory. J-Rod 05:30, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem here is misinformation that was originally spread by the Bush Admin when Zubaydah was feeding them information that they wanted to hear. More recent evidence shows that the Bush Admin knew all along that Zubaydah actually was exaggerating.

<p>I added information about Bush's credibility specifically on the Zubaydah issue. Now, Anthony has added information about Suskinds book that has nothing -- absolutely nothing -- to do with Zubaydah. I submit that this article is about Zubaydah, not Suskind. I tried to delete this irrelevant info but Anthony reverted. His argument seems to be that any questions about Suskind's credibility are relevant to Zubaydah. I think, to be consistent, any questions about Bush's credibility would likewise be relevant. Thus, either we should delete the non-Zubaydah related Suskind information, or we must add the following information (and possibly more) to the section quoting Bush:</p>
<dl>
<dd>President Bush is known for frequent misstatements and errors regarding the war on terrorism; in fact, some have claimed that he intentionally constructed a false case for war with Iraq without regard to the facts. Some intelligence analysts have accused the Bush Administration of "cherry-picking" the intelligence to support a predetermined decision to invade Iraq.<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/09/AR2006020902418.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/09/AR2006020902418.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> A minority staff report by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform claimed that "in 125 separate appearances, they [Bush, Cheney, Powell, Rumsfeld and Rice] made ... 61 misleading statements about Iraq's relationship with al-Qaeda."<a href="http://www.house.gov/reform/min/pdfs_108_2/pdfs_inves/pdf_admin_iraq_on_the_record_rep.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.house.gov/reform/min/pdfs_108_2/pdfs_inves/pdf_admin_iraq_on_the_record_rep.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Even the conservative <i>Economist</i> has acknowledged that Bush has misled the public into war.<a href="http://www.economist.com/world/na/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2553350" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.economist.com/world/na/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2553350" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are some people, like Benjamin Ferenccz, a chief prosecutor at the <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_trials.html" title="Nuremberg trials">Nuremberg trials</a> who hold the view that Bush should be tried for war crimes along with Saddam Hussein for starting "aggressive" wars.<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0825-06.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0825-06.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Other experts have also regarded the Bush Administration's decision to invade Iraq as the supreme international crime, a crime against the peace: "There was no authorization from the U.N. Security Council ... and that made it a crime against the peace," said Francis Boyle, professor of international law, who also said the U.S. Army's field manual required such authorization for an offensive war.<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003207442_watada18m.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003207442_watada18m.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I did not add this information because I prefer that only stuff directly related to Zubaydah be included here. What do other people think?--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 09:13, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I re-read Anthony's edit and I see that he only added a link to the subway bombing thing but removed the information about it. That is better, but Anthony is wrong that the subway thing is "the central claim of the book." I also don't understand why it is relevant in any way to Zubaydah. Though I will not make a stink about it if others think the claim is somehow useful here; I'd just like to hear a logical explanation of why.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 09:42, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You've adequately proven your point. Questions about Suskind's (or Bush's) credibility don't belong in this article, unless they directly relate to Zubaydah.

<dd>Sorry, but LOL. I just read your edits. For you to make those edits and then have the audacity to claim that a sourced accurate quote is "very POV" is ludicrous. First, on Ackerman, the claim that he is a "long term critic" of "democratization" is ridiculously POV. Even worse, your "restructuring" specifically removed Suskind's response to the claim that his book is wrong, making it seem as if he had no response to the critics!

<dd>I did not mean to remove the notion that Suskind had no answer, but I wanted to avoid an "argument by proxy". I just wanted the article to present one side and then the other.

<dd>A "mediator" should be someone in the middle or without a strong opinion either way rather than someone who agrees completely with one side. To take these issues in turn: (1) The Ackerman comment is not a misinterpretation of what Bush said; that is your opinion, and it is not backed up by a published source. Ackerman is well known enough as a source that the fact that it is in a blog should not matter. I can't find a single source that says specifically what Zubaydah told Bush about Shibh that we didn't know already. (There is another lie here, by the way, that Ackerman does not mention -- Bush implies that it was torture that got the information; whereas intel experts have indicated that Zubaydah did not give us accurate information until we tried methods other than torture to gain his cooperation). (2) As for Blumenthal, he is simply summarizing Suskind, mostly with direct quotes. What is your specific objection to this quote? I will pick up Suskind's book so we can quote it directly, but I think this is a useful summary.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 03:27, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Blogs do matter. That is per Wikipedia policy. Anyway, I think you have it wrong. As I recall, some people claim that Zubaydah revealed information when he was given gentle treatment but clammed up later. You have the sequence wrong. But the problem with that is that the revealed information seems to have come from the supposed torture -- and indeed that is one of the complaints.. that he gave too much information that was not valuable. In short, the critics give it both ways -- he clammed up and he spilled too much. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 05:24, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As for Ackerman, the problem I have is your definition of "democratization." Ackerman may be a critic of Bush's policies; one could just as easily say he is a critic of "neo-imperialism" in the middle east. Both are highly POV. I doubt he has a problem with democracy; it is democracy at the point of a gun that he seems critical of. I also don't see how it is relevant at all here, even by a stretch of the imagination. He is commenting specifically on alleged information revealed by abu Zubaydah; his views on "democratization" are totally irrelevant to this page. As for your restructuring, this is not an issue of counting words on each side -- it was an issue of you specifically moving a response to one set of claims to make it sound as if the claims were conceded by Suskind. You may believe Suskind's response is inadequate, but that is a judgement on your part and would be considered "original research." Best thing to do is say here is what an anonymous intelligence official said, and here is how Suskind responded. Restructuring the article as you did buries Suskind's response to make it seem as if he never responded. You also deleted his specific response to the claims, and you went further and characterized the view of one anonymous source and one named source as the view of "intelligence insiders" generally, when in fact Suskind quotes far more "intelligence insiders" in his book, including Dan Coleman, the top FBI analyst of al Qaeda at the time. Let me know if there is anything else I need to clarify.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 20:11, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>To claim that my edits were disasterously POV is just wrong. You may feel that they are POV (I was seeking NPOV) but certainly it was not egregious.... not compared with the current section.</li>
<li>You do not have a problem with my definition of "democratization." You can't. I did not give one. Ackerman has been quite open about his concerns. He has never said that he had a problem with "neo-imperialism". Indeed he has an alternative strategy that might be a version of neo-imperialism. However, Ackerman himself has been vocal about being opposed to the democratization of the middle east. You seem unaware of his position. But when you say you doubt he has a problem with democracy, you clearly do not know what he is about. And perhaps you should research it. He does not think that these countries can or should be democratized if they are going to vote for fundamentalist islamic regimes. (I happen to think he may be right).</li>
<li>Ackerman's pre-disposed views are relevant since his quote is a real POV work. It presumes things that Bush did not say and then attacks those things. This is called "Strawman". When this logical fallacy is engaged in, it is appropriate to look into the motives of the person saying such things. By rejecting that notion, you are rejecting NPOV for the article.</li>
<li>You mention word counting and say it is not an issue. Again, I refer you to WP:NPOV, where it is one of the items to consider in an NPOV area. Please do not reject policy out of hand simply because you do not like the results.</li>
<li>As far as removing Suskind's replies, the problem here is two fold. First, the objections to Suskind, if not expressed in an equal volume of words, at least deserve their own separate paragraph. Buried inside the discussion creates an POV pit, and I already showed that this is a concern in WP:NPOV. Second, though, Suskind's replies are not <i>new</i>. They are a rehash of what was said before. Should we go and find different quotes from different people, going back and forth in the article? I think that is highly unencyclopedic. I did not remove substantial content. I let the other view have the bulk of the space and I also let it have the first word. However, it is entirely appropriate and within the guidance of WP:NPOV that it should have its own separate section and that furthermore, the article stay clean by summarizing each point separately, rather than engaging in argument or debate by proxy.</li>
<li>With regard to Suskind's response being adequate -- or my view of its adequacy... this is utterly irrelevant. What I think of it does not matter. What matters is the content. Did he had anything substantively new? No. His side was presented. Now the other side gets a fair shake to respond. That is all. Your claim that I am using original research is completely inappropriate.</li>
<li>I did not change the source to anonymous. It was originally anonymous in the article. Check it out.</li>
<li>The one thing you need to clarify is this: will you engage in a discussion to fairly edit this section or are you resistant? I note that others seem to indicate you are resistant to such things. If you are resistant, then we can go for an RfC. That is all I need clarified. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 21:19, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I left in the statement that Bush was talking about something slightly different than Ackerman, but the fact is that Bush has not pointed to anything other than what Ackerman criticizes. Your claim that this is somehow tied to Ackerman's views on "democratization" seems ludicrous on its face. This is not about democratization nor is it about invading Iraq. It is about whether what a captured terrorist had to say while being tortured was helpful in catching other terrorists.</dd>

<dd>It is clear by inspection that Ackerman is wrong. Just as above when you claim that I said he was a monarchist. I did not say that. But you claim it. Ackerman says that Bush said something he did not say.

<p>(Unindent)Sort of funny. But in fact, ordinary rationality is a matter of both logic and law. In logic, failure to observe the obvious is a logical fallacy. In law, such failures by jurors are "Failure to deliberate" and can even result in penalties. So, while your position may work here, it is not valid in "real life" as I am sure you know and in a quite moment would admit. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 06:21, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

For example, take a look at the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> or <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> articles and count the words in favor of Holocaust denial or in favor of the view that gravity does not exist. I'm not trying to bias the argument here one way or another; I am trying to accurately portray the state of information known about Zubaydah. If you take a look at mainstream media sources, the consensus at this point seems to be on Suskind's side, at least on this one issue. The evidence is also in his favor.</dd>

Your claim that his reply is not new is your opinion. Again, it is not up to Wikipedia to evaluate this debate in such a manner. Sorry but I do think your version was extremely POV.</dd>

<p>Hopefully my recent additions will clear up the problems that have been alleged with the Ackerman quote. Ackerman's claims have been echoed by the NYT and WaPo, so I have added that information.

<li>Because your approach has created an emotional response in me, I believe I should disengage.</li>

I will not assert that the article must change in the meantime or I will just start over. I will come back with an open mind. But I do not think that an open mind will accept the POV in the article as it is.</li>

<p>Umm, what the hell is the deal? I didn't revert you; I bent over backwards to address your concerns and even took out the contested material completely. You continually insult me, telling me now that I have no intelligence and/or honesty. I am sorry you have some emotional connection to Mr. Zubaydah; my connection to this is simply about keeping these entries accurate and truthful. I do not feel that I "own" this article as you have charged; I am editing this article and similar ones because I have some expertise on these topics. I have not reverted your edits; I have engaged you in conversation over every contested point, and I have made reasonable arguments justifying my position. You seem to believe that when I do this I am being aggressive and bullying -- I am simply stating as clearly as possible what I believe to be true and offering the evidence to back it up. If you have counter evidence please offer it. As you should have seen, I am more than willing to be reasonable. I am confused as to why you think I have not been.

<p>I suspect that you only consider it reverting when you go back a page. However, another form of reverting is to remove the edits of another editor and replace them with the same words or very closely similar words as were originally there. That is what you have done and which I was referring to as revert. I suspect you will now say that this is not reverting. However, it is part of the definition of reverting for such things as the 3rr rule, so that is how I use the term. I returned here to offer my apology above and saw this statement of yours and decided that this might help clarify.</p>
<p>Incidentally, calling me a "weird stalker" is an example of the behaviors that I find dismissive and offensive, in case you were not clear about what I mean in that area. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 13:44, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the Gitmo stuff should be separate; a pointer within the bio would be enough. There are Wikipedians who go from terrorist to terrorist around here, for no other reason than to copy and paste big tables of data about detention, or fatwas about it from Human Rights Watch and the Guardian. There is enough to say about Abu Zubaydah.</p>
<p>BTW he's not the biggest al-Qaeda cheese yet captured. Check out <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mamdouh_Mahmud_Salim_35f5.html" title="Mamdouh Mahmud Salim">Mamdouh Mahmud Salim</a> -- a subhuman gargoyle whom the al-Qaeda defector al-Fadl says was Osama's best friend.</p>
