<dd>Hey there,
<dl>
<dd>What section, specificly, did ARGOU add? I read through the article and am having some trouble pinning it down. Was it the section on tourism? Thanks alot, and I hope if there is anyway to do so I can contribute some more. Something I think that would help this article alot would be to add a list of good books on the subject of the temples at Abu Simbel. I recently wrote a paper on this, where web sources were not allowed, so I could suggest some in the future. -Tristram Shandy</dd>

<p>I understand that a representation of the Garden of Eden was found in this temple (Godfrey Higgins, Esq., Anacalypsis: An Attempt to Draw Aside the Veil of the Saitic Isis; or an Inquiry into the Origin of Languages, Nations and Religions, 2 vols. (new York: J. W. Bouton, 1878), vol. 1, p.403.). Could this information be added?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Looks good to me, should it be mentioned in the same section as Ramesses II's claimed victory in the battle of Battle of Khadesh and other pictographic depictions or should it have its own section bringing in suggestion to the depiction of Eden in other temples from near the same era? (specificly, I mean, Mesopatamian temples from the Assyrian and Sumerian ruling periods.) Personally I would like to see it be paralleled with the depictions that other cultures fabricated. -Tristram Shandy</dd>

<p>From what I understand the light does not shine on all statues, but only on three the sun gods Ra-Horakhty, Amun and Ramesses. Ptah (on the far left) remains in shadows all year as he is the god of darkness. When the temple was moved not only did the dates change to the 22nd of October and February but now part of the light shines on Ptah's shoulder. The original dates for this were the 21st.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the book sources I came across they said the original date was the 21st and that it turned into the 20th of each month respectively. Where did you read that these occurences were the supposed birthdate and coronation of Ramesses II?</dd>

<p>I recently wrote a paper about the greater temple at Abu Simbel for my History of Architecture class. Using this information I went through and did some clean up where I beleive my writing and research would help. Up soon I will add a bibliography for works cited and consulted, but I need to "convert" it into wikipedia's standard as it is currently in the MLA format. -Tristram Shandy</p>

<p>The above unsigned heading (unsigned template added by me), along with a couple of article edits by the same anonymous editor, seem to indicate that Abu Simbel was moved from Sudan into Egypt. Is this a claim that Egypt "stole" Abu Simbel from Sudan? The border between the two countries takes a detour at the Nile (as <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/egypt.gif" class="external text" title="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/egypt.gif" rel="nofollow">this map</a> shows). But most online sources seem to agree that Abu Simbel stands about 50 km from the Sudan-Egypt border. Since the complex was only moved about 200ft up the side of the valley, it seems unlikely that it was moved across the border. I suppose the question then is whether the border was moved at some point in the past, transferring land from Sudan to Egypt. If anyone has any information on this, it would be nice to either confirm that Abu Simbel was once located in Sudan, or else to remove that claim from the article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoGreg_b8dd.html" title="User:GeoGreg">GeoGreg</a> 23:43, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've got a Reader's Digest Great World Atlas published in 1962. According to the map in page 72 of the Atlas it is clearly evident that there was no border change. You can find the links to the snapshots of the evidence down below. So, according to the new information, I'll remove the sentence in question.</dd>
