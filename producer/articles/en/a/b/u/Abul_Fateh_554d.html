<p>While teaching English Literature at Brindaban College in <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylhet.html" title="Sylhet">Sylhet</a>, he took the first <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Service_7bca.html" title="Foreign Service">Foreign Service</a> exams of <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> (1948), before teaching English Literature for a few months at Michael Madhusudhan Datta College in <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessore.html" title="Jessore">Jessore</a>. He joined the first batch of Pakistan Foreign Service trainees in 1949, moving to <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karachi.html" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>.

<p>A further posting as Third Secretary followed in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> (1953–1956). During this time he married, at <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rangpur.html" title="Rangpur">Rangpur</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_5.html" title="January 5">5 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, Mahfuza Banu of <a href="../../../d/h/u/Dhubri.html" title="Dhubri">Dhubri</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assam.html" title="Assam">Assam</a> daughter of Shahabuddin Ahmed, a respected <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawyer.html" title="Lawyer">lawyer</a> and Mashudaa Banu a well known social campaigner. Now promoted to <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Secretary_4741.html" title="Second Secretary">Second Secretary</a>, he served in the Pakistan Embassy in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> from 1956 to 1960, during which time he and his wife had their two sons.</p>

<p>After the Pakistani military crackdown in March 1971, he received a request from a former university dormitory mate, <a href="../../../s/y/e/Syed_Nazrul_Islam_d839.html" title="Syed Nazrul Islam">Syed Nazrul Islam</a>, now <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acting_President_0dc3.html" title="Acting President">Acting President</a> in the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government-in-exile.html" title="Government-in-exile">government-in-exile</a>, to join the liberation struggle. He responded promptly and positively.</p>
<p>At about the same time, in July 1971, Fateh received a summons from the Pakistan Foreign Ministry to attend a conference in <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a> of regional Pakistani ambassadors. He chose to take his official car ostensibly to drive to Tehran but, as he and his driver approached the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>-<a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> border, he feigned chest pains and ordered the driver to return him home, where he arrived that evening. Saying that he would take a plane the next day, he dismissed the driver. That night, he fled with his wife and sons across the border into <a href="../../../k/u/w/Kuwait.html" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>, from where they took a plane to London.</p>
<p>The announcement of Fateh's <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defection.html" title="Defection">defection</a> to the Bangladesh cause marked the first time a full ambassador had joined the fledgling Bangladesh <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomatic_service.html" title="Diplomatic service">diplomatic service</a>. The news was received with fury by the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_regime.html" title="Military regime">military regime</a> in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamabad.html" title="Islamabad">Islamabad</a>, which meanwhile had discovered that on the afternoon just before his supposed departure for Tehran, he had cleared out the Pakistan Embassy bank account in Baghdad to the benefit of the Bangladesh government. The military regime's requests to extradite him from London were rebuffed by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Government_3f93.html" title="British Government">British Government</a>.</p>
<p>These events were chronicled in a 2003 <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Channel_f606.html" title="National Geographic Channel">National Geographic Channel</a> television documentary, <a href="http://www.ngcasia.com/watch/default.asp?Currentdate=12/28/2005" class="external text" title="http://www.ngcasia.com/watch/default.asp?Currentdate=12/28/2005" rel="nofollow"><i>Running for Freedom</i></a>.</p>
<p>The Mujibnagar government made him ambassador-at-large, followed in August 1971 by the concurrent position of Adviser to the Acting <a href="../../../p/r/e/President.html" title="President">President</a>, a position he was to resign in January 1972 after the return to Bangladesh of Bangabandhu Sheikh <a href="../../../m/u/j/Mujibur_Rahman_8270.html" title="Mujibur Rahman">Mujibur Rahman</a>. He had a leading role, as the Bangladesh movement’s seniormost diplomat, in a delegation under Justice Abu Sayed Choudhury which went to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> to lobby for the Bangladesh cause. He was one of the first high officials to reach <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka.html" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> after its liberation, and was quartered with other senior officials in Bangabhaban until January 1972. Already the effective head of the incipient <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_service.html" title="Foreign service">foreign service</a>, he became <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Secretary_5431.html" title="Foreign Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> at the end of 1971.

<p>He then took up the position of Bangladesh’s first Ambassador in Paris (1972-1976). The early part of this posting involved extensive travel in Africa to persuade African governments to recognise the independence of Bangladesh. In 1973 he represented Bangladesh at a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth</a> conference for <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth.html" title="Youth">Youth</a> Ministers in <a href="../../../l/u/s/Lusaka.html" title="Lusaka">Lusaka</a>. In 1975 he went to <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> and, at a time of a shortage in supply of <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosphates.html" title="Phosphates">phosphates</a>, managed to secure a substantial phosphate shipment for Bangladesh.</p>
<p>In mid-1975 he was selected to be <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Commissioner_2c7a.html" title="High Commissioner">High Commissioner</a> in the UK, which post he took up in early 1976. His two years in London (1976-1977) saw him <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairman.html" title="Chairman">Chairing</a> the Commonwealth Conference on <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Ecology_a807.html" title="Human Ecology">Human Ecology</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_development.html" title="International development">Development</a> and the Bangladesh government approved his recommendation that <a href="../../../d/u/a/Dual_citizenship.html" title="Dual citizenship">dual citizenship</a> be permitted. Many people from Bangladesh were settled in the UK, whose remittances into Bangladesh were an important source of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_exchange_market.html" title="Foreign exchange market">foreign exchange</a>. He pointed out that to oblige them to forgo Bangladesh citizenship if they took up the benefits of British <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a> was not conducive to the continued maintenance of their ties to the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_country.html" title="Mother country">mother country</a>.</p>
<p>His last post was as Ambassador in <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algiers.html" title="Algiers">Algiers</a> (1977–1982). He represented the Bangladesh government at conferences on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namibia.html" title="Namibia">Namibia</a> in Algiers of the United Nations (1980) and the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Aligned_Movement_59a4.html" title="Non-Aligned Movement">Non Aligned</a> Conference (1981).</p>

<p>By all accounts a modest, quiet and unassuming man, in retirement Abul Fateh appears to have turned down opportunities in business, politics and academia which might have raised his profile further. Instead he served out his term as a professional, career diplomat with distinction.</p>
<p>With hindsight he may now be regarded as a distinguished statesman who made an important, non-partisan contribution to the development of democratic values in Bangladesh. It is probably worth remembering that as Bangladesh has perpetually rated as one of the world’s most corrupt societies, Fateh's reputation for integrity is not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>In his initial career in Pakistan Fateh would no doubt have been hampered both as a Bengali and as one who had married an Indian (<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assam.html" title="Assam">Assamese</a>) - nevertheless he rose to Director level in Pakistan's Foreign Diplomatic Service and became an Ambassador relatively quickly given the times.</p>
<p>Fateh played a significant role at the time of the Bangladesh Independence War in 1971.</p>
