<p>I just read an article from the Telegraph.co.uk about how the prisoners in the Iraqi-controlled Abu Ghraib prison are pleading for the Americans to come back. Apperantly the new Iraqi guards are torturing the prisoners and have made them live in subpar conditions. The A/C is no longer on in their cells, their food has been limited to rice and water, and 4-6 prisoners are crammed into 12x15 feet cells. The main hall, where the Americans allowed the prisoners to watch TV, is now off limits and is used by the guards. Now heres my question. Should we add this to this page, the Abu Ghraib abuse page, or both? Here's a link to the article below. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePartyVan_2456.html" title="User:ThePartyVan">ThePartyVan</a> 20:14, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As far as clarity goes, I think that if anyone has cited information on the number of detainees in Abu Ghraib who were former Iraqi soldiers and who who the U.S. government would have to admit that the Geneva Convention does apply to, it would help the article out.</p>

<p>From the text of the Wikipedia article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"All of the alleged acts clearly violate the Third Geneva Convention regarding treatment of POWs, as do the photographs themselves."</dd>
</dl>
<p>What does this mean, "as do the photographs themselves"?</p>
<p>If this is regarding Article 13 - ""...Prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity.", then yes, the photographs do violate the convention, <b>as does the Wikipedia article</b> for encouraging public curiousity. I'm referring in particular to the unhooded images where the face of the victims are clear. I wasn't going to say anything last night but I see today that another one has popped up. "A naked prisoner is threatened, or intimidated, with a dog." The other photo is the dog leash one. At the very least these photos need to be removed and replaced with blurred face photos. Or we should stop paying lip service to the Geneva Conventions. --<a href="../../../m/4/-/User%7EM4-10_ee36.html" title="User:M4-10">M4-10</a> 20:33, 9 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Paying lip service to the Geneva Conventions" is, of course, precisely the point at issue. If only more than that had been done! I agree: In my view the prisoners should not be identifiable unless that is itself relevant. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 20:50, 9 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see the photos have gone. Rumsfeld is pissed off at the "illegal" pictures, it seems, more than he is about the activities portrayed. I'm sure none of us here feel the same. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 21:05, 9 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Those two pictures were actually rather informative, so if someone could reupload blurred-face versions of them (preferably over the old filenames) and re-add them that would be helpful. I'm on a public terminal at the moment so don't have the resources to do so. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 21:09, May 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The two pictures are now restored with blurred faces.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 01:00, May 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not sure what Wikipedia will achieve by blurring the faces. If the pictures are available at most other sources unblurred - the individuals privacy cannot be protected. I <b>HIGHLY</b> recommend we use the unaltered, unblurred images. (See Reuters etc) --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">OldakQuill</a> 21:40, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>From Eloquence's talk page: OldakQuill reverted the photo to unblurred, I reverted it back to blurred. The man in the picture has a right to privacy from public curiousity, even if Reuters and other media don't believe it. Thanks for producing a blurred version, Eloquence. --M4-10 20:49, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree - seing the faces adds nothing to the pictures - even if others show the faces, we should not - blurring in these cases is appropriate. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Richards_3ae7.html" title="User:Mark Richards">Mark Richards</a> 18:53, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The faces show the fear and horror of the abused detainees. Blurring the faces whitewashes that, and makes the individuals anonymous and therefore less immediately, viscerally human. The (U.S.) Holocaust Museum has also wrestled with this issue (in particular, photos showing Jewish victims of Nazi Germany naked) and ultimately decided that historical verisimilitude required that the pictures -- in all their horror -- be unobscured. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">orthogonal</a> 08:18, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>FWIW, the Geneva Convention, <b>I think</b>, only to apply to militaries, not to journalists - this became an issue when Al-Jazeera broadcast shots of captured US soldiers. (Which reminds me, do we have those photos on Wikipedia? If not, we should do, less we lay ourselves open to charges of racism and unfairness.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, I don't think it would be a problem for Wikipedia to obey the Geneva Convention <i>anyway</i>, so I think we should do that. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 18:50, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>However, it is not a problem of Conventions, it is a problem of people's right to their honor -privacy, or what you want to call it. Even though other sources are not aware of the fact that publishing a photo of someone being humiliated is even more humiliating for that person, this does not give us the right to behave rudely (dishonorably) towards them. Eloquence did very well blurring the faces. <a href="../../../p/f/o/User%7EPfortuny_f17f.html" title="User:Pfortuny">Pfortuny</a> 19:00, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's getting very difficult to separate trolls from sincere loony leftists these days. Does being sincere in one's dementia absolve one from being a troll?

<p>Well, I am not a <i>sincere loony leftist</i> but I happen to agree that, on average, soldiers tend to be hard and brutal - it's in the training. The evidence is plain: The average IQ is a little lower than the pop'n at large. It is difficult to have moral stature when you are trained to obey orders unquestionably. Remove command and control and what happens? When the cat is away the mice will play. Encourage misbehaviour (explicitly or tacitly) and the troops will misbehave, no encouragement needed. I am not surprised that US and UK soldiers have misbehaved. Soldiers always misbehave. And I am sickened too. In what way is any of that loony or leftist? None of my conservative sane friends think different either. M4-10 might be in the military or not. In any event I would like to make plain I am talking about soldiers on average, I am saying nothing about any individual soldier, and it would be stupid to think I am. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 20:41, 8 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cecropia, this is an example of why the "were you there?" or "Are you a soldier (or doctor, or cancer patient, or whatever)?" is a bad line. There <i>are</i> people out there with soldier credentials who feel that way, like John Kerry who has had disdain for soldiers ever since. And many soldiers have the killing inhibition removed with no conscious morality ingrained in its place (this is bad training). Naturally, they tend to become confused afterwards. I highly recommend David Grossman's <i>On Killing</i> to anyone interested in man's natural hesitancy to kill and the enablers to killing. None of this says anything about how a trained soldier is in essence. "Hard and brutal" is not how I would describe soldiers' tendencies. The one that applies most (after basic training, and still not for everyone) is "confident". --<a href="../../../m/4/-/User%7EM4-10_ee36.html" title="User:M4-10">M4-10</a> 06:19, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Encourage misbehaviour (explicitly or tacitly) and the troops will misbehave, no encouragement needed." I invite you to clarify this phrase. If George W. Bush said this it would end up as another example of how "stupid" he is. Feel free to delete this comment if you fix it.

<p>Clarification: What is Rumsfeld (ostensibly) taking responsibility for? It has to be for not ensuring that this type of thing could not happen. That this was not done (by proper training, or inspections, or by example) is the tacit permission to which I refer. That the US govt and the Pentagon sanctioned some of these interrogation techniques is the explicit permission to which I refer. Very senior UK army officers have reported being disturbed by the very anti-Iraqi attitude of many US soldiers <i>and officers</i>. US soldiers are not naturally torturers and humiliators any more than any other army is, where did it come from? Any unsupervised group given power over others tends to cruel and inhumane treatment, as numerous psychological experiments testify. How would you explain what has occurred? <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 00:38, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Or, if you simply drawing attention to my illogical sentence I would like to rephrase it thus: "Encourage misbehaviour (explicitly or tacitly) and the troops will misbehave, as often no encouragement is even needed." Also, (as this is no longer plain) I wasn't responsible for the original comment in this section. Visit the archive to see the edit history. I just thought that it was incorrect to identify it necessariy as trolling. I still feel sick about all this, as does the original commenter.

<p>If you're not careful you'll be called a troll. (1) Those bright enough to enter the universities disproportionately do that rather than joining the military; (2) the army is used by society as a dumping ground for some otherwise unemployable people; (3) joining the army is occasionally offered as an alternative to prison; (4) people who do not like obeying orders or being in a highly structured environment do not typically join the army.

<p>First let me say that as an American and former military policeman I am shocked, disgusted and ashamed by the photos that have come out of Abu Ghraib prison. That someone like Lynndie England could wear the uniform of any military force is a disgrace.</p>
<p>Having said that, I looked at this article for the first timne today, and the POV anti-American bias is incredible. I note the very little space devoted this prison under Saddam, with the economical note that "up to 4,000 prisoners are thought to have been executed there in 1984 alone."</p>
<p>Somehow we manage to chronicle the dismal history of this prison under Saddam in five short paragraphs. But when the US took over the prison--ah, now there's something some of our editors can really get their teeth into!</p>
<p>With all the horrors that occurred there, Wikipedia didn't even have an article on the subject until less than two weeks ago.</p>

<dd>I think there is bound to be a problem with any article on a recent subject. This article isn't about Abu Ghraib, it's about American prisoner abuse in Iraq. I've asked a couple times for a subject split or rename but some people seem intent on calling it "Abu Ghraib (prison)". In a couple years we can come back, wipe out all the NPOV crap, and start over. Most people writing don't care much for dictatorial abuses in far-off lands where no free press publishes photos, they just care to get a "cowboy" out of the White House. Wikipedia is great, but not for contemporary American politics in particular. --<a href="../../../m/4/-/User%7EM4-10_ee36.html" title="User:M4-10">M4-10</a> 21:51, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's no reason to split the article at the present time, it just makes linking more difficult. The fact that Saddam Hussein's treatment of prisoners doesn't get as much space is not surprising, after all, we all know that Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator; the abuse scandal is a big scandal exactly <i>because</i> it was committed by United States soldiers.</p>

<dd>Is that because the evil <i>librils</i> who dominate Wikipedia all secretly admire Saddam Hussein and loathe good American soldiers, looking for an excuse to ram their abuses down the throats of God-fearing Americans? No, it's because there is simply not a whole lot of reliable information available about Saddam's abuses. His soldiers didn't document their crimes with digital cameras and he didn't oder an investigation into them, nor was there a free press to report about them, nor was there an international outrage when Amnesty or another human rights organization reported that Saddam had tortured people (the typical response would be more like "duh!"). So what we have are vague estimates, witness reports and, certainly, a great deal of propaganda (from Iran, <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurse_Nayirah_755c.html" title="Nurse Nayirah">from the United States</a>, etc.). --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 22:55, May 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, what we have is mass graves of Hussein's victims which were dug up not even by us, but by the mourning relatives of the victims. We have the testimony of people who have been to those prisons. Some of them actually showed the soldiers around there and told about what happened to them. What you are trying to do here is sort of like write an article about gas chambers where you mention that according to some statistics the Nazis gased some millions of people, and then spend the rest of it describing the horror of the use of gassing in America to execute prisoners. Keep in mind that what you write here may well become "history" as read and accepted by people decades from now, including people in Iraq and places like that. Nothing good will come out of writing a history where real massacres merit a few words and misdemeanors by couple of undisciplined soldiers provoke pages of outrage.

<dd>Really? We have a bunch of ugly photos, and this constitutes a lot of evidence to write a huge article damning the Americans and ignoring other aspects of the place? Then we have all the corpses and stories of survivors, is this somehow less evidence? The treatment of the two events in the article itself has to be conmensurate, e.g. 10 sentences each or so. Now, once you link to an article specifically dedicated to the event, then you can write all you want about all of that alleged evidence you care so much about. <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatcher_5a47.html" title="User:Watcher">Watcher</a> 11:18, 15 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the best reason to split the article is that the real story here isn't the geographical location of the abuses (the prison) but the bigger story of abuses.

Given that the veracity of the images has been called into question, it seems appropriate to have these two cases separate for now. As for the <i>visual length</i>, I disagree; the table of contents makes it easy to navigate to any section you are interested in. The byte size limit on articles has been imposed not because of visual length, but because of editing difficulties on long pages which exceed a certain size; these editing difficulties do not exist here. The other reason is that splitting up an article makes it easier to link to individual parts, while I see no need for this in this article.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I will reiterate my earlier position. If one of two things happens - the scandal goes beyond Abu Ghraib, or the article exceeds a size of 35-40 KB, we can split it up. In the latter case, I would prefer looking for unnecessary long sections first and summarize those.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 22:41, May 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Note that in neither case are the abuses supposed to be limited entirely to Abu Ghraib. There are allegations of abuses both now and then in more than one place in Iraq.</p>
<p>The big <i>political</i> story with the recent allegations is of supposed liberators behaving in a way that appears to violate the fundamental principles that they claim to be fighting for, the resulting soul-searching and disastrous self-inflicted PSYOPS defeat for the coalition. But that's a political story, linked to the abuses, but not literally happening in Abu Ghraib prison. Thus:</p>
<pre>
1 Abu Ghraib, torture prison
2 Abu Ghraib and elsewhere --&gt; Saddam-era abuse
3 Abu Ghraib and elsewhere --&gt; Recent allegations of abuse --&gt; political scandal

<dd>You still haven't cited verified instances of abuse outside Abu Ghraib. The title "Abu Ghraib" is not only appropriate because it is the location of the abuses, but also, because this is the single identifying term for the scandal. If you want to check news.google.com for recent news about the scandal, what do you search for? That's right, "Abu Ghraib". I have no political motivation whatsoever in wanting to keep this article together. My main concern is that titles like Alleged scandal about United States troops in Iraq in 2004 who apparently tortured (some people disagree with the term torture) and humiliated (although the degree of humiliation is disputed) prisoners in Abu Ghraib aren't very easy to find and consistently link to.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 22:41, May 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Every tinpot dictator? How many do you ahve to murder to be worthy of an encyclopedia covering your depredations? So you feel an encyclopedia is supposed to set a higher value on reporting hypocrisy than murder. I guess we have a lesson, if you plan to murder big time, just be a good old-fashioned honest brutal dictator and you can torture and kill tens or thousands and Wikipedia doesn't get too excited about it. But then, the UN didn't either. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 23:42, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting to compare what is on the minds of Wikipedians.

One reason we do not have the images on Halabja is that they are <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyrighted</a>, while the soldiers' photos are in the public domain. Another reason is that Halabja happened 15 years ago, long before the Internet became a mass medium, and didn't even attract much attention back then (certainly no clear condemnation or reaction from the United States), while the Abu Ghraib scandal is happening <i>right now</i> and thousands of Wikipedians are around to document it as it happens. Finally, the acts which happened in Abu Ghraib covered a wide range of different types of abuse, which are best illustrated with multiple images (although I would also favor multiple images for Halabja, if permission could be gained to use them). This article is not about Halabja, it is about Abu Ghraib.

<dd>Nix. Wikipedia is not a place of judgment but a place of documentation &amp; description. The Wikipedia history of Abu Ghraib should be documented solely on what happened there and not on someone’s alleged intentions or the price of beans in China or what not. In that light, the article indeed remains very lopsided.

<p>I wrote the line. The section of which it is the last sentence has the header "Isolated incident, or systematic failure, or official policy?" The section then goes on to show, with references, that the torture and humiliation were routine, systemic and widespread (Taguba report and Red Cross); that they had been occurring for over a year (Red Cross); and that <i>some</i> of them were official policy (Major Geofrey Miller quoted in the Guardian).

<p>Kingturtle, please do not remove Bush quotes. Any day now the article is going to be split into various sections. They will then slot with even more relevance into the correct split-article - the one which best deals with the political fall out. Quotes are allowed in Wikipedia - especially short ones.

<p>Eloquence, working toward a consensus hasn't been particularly effective so far in this very controversial topic. There have been several claims by various users that other users wanted to split or not split out of alterior motives. There have even been brief edit wars about this. Thus, the vote. If you'd like to work toward a consensus, whether you vote or not, it would be welcome.</p>
<p>The Anome, the vote isn't just about whether to split or not, but also about <i>how</i> to split. Your opinion is welcome.</p>

<p>Well, I think we should reach a consensus that a split is desirable, before choosing the exact form of the split.

<p>Cecropia asked, perhaps rhetorically:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Have you ever been a soldier? Have you ever received training as a soldier?</dd>
</dl>
<p>I enlisted in the US Army twice (1982-84, 1986-89). I received "peacetime" basic training each time, which included a bare minimum of ethical instruction. "It is illegal to follow an illegal order" was the gist of it, and I was required to carry a <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_of_conduct.html" title="Code of conduct">code of conduct</a> card with me at all times, which read in part, "An American serviceman is responsible for all his actions."</p>
<p>Now, one reason I finally got out instead of pursuing a career as an officer, is that I was sure that at some point I would be faced with a Major Ethical Dilemma. I envisioned it as being similar to the Abu Ghraib situation: rough up these guys and scare 'em a bit, so they'll talk.</p>
<p>The dilemma would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Violate my conscience and US Military Law (as well as the Geneva Convention) by going too far -- to gain valuable information that saves dozens or hundreds of lives (my comrades or local civilians); or,</li>
<li>Follow my conscience, military law and Geneva by scrupulously refusing to "cross the line" -- while risking ostracism or punishment for "refusing orders"</li>
</ol>
<p>I would like to think that I would make the right choice, and that if were in the current scandal I'd be one of the Military Intelligence interrogators who is NOT being investigated. But soldiers are "a scurvy lot", in many cases little better than 19th century pirates, and I don't know if I'd survive being a <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistle_blower.html" title="Whistle blower">whistle blower</a>.</p>
<p>Even if most of the "abused prisoners" were Iraqi officials from the "deck of cards", men who had performed or directed the murder or torture of hundreds of innocent people -- even then, according to my sense of ethics AND according to America's <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniform_Code_of_Military_Justice_9124.html" title="Uniform Code of Military Justice">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> UCMJ -- well, two wrongs don't make a right.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think the Pentagon and the White House deserve a BIT of credit at least for taking the matter so seriously. I don't recall Adolf Hitler's crew putting out a press release about the MILLIONS of civilians executed in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concentration_camp.html" title="Concentration camp">concentration camps</a>.</p>
<p>If there's outrage at hazing of Saddam's henchmen by GIs, let's not forget Saddam's gassing of the Kurds, and what his sons did to whatever pretty girl they saw on the street. Sure, America ought to be held to higher standard; let's just not let it become a <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_standard.html" title="Double standard">double standard</a>.</p>

<dd>First, Ed, no it was not a rhetorical question, but it was not directed at you, it was directed at Paul Beardsell, who said "on average, soldiers tend to be hard and brutal." That is an amazingly bigoted statement, unless it came from someone who had been in the service, then I would want to know what service, and how was he trained.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Explain how if it's bigoted for a non-military person to make the statement, it suddenly becomes NOT bigoted if the person has served in the military. I happen to personally think it's a monumentally stupid thing to say, regardless of who says it, but I also think that one does not need to experience something first-hand to have knowledge of it. For example, my cousin spent some years in the Navy. Having spoken with him extensively about it, I think I know at least a few things about his time there. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 16:37, May 12, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to ask a question about your military experience, because it is oddly out of my experience--even given that there were 15-20 years between our service experiences. First, why were you in service only two years the first time--enlistment is three years minimum unless you're drafted. Second, when you reenlisted, why did you go through basic training AGAIN. That's extraordinary. Third, what was you MOS and AIT training?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I honestly don't understand why you would have a problem with possible moral issues. John Kerry's 1971 charges aside, a lot of highly moral people have served in the U.S. armed forces and been able to deal with possible moral ambiguities, such as the helicopter pilot who brought the My Lai Massacre to an end.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since you appear to have been on an officer track (I was just a buck sergeant) surely you must have had some concept of what the Army was about, especially to re-enlist after a break.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And to make a point about this "article"--I don't see where we learned <b>how</b> these photos came out. The Army discovered the behavior of the soldiers who committed these acts and they were already being investigated for courts-martial. Those pictures were <i>evidence</i>. A relative of one of these soldiers decided that his kin was being made a fall-guy (remember NONE of this was in the press yet) and started marketing these photos around. CBS (IIRC) finally picked up on these some five months later. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 17:27, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cecropia, I missed your original question. You have subsequently said:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>:First, Ed, no it was not a rhetorical question, but it was not directed at you, it was directed at Paul Beardsell, who said "on average, soldiers tend to be hard and brutal." That is an amazingly bigoted statement, unless it came from someone who had been in the service, then I would want to know what service, and how was he trained.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>If we are going to restrict comment on something to those with <i>direct</i> experience of it then very few people are going to be allowed to comment on anything. For example I would not be allowed an opinion about torture because I have never been on either end of it. So whether or not I have been a soldier is just irrelevant. If you accept that I will tell you whether I was in the military or not.</p>

<dd><i>soldiers tend to be hard and brutal - it's in the training. The evidence is plain: The average IQ is a little lower than the pop'n at large. It is difficult to have moral stature when you are trained to obey orders unquestionably. Remove command and control and what happens? When the cat is away the mice will play. Encourage misbehaviour (explicitly or tacitly) and the troops will misbehave, no encouragement needed. I am not surprised that US and UK soldiers have misbehaved. Soldiers always misbehave.</i></dd>

<p>You're right, I made a bold statement. You questioned it and so I thought about it again. Essentially I stand by what I said. It is my experience albeit second hand in that I lived in a highly militarised society, apartheid-era South Africa, for a long time. Practically all my school mates and most of my university friends were conscripted into an ugly war. These perfectly reasonable people did some perfectly unreasonable things, some of them. I escaped conscription primarily because of my citizenship. I am glad I did not go because I am not sure that I would have had the strength of character to resist the illegal orders that I know one or two of my acquaintances obeyed. One person I knew well, a perfectly ordinary guy, admitted he had participated with the rest of his patrol throwing hand grenades into the huts of an Angolan peasant village for kicks, not because they were under threat. War does nasty things to ordinary people who are called <b>soldiers</b>. There is but a thin veneer of civilisation on any of us. We are all capable of being hard and brutal given a chance. Soldiers are given a chance. Once again, what I say here says nothing about any particular soldier. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 22:42, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the detailed response. But your response establishes the necessary context. I don't have experience with (apartheid?)

<p>My response had some detail but was not complete. I could have cited books, articles, well known psychological experiments. We are all the same. I have rightly generalised the point to soldiers in general. Of course, some platoons, units, regiments, divisions, amries will behave better than others: Quality of leadership and training makes a difference. Oh, and recognising the enemy as fully and equivalently human! <i>Perhaps</i> the attitude of the SADF to blacks and the US Army to Iraqis has something in common here. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 23:22, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you should rethink "rightly generalized."

<p><br />
Possibly, but you cannot tell that. I think lack of direct involvement can sometimes allow a truer perspective. Hence the word "perspective": You need to stand back. Your proposition is risible: Essentially you are looking for reasons why I am, according to you, wrong. If you start from that perspective then any of my disclosed history can support that view. E.g. Let's assume (for the sake of argument only) that I was the school friend of whom I speak, the one who needlessly threw the grenades. Then you could say perhaps it is the horror and guilt of that experience which gives me "a perspective not supportable by the facts". What facts? Address the arguments rather than the man. You will note I ask no information about you - I am only interested in the quality of your argument. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 11:53, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These are different incidents, different stories. If we include all of them the article will grow to 500K. I think the article we move this content to should focus on <i>one</i> issue. The other incidents you describe belong in the overview article, and can be described in detail in their own article (e.g. Iraq hostage crisis). Furthermore, article titles need to be short and to the point, and Abuses by contending forces during the Iraq Occupation surely isn't, which is a good indicator that it tries to include too much.

It reminds me of the photograph in the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Rumsfeld_67a3.html" title="Donald Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> article, showing him shaking hands with Saddam Hussein.

<dd>Moral comparisons of the sort "But look at what Saddam did" is also a typical indication of bias. It's the language of apologists. When you write about the Inquisition, for example, Catholic apologists will often pop up out of nowhere and point to incidents of torture under Protestant governments, claiming that these were much worse. Worse, people often feel inclined to bring up such matters when nobody was even talking about them. For example, when there's a news report about a child being beaten to death and a discussion ensues, one popular response I have noticed is "But spanking, when properly done, is completely harmless and good for the child". I find such responses highly distasteful and off-topic.</dd>

But the inclusion of the Abu Ghraib photos is not a symptom of this bias. The repeated attempts to remove these photos, however, is a symptom of <i>conservative</i> bias.

<dd>Silly me! There's an IPA pronunciation guide in the very first line. So now we know that "Abu" starts with a glottal plosive and ends with a long close back "u" sound, and "Ghraib" starts with a voiced velar fricative and has an approximant palatal before the "b"… That sound clip is looking like a <i>real</i> good idea right about now. As a practical alternative to IPA, and in lieu of a good clip, can someone spell out a more informal guide (e.g., "ah-BOO grah-EEB", as a guess) that minimizes the damage done by English speakers? -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 03:07, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It, and the name Abu Ghraib, is also associated with the torture of Iraqi prisoners by US military personnel. The rising use and wide distribution of digital cameras and camcorders among US soldiers was instrumental in releasing the images to the world. Subsequently, US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld officially banned the use/possession of any type of photo-capable cell-phones in all military installations ( <a href="http://news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,9643950%255E401,00.html/" class="external free" title="http://news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,9643950%255E401,00.html/" rel="nofollow">http://news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,9643950%255E401,00.html/</a> ).</dd>
</dl>
<p>This paragraph makes two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>That the abuse of Iraqi prisoners constitutes "<a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torture</a>".</li>
<li>That Rumsfeld banned photo-capable cell-phones.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think both of these points are more related to the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_prisoner_abuse_at_Abu_Ghraib_prison_8a1f.html" title="Coalition prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison">Coalition prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison</a> article than this shorter, more general article.</p>
<p>Also, the issue of whether the abuse (for which some soldiers were punished by their own army) rose to the level of "torture" goes way beyond the scope of this article -- and certainly is not a 'matter of fact' but something which Wikipedia should be neutral about.</p>

<dd>In late April 2004, U.S. television news-magazine 60 Minutes II broke a story involving regular torture and humiliation of Iraqi inmates by a group of U.S. soldiers. The story included photographs depicting the torture of prisoners</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have not seen any photos depicting the torture of prisoners. The closest thing to 'torture' I've seen is (a) the hooded guy with outspread arms who was "told that he'd be shocked"; and (b) a photo of dogs on leashes menacing a bound prisoner. Of course, these are gray areas at best, and I'm not saying it's nice to do this even to get info from <b>known terrorists</b> about on-going and planned operations.</p>
<p>I'm just saying we shouldn't call these photos "depictions of torture" unless (1) some named source says they are, or (2) some source defines torture to include 'telling a prisoner he'll be shocked' and 'menacing a bound prisoner with dogs' and (3) some other source asserts that these are depicted in the photos.</p>
<p>Note that #3 is not what I'm disputing so much as #1 and #2. If we can get either of those into the article, then I'd be satifisied that it meets NPOV requirements.</p>
<p>As most of us know, there are many different definitions of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torture</a>. The ones I accept, and the ones you accept may differ. If it doesn't involve mutilation or actual pain, I'm leery about automatically labelling it "torture". But what I think doesn't matter to YOU or to the reader. What we need is any or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>definitions agreed to by the US, which may overlap with:</li>
<li>definitions made by the UN or put forth in international treaties</li>
<li>definitions set by various human rights organizations (possibly stricter than American or UN standards);</li>
<li>rules issued by Coalition authorities (just for completeness)</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to distinguish between "abuse" and "torture". Under US law, even ABUSE can get you a year in prison. Torture (if I understand US military law) would get you much stiffer punishment.</p>
<p>Note also that the US standard of justice for abusers and torturers is THOUSANDS OF TIMES STRICTER than the old Iraqi standard. We don't permit our soldiers to cut off body parts or shock genitals, and if a congressman, reporter or chaplain finds out about it, there will be hell to pay. NOBODY excused <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Calley_8500.html" title="William Calley">William Calley</a> for <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Lai_8cdf.html" title="My Lai">My Lai</a>.</p>
<p>Some Wikipedians have said things like, "We all were told that torture had ended in Abu Ghraib after Saddam was overthrown, but now we now that it still went on." This is a matter of opinion -- not fact -- and it hinges on sharply different definitions of "torture". No one's tongue or ear was cut off, by coalition troops.</p>
<p>Now whether the 50 or so "softening up" tactics "permitted" by US regulations before/during interrogation are "humane" or not, is a different question. Not all "inhumane treatment" is torture. Or, if anyone says so then there are 2 POVs:</p>
<ul>
<li>some or all "softening up" tactics are "torture"</li>
<li>the US p.o.v., i.e., that softening up tactics were strictly vetted to be effective but not to be so "bad" as to constitute "torture"</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure these comments are in the right place. I might copy or move them to coalition abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib or wherever the Abu Ghrain abuse scandal currently sits. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 20:43, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks. I skimmed the references -- just enough to be able to draw the following conclusions (as a former soldier with 2 Good Conduct medals and 5 years total service):</p>
<ul>
<li>Severe abuse took place, enough to justify courts-martial (military trials of US servicemen).</li>
<li>The US definition of torture is stricter than I thought.</li>
<li>Our prison guards are only 100 times better than Saddam's -- not 1,000 times better, as I had boasted earlier.</li>
<li>Thank God for the <a href="../../../u/c/m/UCMJ_fc7e.html" title="UCMJ">UCMJ</a>, our free press, and the Bush Administration.</li>

<p>If I had been an officer at that prison, I'm not saying I could have stopped all the abuse single-handedly, but I would have blown the whistle much earlier. The commandant was let off too easily, in my opinion; I heard she got a "politically correct" promotion during the Clinton Administration.

<li>Definitions of torture include physical torture and torture that may not leave physical marks (such as long-term exposure to extreme temperatures, routinely practiced at Camp X-ray), as well as even the <i>threat</i> of severe suffering. Sexual humiliation and abuse up to rape may not be as visible as cutting off someone's tongue or ripping out their fingernails, but the damage inflicted on the victim is often greater. "Torture light" methods have been practiced for quite some time in the "War on Terror"<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A25762-2004Mar3?language=printer" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A25762-2004Mar3?language=printer" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>
<li>We need to realise that many of the pictures were never released. Some were shown to Congress I believe, and those who saw them were deeply shocked.

<li>There are several credible reports of child abuse by occupation troops. This is another "softening up" technique, sometimes used as a way of making the children's parents talk when all else has failed&#160;: <a href="http://www.sundayherald.com/43796" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sundayherald.com/43796" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0804/dailyUpdate.html?s=ent" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0804/dailyUpdate.html?s=ent" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <i>Witnesses say US forces also abused children and youths. Soldier Samuel Provance from Abu Ghureib reported the harrassment of a 15 to 16 year old girl in her cell as well as a 16 year old boy who was driven through the cold after he had been showered and who was then besmeared with mud. Allegations have been made that children have been subjected to torture and rape. This has been used to make detained parents talk in cases where other interrogation methods have failed. Seymour Hersh told a San Francisco audience: "what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys, children, in cases that have been [video] recorded, the boys were sodomized, with the cameras rolling... the worst above all of them is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking." An unpublished Unicef report is said to include statements about children that were arrested in Basra and Kerbela and routinely detained in Umm Kasr. The children are said to be without contact to their families and cannot expect a trial.</i></li>

<p>Many in the US and the UK seem to find it difficult to believe the torture allegations - "torturing for freedom" is after all not a very convincing slogan. Personally I don't think there is anything surprising about it&#160;: counter-insurgency methods (as developed by the French in Algeria) have always included torture as a way of beating a recalcitrant population into submission. The insurgency is very strong and growing in strength, the majority of Iraqis want Coalition troops to leave ("Thank you and goodbye" was their attitude from as soon as Saddam's regime fell), and the military situation for the Coalition is desperate - many in the top echelons of the US military think the "war is lost", retired general William Odom, former head of the National Security Agency even compares it to Stalingrad: "our going into Iraq was the equivalent of the Germans in Stalingrad." <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1305360,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1305360,00.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Desperate times lead to desperate measures. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 14:44, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just been reading about this literal translation of "أبو غريب" on languagehat.com and languagelog. Apparently "abu" (أبو) has wide usage and would be better translated as "place of". "Ghraib" (غريب) is a dimunitive of either "crow" / "raven", "west", or "strange" / "foreign"; all from the same Semitic root. Because of this I've commented out the literal translation in the article until an Iraqi can clarify things. See <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001907.html" class="external free" title="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001907.html" rel="nofollow">http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001907.html</a> and <a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001757.php" class="external free" title="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001757.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001757.php</a> — 203.222.154.2 23:29, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, I've just noticed that both <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Ghraib_ba45.html" title="Abu Ghraib">Abu Ghraib</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Ghraib_prison_7bdf.html" title="Abu Ghraib prison">Abu Ghraib prison</a> share this one talk page! My notes here refer to the former. — <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippietrail_ecc5.html" title="User:Hippietrail">Hippietrail</a> 23:45, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Umm, I recall reading somewhere that the "city" was named Abu Ghraib, but that a particular section of the prison was named after one of the firemen that was killed at 9/11. I keep wanting to say that this came from the lengthy rant about being angry by warblogger (at least I think he's the guy who posted "angry"), but I know this actually came from <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/2004-05-13/feature.html" class="external free" title="http://www.thestranger.com/2004-05-13/feature.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestranger.com/2004-05-13/feature.html</a> by Sandeep Kaushik at thestranger.com. Where should that bit about Camp Ganci be fit in... or should it be bothered with? Also, I wonder if anyone knows where "angry" is posted. <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESweetfreek_088b.html" title="User:Sweetfreek">Sweetfreek</a> 06:40, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Furthermore, he has only "allegedly" done it. Has the court martial been held yet&#160;? What's the verdict&#160;? Is he proven guilty&#160;?

<p>From the accompanying article: <i>"While many of the 279 photos have been previously released, until this point no one has been able to authenticate this number of images from the prison, or to provide the Army's own documentation of what they reveal. This is the Army's forensic report of what happened at the prison: dates, times, places, cameras and, in some though not all cases, identities of the detainees and soldiers involved in the abuse."</i> -- <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosphere</a> 04:41, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article reads: "On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_9.html" title="March 9">March 9</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the U.S. military decided to close Abu Ghraib prison and transfer prisoners to other jails in Iraq.&lt;" I worked for a news organisation back then, and we found out that this is not 100% true. I called the spokesperson for the coalition forces, and he said it had always been the intent to close the facility, and hand over control to coalition forces. So it wasn't on March 9, and it isn't really sure the prison will be closed permanently. He didn't really want to say a lot, but he did say that the news in that form wasn't true. (Speedwise, scale-wise.)</p>
