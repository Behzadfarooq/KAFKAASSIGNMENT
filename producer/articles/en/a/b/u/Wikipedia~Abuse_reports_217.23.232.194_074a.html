<p>I've identified two main types of vandalism from this IP:</p>
<ol>
<li>- Inserting random obsceneities into artices, usually to the tune of "This is a load of shit"</li>
<li>- Adding sometimes subtle, but always annoying and innapropriate, changes to articles. These include adding random words, phrases, letters, spaces, line breaks, and confusing/ innapropriate subheadings, etc..., all clearly bad-faith edits</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps an isolated incident, I discovered at least one occurrence of page blank vandalism, to <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec_Mythology_b86d.html" title="Aztec Mythology">Aztec Mythology</a></p>
<p><b>Amounts to repeated schoolboy vandalism, does not appear that blocks are having any affect and vandalism continues soon after blocks expire. This needs to be taken up with the school system</b></p>

<p>In a nutshell, <b>this IP has been blocked 22 times by 18 different admins</b>. As was stated in the original alert, most of these blocks have been short since the IP belongs to a school.</p>

If that fails, you may need to take it up with the county, and here's why:<br /></p>
<p>The Derwentside District Website <a href="http://www.derwentside.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=518" class="external free" title="http://www.derwentside.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=518" rel="nofollow">http://www.derwentside.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=518</a> states that education is the responsibility of the Durham county and any complaints concerning schools should be directed to them. I searched the Derwentside website and couldn't find anything relating to schools, except the above. Here's the contact info for Durham County.<br /></p>
<p>Durham County Council<br />
County Hall<br />
Durham DH1 5UB<br />
UK<br /></p>
<p><br />
In Durham city there are groups of teenagers that are increasingly getting involved in gang tagging with initials such as 'RCS'. Which is a major contributor to the vandalism problems in Durham and is believed to be a violent street gang in the Crossgate Moor area and the area near the old organ factory, believed to have up to 50 members. Tagging and breaking into buildings is believed to be the initiation for the people wanting to get involved with the group many crimes have been linked to this group.</p>
