Work on the history section may need to wait a couple of days until I can get myself into Moorfields in London. As I'm sure you realise, I've no connection with ophthalmology, I'm merely an electrical engineer who has keratoconus. Access to many publications is limited for me, but I will see what I can find this week. Despite very strenous efforts, I have so far been unable to find who coined the term keratoconus. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> 08:51, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Keratoconus and gaucher</span></h2>
<p>In France, there's 3 people who had Gaucher's Disease and kerataconus ( me and two other people). It's a new relation and genetical research will be do. I had gaucher's disease and keratoconus and recently during a meeting association, a doctor said me he knows two other people. He send them at a french laboratory for research. Another specialist (of gaucher's disease) said the discover of three men for a population of 400 gauchers is significative for him.locusfr</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the information. What do you mean by a "population of 400"? If there are 63,587,700 people in France and the prevalence of Gaucher's disease is between 1:30,000 to 1:50,000 <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11020862&amp;dopt=Abstract" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11020862&amp;dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, then there should be between 2,120 and 1,272 people with the disease in France. If only three of them have keratoconus, then that makes the prevalence of those with Gaucher's disease <i>and</i> keratoconus in France to be 1:707 and 1:424... not 1:133 (i.e.3:400). I'm not sure how significant this is given the lack of verifiable information and that the prevalence of keratoconus has been estimated to be between 1:2000 and 1:500. -<a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 00:58, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's 400 knew people with gaucher's disease of type 1. it's possible that there's more people but so people have a minor problems that it's not recorded or had a treatment. I know a man of 60 years old who discover recently they had gaucher's disease but they're not important health problems. I spoke of type 1 because gaucher's disease has 3 types. Actually, nobody has thought or found before a possible relation between gaucher and keratoconus. it's recently with the discover of three men. locusfr</dd>

<p>Hi, AED. Just dropping a note regarding your three created articles which were TLA's. Since they only have a single entry, I've converted them to redirects (see how <a href="../../../r/d/r/WP%7ERDR_62a4.html" title="WP:RDR">here</a>), but in the event that the acronym can have a second interpretation, the page can then be changed to a disambiguation page.

<p>I noticed you recently made a change to <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism_and_homosexuality.html" title="Objectivism and homosexuality">Objectivism and homosexuality</a>. You were right that the text was ambiguous, in that it spoke of an organization but didn't specify which one it meant.

<p>But while I'm not complaining about the content of your change, I do want to ask you to please come to Talk and discuss any issue before making a change. This request is not really about you, but is instead part of an ongoing effort to avoid another edit war and Protect.</p>
<p>Once again, I'm not at all complaining about the content of your change and I don't in any way want to discourage you from further contributions; my only request is that you work with us to make changes more gently. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 08:38, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>your new additions to myopia are very well written. i would only quibble with the opening sentence under hereditary. i would favor "A widely held" instead of "The most widely held". in this way we improve POV and dont have to argue over whether its the most widely held. i actually subscribe to the environmental theory and believe the weight of more recent research heads that way, although some of the hereditary data is arresting, i admit. cheers, <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 22:00, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">FYI: John Nottingham</span></h2>
<p>Hi... thought I would let you know, just for interest's sake, of the notes I made from the 1854 Nottingham book at the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Library_1c04.html" title="British Library">British Library</a> the other day:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was expecting it to be a paper, maybe a few pages long, but it turned out to be a substantial book of about 180 pages.</li>
<li>Almost every source I had seen beforehand, including some very well-referenced ones, had got his initial wrong as <i>G</i>, not John.</li>
<li>The term 'conical cornea' is used throughout. I could find no use of 'keratoconus'.</li>
<li>It proved quite readable, if a little stilted. The pages had yellowed somewhat, but at 150 years old it was still in good condition.</li>
<li>He ran through a list of remedies people had tried, noting that few of them showed any sign of success. It was interesting to see that some had tried <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electromagnetism.html" title="Electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a>, which in 1854 was very poorly understood. Nottingham's understanding of electricity, as a physician, would likely to have been extremely sketchy on what was then an incipient science. He may, for example, have been referring to an electric current, or to the application of electric shocks to the eyeball. However, it's interesting to see that in the mid 19th century, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackery.html" title="Quackery">quackery</a> was as alive and well as it is today.</li>
<li>He speculates on the cause, and whether or not the distribution is even (he suggests a higher prevalence amongst the Chinese).</li>
<li>Reports on the use of prussic acid vapour to treat what appears to be corneal hydrops.</li>
</ul>
<p>I put in a request for the 1859 paper by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Bowman_7036.html" title="William Bowman">William Bowman</a>, but this was kept off-site, and they were not able to retrieve it before the library closed for the day. And on another note, I have found an earlier usage of the word keratoconus: the Franco-German ophthalmologist <a href="../../../../fr/f/r/%C3%A9/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Jules_Sichel_9fbe.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Frédéric_Jules_Sichel">Frédéric Jules Sichel</a> (or Julien -, or Julius -) wrote a <a href="http://www.history-ophthalmology.com/v7jh.html" class="external text" title="http://www.history-ophthalmology.com/v7jh.html" rel="nofollow">paper</a> on the subject, and he died in 1868, a year before Horner's paper. It's not clear that Sichel was the first, though. Regards, --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> 15:42, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Featured article!</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../k/e/r/Keratoconus.html" title="Keratoconus">Keratoconus</a> is now a featured article! Blink and you would have missed it happening. The only indication was the addition of the FA notice to the <a href="../../../k/e/r/Talk%7EKeratoconus_23b8.html" title="Talk:Keratoconus">talk page</a> by the closing admin. I was surprised for two reasons: first, I thought it had almost a week left on the process, and secondly, I didn't think it had garnered enough total votes yet. There's still more to do: there's a couple more of your points on the talk page to look at, and the prose in general wants tidying and to employ more precise medical terms. I had wanted for some time to fit in the word 'ectasia', but it would then need linking, and <a href="../../../e/c/t/Ectasia.html" title="Ectasia">ectasia</a> is currently a redirect to <a href="../../../a/n/e/Aneurysm.html" title="Aneurysm">Aneurysm</a>, which discusses blood vessel distension.</p>
<p>When I first came here to write this piece, I was originally going to write something like 'thanks, I couldn't have done it without your help'.

I have added citations and changed the text to make it more readable. Regarding the copyright, I have asked "Neurology" to clarify the issue.

<dd>I can sort Symptoms from Signs quite easily, but it's going to be harder to separate Signs from Diagnosis.

<dd>As written above, I don't think the third sentence is necessary. And I'm no longer certain that the fourth sentence is accurate given that lack of consensus regarding how chiropractors define "vertebral subluxation" or whether it (versus spinal malalignments) is the cause of illness or disease. If there is no consensus among them, we should not let this introduction imply that there is. Perhaps the answer is to mention whatever beliefs are shared among chiropractors first. Example: "There are varying philosophies [or schools] of chiropractic, but most practitioners agree [or believe] that...[Insert common demoninator here]." It is not my view that every sentence <i>must</i> be referenced, but I strongly favor that idea in order to reduce reversions based on POV accusations. Until we can cement some comment as to what chiropractors believe in theory or in practice, I think we would be chasing a moving target to discuss how skeptics address chiropractic theory of practice. I would, however, like to see the skeptic addition prefaced with something like: "Although X million people seek treatment from chiropractors each year,...". -<a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 21:00, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I can see what you mean about the third sentence. It is nearly always presented by chiropractors as if it was a unique chiropractic viewpoint (just like the old straw man argument "we treat the cause, while they only treat the symptoms"). It is a universal belief in medicine, and therefore superfluous in this connection.</dd>

<dd>I think the fourth sentence still represents most chiropractors' viewpoints.

(You should read that page!) We just need to avoid using the word "consensus."

<dd>I thought hard about that one, too. That is why I suggested changing it to <i>chiropractic principles suggest</i>... It takes the issue of "belief" out of the equation. It does not matter whether some or most DC's believe it or not. I suppose it is possible that there are medical doctors that don't believe in the germ theory either, but they know it is a principle of medicine and don't take issue with the fact that it does not describe their personal belief. The statement that you have created is the most accurate assessment of what chiropractic is that I have seen in more ways than you probably realize.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>displacement or abnormal motion of vertebrae--that includes misaligment, normal alignment with abnormal motion, muscle spasms, sprains and strains, ligament laxity and subluxation, etc..</li>
<li>can impair or alter nerve function-- includes the blatant "pinched nerve", facilitated nerve impulses from chemical irritation, decreased nerve impulses from chronic irritation, autonomic imbalance, disturbed mental energy, blocked innate, or anything else that might get in the way.</li>
<li>can interfere with the body's ability to stave off disease or other pathology-- Oh my gosh this says it all; straight's diseases and/or dis-ease, and even reform DC's agree the segmental dysfunction of a vertebra can lead to degenerative changes within the disc and osteoarthritis- this is pathology as well. And if you change the first word to <i>may</i> instead of <i>can</i> you capture even the ones who don't believe any of it.</li>

I went off half-cocked because I just get tired of the popular American delusion about American life expectancy, which is often then used to justify a claim (unjustified, as you and the anonymaous poster point out) that the American health care system is the best in the world.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tonometer/Tonometry</span></h2>
<p>Dear AED, please do not take my actions personally, but the previous version of the update was creating a negative "suggested" opinion about Diaton; where the opinion was based on TGDc and not Diaton, which is much more advanced (fyi TGDc is no longer in production). As you have also correctly noticed, "powered by" - we have added Diaton Tonometry as an educational vehicle to Wikipedia just a few days ago due to the FDA approval - it's a new, unique method, which I hope will do much good to the industry and the cause overall. No spamming was intended and would like to request to reconsider and reinstate the link as an external source for information purposes only – the link did not lead to the buy page, just presented legitimate overview… I also wanted to take a moment to thank you for taking your time to review all the available info as deep as you have; even I haven’t done as much. There are a number of fresh publications, with up-to-date information about Diaton Tonometer entering wide media within this and the following months. I will try to make you aware as it appears and would like to jointly, since we're educating the same marketplace, to create awareness of this tonometry method. Looking forward… Rgds, ^DA<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by ^DevelopAll (<a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User_talk%7E%5EDevelopAll_5dd4.html" title="User talk:^DevelopAll">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_%5EDevelopAll_6f71.html" title="Special:Contributions/^DevelopAll">contribs</a>) 06:22, 10 June 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Verification</span></h2>
<p>It is highly arrogant of you to have removed the "of best selling medical books" from the article of an Indian Author even without discussing the facts initially on the talk page. And your action of removing medical books whn 6 books are quoted with ISBN numbers is beyond comprehension Indian Books are NOT marketed in Amazon and don't base your conclusions seeing only that I expect you to restore the lines. The very fact that books are out of print means that they are best sellers. Remember that there is a world outside your view and Wikipedia is global encyclopedia and not limited to your area only<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 59.92.112.54 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_59.92.112.54_2564.html" title="Special:Contributions/59.92.112.54">contribs</a>) 12:30, 4 August 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>If an article lacks verifiable sources, it makes sense to see whether verifiable sources exist. If they do, then the sources should be added to the article.

<p>I have added myopia to my watchlist. It comes to my mind that behavioral myopia could be so forcefully advocated by, well, a vision therapy proponent. Vision therapy is a fav topic of optometrists in USA and its validity is hotly contested by Pediatric Ophthalmologists (see AAPOS website), who see no reason to subject a child to such dubious &amp; expensive methods in an attempt to "train" the eyes with questionable equipments.

<dd>I am an OD but my views on vision therapy mirror your own; orthoptics may have some limited use but the rest of VT (i.e. treatment of dyslexia, autism, etc.) should be viewed with extreme skepticism. In <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myopia.html" title="Myopia">Myopia</a>, an earlier reference to "Take off Your Glasses and See" has me suspecting that the bit on "behavioral myopia" was added by a Bates method or "natural vision improvement" advocate, rather than a proponent of vision therapy or "behavioral optometrist". -<a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 22:30, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I wasn't sure if listing his best-known trainees was appropriate, but certainly every one of them has an impressive CV, though I suppose nobody outside the ophthalmology world would care. What's still needed in the Parks article is a discussion of his publications and ideas. I have to go back to work tomorrow, but may forward the link to someone who could flesh it out more. A photograph would be appropriate, but I don't the rules regarding dragging one from another Web site. Again, thanks for your encouragement.

<dd>Links to the USA<i>Eyes</i>.org website have been a part of the Wikipedia Lasik information page for quite some time. They are ocassionally removed or altered by vandals and then subsequently replaced. In the most recent instance, I attempted to <i>replace</i> a previously existing external link to our website. Our organization is a nonprofit nongovernmental patient advocacy. We are an authoritive source for information on Lasik, IntraLasik, PRK, LASEK, Epi-Lasik and all forms of refractive surgery and have been a source for media as wide in scope as the Wall Street Journal, Ophthalmology Management, Ocular Surgery News, and Oprah. I do not agree that the removal of links to any authoritive website should be considered "the correct thing". I also believe it is absolutely appropriate for a website owner to <b>replace</b> long established links to their previous state. Glenn Hagele 17:15, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your message on my talk page regarding the spamming by William charles caccamise sr, md. It certainly does look like spam, and in fact someone else already removed it all and requested a block on the user (which was granted).</p>
<p>If you run across any other spam in the future, you're of course welcome to send me another message. However an even better approach would be to bring it up on the talk page of the WikiProject Spam (here: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_459e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam</a>. There's many more eyes on that talk page (obscure pun not intended), so you'll often get a much quicker response there (as I must, unfortunately, hold down a day job).</p>
<p>Feel free to join the project as well if you'd like to help fight spam. Nothing is required to join except the desire to fight spam. Even if all you do is leave messages on the project talk page when you run into spam, it'll certainly help.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vision and eye care project page</span></h2>
<p>I find that we should be able to discuss various eye topics where everyone can have a look. I suggest that a page / project be created exclusively for us healthcare professionals in vision and eye care, where the topics can be dealt with in a community forum. Navigating to each user:talk page and finding out "who said what in response to which statement and when" is getting to be really tedious. Your efforts are commendable in letting me know of what goes on where - but there has to be a better way! It would be particularly valuable for people like me, who can't spend more than a certain amount of time, coz of busy real life schedules. I hope you know more Eye care professionals who share a common vision of contributing and improving the related articles and we can then invite suggestions on the project talk page.

<dd>I actually dunno how to implement the bulletin board on <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLINMED_f8b0.html" title="WP:CLINMED">WP:CLINMED</a>. Also, there are a lots of non-eye related discussions going on its talk page, drowning the specific discussions that we want - to focus on all the Ophthalmology related articles in one place. My previous request to NCurse to list Ophthalmology on the main Project page was supported (see his archive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NCurse/Archive2#Ophthalmology_missing_from_the_Medicine_portal|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NCurse/Archive2#Ophthalmology_missing_from_the_Medicine_portal|" rel="nofollow">here</a> and my archive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:EyeMD/Archive1#Medicine_portal|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:EyeMD/Archive1#Medicine_portal|" rel="nofollow">here</a>), but somehow later dropped.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia terrorism</span></h2>
<p>Once I had the quaint notion that Wikipedia was a collection of informative articles until I had the misfortune to come across you. You're that all too frequent breed of Wikipedian that browses the pages looking for things that offend your pedant's eye, causing endless strife with trivial edits and the sublime belief that you are the ultimate oracle (or should that read opticle) of all things ophthalmological. Wikipedia would be vastly improved by your absence, since you cause more trouble than your very minor contributions warrant. The tragic thing is that you and your sort have turned the pages of Wikipedia into a political arena, whereas with consideration and sensible discussion, you could have achieved so much more. Some day the scales will drop from the eyes of Wikipedia and you will be given the short shrift you so richly deserve. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_venter_0ade.html" title="User:Paul venter">Paul venter</a> 15:20, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello AED. I see you're the creator of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_complaint.html" title="Chief complaint">Chief complaint</a> article. Please take a look at the deletion debate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chief_complaint" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chief_complaint" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.
