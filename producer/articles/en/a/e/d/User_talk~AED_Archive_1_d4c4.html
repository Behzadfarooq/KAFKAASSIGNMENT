<p>Hi, I see you listed this article for deletion and then rethought when you saw that it had already been listed before. Because you're not the only person who thought that article shouldn't be on Wikipedia, I thought it might help my understanding of other editors' attitudes if I asked you a question. Why did you think this article should not be part of Wikipedia? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 08:37, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Tony. Although it may be more convenient and practical for physicians to use, <a href="../../../c/-/t/C-Tools_2.0_746e.html" title="C-Tools 2.0">C-Tools</a> is essentially a medical reference guide similar to many other university level textbooks. There are very few widely-known medical references that warrant inclusion in an encyclopedia... the <a href="../../../p/d/r/PDR_a34f.html" title="PDR">PDR</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gray%27s_Anatomy_7b7b.html" title="Gray's Anatomy">Gray's Anatomy</a>, or even <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitalogy.html" title="Vitalogy">Vitalogy</a>. C-Tools may be handier and better suited for clinical work than DeVita's "Principles and Practice of Oncology" text, but that's not enough for me. -- <a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 09:28, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
We even have an article about the UNIX <i><a href="../../../n/o/h/Nohup.html" title="Nohup">nohup</a></i> command, so if you have some medical textbooks that are current and have been found useful, they would probably be encyclopedic enough for entry here. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:48, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I advised you not "to alter anyone's entries in the Talk pages but your own". I did not claim that you altered the text, however, you did in fact make a minor small to my entry: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHealth_economics&amp;diff=19115836&amp;oldid=19112229" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHealth_economics&amp;diff=19115836&amp;oldid=19112229" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. This is an entirely minor point, so you can relax; I apologize if I have insulted <i>your</i> integrity or <i>your</i> ego.</li>
<li>You claim that I am a "lier"; I claim that you should review your previous comments (i.e. <i>"This is the last time that i am answering to your nonsense."</i>) and look up the spelling of "liar" before you presume to call me one.</li>
<li>We've already discussed why I reverted your mass deletion of the current article. You claim that I am clueless as to why your edits were completely proper; I claim that you are clueless as to why they were not.</li>
<li>You claim that I am writing in "completely irrelevant topics" and that I have "no significant contributions"; I claim that your sense of self-importance is inflated and that you have revealed yourself to be a bit of a stalker.</li>
<li>You claim that crediting then quoting <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> is "plagiarising"; I claim that you need to buy a better dictionary and rethink what you claim to be your "expertise in journalism".</li>
<li>You imply that new members, such as yourself, are entitled to patience in learning to use Wikipedia, as though that would absolve you from any rude comments you may choose to post; I claim that it's a shame that you had to take something impersonal and make it personal. <a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 06:10, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I will have you know that it is <i>you</i> who is changing <i>my</i> edit on <i>my</i> Talk page. You have done so six times now without the courtesy of asking that it be changed. I believe it is my right that you be held accountable for your insulting behavior, and I will remind you that it was you who chose to sign your real name. Still, I am willing to change it (as I have been all along) if you were to <u>request</u> it of me. <a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 05:32, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I may have to remind you that it may be <i>your</i> talk page but it is <i>my</i> name that you insist on putting on here and it is <i>my</i> right to decide where my real name appears. I may had chosen at the beginning to use my real name on here but as you can see the user name has been changed sometime ago. However, <i>you</i> keep insisting on putting all the time my real name on your talk page despite my disagreement. The real joke is your sentence above: 'i am still willing to change it (as i have been all along)'. Finally, you are accusing me for insulting behaviour because i simply pointed out that you keep writing crap on topics for which obviously you have no idea about (and erasing useful contributions from people who actually know something about it) but you don't see <i>your</i> insulting behaviour in this case. It is fairly evident who is the one with the insulting behaviour here. --etronic 04:07, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed, it is. Your peculiar idea of what it means to “simply point out” something [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Health_economics&amp;oldid=19101075" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Health_economics&amp;oldid=19101075" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] and your continuing arrogance in asserting what you think are your rights both warrant the label of “insulting behavior”. If you think my calling you to task on those things does, too, then so be it. My edits were in place long before you changed your user name in order to avoid accountability for your behavior, so the only think I am “insisting” is that the change be presented in the form of a <u>request</u> rather than a demand. The real joke is that you find that too much to ask. <a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 00:16, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The right not to have <i>my real</i> name posted on here is common sense (to everyone, except perhaps you). And yes i simply pointed out what was wrong with that definition. And yes i was right about the fact that "someone's ego is hurt"; you have proved it when you kept erasing my post and reverting the page to the wrong definition despite the fact that you had (and still have) no idea about what i was talking about. Doesn't that show arrogance? Doesn't that reveal inflated sense of self-importance? Who told you to act as an "administrator" on here? What makes you so special to decide what is good to remain written? And how can you decide if what i wrote is right or wrong when you have absolutely no idea about it?? I didn't do any vandalism; i just wanted to contribute an article; that's all! Yes, your ego is hurt whether you admit it or not. You proved it and you keep proving it by posting my real name on here despite my explicit disagreement (see above). The fact that you are insisting in <i>demanding</i> from me to request explicity from you not to post <i>my</i> real name on <b>YOUR</b> talk page, clearly reveals whose ego is bruised, whose sense of self-importance is inflated and whose behaviour is arrogant. In fact for revenge you have been even submitting my name in the history of Wikipedia! I still believe 100% of everything that i have said so far and accountability for what i have said, remains even with my new user name. Why don't <i>you</i> post <b>YOUR</b> real name so you can then be held accountable personally for <b>YOUR</b> insulting behaviour? Instead you keep hiding behind the user name 'Edwardian'. If this is what you want yes i request you not to post my name on your talk page. Anyone who reads all the above can clearly see that your attitude is pathetic.

<dd>The feeling is mutual. We've already discussed why I reverted your mass deletion of the article. It was not because my ego was hurt, but because "your previous edits included deleting appropriate links as well as adding non-working links (i.e health econcomic evaluation), inappropriate non-encyclopedic remarks (i.e. 'note the distinction!'), and your signature to the actual article" and because you deleted useful content per <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoiding_common_mistakes_8f85.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoiding common mistakes">Wikipedia:Avoiding common mistakes</a>. Obviously, the possibility that you made an error was inconceivable to you (and evidently remains so) so you <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychological_projection.html" title="Psychological projection">projected</a> <i>your</i> hurt feelings and lashed out that it must be <i>I</i> with the bruised ego (i.e. what you term "simply pointing out" my errors). You are similarly oblivious to why the edit war exists on this page. You're lost on the fact that you've acted like a jerk to others yet expect them to be complicit in kowtowing to your wishes.

<dd>First of all, let me state that I’m not concerned about charges of illiteracy from someone who calls me a “lier”. In my opinion, your indignant response to being a target of psychologizing was the more interesting way to reveal your hypocrisy: <i>“How dare you analyze <u>my</u> actions and charge that it is <u>I</u> with the bruised ego!”</i> That's rich. Secondly, I just finished explaining (again) why I reverted your mass deletion of the article, yet you won’t acknowledge the guidelines posed in <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoiding_common_mistakes_8f85.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoiding common mistakes">Wikipedia:Avoiding common mistakes</a>: <i>"Deleting useful content. A piece of content may be written poorly, yet still have a purpose. Consider what a sentence or paragraph tries to say. Clarify it instead of throwing it away.

If all else fails, and you can't resist removing a good chunk of content, it's usually best to move it to the article's 'Talk page', which can be accessed using the 'discussion' button at the top of each page.

<dd>Man, indeed you are not only illiterate but also a complete moron. You <i><b>obviously</b></i> didn't notice the fact that English is not my first language. Yet, instead of pointing out some other (grammatical) mistakes that non-native speakers inevitably do, from everything that i have said so far you just picked up a mistype to prove my illiteracy. Pathetic... With respect to the sentence you provided above to justify your arrogant etc behaviour (which after all the above cannot be justified anyway) i will have you know that it doesn't exist <i>anywhere</i> in my responses. You either have no idea what you are talking about but you say it anyway (because you have to say something - similar with the fact you had no idea about the Health Economics definition but you still judged whether it was right or wrong) <i>or</i> invented it yourself (you have invented things before, you are a liar {did i spell it right this time? hehe} - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Health_economics" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Health_economics" rel="nofollow">here</a>. And you still prefer playacting the psychologist (and a bad one i may add) instead of providing a convincing answer/counter-argument. You are a good actor i'll give you that, but a really bad psychologist - i suggest you to change profession! Finally, i see that you still love plagiarising the entire Wikipedia chapter on guidelines but you are still <i>incapable</i> of interpreting them. All your actions in my case contradict with what Wikipedia Guidelines state. I may have to remind you that <i>you</i> were the one who was mass deleting the page all the time, not me! It can be clearly seen from the history! Are you also blind or just stupid? Wikipedia guidelines state: <i>"...it's usually best to move it to the article's 'Talk page', which can be accessed using the 'discussion' button at the top of each page. The author of the text once thought it valuable, so it is polite to preserve it for later discussion."</i> You instead completely <i><b>ignored</b></i> the guidelines that you now claim, by deleting my contribution all the time without moving it to the discussion or talk page. You could also have just deleted the non-encyclopedic remarks (were only 3 and for which i have accepted several times responsibility) and not the entire article. Thats the real reason why this edit war exists. People like you, are an impedement to the Wikipedia project. They pretend to know everything where in fact know little or nothing. Complete morons like yourself. I don't know everything as you have accused me in the past but hell yes i certainly know a great deal about Health Economics - that's my specialism. And that's precisely why i only write about Health Economics. You, in sharp contrast, write in 100 different topics. The number of edits in different topics doesn't mean that you know about them. Your minor edits and spelling corrections prove this. --etronic 18:50, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It’s not my fault that you’re a stalker exhibiting delusions of grandeur over a repressed inferiority complex; <i><b>I</b></i> certainly did not “accuse” you of knowing everything. I’m not concerned about charges of illiteracy from someone who calls me a “lier” then admits that English is not his first language. Nor am I concerned about charges of plagarism from someone who doesn’t understand the difference between “plagiarising” and “quoting”. Take some time to look up “paraphrase” and “irony” while you’re at it; it may help you understand the sentence with which you are having difficulty (i.e. <i>“How dare you analyze <u>my</u> actions and charge that it is <u>I</u> with the bruised ego!”</i>). Suffice it to say, the history clearly shows who initially mass deleted the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Health_economics&amp;diff=19055224&amp;oldid=17964613" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Health_economics&amp;diff=19055224&amp;oldid=17964613" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<dd>I think my other responses clearly answer your accusations with facts, and not pseudo-psychologic evaluations like <i>"...a stalker exhibiting delusions of grandeur over a repressed inferiority complex..."</i>. The intuitive reader can clearly see what is going on. A few clarifications though. First of all, i really find interesting the fact that you insist in doing this pseudo-psychologic evaluation from here (i.e. online) without knowing anything about me. Second, you are right about the fact that 'plagiarism' is not the appropriate term to use in this case, but the fact that i used the word 'plagiarising' instead of the correct term 'quoting' doesn't change anything. You always invoke the Wikipedia guidelines whenever it is convenient for you and you interpret them in a way that suits your needs. At least, i have been continuously accepting responsibility for what i have been saying. You never did and you still refuse to do so. Third, the above paragraph illustrates your ironic -among other- attitude. Yes that's what you had been doing all along, you admit it. You were being ironic and you had been paraphrasing everything that i have been saying. Your sentence (i.e. <i>“How dare you analyze <u>my</u> actions and charge that it is <u>I</u> with the bruised ego!”</i>) is another example. Fourth, yes the history clearly shows many things <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Health_economics&amp;diff=19061329&amp;oldid=19055224" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Health_economics&amp;diff=19061329&amp;oldid=19055224" rel="nofollow">see here</a>. I deleted the definition which was wrong. You were deleting the one that was correct. I then moved the wrong one to the 'Talk' page and i explained why it is wrong despite the fact that i was not aware at that time (immediately after i signed up on Wikipedia) of the Wikipedia guidelines. In contrast, you <i>knew</i> the guidelines but you chose to <i>ignore</i> them by completely erasing my entire contribution all the time and not moving it on the 'Talk' page to discuss it. Fifth, I also used my real name (being eager to accept responsibility for what i write) and i would continue to use it if you weren't abusing it. You even started submitting it in the history page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Edwardian&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Edwardian&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">see here</a>) for revenge, which is something that clearly shows your pathetic personality. You instead, prefer hiding behind your user name 'Edwardian'. Finally, i will have you know that although English is not my first language, even i know that the term '<a href="../../../i/l/l/Illiteracy.html" title="Illiteracy">illiteracy</a>' can also refer to a broader -social- sense of education and not just mistypes (i.e lier).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Visual Snow/Astigmatism Connection?</span></h2>
<p>As the user who entered those elided sections, I agree I was being anecdotal. However, note that the 'visual snow' entry crossreferences no conventional structural conditions, only <a href="../../../h/p/p/HPPD_63e0.html" title="HPPD">HPPD</a> -- which this individual was convinced he was suffering from until a relative tipped him off to the possibility of astigmatism.</p>
<p>Someone with a perception of 'snow' and a seemingly correct prescription (correcting only myopia, say, as my previous was) is unlikely to consider the possibility of a 'simple' solution unless the [i]potential[/i] connection is made clear.</p>
<p>Since the whole concept of the condition is practically anecdotal, how about we compromise with some boilerplate about undergoing a thorough exam, considering all major possibilities for blurred (and thus potentially 'snowy,' depending on individual variance) vision before concluding the condition is, in fact, mysterious and hopeless?</p>
<p>In a similar vein, "There currently is no established treatment for visual snow" could be replaced by "There currently is no <b>one</b> established treatment for visual snow" or ""There currently is no established treatment for visual snow in absence of a diagnosed physical condition" and better represent the true nature of the issue.</p>
<p>(I'd never claim astigmatism is the <i>only</i> cause of snow, or even a common one, but I'd like to see the possibility mentioned for those few people it might help. In browsing 'snow' forums, it's clear <i>some subset</i> of sufferers are 'dumb kids' like myself who happen to have used drugs at the same time as their vision degraded, and are thus scared to raise the issue of their perceptions with their opthalmologist without knowing it could be something so basic.)</p>
<p>Obviously I'm not doing well with brevity, so I leave it to you to consider improving the language. Remember, a good chunk of readers will be visiting the visual snow article <i>because they are experiencing visual snow,</i> so may it err on the side of the exhaustive in offering these folks some insight.</p>

<p>I see that on September 14 you did a mass delete of my addition to the Theories section of Myopia on the grounds that "nearly all the text was copied or changed only slightly from" http:aarcolin4.net.</p>

<p>1. The page on the external link has a word count of 2,970; my addition to the Theories section has 1,129, ergo you are wrong to claim that it was copied.</p>

<p>If in fact the Thiemann study is truly unbiased, then there should be no problem in stating the fact that they sponsored it. <b>[Studies are typically referred to by the name of the university or the names of the researchers doing the study, not by the name of the “sponsor” or entity funding the study. This is “the University of Calgary study” or “the PATCH study”, not “the Thiemann study”. If one believes the study to be unbiased, then there should be no reason to mention who funds the study. If one believes the study to be biased, then there should be much more than a mealy-mouthed suggestion that it is. And that is what you are suggesting we put here.]</b> I personally do believe that when a party with a financial stake in one result oven another sponsors a study, it will create a slant in some fashion, how exactly, I don't know for certain. <b>[You admit that you “don’t know for certain” how “a party with a financial stake” in a study “create[s] a slant in some fashion”, so how do you know that they “create a slant in some fashion” in the first place? You don’t.]</b> What I have read points to the EDTA dose received as being too low (in comparison with the dosage recommended by protocol), that the best respondents to EDTA were somehow factored out of the final report, that Thiemann reserved the right to edit the published report (not to alter the data, but to redact what was reported or not). <b>[These are all unsubstantiated assertions from PRO-chelation therapy advocates.]</b> If the study was done in a truly scientific and objective and neutral fashion, they should be proud to have their name associated with this study. <b>[Perhaps they are, but the purpose of a Wikipedia article is not to toss out kudos.]</b> It strike me as naive to think that humans conducting a study would truly be 100% objective and neutral in the design and execution of such study, when they know full well that their paychecks and funding for the study is coming from an entity that clearly wishes and prefers one result over the other. <b>[It strikes me as naïve to believe the enormous conspiracy theory that Thiemann convinced numerous researchers at or affiliated with the University of Calgary to stake their academic and professional careers by taking money to falsify their reports, and that JAMA was similarly convinced to stake its world-renown reputation by turning a blind eye to these falsified reports.]</b> I do believe that it is germane to mention that a party with a conflict of interest sponsored the study. <b>[It is germane in the publication of a study (see JAMA’s rules for authors <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/ifora_current.dtl" class="external autonumber" title="http://jama.ama-assn.org/ifora_current.dtl" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>), but not warranted here – particularly since the Univesity of Calgary researchers certainly disclosed to JAMA any potential conflicts of interest and that this was a “double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial” that was peer reviewed. The only reason to mention who funded the study at this point is to allude to bias where the preponderance of evidence shows none exists.]</b> Will you admit that a financial stake in one result versus another actually constitutes a conflict of interest? <b>[Will you admit that it is not in the best interest of the numerous researchers at or affiliated with the University of Calgary to stake their academic and professional careers by taking money to falsify their reports? Will you admit that it is not in the best of JAMA to stake its world-renown reputation by turning a blind eye to these falsified reports?]</b> Also, once again, that study absolutely said nothing in regards to autism spectrum disorders. <b>[I never said it did. What I did say was that it is not accurate for the article to state that mainstream medicine only disputes the efficacy of chelation thearpy in the treatment of atherosclerosis.]</b> The link between these type of disorders and mercury from thimerosal or other sources has never been dis-proven. <b>[Martian toxins delivered by UFO probes also haven’t been ruled-out, but the burden of proof is on those making the claim.]</b> As far as 100% scientifically airtight proof goes, I'm not going to recommend that any more children receive mercury, whether in elemental form, nor in molecules of one, two or more carbon atoms (methylmercury, ethylmercury etc.) We have to fall on what you are calling a "preponderance of evidence". The rise of autism spectrum disorders, co-incident in the 90's with the 2 and 3 fold increase in the number of mercury containing vaccines administered to children, coupled with the fact (once again&#160;:-) that mercury IS a powerful neurotoxin is enough to convince me, called me biased if you will. I am conviced. Why is Eli Lily excercising all the political muscle it can muster to get liability protection from thimerosal lawsuits if there is no chance that the mercury it foisted on infants caused their autism&#160;? But I am digressing.... this article is on chelation therapy. <b>[Indeed. I haven't got all day so let’s handle one assertion before moving on to the next.]</b> 1) Chelation therapy is used by so called "alternative" medicine to treat atherosclerosis and also to treat autism spectrum disorders. (BTW, when Galileo maintained that the earth revolved around the sun, in opposition to prevalent or "mainstream" scientific thought at the time... ¿was he an "alternative" scientist? ) 2) The Thiemann study, flawed or not, biased or not, addressed atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, et al, it did not address autism spectrum disorders (ASD's). Geni's removal of the explicit mention of this casts aspersions on chelation therapy in regards to treating ASD when in fact the Thiemann study says nothing about this. <b>[So, you want clarification in the article as to why mainstream medicine rejects chelation therapy as treatment for autism? That can be arranged.]</b> The preponderance of the evidence points to a strong causal link between mercury and ASD. <b>[It categorically does not.]</b> Deleting the link to the nerve-sheath formation disruption U Calgary study is wrong. That study exposes one mechanism whereby mercury severely affects the CNS. It stands to simple reason that if there is a way to get this mercury out of the body, the mercury will no longer affect nerve sheath formation, the neurons will no longer die without their sheaths and cognitive funcitioning will cease to be impaired for that reason. <b>[That particular <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11277574&amp;query_hl=8" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11277574&amp;query_hl=8" rel="nofollow">study</a> implicates “(mercury) as a potential etiological factor in neurodegeneration”, not neurodegeneration as a cause of autism. To make that leap is “simplistic reasoning” not simple reasoning.]</b> Note that I have not been trying to suppress the Thiemann study, merely to clarify exactly what it pertains to. It is useful information. <b>[It’s already clear that the PATCH study pertains to ischemic heart disease and not to autism. If you want clarification in the article as to why mainstream medicine rejects chelation therapy as treatment for autism, that can be arranged, too.]</b> Likewise, the U Calgary study on tubulin and nerve sheaths is pertinent information. <b>[Again, that particular study implicates “(mercury) as a potential etiological factor in neurodegeneration”, not neurodegeneration as a cause of autism. Incidentally, why do you refer to one as the “Thiemann study” and the other as “the U Calgary study”?

<dd>Hey Edwardian, I am not suggesting that any researcher actually took money to falsify results. Merely that having a coroporate sponsor that would be pleased with one result over another might in some way - perhaps subconsciously even - slant the methdology of the study. I've called it the "Thiemann study" simply to distinguish it, but I concede it's best to refer to them in a NPOV way - how about the PATCH study and the tubulin study, or any other such suitable names. Using U Calgary merely confuses the issue because there are two different studies being mentioned. You are also correct the tubulin study implicates mercury as a potential etiological factor in neurodegeneration”, not neurodegeneration as a cause of autism. All well and good. I orginally three months ago, merely inserted a link to point to this study. Geni not only deleted it, he substituted a reference to the PATCH study that was ambiguously implicating that chelation therapy is ineffective in mercury poisoning in minute amounts, the kind of which is in fact, sorry to contradict you, are strongly implicated in the rise of autism in the 1990's. Claiming that "it's an article on chelation therapy and not on the effects of mercury on the CNS" as a reason to suppress this info is disingenious at best. Alternative medicine uses chelation therapy to treat autism. True, a definite causal link has not been proven, but neither has it been disproven. Chelation therapy removes heavy metals from the body. The tubulin study provides important information to back up why alternative medicine's use of chelation therapy to treat autism might no be so off the wall.

<dd>Intersofia, it is not “suppressing information” to exclude non-relevant information from the article. I agree with Geni that there is little reason to reference “the tubulin study” in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelation_therapy.html" title="Chelation therapy">Chelation therapy</a>. You said yourself that the study showed that mercury may cause neurodegeneration, not that neurodegeneration causes autism. If it doesn’t show that neurodegeneration causes autism or that chelation therapy prevents autism or any other disease, what point does it serve in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelation_therapy.html" title="Chelation therapy">Chelation therapy</a>? The article already suggests that mercury and other substances pose health risks, but you’re welcome to put a link to “the tubulin study” at the beginning of the article to emphasize the point.

<p>I've dealt with my share of people pushing views on medical articles. They are fairly easy to spot and usually go away after some bickering. Your response on the inadequacy of the animal studies was appreciated.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to explain to pushy editors the importance of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">"no original research"</a>. Some people are just so convinced of the truth of their assertions that they feel scientific rigor somehow should not be applied to their theories. It is my firmly held view that Wikipedia does need to apply these rules strictly.</p>
<p>I have never objected against coverage of alternative views or treatments, as long as they are <i>notable</i>. This is another contentious point (see <a href="../../../m/y/o/Talk%7EMyocardial_infarction_496c.html" title="Talk:Myocardial infarction">talk:myocardial infarction</a>). Again, some people feel that their theory or treatment should be covered even though it is unknown even amongst experts and hence likely to be unnotable.</p>

<li><b>Wikipedia is not a memorial</b> doesn't apply as that rule is for people who do not deserve an article.

<p>Hi there, thanks for your interest in the RfC. I'd just like to know why you've simply reverted my latest attempt at mentioning the criticism? This is about my third attempt at trying to compromise, and you should note that this version makes no mention of the Sorensen research, it's actually talking about completely different findings. It's a lot better if you can rewrite - rather than simply reverting - in order to reach a compromise, so I'm reverting back to my version and encourage you to contribute / improve on what I've said. I'll make the point again, I just want mention of the controversy, which has been well covered in a number of newspapers (largely through Campos' extracts) and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Scientist_4920.html" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a>, and so is well known to the public. --<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendanfox_bfcb.html" title="User:Brendanfox">Brendanfox</a> 04:26, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thank you for your comment. Mention of Sorensen or not, it is certainly not clear that recent research warrants prominent mention in the introduction. I think <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> have outlined the reasoning sufficiently. The vote on this issue is current 3 to 1 against your version; at least two of whom are voting in opposition are physicians.

<p>I'm extremely disappointed in your unexplained abandonment of the problems here. I also do not know why the best link you could give to back up your retreat was <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a>, but not to any mention of the specific guideline you are hiding behind. The closest actualy policy I could find, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research</a>, does not anywhere say that primary sources cannot contribute to an article. Since no one who holds this belief has ever pointed me to an actual established policy (as opposed to a <i>proposed</i> policy) against it, I'm continually convinced that it is a myth. Regardless, if you're going to run away from a difficult issue, then just admit it, don't hide behind a policy you can't actually reference. But even if "no involved contributors" was in fact an established policy, the best answer would be to get action against the participants involvement of the article, and move their contributions to Talk -- not throw up your hands and cry foul. I'd hoped you were going to help the matter.

<dd>There are a lot of mistaken premises and loaded words in your rebuke(i.e. “abandonment”, “retreat”, “hiding behind”, “run away”, “hide behind a policy”, “throw up your hands and cry foul”, etc.) and your comments about me on others' Talk pages, but I’ll suppress my initial comments and attempt a polite reply anyway.</dd>

<dd>In short, I am happy to offer my opinion to help resolve a content dispute between two editors, but not when each editor spends more time attempting to convince me that the other is liar rather than addressing the specific content of the article.

As I explained to <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a>, writing about subjects in which one is closely involved is not currently a violation of Wikipedia <i>policy</i>, but <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> is a <i>guideline</i> that discourages it. <a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 04:08, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I agree with you that ophthalmology is appropriate for all the subcategories that you mentioned (and I encourage you to pursue those), I feel quite certain that there is enough distinction between the ophthalmology and optometry for there to be two categories. It would seem quite absurd to categorize the American Academy of Optometry under Ophthalmolgy, for example.

It really helps others understand what you changed, think of it of the "Subject:" line in an email. I hope you don't mind.&#160;:)</p>
<p>And I have one remark about the "No new messages" joke at the top. I did not find it as funny as you wanted it to. But never mind about that. Cheers, <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 17:00, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll work on the edit summaries, but if you don't want me to mind a remark, you shouldn't make the remark. I'm not sure where you got the idea that I intended it to be funny since it's a banner that merely reflects the status of my Talk page... with a link to a WikiProject that I like to keep an eye on. <a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a>08:48, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've deleted the page in question (Wikipedia talk:Wikiproject:Alternative medicine/Archive 1), hopefully that will make it possible for you to remove it; if not, let me know. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 22:50, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My next suggestion is to contact a developer. You can often find them on irc, either in the main #wikipedia chanel or in the server channel. If you don't use IRC, try contacting them via <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_permission" class="extiw" title="meta:Requests_for_permission">meta:Requests for permission</a>(I think). If I can be of further help, let me know. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 05:49, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Edwardian, I've never had a chance to compliment you on your awesome ophthalmology work. You've been doing this largely on your own, and the effort is admirable. Have a barnstar, and keep up the great work! <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 21:38, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Feel free to move the star to your userpage.

<p>Ah, I see you've noticed the new {{<a href="../../../e/y/e/Template%7EEye-stub_d955.html" title="Template:Eye-stub">eye-stub</a>}} I just created. Glad to see someone so interested in helping out! Please do note, however, that there are some ocular muscle articles that should be double tagged with both {{<a href="../../../e/y/e/Template%7EEye-stub_d955.html" title="Template:Eye-stub">eye-stub</a>}} as well as {{<a href="../../../m/u/s/Template%7EMuscle-stub_76c2.html" title="Template:Muscle-stub">muscle-stub</a>}}, if you wouldn't mind. I delibeartely had not yet tagged them witht he muscle-stub because I wanted to wait until eye-stub had been created. --<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncycloPetey_19b4.html" title="User:EncycloPetey">EncycloPetey</a> 14:06, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
