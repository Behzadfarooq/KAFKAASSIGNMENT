<p>Ancient Greece, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, 18th Century, Kant, Hume, 19th Century, Hegel, Nietzsche, Tolstoy, 20th Century, Clive Bell, R. G. Collinwood, John Dewey, Susanne Langer, Arthur Danto</p>
<p>None of them contained anything, though a few were marked as stubs. Leaving section headings followed by nothing is messy and meaningless.

<p>Yes, the article needs a major rewrite by an expert. Knowing nothing of this topic, I came here via the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_art.html" title="Philosophy of art">Philosophy of art</a> redirect hoping to get an overview, but the material here seems to cover only one small aspect. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlac_7f30.html" title="User:Slac">Slac</a>'s contention that the article covers little of what's in a typical philosophy of aesthetics course is borne out by for example <a href="http://www.aesthetics-online.org/ideas/kieran.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aesthetics-online.org/ideas/kieran.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which describes the content of a text on the subject.

<p>Greek Speculations - "Ancient Greece supplies us with the first important contributions to aesthetic theory, though these are scarcely, in quality or in quantity, what one might have expected from a people which had so high an appreciation of beauty and so strong a bent for philosophic speculation. The first Greek thinker of whose views on the subject we really know something is Socrates. We learn from Xenophon's account of him that he regarded the beautiful as coincident with the good, and both of them are resolvable into the useful. Every beautiful object is so called because it serves came rational end, whether the security or the gratification of man. Socrates appears to have attached little importance to the immediate gratification which a beautiful object affords to perception and contemplation, but to have emphasized rather its power of furthering the more necessary ends of life. The really valuable point in his doctrine is the relativity of beauty. Unlike Plato, he recognized no self-beauty (auto to kalon) existing absolutely and out of all relation to a percipient mind." --From the 1911 Encyclopedia (Public Domain)</p>
<p>Would this section be appropriate? The same encyclopedia also has entries for Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus. Famous German philosophers also each get a section. If it gets used then the template "open curly open curly 1911 close curly close curly" should be included. See my talk page for more of the 1911 entry. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmilner_9b90.html" title="User:Jeffmilner">Jeff</a> 23:47, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Might it be a good idea to replace the current article entirely with the 1911 one, then make whatever changes are necessary to incorporate modern developments? That article is quite well done and treats many subtle points that we're missing here. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkling_df45.html" title="User:Inkling">inkling</a> 05:22, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This sounds a good idea, <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkling_df45.html" title="User:Inkling">inkling</a>! Major surgery like this is required, in my opinion. But could we see the text from the 1911 if you have it downloaded already (e.g. from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/200" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/200" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>)? Maybe you could post it here for consideration, and if people agree it can be moved to the <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aesthetics.html" title="Aesthetics">article page</a>, perhaps in conjunction with moving the content of the existing article to here on the Talk page. -- <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimR_3f8c.html" title="User:JimR">JimR</a> 06:43, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmilner_9b90.html" title="User:Jeffmilner">Jeffmilner</a> for posting it (see just below), though seeing it, I'm not sure if my idea of having it here on the talk page was the best approach. It's more informative than the present page, though the style is old fashioned; it's long; and wow, it will need a lot of work. I propose that we move it to say <a href="../../../a/e/s/Talk%7EAesthetics_Brit1911_3dd9.html" title="Talk:Aesthetics/Brit1911">/Brit1911</a> which will be a subpage of this talk page: this seems to be allowed, according to <a href="../../../s/p/_/WP%7ESP_e9e9.html#Allowed_uses" title="WP:SP">WP:SP#Allowed uses</a> number 1. Then it will stand by itself, and we can work on it to correct the scanning errors, remove the newlines, and wikify â€” and update it, if anyone has the necessary knowledge. Then once it's up to scratch we can replace the existing article with it (we'd probably want to save the current version here on the talk page).

<dd><a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimNelson_44be.html" title="User:TimNelson">TimNelson</a> 10:05, 8 January 2006 (UTC) -- People have talked about replacing the article. I think it would be better to put the Brit1911 was tacked on to the end of the section labelled "Aesthetics in History and Philosophy". The stuff currently on Wikipedia is good, but it's an entirely different categorisation system, which is why it doesn't resemble what people are studying. If this is what we decide to do, we'll have to promote the headings on the current Aesthetics page, and demote the headings on the Brit1911 one.</dd>

Instead, what would people think of moving <a href="../../../a/e/s/Talk%7EAesthetics_Brit1911_3dd9.html" title="Talk:Aesthetics/Brit1911">/Brit1911</a> to say <i>History of aesthetics (pre-20th-century)</i> or <i>Aesthetics (history pre-1900)</i>, and linking it prominently from a suitable place in the main article? -- <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimR_3f8c.html" title="User:JimR">JimR</a> 04:54, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Any person's aesthetic response to a work of art will be unique to that individual, but many aesthetic principles can be identified and used by the creator of the work to achieve specific aesthetic effects."</p>
<p>1) How is an "aesthetic response" different from a generic "response"? This is not clear from the introductory paragraph.</p>
<p>2) Saying that "many aesthetic principles can be identified and used by the creator of the work to achieve specific aesthetic effects" seems meaningless. I could substitute any other word for "aesthetic" in this phrase, and have an equivalent statement. Ex: "many scientific principles can be identified and used by the creator of the work to achieve specific scientific effects". It may (or may not) be true, but it doesn't help you understand what "aesthetic" means.</p>
<p>I thought I would post these comments here, rather than simply deleting the sentence in question, in the hope that someone might be able to do something with it. I think aesthetics can be useful, but I really don't think this sentence is helpful in explaining it. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiteC_f18a.html" title="User:WhiteC">WhiteC</a> 02:16, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi all. I came here looking for "Aesthetic", the noun, not "Aesthetic" the adjective. The word "Aesthetic" redirects here to "Aesthetics" (and rightly so).</p>
<p>An example of the difference:</p>
<ol>
<li>(adjective) relating to or dealing with the subject of aesthetics; "aesthetic values"</li>
<li>(noun) (philosophy) a philosophical theory as to what is beautiful; "he despised the esthetic of minimalism"</li>
</ol>
<p>(lines above taken from Googling "define:aesthetic"). I'd been reading about Cool, which is defined on the Cool disambiguation page as an African philosophy and aesthetic. I came here to try to answer the questions "What is an aesthetic?" (the noun), for which I had to go to Google to get the above definition, and "What other aesthetics are there" (which, now that I know the meaning of Aesthetic (noun), can be rephrased as "What different theories of the attractive are there", with "<a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29_fabf.html" title="Cool (African philosophy)">Cool</a>" being one of these. I've attempted to answer these, by defining "Aesthetic" as separate from Aesthetics at the top of the page, and by adding the "Schools of Aesthetics" section. Unfortundately I only had one entry for that list (and the discussion page for that article shows some controversy); if anyone has anything different to add, please feel free. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimNelson_44be.html" title="User:TimNelson">TimNelson</a> 09:47, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to numerous comments, I am taking a couple of days to run a major copyedit of the article OFFLINE; I will also incorporate some elements from the 1911 Britannica history. I should slightly simplify the language as well (shooting for an 11th grade audience).</p>

<p>â†’ A couple of sections had Definitions of the word Aesthetic; I combined these into a top "Definition" section;</p>
<p>â†’ I added in some of the Britannica info into the existing History and Philosophy section, arranging it more chronologically with sub-section headings. As the first couple paragraphs of the Visual Arts section appeared to talk about Modern views on Aesthetic philosophy, I moved those paragraphs from Visual Arts to the Philosophy section;</p>
<p>â†’ I removed many of the wikified words leaving primarily propper nouns and large concepts wikifield;</p>
<p>â†’ I combined the sections of Information Technology and Digital Aesthetics;</p>
<p>â†’ The Mathematics section had a tone as if it were trying to justify the beauty in math. We already accept that; I repurposed the section to try to delinieate the aesthetic elements of said beauty;</p>

<p>Hopefully the tag added to this article will entice someone to add more intellectual rigor to the subject. Right now, the article is unsatisfactory, not particularly informative, and disorganized. Let's use the 1911 Britannica article as the main text and piece together subsequent philosophical ideas to fit into the article. A massive rewrite is definitely called for...</p>

<p>The 1911 Brittanica Article is mired deep in POV, worse its a POV that started dying in the teens, and was dead dead by the 60's, it's history section is decent (but still very POV) and has been hived off into an awkward "history of aesthetics (pre-20th century)" article, but the rest of the 1911 Brittanica article is about as useful as a pre-plate tectonics discussion of global geology. I am a philosophy professor although not a specialist in aesthetics. I have put up a massive re-write. I have left the expert tag in but I may well count as a expert of the relevant kind, I'll let someone else decide. I'm not sure if I complied with all the wiki:philosophy project goals on the first shot, someone should check that. In particular I haven't done a good job of avoiding weasel words and dialogic style, I don't know any other way to make the material short, accessible, accurate, NPOV and still do justice to all aesthetic positions of all cultures and historical periods. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 16:35, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Thank</b> you. That's expert enough for me. I originally sought the wikipedia article for the purpose of learning something about aesthetics, and it was a disappointment. Today, literally, my first and second impressions of this new version were "oooooh. Pretty pictures." and then "Ew! Bugs!" Then I read the text, and it's informative, thoughtful, and clearly knowledgeable. Anyway, now I'm more informed about aesthetics, and the wikipedia resource has a beautiful article with well-placed pictures, references, and an authoritative treatment of an important field of study.

<p>Under industrial design:</p>
<p>"designers heed many aesthetic qualities to improve the marketability of manufactured products: smoothness, shininess/reflectivity, texture, pattern, curviness, color, simplicity (or usability), velocity, symmetry, naturalness, and modernism"</p>
<p>Simplicity is not the same as usability -- it's a subset of usability at best. For an example: lets say apple came out with an iPod so small it only had one button; the power button. You turn it on and it just starts playing whatever it feels like at whatever volume it feels like. This would be a simple interface, but it would not be a useable interface... I've never edited a wikipedia article and it's such a small point that I figured I'd just mention it and let someone else change it if they saw fit to.</p>

<dd>For me, this article feels <i>different</i> to other articles I have read on Wikipedia (and I've read many, like I'm sure we all have) and I really like it. There is a subtle change of vocabulary and I say with a coy tongue-in-cheek voice, I like the aesthetics of the "long" question mark headings. The text is written like a wiki/encyclopedic page with with a certain element of Philosophical textbook which the newest novice could understand. I think it is nearly ready, at worst. 80.47.196.152 22:02, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Based on the treatment that the Hilary Putnam article got as a feature article candidate, I'd say that a much better copy-editor than me needs to go over this with a fine tooth comb, and someone needs to fill this puppy with a large number of in-line reference citations, before we consider it for FA. It think the overall structure and feel is pretty good, but the detail-language may need a bunch of ironing. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 14:43, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Most of this article is okay as it stands, but parts of it appear to be incomplete - I was redirected here from a search for the Philosophy of Art, which meant that I expected to find more about the Philosophy of Art than there currently is. In particular, the section on the value of art is appalling - by being just a paragraph of questions, it implies that there's been no significant work done in this area to answer those questions, because (to the mind of the average reader) otherwise it would have been mentioned. I've only recently begun studying the Philosophy of Art so I'll try pulling something together when I've learned more (unless someone else can do it sooner?), but until then because that section needs expanding I'd say this article isn't ready for nomination for featured article. <a href="../../../a/n/r/User%7EAnria_f794.html" title="User:Anria">Anria</a> 12:38, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe it is my bias here, but if we want to expand the Philosophy of Art angle much let's create a philosophy of art page, move the redirects and link it from here. There is a lot of work done in philosophy of art, but there is very little consensus. Serious attempts to answer the many questions I mentioned would be of the form X argues Y about topic Z, A argues B about topic Z, D argues E about topic Z, and I worried that would clutter up a page that already almost too long, and very prone to each discipline coming in and cluttering. As we have done with most other disciplines, lets try to keep philosophy to a short paragraph here and allow an expansion page for all the arguing betwen Brand, and Cohen and Blocker and whatnot. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 13:10, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I assumed that there was a reason for the Philosophy of Art search to redirect here - something along the lines of a discussion leading to a redirect, I think (relatively new Wikipedian; please forgive silly assumptions&#160;:)) - but that suggestion is definitely a better one in the interest of avoiding clutter to an already long article.

<dd>Yes I suspect there are 2 main reasons. 1) Philosophy is in bad shape on WP, the Aesthetics Project folded for lack of anyone willing to work on it, (I was the only active member last time I checked) and much of the rest of philosophy is struggling. 2) It is a common mistake to think that philosophy of art and aesthetics are synonymous, or perhaps this is a common position and it is my POV (and others) that they are not synonymous. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 14:11, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The kittens are there because cuteness is a variety of aesthetic judgment, and it is important to understand that beauty is NOT the only form of aesthetic judgment, a common error.

<p>Where did he write this? <i>Art as Experience</i>? Or someplace else? If it was in A as E, could we get a chapter or page number or the like? --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 01:47, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Kandinsky painting that illustrates this section is nice (aesthetic judgement!), but I think it's inappropriate to categorise it as post-modern, and is therefore somewhat misleading in this context (the same image is also used to illustrate the 'Creative Impulse' and 'Symbols' sections of the main article on Art). I'm new to editing WP, so maybe somebody else could replace the image with another that is generally agreed to be representative of post-modern art (perhaps work by Jeff Koons, Sherrie Levine, Damien Hirst, or some site-specific art instead of a traditional painting?) --Birkinstein 18:02, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree. The image should go. This section as a whole is a bit of a muddle (other posts have pointed to the problem of addressing such a large subject). The first paragraph about the Bloomsbury group and Twentieth century 'revolts'is really about Modernist Aesthetics and Avant Garde Aesthetics. The second paragraph does describe some features of Post-Modern aesthetics, but needs expanding.--<a href="../../../e/t/h/User%7EEthicoaestheticist_7a56.html" title="User:Ethicoaestheticist">Ethicoaestheticist</a> 18:17, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In some of the early parts of the article there are quite a few statements stated as fact that derive from Kantian Aesthetics. I've got nothing against Kant. The single joke in the Third Critique makes me laugh every time. I think though that the Kantian parts should be properly referenced so readers can see where these ideas come from. I've added a quote about agreeable wine drinking.--<a href="../../../e/t/h/User%7EEthicoaestheticist_7a56.html" title="User:Ethicoaestheticist">Ethicoaestheticist</a> 00:08, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article concentrates too much on Art. Of course that is important, but many other areas need to feature also. 1. Science. The aesthetic appeal of a scientific theory or model is widely acknowledged to have a huge effect upon the likelihood of its being researched and promoted. The beauty of the double helix; the elegance of the periodic table, etc. etc. 2. Nature. What are the mechanisms that tell us which 'landscapes' to admire/be moved by? (but I'm talking slices of the natural world, not paintings). e.g. Why does a 'good view' generally have to be a very extensive one? I don't feel qualified to write this, but someone should.
