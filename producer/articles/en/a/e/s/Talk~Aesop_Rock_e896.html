<p>The quote used in the Aesop Rock article from the song "Oxygen" is written: "I'm an honesty columnist, fathering doom documents". At the risk of admitting certain obsessive qualities, the verse on the album uses the word 'sovereignty' in place of the word 'honesty'.</p>
<p>Generally, the lyrics found online can be *very* inaccurate. Aesop Rock's latest release "Fast Cars,Danger, Fire, and Knives" comes with a booklet of lyrics from the first 5 albums... it's a great read, while you've got the songs playing.</p>

<p>Aesop Rock isn't jewish, he's a non-practicing catholic.</p>
<p>Listen to his personal narrative in the song "Holy Smoke" on Fast Cars, Danger, Fire and Knives.</p>
<p>It's also further confirmed in a few interviews. <a href="http://www.606studios.com/bendisboard/showthread.php?t=5773" class="external free" title="http://www.606studios.com/bendisboard/showthread.php?t=5773" rel="nofollow">http://www.606studios.com/bendisboard/showthread.php?t=5773</a></p>
<p>" What is the idea behind the track, “Holy Smokes”? Is that song autobiographical?</p>
<p>Yeah there’s totally an idea behind it. It’s basically like this. I grew up in a family that was really catholic and their parents were REALLY catholic (laughing) you know what I mean. My mom and father grew up in Shithole, Pennsylvania, in a town where there was nothing but a church. So for my mom it was like every day involved church… So in 2005 religion is so complicated, and not as basic as it was back then. Recently there were a string of Catholic priests molesting kids. So I’m like, all right, how I am suppose to be attracted to this. It was a big let down for my mom, because religion is a major part of her life and has helped her through a lot of hard times. And for me growing up in a different era, it’s not like that. Organized religion is not as simple as it was. It’s not like “come home from school, and go to church because that’s were the town meets”. There’s so much fucked up shit, that it just makes it extremely hard to devote yourself to religion. And so, for me, I didn’t find the same sense of communitywith the church growing up in New York, because there was somuch for me to get into. I was trying to run around with my friends.So the song is like a social commentary on two generations of my family. And summed up kinda like this “ Organized religion in 2005, for anyone who is between the ages of a baby to thirty years old, is just not going to be the same as it was for their parents generation.” That being said I still have morals, and I’m still a good person. If there’s a hell I don’t feel like I’m going there because I have done some stupid shit, or because I got arrested for graffiti, or because I smoke weed. "</p>

On this page, Aesop Rock is catagorized under "white rappers." However, I've heard conflicting information regarding his ethnic background. Can someone give a definitive answer on this subject?</p>
<p>He's white. I think he's from upstate NY, but I know for a fact he's white. //<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDJRaveN4x_2cab.html" title="User:DJRaveN4x">user:DJRaveN4x</a></p>
<p>He's definitely white. Seen him live&#160;;x (which was DOPE). Subversive 09:14, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Stream of conciousness lyrics is not the only factor to consider when using the term avant garde. Aesop Rock as a unique and original flow, are you going to say that someone else has that? If not, then I would say avant-garde is an acceptable description of Aesop Rock. Seg 19:49, 27 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Having a unique flow does not make you <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avante_garde.html" title="Avante garde">avante garde</a>, just as playing a guitar in your own way doesn't make you the cutting edge of Rock music. And even if it did, I would contest the statement that his flow is especially unique.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 21:10, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>A <i>unique</i> and <i>original</i> flow? I'm sorry, I didn't realize that everyone else in rap except for Aesop Rock is totally imitating each other. It just so happens that Aesop Rock rips off early Kool Keith, Das EFX, and if you were to compare him to his contemporaries, his "originality" is completely nonexistent. --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModulatum_dd33.html" title="User:Modulatum">Mod</a> 04:39, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Avantgarde is a relative concept and a loaded word. While I personally would probably consider Aesop avantgarde hip hop, and really don't see how anyone couldn't, it is nothing but problematic and POV to use it in the way it was being used. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamieli_47f3.html" title="User:Jamieli">Jamieli</a> 21:37, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think as with most such things, we should defer to published sources.

<dd>I agree, but I don't think the bias is incredibly blatant. I think all that is needed are the removal of a few choice words, like "unmistakable," and "critically acclaimed" (unless these can be cited). I also think the third paragraph of the Music section (with all of the lyrics) might need to be re-written. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESyntaxPC_cdbf.html" title="User:SyntaxPC">SyntaxPC</a> 14:00, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Is it really necessary to mention all the compilations/guest appearances Aesop Rock has appeared on? I'm fine with the <i>idea</i> of only a partial list, but it would be problematic if not impossible to limit the entries or choose which ones qualify as most important. The link to discogs.com has a complete listing of every little appearance Aesop Rock has appeared on (as far as I know), so I think that should be sufficient, and in lieu of that I think we should take out the "Guest Appearances" and "Compilations" sections altogether. It's unnecessary to the article and is just gonna be problematic down the line (it's been edited and reverted a number of times already). Thoughts?<br />
