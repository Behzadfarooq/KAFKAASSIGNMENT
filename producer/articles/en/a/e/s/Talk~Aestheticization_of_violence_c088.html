<p>Hi, I am concerned that this article may contain original research. According to Wiki policies, "<i>Original research is a term used in Wikipedia to refer to material that has not been published by a reliable source. It includes unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position — or which, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimbo Wales, would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation."...Wikipedia is not the place for original research. Citing sources and avoiding original research are inextricably linked: the only way to demonstrate that you are not doing original research is to cite reliable sources that provide information directly related to the topic of the article, and to adhere to what those sources say.</i>The Wiki policy goes on to list examples, such as "... introduc[ing] an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source". As such, when an editor discusses the "Kelllian cognitive map (sometimes known as the semantic map)" in the article, I worry that this may be original research, unless an expert source on aestheticization of violence (e.g. a professor of film theory/ media criticism, etc.) has stated that the "Kellian cognitive map" is an appropriate analytical method.Nazamo 18:57, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have written this page from scratch but it is now as complete as time currently available allows. It's probably a bit too long, so feel free to pitch in and tighten it up. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid91_7ed4.html" title="User:David91">David91</a> 21:04, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, you are right. Thank you for your work. Indeed, the topic deserves the article. But in its current state the article is more of an essay than of encyclopedic. Please be ready that large pieces willbe deleted. In no way it is an offense to you and your work. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 22:28, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have split the subject matter into two pages. I don't know whether this helps but it seems better than doing nothing and allowing the work simply to be discarded on the ground that it is too long an essay. -<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid91_7ed4.html" title="User:David91">David91</a> 16:36, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>IMO acceptable. In this way the topics are better separated. At the same time, the problem with the article was not its length, but style. In essays, the authors are free to elaborate their opinions on the subject and present interpretations. In encyclopedia the facts must be presented. Opinions of people who are <b>authorities</b> in the area are also <b>facts</b>, if clearly stated that they are opinions of named persons.</dd>

<p><br /></p>

<dd>For example, your phrase <i>"Each Commission hearing is a piece of theatre designed to give all stakeholders the opportunity to be heard and to receive forgiveness and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catharsis.html" title="Catharsis">catharsis</a> through reconciliation."</i> is clearly your (or not?) interpretation, rather than a description of a phenomemon. It is a vivid metaphor, but inadmissible in wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:57, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ah ha! Thank you for the guidance. As you will realise, I am not new to writing but I am new to this activity so all the help offered is much appreciated.

<p>I think its important to mention john woo, as well as the surrealists, and goya and rembrandt, all of whom dabbled in the "aestheticization of violence" and met with great success....</p>

<dd>This page is intended to be about the principles. One or possibly two examples would be acceptable but I am against simply turning the page into a catalogue of everyone who might or might not have aestheticised violence. Further, it would be a subjective and arbitratrary exercise to decide who to include or exclude. It is therefore better not to open Pandora's Box. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid91_7ed4.html" title="User:David91">David91</a> 03:52, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I put up the essay tag. This is an interesting topic, and the original essay obviously took a lot of work. Many of the supporting/contextual explanations AROUND the topic (e.g. Pierce) have legitimate sources. However the core concept, "aestheticization of violence" needs a definition that represents a consensus of experts (e.g. professors on Media studies/film studies/ media critics). The current definition in the LEDE looks to me like OR (Original Research). IMHO, ideally (and I'd like to help in this regard), the LEDE should say something like "<i>The concept of aestheticization of violence was first developed by Smith in her 1990 article "Aestheticization of violence", in which she argued that XXX XXX XXX. Although Smith defined the concept as XXX XXX, cultural theorist Jones, in her book Aesthetics and Violence (1994) suggests that the definition be nuanced to include the concept of YYY YYY.</i>"Nazamo 17:24, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But the lede is precisely <i>not</i> where to get into arguments over such fine distinctions ("nuances"). The lede as currently articulated offers a straightforward, noncontentious, and simple definition of the term, just as it should. It is part of the essential work of encyclopedia writers to summarize the general understanding of terms and present them as clearly and neutrally as possible in the introduction of an article. The crucial debates--which of course must be (a) presented fairly and (b) cited as appropriate--concern exactly what specific cultural artifacts or genres <i>constitute</i> the "aestheticization of violence." Those debates are properly surveyed below the lede. At the moment, it's entirely unclear what, if any, part of the entry reads "like a story or essay." I'm removing the tag pending the identification of unacceptably story- or essay-like elements within the body of the entry. —<a href="../../../d/c/g/User%7EDCGeist_4ed5.html" title="User:DCGeist">DCGeist</a> 21:44, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm appending here Nazamo's comment to me about the current condition of the article. I'll say briefly that (a) the article does not strike me as a "content fork," as the aestheticization of violence is a substantial and relatively discreet topic within the very broad field of aesthetics. On the other hand, (b) I agree fully with Nazamo that the article should survey a few different sources for the term, preferably in the first section following the lede.</p>

<dd>Hi Dan, this note is about the aestheticization of violence article, which I tagged with the Essay template. Regardless of whether or not the article should have an Essay tag, I believe that there are still problems with it. This article may be "A content fork"..("usually an unintentional creation of several separate articles all treating the same subject"). Perhaps there is a broader article on aesthetics this could go into. Wiki guidelines state that "...content forks and POV forks are undesirable on Wikipedia, as they avoid consensus building and violate one of our most important policies." As well, the article doesn't lay out the different sources of the term "aesthetics of violence" (as in "Professor Jones, the author of six books on aesthetics of violence, defines the term as XXXX. In contrast, Smith defines it as YYYYY.")Nazamo 18:13, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
