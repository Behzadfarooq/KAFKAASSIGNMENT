<p>The choice of examples seems strange to me. Obviously aesthetics are neccessarily subjective, but I wouldn't say the Sims has aged well considering that the models are mimetic depictions of humans which appear much blockier and expressionless than those in the sequels. The article is also factually incorrect in stating that the Sims is 2d, since it uses 3D models for the characters. Diablo also seems a strange choice since it uses pre-rendered models for the sprites and for the cutscenes, and even 3D-rendering technology has become considerably more advanced since then. Are these examples commonly backed by proponents of this aesthetic?</p>
<p>I'd write a bit on the common sentiment that earlier flat-coloured polygonal 3D games were much easier to understand visually than their early textured-3D counterparts (due to problems of bluriness and limited texture size) but I think that would be pure conjecture, and I'm not sure how universal the feeling is. <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.61.57.35.html" title="User:207.61.57.35">207.61.57.35</a> 18:57, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course the examples are strange (and subjective), but it is necessary to choose among the best of them. I am confident that Homeworld 1 and 2 are the best examples, and perhaps should be emphesised by giving them a seperate paragraph. Every game will eventually decay, but for those which this rate is relatively slow, the dissonance will not be noticeable in the immediate future. Of course, the same could be said for Starcraft, Diablo, etc., but perhaps they were good examples. As for the less-complex visuals, though it may or may not be universally shared, I encourage you to mention it since I am not well familiar with it myself. --<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaiSeun_0295.html" title="User:KaiSeun">KaiSeun</a> 00:35, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article says: &gt;&gt;over time, [games, or games graphics] quickly deteriorate, looking worse and worse. As a result, players introduced to such games later in its life will notice a significant amount of decay.</p>
<p>This is patent nonsense. I've never seen a PC game's graphics change over time. If what is meant is that expectations change due to the introduction of new, more sophisticated graphics in newer games, could someone please change the article to say that?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've made the "quickly deteriorating" part more specific, and moved "they" (games and their graphics) to the bit "worse and worse". I've added a sentence explaining player expectations, though I included the context bit because I hardly expect games from even 5 years to look as good as games today.</dd>
<dd>I've also changed "limitations of current hardware" to "available computational resources" as there are games like Call of Duty which worked even though its engine was based off a heavily modifed Q3 engine.</dd>
<dd>What needs to be included is a paragraph explaining the difference between aesthetic and graphics, as they seem to be used (elsewhere) interchangably. I would also mention how games like World of Warcraft and Psychonauts did not strive for realism, but instead aimed for an aesthetic and mostly succeeded because they were well suited for their worlds. --<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaiSeun_0295.html" title="User:KaiSeun">KaiSeun</a> 00:40, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know if the examples really make sense, the original Splinter Cell still looks very impressive, especially in screenshots placing emphasis on the light/shadow effects (For example: <a href="http://www.gamerevolution.com/oldsite/previews/screens/xbox/splinter_cell/splinter_cell1b.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.gamerevolution.com/oldsite/previews/screens/xbox/splinter_cell/splinter_cell1b.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamerevolution.com/oldsite/previews/screens/xbox/splinter_cell/splinter_cell1b.jpg</a> ) The idea in general is certainly true though. My question is if a game like Half-Life 2 counts as Aesthetically complete. I think the texture work and art style is very coherent and beautiful in that game.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>The examples are relative, and will change in the future. They were chosen to compare games that strived for (photo)realism, to those that did not. For example, for someone who played Starcraft many years ago, and has only recently return to it, the coherence (if that is the proper term) between then and now are likely the same. Comparing with say Splinter Cell, the same coherence you feel today may not, and perhaps will not, be the same if you were to return in a few years.</dd>
<dd>Looks, or more properly, graphics, are part of the game's aesthetic, but are one of many things that contibute to a player's model. If a game focuses on these other aspects, which appear to be unaffected by more computation power, then the game would have a better chance of achieving aesthetic completion. Even though the visual quality deteriorates, its other qualities do not. The best way to identify these, of course, is to wait many years and then compare.</dd>
<dd>HL2 could be considered aesthetically complete, though not by coherent and beautiful art style alone, as you put it. In a few years times perhaps, its lack of opportunities for player exploration may become glaringly obvious compared with the games of the day. --<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaiSeun_0295.html" title="User:KaiSeun">KaiSeun</a> 18:54, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
