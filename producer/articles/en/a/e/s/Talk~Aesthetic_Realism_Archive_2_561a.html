<p>It is hoped that the writers who contribute to this page are <i>true</i> critics.

<dd>As noted above, we do <i>not</i> eliminate talk content and tell the reader to rummage through the history for it. Standard practice is to archive it. Standard practice in archiving is to leave currently active discussions in place on the main talk page, but in this instance I simply archived everything you had deleted, partly because there's really no bright line setting off what should be kept here on the main talk page. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 22:06, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Editing notes</span></h2>
<p>Streamlining what had become an onerous article much appreciated--I removed a subjective passage that did not add to the understanding of Aesthetic Realism.</p>
<p><br />
I removed the comment on Michael Bluejay's motives--the discussion should focus on the veracity of the issues raised, not on the person. Readers can draw their own conclusions about the state of mind of the various participants.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">I added back the attack on me</span></h2>
<p>I don't mind the attack on my motives in the article. I have no problem letting the other side air their complaints about their primary critic. Since the section in question covers how AR deals with its critics, this is a primary source of how they do so, and thus I believe adds much value to the article. So I'll add the attack on me back to the article.</p>
<p>If you really feel it's inappropriate for the article, let's talk about it. I doubt you'd change my mind, but I'm willing to listen. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbluejay_da97.html" title="User:Michaelbluejay">Michaelbluejay</a> 03:15, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disagreement</span></h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have received a mail from Arnold Perey concerning this article. May I recommand that you seek help from the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Committee_9b92.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Committee">Wikipedia:Mediation Committee</a>&#160;? thanks <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">Anthere</a></p>
<p><a name="Request_for_Mediation" id="Request_for_Mediation"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for Mediation</span></h2>
<p>In looking at the procedures to initiate mediation, I see that it is necessary that both editing parties wish it. I do wish mediation. I hope that Michael Bluejay also does. I am hereby submitting my request and will message mediators about it. --<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.114.86.135.html" title="User:66.114.86.135">66.114.86.135</a> 21:42, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nearly immortal?</span></h2>
<p>This is editorializing and is not supported by any AR text I've seen. Can the writer show a text? If not, it should be edited out, no?</p>
<p><a name="Defense_of_edits" id="Defense_of_edits"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Defense of edits</span></h2>
<p>First of all, I welcome outside help with this article, so it's not just a war between AR supporters and their most vocal critic (me). I spent a lot of time reading the various methods of resolution on Wikipedia and I'm not sure which one(s) I should pursue. I would welcome mediation but I'm not certain whether we're allowed to go to that point before trying other methods. The documentation about resolution methods is verbose and I just spent a lot of time reading it and I'm having a hard time keeping it all in my head.</p>
<p>Oh, I see that another party has agreed to mediation. Great, let's go for it. I'm confident that third party help will result in a fair article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually it's not representative</dd>
<dd>Since each AR supporter has his own view, and the particular supporter you quote says things that most others don't, I will remove it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whoa, wait a minute, here's why it's representative: <i>It's on the Aesthetic Realists' _Countering the Lies_ website</i>! They obviously feel it represents them well or they wouldn't have put it there. If they don't feel it's representative they're free to take it down, but so long as they hold this up as a good example of countering their critics, then I think it should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Also, obviously not everybody has the same exact opinion. That's not the point. This is simply an _example_ of such an opinion (and I think it's a pretty good example).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nearly immortal?</dd>
<dd>This is editorializing and is not supported by any AR text I've seen. Can the writer show a text?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Um, how about in the article itself?&#160;:) The quote therein says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Eli Siegel, founder of the philosophy Aesthetic Realism, is, in my careful opinion and that of a growing number of people, the greatest human being ever to live. That means the person fairest to the world and most useful to it. This means the person kindest, most learned, most ethical, most imaginative, and most desirous of learning; the greatest fighter against ugliness in people, the greatest encourager of beauty; the person at once most unified and diverse, most serious and humorous, powerful and subtle, magnificent and democratic."</dd>
</dl>
<p>If that's not nearly immortal I don't know what is.</p>
<p>I think there was also another quote in the article about how _Self and World_ was supposedly greater than Shakespeare and the Bible, but if so then it's been edited out. It's from one of their books, and it's on my website. Finally, I published on my site the testimony of a former student who said, "While I was in AR, I did believe that Eli Siegel was greater than Christ...It would have been accurate to say I 'worshipped' him."</p>
<p>So I don't think this is 'editorializing', I think it's backed up by the facts.</p>
<p>Can't wait for the mediation. --Michael Bluejay</p>
<dl>
<dd>My understanding is that mediation can be an appropriate first step. In this particular instance, however, one alternative worth considering would be a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">Request for comment</a>. That's easy for me to say, though, because I'm not willing to do the work to set it up. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 07:18, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Further editing notes</span></h2>
<p>The current article has gotten a bit verbose, and, at times, off track. I deleted some redundant passages, and made other minor changes to tighten up the language.</p>
<p><br />
The first paragraph needs a major reworking--the opening line does not tell us what AR is.</p>
<p><a name="Moving_the_matter_of_controversy_to_another_entry" id="Moving_the_matter_of_controversy_to_another_entry"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Moving the matter of controversy to another entry</span></h2>
<p>In keeping with the way the controvery over John Kerry's military service was moved to a separate category--while there is a straightforward account of Kerry's life under his name--I have moved the whole "Criticisms / Objections" section to a new category, "<a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms___Objections_As_to_Aesthetic_Realism_a7fe.html" title="Criticisms / Objections As to Aesthetic Realism">Criticisms / Objections As to Aesthetic Realism</a>." There, it can be dealt with a more length.</p>

<dl>
<dd>The reason for creating the daughter article about <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_military_service_controversy_86af.html" title="John Kerry military service controversy">John Kerry military service controversy</a> was that there was so much detail about that point, but it was a minor aspect of Kerry's overall biography. Including all the detail in the main <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> article would have been clutter. Simply excising all the detail would lose information. Therefore, we created a daughter article and left behind a short summary in the main article. I don't think the AR article is in the same situation. The article isn't unusually long; furthermore, in an article about a set of beliefs, the criticisms and objections are central, not peripheral the way the Swift Boat ads were peripheral to Kerry's career. Presentation of the AR philosophy itself and of criticisms and objections could readily be accommodated in one article, if not for the problem of the constant POV editing. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 21:06, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedians, please help me combat AR's censorship and POV rants</span></h2>
<p>AR supporters have one opinion of AR and I, as a critic, have another. Fine. The difference is that I'd still like this article to be a legitimate encyclopaedia entry while AR prefers to excise criticism and insert ridiculous POV cheerleading. Here's an example of how Aperey described a link to the site which tries to rebut critics like me:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Why those saying it is a cult are, in fact, lying"</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is SO RIDICULOUSLY POV it's not even funny. I call on the Wikipedia community to help me combat this nonsense. I can't do it alone. I've requested mediation but I don't know when that process will start.

<dd>One possibility is to wait and see what happens through mediation, though I wouldn't be particularly optimistic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's another possibility:
<ol>
<li>You set up User:Michaelbluejay/Aesthetic Realism (draft). This is a subpage in your user space. You can set it up by clicking on the link I've created. On that subpage, you write the article the way you think it should look, leaving in reasonable pro-AR comments, restoring the criticism that you wrote that got promptly deleted, and NPOVing the whole thing. You can do this by cutting and pasting from past versions of the article and from the talk page, as well as writing new material.</li>
<li>When you think it's ready, let me know. I'll look at it for NPOV and for Wikipedia style and format. I know I said I wasn't going to waste more time on this, but, as an experienced user here, I don't feel comfortable about just walking away from this festering dispute. I hope we can wrap it up so that everyone can spend time editing <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perverted-Justice.com_ab76.html" title="Perverted-Justice.com">Perverted-Justice.com</a>. (Pardon the in-joke; that's another ongoing edit war.)</li>
<li>You can accept whichever of my suggestions you please. Arnold Perey can meanwhile be refining the article any way he wants to.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedians, let us look at the facts</span></h2>
<p>It is not right for Mr. Bluejay to use Wikipedia as a platform to attack a legitimate philosophy and the professional people who study and teach it--doctors, artists, persons in the social sciences, teachers, homemakers, and more. I hope that anyone who wants to deal with this situation reads carefully and is not in a hurry.</p>
<p>Mr. Bluejay's attacks (take a look at the history of this page) are far too numerous for me create a legitimate article and hope it stays put. I have written and rewritten, only to find the saboteur at work again.</p>
<p>That is why mediation is necessary--at least to begin getting a just article.</p>
<p>I can rewrite till the end of time if need be to have the truth win out over obvious "bad-mouthing."</p>
<p>Apparently Mr. Bluejay wants to use Wikipedia's terms in his attack, such as the above "This is SO RIDICULOUSLY POV;" and in doing this he is ever so transparent. In fact, he is promoting his own, obviously NOT NEUTRAL, point of view.</p>
<p>Yes, as one Wikipedian wrote to me, everyone has the right to his opinion even if it is delusional. But no one has the right to suppress what another believes to be true, as Mr. Bluejay has tried to do to my writing.</p>
<p>He has censored me--unfortunately--and cried out that he was censored because I, hastily, deleted links that led to his libelous website. And later have tried to add paragraphs describing what I know to be true, often using legitimate and authoritiative sources. Further, I have tried to put what is unimportant in its proper place, and what is important and central in its place. But this is not allowed?</p>
<p>There has been no dialogue--just Mr. Bluejay's and a few others' peremptory comments, deletions, and substitutions. Democratic? No. Authoritarian? Yes.</p>
<p>This should change.</p>
<p>The "Big Lie" technique, in which you tell a lie so big that it intimidates people, and you tell it again and again, has been used in history. This is his technique and those who are sustaining lies about Aesthetic Realism.</p>
<p>Apparently Mr. Bluejay is afraid of mediation--writing "I've requested mediation but I don't know when that process will start"--and wants to do something else to preempt it.</p>
<p>There should be a real dialogue. Mr. Bluejay wants a <i>fait accompli</i> with his own version in place--badly misrepresenting a real history, an important philosophy, and honest people who teach it.</p>
<p>So I have set some facts before you.</p>

<dl>
<dd>The word 'cult' itself is very controversial, and has several different meanings and has very negative connotations. In general it should be avoided--don't say "X is a cult", say "so and so has called X a 'cult' because...".</dd>

<dd>That's the title of the website, and we prefer to use descriptive titles instead of URLs where possible. I think our readers will understand that Wikipedia isn't stating Aesthetic Realism to be a cult, any more than we're stating it to be a new foundation for interdisciplinary musicology just because we report the title of your presentation on that subject. If you think that someone might conceivably miss this point, however, we could add a description, so that the entry would read something like:

<p>The last section of the article states: "Meanwhile, the furtherance of these scientific and humanistic goals, which Aesthetic Realism stands for preeminently, has angered some individuals. These have worked to disparage this new education with pejoratives."</p>
<p>The anger described (if referring to Michael Bluejay's site) is erringly ascribed to the furtherance of the goals of AR. It's the method of furthering these goals that has angered some folks. Bluejay's site is clear on the distinction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the persons who now study and teach Aesthetic Realism have responded to Michael Bluejay by saying that the "methods" he attributes to Aesthetic Realism are, in fact, not true but exactly what the paragraph describes: "dispargement" and "pejoratives." Former students of Aesthetic Realism, who have had no connection with it for many years, have also written descriptions of their past study of Aesthetic Realism which take exception with Michael Bluejay and call into question his accuracy and impartiality.</p>

<dd>I am nobody to "dictate" anything. Any Wikipedian can add that tag, subject to certain rules. In this instance, I raised specific issues on the talk page. My concerns weren't addressed here, and my changes to try to make the article more neutral were promptly reverted, so the article is still biased. For just a couple examples, so you won't have to go hunt them up: The assertion that people actually <i>did</i> change from being homosexuals is a claim made by Aesthetic Realism; we can report that that's what they say, but the current text accepts their statement (which is contested) as the truth. The last paragraph of the article talks about favorable opinions of Aesthetic Realism from unnamed "[p]ersons with broad knowledge in these scholarly and humanistic fields". If there are such persons, it shouldn't be too hard to find one and give a quotation attributed to that person, with a reference (online or paper). The comment in the last sentence about people working to "disparage" Aesthetic Realism with "pejoratives" is pure POV. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 01:50, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, the tag is needed. When I neutralized the "fact" that people had "changed" their sexual orientation by attributing it to Aesthetic Realism, it was promptly converted back to a "fact".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Another Response</span></h2>
<p>Interesting dispute. I read the Jewish Times article. It seemed to me it was written by a zealous reporter who had a point of view. She seemed to want to discredit Eli Siegel in order to embarrass city officials and burnish her credentials as a hotshot "investigative" reporter. While she quotes a very flippant remark made about Eli Siegel by Max Gordon, she doesn't balance that quote with any made by people like William Carlos Williams and other third-parties quoted in the Wikipedia entry about Aesthetic Realism that show a rather high regard for Siegel or at least some intellectual acknowledgement of him as a serious thinker. I find it hard to believe the thesis of this article that city officials just automatically issue proclamations without some basis in fact for it. The article also contains many quotes from ex-students of the group slamming Aesthetic Realism but almost none from ex-students with more positive points of view--though they clearly exist and have, in fact, written statements on Aesthetic Realism's "countering the lies" site. The members of Aesthetic Realism quoted in the article do sound quite gushing. But I wonder if they are being fairly quoted or only quoted selectively to make them sound that way. It shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody that the bias of a reporter can cause him or her to "tailor" a story in a way that might not be completely accurate. I'll look forward to the analysis from Aperey. I don't know too much about Aesthetic Realism but this dispute makes me curious and I think I'll try to find out more about it for myself without relying on filtered information from either its enthralled supporters or its axe-grinding detractors.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some of us are neither. I was exposed to Aesthetic Realism through someone I respected. I read through a lot of the material, and while its an interesting way to look at life, it ultimately falls short. Taoism reflects a similar approach, though with a richer background. Your response seems rational--Eli Siegel posed an intriguing view of the world. My limited experience with Aesthetic Realists (and my experience here on Wiki), however, made an honest attempt at understanding the man Eli Siegel impossible.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>While Taoism does speak about opposites that are in tension but not flatly opposed, it is too superficial to equate it too closely with Aesthetic Realism. Hegel also based his philosophic thought on opposites and again, while there are similarities to the approach of Eli Siegel, there are also important differences that make Eli Siegel's thought original. His thesis that the same opposites that compose the essential structure of reality are also the opposites that every human self is always dealiang with--and trying through the process of life itself to "make one"--and that people can learn how to do this from the study of all the arts and sciences as well as the "stuff" of everyday life, cannot be found in either Tao or Hegel and, I believe, constitutes a fresh and sound basis for further philosophic inquiry. Taoism also believes that the opposites cause all life to bend back in upon itself in coming full circle. This is illustrated in the yin/yang symbol with its outer containing circle. In my reading of Aesthetic Realism literature, which I admit has not been exhaustive but has been more than cursory, I see the opposites being used to advance the reverse theory: namely, that instead of life bending back in upon itself, it's motion is onward and upward, in an increasingly ethical direction. In an often quoted statement in Aesthetic Realism literature, Eli Siegel defines ethics as "giving other things what they deserve as the one means of giving yourself what you deserve" (opposites) and says: "Ethics is a force like steam, the atom, electricity--and will have its way." For myself, I prefer this way of understanding the role of opposites to the one found in Taoism, though I do think very highly of Taoism with its emphasis on simplicity and the natural. (Please note that the above quotes from Aesthetic Realism are approximate and offered from memory. I make my apologies to those who know the subject far better than I.)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"killed" is definitely the wrong word</span></h2>
<p>While I don't intend to fiddle around with the entry on Aesthetic Realism, not knowing all that much about it, I do object to the use of the word "killed" in describing how Eli Siegel died. My father choose to end his life with dignity at an advanced age when his health had badly eroded and he was in fierce pain. I would be very angry if people went around describing that rational (and I believe wise) decision as him "killing" himself. It seems the persons involved in Aesthetic Realism feel likewise--and understandly so. The anti-Aesthetic Realism folk are the ones insisting on this language and that should tell you everything you need to know about how accurate or appropriate the use of this word is. "Ended his life" seems far more descriptive of what actually happened and is hardly a euphemism. That's how I would describe how my Dad passed away. We don't go around saying Jackie Kennedy "killed" herself, do we? I'd be pleased if somebody would fix this. (- not signed)</p>

<dd>If someone committed suicide, that's generally how it's objectively stated. "Committed suicide" is a straightforward, truthful statement, and would be perfectly acceptable.

<dd>Sorry to press the point, but I don't think "suicide" works either. Although it is preferable to "killed", it doesn't really address the concerns of the person who made the first comment above. While it is true, as Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary states, that suicide is "the act or an instance of taking one's own life voluntarily and intentionally esp. by a person of years of discretion and of sound mind" it still has a stigma attacked to it that current thought on a person's right to die with dignity would challenge.

That assertion—so vehemently denied at the time—seems to have been proven by subsequent editing. I think we need to use the correct, frank, and true term here, and perhaps restore some mention of the fact that the circumstances of Siegel's death are dealt with in the publications of Aesthetic Realism with a great deal of euphemism, obfuscation, misdirection and denial. - <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOuterlimits_49f0.html" title="User:Outerlimits">Outerlimits</a> 22:05, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Aesthetic Realism is the philosophy founded by poet and critic Eli Siegel in 1941. Among the public it is best known for statements that some of its adherents had "changed from homosexuality" as a result of their study. In 1990, the Aesthetic Realism Foundation discontinued this aspect of the philosophy's study because of what it described as the "atmosphere of anger" surrounding the subject which made impartial, philosophic discussion of Aesthetic Realism itself difficult.

<p>"Its adherents find the Aesthetic Realism point of view of art more significant: the Terrain Gallery was founded in 1955 with the publication of Eli Siegel's "Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites?" then reprinted in The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism and elsewhere.

<dd>The sentence "Its adherents find the Aesthetic Realism point of view of art more significant..." is hard to see the meaning of. It doesn't take into account the art critic Huntington Cairns who found the point of view to art as significant as Spinoza's to ethics. (Spinoza put ethics on an almost mathematical footing I believe--something I believe Siegel does for aesthetics, the branch of philosophy that studies beauty.) -- Artists have exhibited at the Terrain Gallery for about 50 years and the point of view to art was highly significant to them. They included a significant number of greats like Claes Oldenberg and Charles Magistro. (see terraingallery.org). And William Carlos Williams who found Siegel's poetry immensely important for American culture. None of these are "adherents" no matter how you define this term.

I am thrilled: your communications could not have come at a better time. I can't tell you how important Siegel's work is in the light of my present understanding of the modern poem. He belongs in the very first rank of our living artists. That he has not been placed there by our critics (what good are they?) is the inevitable result of their colonialism..."<a href="http://www.elisiegel.net/poetry/WilliamsLetter1951.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elisiegel.net/poetry/WilliamsLetter1951.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Aperey</dd>

<dd>OK, so Williams is refering to several of Siegel's poems. That is not the same as referring to Siegel's philosophy, unless you are saying that it was contained in his 1925 poetry. So it is irrelevant to quote Williams about AR. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 18:01, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Aesthetic Realism Foundation is a cultural and educational institute. Aesthetic Realism is the philosophy taught there. People who come to study in classes and consultations are students, not adherents. One cannot fairly say if a person comes to eight consultations and sees people and the world more accurately--and therefore is better able to appreciate art, to care for people, and to be kind--that person is an "adherent." No, he or she has learned something. There is an effect of knowledge one has gained, sometimes very quickly; sometimes over a longer period of study, which will be richer.</dd>

<p>Take for example a person who doesn't like Chaucer but never read more than a few lines. Then that person comes to love Chaucer because a good teacher explained the poetry cogently, factually, and made its beauty felt. For "Chaucer" read "the world" and you have a sense of how Aesthetic Realism enables a person to care for the world more. It isn't "adherence" but study. --<a href="../../../a/p/e/User%7EAperey_a9cb.html" title="User:Aperey">Aperey</a> 17:35, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added some documentation. There is more.</p>
<p>The fact is the Aesthetic Realism Foundation is not a philosophy but a school--this makes things a little different from the common way of thinking about a philosophy. Knowledge is transmitted, including about anthropology (which I teach), poetry, acting, and other subjects which are part of the curriculum. The education process is not really included in the term "adherent." It sounds more like geting glued to something than assimilating knowledge from it. (I say this with adequate awareness of the common usage of the term "adherent," I hope.) --</p>

<dd>The Foundation is indeed an institution, not a philosophy. As Outerlimits pointed out, though, Stanford is also an institution. I assume that, at Stanford, a student can take classes about Marxism. It would seem odd to call someone an adherent of Stanford, but perfectly normal to call someone an adherent of Marxism (or of libertarianism, or of Christianity, or of the theory of evolution). "Adherent" seems to me to be a neutral word for someone who agrees with a particular point of view. "Proponent" goes beyond that to connote active advocacy, "follower" might have an implication that the person didn't exercise critical judgment, and "supporter" is too weak because in some contexts it would include someone who didn't agree with the doctrine but who defended the right of other people to teach it. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 23:47, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Did the poem "Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana" sweep America? Yes, it did. See below:</span></h2>
<p>In a 1944 article in the Baltimore Sun, Donald Kirkley referred to the immense national popularity of "Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana" in 1925 as "a flood of publicity." In fact, the title "Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana" was so well known that it is quoted in <i>Bartlett's Familiar Quotations</i> (edition to follow if needed).</p>
<p>Donald Kirkley wrote this about Mr. Siegel--</p>
<dl>
<dd>He thought "all knowledge was connected — that geology was connected with music, and poetry with chemistry, and history with sports." ... He wished to find ... some principle, unifying all the various manifestations of reality.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That principle was, "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites." It is the basis of Aesthetic Realism. And writing about Siegel in 1925, after the <i>Nation</i> Poetry Prize:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Baltimore friends close to him at the time will testify to a certain integrity and steadfastness of purpose that distinguished Mr. Siegel. . . . He refused to exploit a flood of publicity which was enough to float any man to financial comfort. . . . He took a job as a newspaper columnist at a respectable salary, and quit it when he found that he would not be allowed to say what he wanted at all times.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Cheers, Aperey (Arnold Perey)</p>
<p>"Sweeping the nation" implies a popularity on the order of hula hoops, the macarena, or pet rocks. A "flood of publicity" (as demonstrated by an article in the Baltimore Sun) and a quotation in Bartlett's do not add up to "sweeping the nation". - <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOuterlimits_49f0.html" title="User:Outerlimits">Outerlimits</a> 20:26, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BY THE WAY I believe something like that did happen. Across the country, as I understand it, people were writing in their local newspapers poems in imitation of "Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana." People were stirred by the poem. You should read it out loud (it's online) to see some of the poetic quality that captured the imagination of Americans and simultaneously made the "authorities," the "establishement," so angry. It's a credit to Mr. Siegel's integrity that he didn't capitalize on this early fame but continued developing his philosophy and poetry regardless of what authorities "accepted" it or "criticized" it or ignored it. I admire his choice immensely. --<a href="../../../a/p/e/User%7EAperey_a9cb.html" title="User:Aperey">Aperey</a> 20:02, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I can understand that it was important in Siegel's career, but why is it in the introduction? And what is its relevance to the philosophy? Could we write a paragraph or two that answers those questions and put all the "Hot Afternoons" and poetry discussion there?

<p>I still think that the development of Aesthetic Realism as a philosophy ought to be taken chronologically. There are the 20s, then of course 1941, then 1955, and then the later events.</p>
<p>It is not correct to call Eli Siegel a "minor" poet. Fame does not make a poet major or minor. Southey was very famous in his day but seen as minor today. Van Gogh was major--but as an artist he did not sell any of his paintings. It is the power of Siegel's poetry that makes him major. And people who really know poetry saw this: a great poet himself, W.C. Williams; William Packard, the critic of poetry who founded <i>The New York Review</i>; NY Times reviewer Kenneth Rexroth, and others.</p>
<p>I cut some paragraphs I wrote much earlier because they no longer seemed relevant. I also trimmed some others' writing where it seemed to me either too awkward or really too "editorialized" to pass inspection.</p>
<p>As to the two sections on homosexuality, I tried to keep the first exactly as it was, and in the "Objections" section to interleave the Bluejay contribution with Margot Carpenter's response. Because of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation's desire not to be involved in an "atmosphere of anger" I changed nothing that seemed important to the writer. If something needs to be restored to its previous state, which I might have changed, go ahead.</p>
<p>The Marvin Mondlin statement seemed unnecessary in terms of sticking to the topic.</p>
<p>I think it is fairer to have a title "Objections to Aesthetic Realism and Some Responses to the Objections" -- because we need to have symmetry in these controversial matters. --<a href="../../../a/p/e/User%7EAperey_a9cb.html" title="User:Aperey">Aperey</a> 20:20, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Objections" is a very poor title to the section - you keep removing most of the criticisms and adding only rebuttal. It might be better renamed "testimonials in favor of AR". -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 20:36, Jun 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think I did remove "most" of the criticism--they're still there. I did remove some paragraphs from the "Friends of Aesthetic Realism--Countering the Lies" website. Put the criticisms back in, whatever you find. However much of that writing is POV pretty blatantly. "Claimed" instead of "stated" etc. etc. -- There is more opinion, I'd say, than fact. As I wrote to the Mediator, Bluejay et al are free to give what they call criticisms as long as the people who disagree with them are given "equal time" to express the disagreement.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course Eli Siegel is a minor poet. He doesn't appear in any critic's listing or anthology of major poets. Your inability to recognize that he has had no lasting impact on English literature suggests you are not looking at the question objectively. A few good reviews of a poem don't cause that poem to have any particular influence on literature: Siegal's influence <i>as a poet</i> is essentially nil. He would be completely forgotten today had he not founded Aesthetic Realism. I'll refrain from re-adding the (correct) information that Siegal was a minor poet if you tone down some of the paeans to his ineffability that makes that notation so necessary. - <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOuterlimits_49f0.html" title="User:Outerlimits">Outerlimits</a> 20:40, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am not for "peans" to "ineffability"--Bluejay made it necessary to show that the opinion stated by Ellen Reiss is one that has been felt for decades by the people who knew Siegel best. Because Bluejay quotes Ellen Reiss (out of context I might add) for the purpose of making her opinion seem isolated, so he can make the reader think he is right to say Aesthetic Realism is a cult (which it isn't). Bluejay wrote this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One has described Siegel's Self and World: An Explanation of Aesthetic Realism (<a href="http://definitionpress.org/SAW-page.htm" class="external free" title="http://definitionpress.org/SAW-page.htm" rel="nofollow">http://definitionpress.org/SAW-page.htm</a>) as the greatest book ever written, and others have said Siegel is the greatest man who ever lived. In [i]Aesthetic Realism and the Change from Homosexuality[/i] (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0910492344</a>), Ellen Reiss, the current (2005) Class Chairman of Aesthetic Realism says:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Eli Siegel, founder of the philosophy Aesthetic Realism, is, in my careful opinion and that of a growing number of people, the greatest human being ever to live. That means the person fairest to the world and most useful to it. This means the person kindest, most learned, most ethical, most imaginative, and most desirous of learning; the greatest fighter against ugliness in people, the greatest encourager of beauty; the person at once most unified and diverse, most serious and humorous, powerful and subtle, magnificent and democratic."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is necessary to quote others to show that, just possibly, Reiss is talking factually about a real person whom others saw the same qualities in. (There are more than those whom I quoted). If these two paragraphs by Bluejay are no longer in the article, it wouldn't be necessary to show Reiss is not in isolation. Maybe we could get on with the business of really saying what the Aesthetic Realism philosophy is.</p>
<p>Bluejay also wants to focus on the obvious fact that the press has largely ignored Aesthetic Realism, and use it to say I and others are "cultists" and are paranoid to say the press has been unfair. That's why it's necessary to give the reader a chance to understand why the press has put aside this philosophy (except for one or two tabloid-quality stories Bluejay's reprinting). It's a fact that there has been a fear of the size of Siegel's philosophy--including its uncompromising belief in human equality--and the respect that this philosophy engenders. The reader has a right to know why a philosophy thought great by a significant number of people is not well known.</p>
<p>The "belittlers" as Bready calls them want to say it's the fault of the philosophy and/or the people who care about it, that they aren't so good: they're deluded. Either the "belittlers" are right, or there is something wrong with how the majority of the press, the academic world, and even the critics see Aesthetic Realism. I think it's the latter. And all the facts--when they are presented, and not censored--will show that.</p>
<p>Ponder this -- (as to "major" and "minor" in art and poetry) -- If you told an Elizabethan that William Shakespeare was the greatest poet the English language had ever seen, you'd be pooh-poohed--the average academic didn't think that way during his lifetime. It took a couple of hundred years for his greatness to be recognized. If you were talking to a Bluejay you might be called a "cultist." I think it wasn't till Coleridge wrote about Shakespeare that the literary world began to get an inkling that he was really important. And Coleridge was a "nonconformist"(This can be verified).</p>
<p>Think of this too -- Vermeer was not recognized as a great artist--one of the greatest of all time, we think today--until several hundred years AFTER he died. The critics missed his value. He was seen as one of the minor Dutch masters by the best critics until, I think the time of Proust--who loved Vermeer. I can get exact references for this--it's real history.</p>
<p>To be a true critic of one's contemporaries is one of the hardest things going. Academic critics aren't so good at this. Williams was. We have to see Siegel as he will be seen historically. The tendency to make the value of an artist or scientist depend on contemporary "influence" is wrong. How many footnotes refer to him, etc. Mendel's discovery of the gene almost went into oblivion when he died. (Even though his paper on this discovery was published in his lifetime its importance wasn't recognized until much later -- I can get references for this too). Siegel is major -- very, very major. I've studied enough poetry, compared the musical power of his lines to enough poetry (major, minor, and bad) to be quite sure of this. Others have, too, and they represent the opinion that will be seen as true. Williams questioned the perception of the critics in his time....We should try to have as large a perspective as he had.</p>
<p>This matter of mayor and minor is not a "quickie" to be solved by the snap of a finger. Study is necessary. And if that's what it takes to make Wikipedia a really good encyclopedia--including fairness to Aesthetic Realism and its founder--isn't that what we should do? --<a href="../../../a/p/e/User%7EAperey_a9cb.html" title="User:Aperey">Aperey</a> 18:52, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Eli Siegel is certainly a minor poet. [N.B.: Although I don't like to engage in a debate like this, you are quite wrong. -- AP]If future ages come to esteem him as highly as we do Shakespeare, they can edit the article accordingly. Until that halcyon day, Siegel will have to be content to be what he is, rather than what he could be, if for some reason his importance is reevaluated. Your comparisons are symptomatic of the problem you have in coming to a realistic assessment of Siegel's literary importance - which is more-or-less none. He's not Shakespeare, he's not Coleridge, he's not Vermeer. He hasn't left behind him a corpus of literary works remotely comparable to the works of any of these. Our "fairness" here ought to be to the truth (and to those who wish to be informed), not to what Aesthetic Realism and its founder would wish to be the truth, and you should not distort the truth to your ends. The "issue" of whether Eli Siegel is a "major" poet doesn't require much study at all: he appears in no anthologies of major poets. [Again, quite wrong. -- AP][Quite right, actually] We need to report that. Meanwhile, if you want to continue to heap largely undeserved praise on your hero, claiming it is a response to Michael Bluejay, then that response belongs down in the article where it would actually be a response, rather than at the beginning, where it distorts Siegel's actual importance. - <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOuterlimits_49f0.html" title="User:Outerlimits">Outerlimits</a> 21:00, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

Until you do, I recommend a little more modesty in your sweeping negations. I hope that you are willing to learn from the way Williams wrote, and Rexroth, and Huntington Cairns, and others who knew poetry well and made the study of literature and art their lifework.

<p>Whew, what a discource! I'm still not sure why the prominence of Siegel as a poet matters to our article on Aesthetic Realism. However, setting that question aside, I have recently done a comprehensive search of all 350+ Internet references to Eli Siegel that Google reports (a few dozen to other people). Only two (yes, two) of them were to significant references by non-AR consultants. (Also two hits to archives of magazines in the early 1970s, one which printed a couple of his poems and one which had some kind of review.) While I don't know what the definition of "minor poet" is, my (original) is strong evidence that Siegel is a forgotten poet outside of the AR world. Obviously we can't cite this in the article but anyone arguing that Siegel is non-minor poet has a heavy burden of proof. (And again, for the purposes of this article I can't see why Siegel's prominence as a poet matters - this is a philosophy article, not a poet's biography).

<dd>Regarding my recent edits: There were Williams quotes all over and other repetitive mentions of Siegel. So I collected them and placed them in the same section. Let's move over to the biography, or delete, anything in there that isn't relevant here. Likewise, I went through the "Objections" section and collected the objections and put them in a section of their own. I think it will be easier to edit if we have common material placed under their own headings.

<dd>In the organization effort, I've moved the Siegel stuff to the Siegel article, then combined the conceptual material, the historical material, and the "objection/respnse" material each to their own sections.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Note on the importance of "Hot Afternoons"</span></h2>
<p>I am writing quickly now as I just saw your post, so I can't give you references and so on. But "Hot Afternoons" was one of the first forms of Aesthetic Realism--it's a philosophic poem that says that things in the world are more related than you know. A hot afternoon in Montana is related to the whole world--to monks in Europe, to Aristotle by the Aegean, to Native Americans "thinking, feeling, trying pleasurably to live...." to a bird flying.... and much more. Mr. Siegel called this poem "The Scientific Criticism" given light and heat. It shows people are all related to one another and is a hymn to equality and mutual understanding. So these three are crucial in the development of Aesthetic Realism: "The Equality of Man," "The Scientific Criticism," and "Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana." They are, respectively, a way of seeing people as equals, a way of seeing and criticising art--and the world as a whole: economics, history, and more; and a poetic (or artistic) way of seeing people and the world: a way that is both logical and passionate as all art needs to be. Everything in Aesthetic Realism as a mature philosophy developed from the core ideas in these three early works--and each is great in its own way--and continued in Mr. Siegel's ongoing critical, poetic, and humanistic endeavors for the next 50 years.</p>
<p>Yes, I think there can be a paragraph or two making this clear. Is this what you had in mind? --<a href="../../../a/p/e/User%7EAperey_a9cb.html" title="User:Aperey">Aperey</a> 20:32, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but it need sources too, like the rest of this article. Did Siegel ever describe how AR came into being? That would be the appropriate source, I imagine. Or an official ARF interpretation of the poem.While we're onthe topic, all of this appreciation for Siegel's genius belongs in his biography. Anything that doesn't refer to AR itself should be removed. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 20:38, Jun 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, Mr. Siegel did describe it. And Ellen Reiss, who is a critic, has written about the meaning of the poem. There are very good sources. -AP</p>
<dl>
<dd>By that criterion, the whole section about his poetry should be removed from this article. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 18:58, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I wrote above was obviously an error. It happens, Aesthetic Realism arose from poetry.

<dd>I am not for "paeans" to "ineffability"--Bluejay made it necessary to show that the opinion stated by Ellen Reiss is one that has been felt for decades by the people who knew Siegel best. Because Bluejay quotes Ellen Reiss (out of context I might add) for the purpose of making her opinion seem isolated, so he can make the reader think he is right to say Aesthetic Realism is a cult (which it isn't).

If these two paragraphs by Bluejay are no longer in the article, it wouldn't be necessary to show Reiss is not in isolation. Maybe we could get on with the business of really saying what the Aesthetic Realism philosophy is.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Relation to Structuralism and other philosophies</span></h2>
<p>I can't find the reference where Conrad Arensberg compares AR to structuralism. This section seems rather long. Where is the Arensberg comparison, and why is it so important? Thanks -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 00:12, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Arensberg reference is not imporant. I took it out.</p>
<p>Please note, Willmcw, the ugly way Outerlimits took the article and inserted editorializing POV arising from malice. I reverted the article back to a cleaner previous version.</p>
<p>What can be done?</p>
<p>You might stop imputing ugly motives. That would be one thing that could be done. You might reread what you're adding and consider whether it clarifies concepts of Aesthetic Realism or obscures them with superfluous detail. That would be another. You might strive for clarity and factuality rather than advocacy. You might strive to differentiate between the good, the mediocre, and the bad. You might attempt to see Eli Siegel's poetry <i>as it is</i>. All these would be good things. - <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOuterlimits_49f0.html" title="User:Outerlimits">Outerlimits</a> 20:17, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If we don't have a specific person comparing AR to structuralism then the whole section should go. I don't see the reason for it to begin with. Without Arensberg it's totally unsupported and doesn't add much of anything to our understanding of AR. Regarding other recent edits, I don't know what ugly edits AP is referring to. One edit that AP made removed the assertion that AR advertised in order to get more students. That is the reason that most schools advertise. If that was not the reason, then why did AR advertise? Also, what is the deal with the quotes form Williams? They have nothing to do with AR - they are about Siegel's poetry. It's OK to have one, somewhere, but the quote does not belong in the intro sentence. What we need there is a 10 word summary of the philosophy. Further, you say, in one edit summary, that "so much disparaging material is introduced into this article". I see very little "disparaging material" - just the short "Objections" section. Why does it matter to a comprehensive summary of AR (which is what this article is) that Siegel had an article published in an art journal? Hundreds of people have undoubtedly been published in that same journal, and I bet we don't have articles about 99% of them. And what does this mean - "As many instances of fame as possible should be pointed to, in chronological order." Why? The "fame" you are talking about is Siegel's, not AR's. This is the article on AR, not Siegel. Or, maybe we just oughta merge the two, since it seems they are one and the same thing. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 21:38, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>PS - I've hidden the Structuralism section. It is a big lump that is distracting and is predicated on an unsupported comparison. Would it be possible to agree to work on one section at a time? For instance, the description of the AR philosophy? Cheers, -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 22:37, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
