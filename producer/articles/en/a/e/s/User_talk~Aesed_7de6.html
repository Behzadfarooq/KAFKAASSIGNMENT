<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I found your map awesome while comparing FR and EN interwikis.</p>
<p>I intended to upload it in commons, but {{fairuse}} seems not allowed there. Do you have more accurate info about the use of this map&#160;?</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:AlAndalusmap 1248.jpg</b>.

<p>Firstly, quit your hysterical ranting, Moving a page to a better title is not vandalism, and that is a ridiculous assertion. Secondly, at no point was there a Muslim rule or occupation of "The Iberian Penninsula", rather of part of it, so the title you are trying to enforce is factually inaccurate. Thirdly, for reasons you are aware of, but choose to ignore, that is not a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline.html" title="Timeline">timeline</a> but a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronology.html" title="Chronology">Chronology</a>.

<p>Are you a noted catrographer? Becuase an ordinary person cannot make a map like that? If you did make it, what historical sources did you use to justify demarking where you did? Making it with no sources does not make it reliable. So, please add what sources you used. The base map and whatever historical date for overlaying onto the map of the Iberain peninsula.

<dd>I have added no source to it... because frankly... you didn't make all of that with no aids for creation. Justify that it's in the public domain or it should be deleted.

<dd>Firstly, that map isn't a template for the final version... they are very different. Also, where did you get the historical data with which to draw the definitive lines you did? That's <i>very</i> important to assure you are accurrate... we've been called the "faith based encyclopedia" but we'd rather not stay that way. Your licensing tags remain and I think the PUI tag will be taken down after it has been up there for 14 days... You have to admit it all looks a little fishy. Mapping is not easy... not if you care about accuracy and making an 19th century or so map into a nice small straight lined map with transparency is not so simple. I mean, look at the detail on the coast lines in the map you says is your source and then look at your version... why would you get rid of all of that? It makes no sense. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 22:46, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, doesn't your 1150 differ from the source map? Why don't we just use the Texas map or work to produce a version of that which looks nicer.

The image was deleted on <a href="../../../p/u/i/WP%7EPUI_d69d.html" title="WP:PUI">WP:PUI</a> by another admin because you did not justify that it was free. Then you re-uploaded it. You can go to deletion review if you have an issue with the decision from PUI but don't just ignore the decision. If I had arbitrarily deleted it, this would be different, but I did not delete it in the first place. So, you are blocked for 48 hours. Please do not do that again. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 23:05, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Image:MedievalIberianPeninsula.jpg was a slightly modified version of the image [:Image:MuslimOccupation.jpg]] which had been deleted under PUI. When you re-uploaded it I told you not to try to circumvent the system. This is doing the same thing so I have blocked you for a week (feel free to appeal it or explain why you did this). The whole point of this has been that you must give sources for historical images. You did not just pull the history and <i>exact</i> borders from Medieval Iberia out of your head... they came from somewhere or, the image has no value because you did randomly pull them out of your head. Borders on maps cannot be considered common knowledge. The fact that you refuse to explain where all of the information comes from but still upload it is problematic and if you continue to do this you will be blocked for progressively longer periods. Please just stop it. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 01:27, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I felt bad so I unblocked you after 4 days. You knew that you shouldn't upload the same thing... because it was deleted as per PUI and reuploading the map with superficial changes was trying to circumvent that. I asked <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">User:Briangotts</a> where his map came from and he told me. I asked <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalman01_ae51.html" title="User:Salman01">User:Salman01</a> where his material was coming from and he gave no claim that it wasn't copyrighted and re-posted it and was blocked. I am trying to be fair about this and I don't see it as trying to stop an encyclopedia from being created. I see it as trying to make this encyclopedia verifiable. We have to know what sources the borders came from because they shouldn't just come from thin air... and if they do... why should we trust the map as being correct? If you can give verifiable information about where data (borders, etc.) comes from and show that whatever copyright you give it is correct then it's fine. But you have to be able to show everything you used to make an image. That's verifiability and when amateurs like ourselves try to create an encyclopedia we need that verifiability to have any credibility... because we will not just be trusted like Britannica is. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 04:30, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
