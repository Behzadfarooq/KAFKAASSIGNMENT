<p><a href="../../../a/e/l/Aelita_%28Code_Lyoko%29_7a7c.html" title="Aelita (Code Lyoko)">Aelita</a> has flashbacks of when she and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Hopper_84c2.html" title="Franz Hopper">Franz Hopper</a> went to <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html" title="Lyoko">Lyoko</a> for the first time. Lyoko was still unfinished and Franz appeared as a bunch of floating bubbles. They were in the forest sector and some monsters attacked them. Hiding in the tower, Franz told Aelita that he is going to try and negotiate with <a href="../../../x/a/n/Xana_%28Code_Lyoko%29_66e8.html" title="Xana (Code Lyoko)">Xana</a> so they can peacefully coexist. He told her to stay in the tower, she heard lasers and ran outside to see monsters attacking him. Franz told Aelita that Lyoko has to be shut down.</p>
<p>Aelita woke up in the middle of class. She told <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremie_Belpois_ebe7.html" title="Jeremie Belpois">Jeremie</a> that she thinks Franz may still be alive. He disagrees with her, noting that Franz sacrificed himself for her. Aelita got mad at Jeremie, so she and <a href="../../../o/d/d/Odd_Della_Robbia_49ea.html" title="Odd Della Robbia">Odd</a> go into Lyoko without telling anybody, which causes problems. Xana had created a diversion to get everybody to deactivate the tower in the mountain sector while monsters worked on destroying the core of Lyoko. They stopped it and deactivated the tower. In Jeremie's room, he discovers evidence that Franz may still be alive.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/l/Aelita_%28Code_Lyoko_episode%29_5819.html" title="Edit section: Recap">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Recap</span></h2>
<p>Aelita begins having flashbacks about her first visit to Lyoko. Once she and Franz arrive there, she appears as she normally does, while Franz appears as several orbs of white light. He explains that he can't take human form yet, as he needs to work on Lyoko so it will develop more. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Kankrelats" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Kankrelats</a> appear, which Aelita doesn't recognize, and Franz tells her to run. The Kankrelats chase Aelita into a nearby <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_%28Code_Lyoko%29_4ce5.html" title="Tower (Code Lyoko)">tower</a>.</p>
<p>In class, Aelita wakes up from her daydream, which the teacher, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Gilles_Fumet" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Gilles Fumet</a>, scolds her for. The teacher continues his lecture, explaining <a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragnarok.html" title="Ragnarok">Ragnarok</a> to the class. Odd makes a rock and roll joke (playing on "rok" in Ragnarok) and is asked to leave the class.</p>
<p>After class, Odd looks back on his joke, deciding it wasn't that funny. <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_Delmas_1152.html" title="Elisabeth Delmas">Sissi</a> walks by, making a joke at Aelita's expense about her daydream, adding that normal people sleep at night. Odd teases that Sissi shouldn't have that problem, since her brains are in her feet. Perhaps a poor choice of words, Sissi turns the barb back at Odd by mentioning his foot odor, which she learned about from one of Odd's former girlfriends. Odd is disbelieving at first, but is quickly convinced that his feet do indeed smell when pretty much everyone he runs into confirms it for him. the others tease him about it. Odd, despite having been told about his foot odor numerous times, assumed it was just a joke. <a href="../../../y/u/m/Yumi_Ishiyama_c57b.html" title="Yumi Ishiyama">Yumi</a> recommends that he see a doctor, since they would surely have something capable of getting rid of his foot odor. Jeremie jokingly suggests amputation. Taking Yumi's advice, Odd goes to see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Yolande_Perraudin" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">the school nurse</a>. She, too, knows about his foot odor, but tells him she has something that can take care of it.</p>
<p>Aelita has more flashbacks about her first visit to Lyoko. Aelita, now safe in the tower, Franz arrives to explain that he must try to negotiate with Xana to keep the program from attacking them. When Aelita asks about Xana, Franz explains that Xana is a multi-agent computer program that he had developed. However, the program achieved sentience and became automatous. Franz neglects to explain just why Xana wants them destroyed. He only warns Aelita not to leave the tower under any circumstances.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Cafeteria" title="Kadic Junior High School">cafeteria</a>, Jeremie wakes Aelita from her dream. When asked what's wrong, Aelita dismisses her memories as simple daydreaming. Odd arrives to announce that his feet no longer have odor problems. When Ulrich aks how he did it, Odd simply tells him that he'll find out at bedtime, since it's a surprise. Yumi leaves to take a math test. Once she leaves, Aelita asks Jeremie about the possibility of finding her father on Lyoko. Jeremie is convinced that any efforts in that regard are wasted, since Franz undoubtedly expended what little energy he had to revive Aelita in "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Key_%28Code_Lyoko_episode%29_d019.html" title="The Key (Code Lyoko episode)">The Key</a>". He also did a thorough search of Lyoko and found absolutely nothing. Jeremie tries to convince her to forget the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Past.html" title="Past">past</a> and look to the <a href="../../../f/u/t/Future.html" title="Future">future</a>. A poor choice of words; this angers Aelita. She reminds him that she spent ten years of her life as a computer program, then wishes that she'd never recovered her memory as she storms away. Jeremie just shrugs.</p>
<p>In another flashback to her first visit to Lyoko, Aelita tries to follow Franz outside of the tower. She finds his various component orbs being fired on by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Hornets" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Hornets</a>. At the same time, in reality, Aelita is running to the Hermitage, her former home with Franz. Back in the flashback, Franz insists that she go back in the tower, as Aelita possesses the keys to Lyoko. Noting that Xana has grown beyond any possible control, Franz tells her that he's going to shut down the supercomputer. Aelita asks if they're going to die as a result, which Franz tells her isn't going to happen. His parting words are that she never forget him.</p>
<p>In her old room, Aelita is crying as a result of the recovered memory. Odd appears in the doorway, having correctly guessed where Aelita would go. He's there to apologize for Jeremie, who, while quite smart, certainly isn't as tactful as he should be in such situations. Regardless, Odd reminds Aelita that Jeremie likes her a lot. Aelita feels the same, but wishes he'd be more understanding of the fact that Franz Hopper is the only thing left of her past life. After a bit of thought, she decides to go to Lyoko to find a trace of her father, and drags a somewhat relucent Odd along with her.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Library" title="Kadic Junior High School">library</a>, Jeremie wonders if he was too hard on Aelita, which Ulrich immediately assures him is the case. Just as he tells Jeremie to let Odd handle it, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Moral%C3%A9s_017c.html" title="Jim Moralés">Jim</a> interrupts them, reminding them not to talk in the library unless they want to be sent to the principal's office. After Jim walks away, Jeremie comments that Aelita must hate him, but Ulrich figures that she's probably looking for Jeremie right now so they can make up.</p>
<p>At the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory_%28Code_Lyoko%29_6884.html" title="Factory (Code Lyoko)">factory</a>, Aelita and Odd make their way to Lyoko. Aelita sets up several timed events that will virtualize them and get them to Carthage without anyone operating the controls. Odd is surprised that she can automate all those different things at the same time. Aelita insists that it's a piece of cake. On Lyoko, Aelita and Odd follow the path she laid out earlier and are whisked away to <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html#Carthage" title="Lyoko">Carthage</a> by the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Transport_Orb" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Transport Orb</a>.</p>
<p>At school, Jeremie's computer detects an activated tower in the <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html#Mountain" title="Lyoko">Mountain</a> sector. To get themselves out of the library, Jeremie and Ulrich start an argument about some unnamed recipe. It has some weird ingredients, which Ulrich explains are part of something Odd thought up. On their way to the sewer, they call Yumi to pull her out of class. She's forced to breeze through the math test then leave before the teacher can even say a word. For obvious reasons, Jeremie has no luck contacting either Aelita or Odd.</p>
<p>At the factory, Jeremie catches a wiff of Odd's foot odor and wonders if he arrived there before they did. Ulrich just assumes it to be a lingering smell from the previous day. Jeremie still has no luck getting ahold of either Aelita or Odd, so he sends Ulrich and Yumi to Lyoko once the latter arrives.</p>
<p>On Lyoko, Ulrich and Yumi find themselves facing a trio of Hornets right off the bat, something Ulrich berates Jeremie for. If that weren't bad enough, two <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Tarantulas" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Tarantulas</a> have also arrived to assist in the battle. As Ulrich and Yumi block the laser blasts, Jeremie materializes their vehicles to even the odds. After escaping the first group of monsters, Ulrich and Yumi arrive at the activated tower to find two <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Bloks" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Bloks</a> guarding it. Jeremie warns them not to get devirtualized while he continues trying to contact Aelita.</p>
<p>In Carthage, Aelita and Odd find themselves facing down an army of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Creepers" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Creepers</a> while the key remains out of reach. For some reason, the Creepers seem apprehensive about the arrival of the two warriors. This does not stop them from fighting back, however. Despite their superior numbers, the Creepers prove to be no match for Aelita. While she destroys them one by one, Odd scales the walls to hit the key. In doing so, Jeremie is informed that someone is in Carthage, and a quick scan reveals Aelita and Odd to him. He's understandably annoyed that they're already there, and informs them of Xana's attack. Having been discovered, Aelita decides to go back and help. While she and Odd head for the passage to the Mountain sector, Aelita notices <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Mantas" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Mantas</a> guarding the entrance to Lyoko's core. Sure enough, Xana has a group of monsters attacking it as they speak, having activated the tower as a decoy.</p>
<p>In the Mountain sector, Ulrich and Yumi fight off the two Bloks. Though the Bloks prove to be somewhat problematic, they are destroyed without ever landing a hit. Jeremie has them abandon the tower and head for Carthage. After they reach the edge of the sector, he promtly sends the Transport Orb to get them.</p>
<p>By the entrance to Lyoko's core, Aelita and Odd continue to fend off the Mantas. After successfully destroying two of them, the final one manages to devirtualize Odd. Aelita heads through the entrance to lose the final Manta. Meanwhile, Ulrich and Yumi arrive in Carthage as backup, but they have a long way to go before reaching Aelita. In the core room, Aelita begins firing on the Creepers and Mantas attacking the core. After destroying one of the Creepers, two of the three Mantas present break off and begin chasing her. Ulrich and Yumi arrive to help, cutting through various monsters with ease as they make their way to the top of the room. It takes them little time to eliminate the attacking force completely. Since Xana's tower poses no immediate threat, Jeremie suggests that Aelita look for data on Franz Hopper.</p>
<p>Back at the dorms, it's night time and Odd reveas the cure for his foot odor to Ulrich. It's a cream that he spreads on his feet. The cream actually smells worse than his feet regularly do. In Jeremie's room, Aelita watches as Jeremie pours over the data she collected from Carthage. At first, it seems as if her efforts were in vain. Just as she's about to leave, however, Jeremie discovers a fragment of Hopper's genetic code. This is good news, as it suggests that Hopper is still somewhere on Lyoko.</p>
