<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re:Counting stubs</span></h2>
<p>All very simple (and a bit of a chore at times). When the stub-sorting project was first set up, we started dividing the geo-stubs up into regions. When that happened, I realised that we'd later have to split them further, so I started a database listing all the geo-stubs and the country they were from. Even since then I've gone through the regional geo-stub categories every couple of weeks and made whatever changes are needed to the database (usually adding a handful of names and removing another - smaller - handful). It's all done by hand - it could be automated, I suppose, but it would almost certainly be less accurate. And since it's done so frequently it usually only takes a couple of hours. The Stub-sorting project knows that I do this, so generally leave it to me to say when a country has 65 stubs and is ready for splitting. Thankfully some of the other stub sorters like Alai keep track on some individual countries that might need splitting into subnational regions. Sometimes countries do get "growth spurts" when one editor decides to write a load of stubs - it wouldn't suprise me if this happened sometime with Oman, but at the moment there aren't really enough stubs for a separate category. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 02:30, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>sure - thanks. I doubt I'll need much help with the categories I look at - they're all slowly getting smaller due to individual countries being split from them - but there are always potential splits of different sorts coming up that need counting (earlier today I asked how many of the Norway-geo-stubs were likely to be from oslo, for instance). Some of that work is automated now, but there's always room for a keen stub tallier at WP:WSS! <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 03:50, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand that you were attempting to get rid of the clutter for history stubs. To be honest I would be satisfied with any stub notice other than Asia. How about creating a stub for articles related to the Hellenistic and Roman periods?--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 20:35, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Armenia is not Asian or Middle Eastern, by any definition other than the geographic one that uses the Bosphorus as South-Eastern border. So if you have to put a continental stub notice put it under Europe as culture/ethnos are more important. Same for Cyprus, it shouldn't be under Asia or Middle East.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 21:13, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi! I see you have re-removed the stub which I'd reinstated on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_St_Neots_ff06.html" title="History of St Neots">History of St Neots</a>, where a previous editor had left a "to do" list in the final section. Obviously the whole article is much too long to be a stub, which is how it was marked when I found it, and replaced it with a History stub, which I repositioned in an attempt to make it obvious it referred just to the section, not the whole article. I thought that, in my early wanderings around Wikipedia, I had encountered a "section-stub" or two. Do such things no longer exist? Do you not think that they serve (or would serve) a useful purpose in flagging up an article that still needs much work, despite its length? (If I'd been able to find an appropriate template I would have used it, but life is too short to search the ever-increasing list of stub categories to find an applicable one. Had I done so I would also have removed the "<b>Topics</b> (to be expanded)" bit, which I reckon is a bit off-putting to the reader.) <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESiGarb_95a2.html" title="User:SiGarb">SiGarb</a> | <a href="../../../s/i/g/User_talk%7ESiGarb_3f7c.html" title="User talk:SiGarb">Talk</a> 17:41, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I've reworded the template and swapped over categories for the first couple - have a look at {{<a href="../../../m/a/r/Template%7EMarmara-geo-stub_336d.html" title="Template:Marmara-geo-stub">Marmara-geo-stub</a>}} now, for instance. If you use that as a pattern for the others, I don't think it'll cause problems. It's a shame this started in the small hours of the morning (my time) - odd that no-one noticed the missing word "geography" - they are being split from a geo-stub category... <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 03:30, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>S'alright - already done&#160;:) (hope no-one minds too much!)

<p>Hi again - I'll add the <i>headings</i> to my Ongoing splits page, but you'll have to add the lists of which article goes where! I haven't been keeping track of the different Turkish articles as far as which region they're from, and all my tallies are done by hand - so if I was going to have to open up each article to see where it was, I might as well do all the template editing too! Hopefully you've kept a list of what belongs where... BTW, do you think the seven categories could each do with a map highlighting where the region is, a bit like the Africa and United States region categories? <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 08:01, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi again, I finally took care of creating and sorting the stubs. In sorting them, I discovered some stubs which rely upon the 1911 Encyclopedia for their information, meaning that their information references Ottoman provinces, etc, as being up to date. Because some of the information may still be relevant or otherwise useful, I don't want to delete the articles. However, at the moment I don't have access to references on the subject. Could you check the articles or suggest someone who can (or a suitable reference online)? <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelfthrytha_8770.html" title="User:Aelfthrytha">Aelfthrytha</a> 04:39, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings! Nice work organizing this project by the way. I wanted to put in a few suggestions. First the template should probably include the North West Frontier Province and Baluchistan:</p>
<p>This project aims to expand, cleanup and wikify, better organize, and neutralize the point of view on articles related to Central Asia, including, but not limited to Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, western Pakistan (North West Frontier Province and Baluchistan), Xinjiang, Tibet and Central Asian portions of Russia. It is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of other Wikipedians. If you would like to help, please inquire on the talk page.</p>
<p>Also, more importantly, if you want to get things done I would suggest a monthly or bi-monthly collaboration project. Basically people nominate articles they want to see improved right away and then people vote on whichever ones they want to. That way the group can pool its efforts and improve articles consistently rather than simply putting out there that various articles need improvement. Anyway, just wanted to add my two cents. Take care. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 21:26, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Adding "Fauna of xy" categories</span></h2>
<p>Today I noticed that you added "Fauna of xy" categories to not only <i><a href="../../../m/a/c/Macrovipera.html" title="Macrovipera">Macrovipera</a></i>, but also <a href="../../../v/i/p/Viperinae.html" title="Viperinae">Viperinae</a>. I'm afraid this is pointless. Those aren't even species! There are also two big problems with "Fauna of xy" categories to everything. First, it's way too general. Right now we may not have too many articles dealing with the fauna of Ghana, for instance, but what about in 10 years time? There could be thousands. Better to create categories that do not have the potential to become so large. I would suggest only creating categories that will never achieve such proportions, such as "Dangerous Snakes of Ghana". Such smaller categories could then be added to "Categories dealing with Ghana", for example.</p>
<p>Secondly, from the viewpoint of at least some species articles, country categories (of any kind) are not always practical either. <i><a href="../../../m/a/c/Macrovipera.html" title="Macrovipera">Macrovipera</a></i> occurs in some 20 countries, while The <a href="../../../v/i/p/Viperinae.html" title="Viperinae">Viperinae</a> are a subfamily of snakes found thoughout the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_World_14db.html" title="Old World">Old World</a>. Do you know how many countries that would be? I'm sure there's a list somewhere, but would it really be practical to add all of those country categories to this one article? If you did, it would become rather difficult for anyone to find what they were looking for in such a long list. In other words, the current system has its limits. Unless that's changed, a solution might be to create only a category for the "Venomous Snakes of Africa" instead. --<a href="../../../j/w/i/User%7EJwinius_b7e0.html" title="User:Jwinius">Jwinius</a> 18:57, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<blockquote>
<p><i>However, I think that in other cases it would be useful for now to add them.</i></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>But, that's my point. How many country category tags do you want to add to a single snake article? For a species like <i><a href="../../../v/i/p/Vipera_berus.html" title="Vipera berus">Vipera berus</a></i>, that would be a tag every country between Great Britain and China. When do you stop adding countries? Better to just make a page with a list of species for yourself instead of adding category tags to all of those articles (and easier too).</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The classification system you suggested would be useful at some point, but there isn't really enough information to know which categories would be appropriate.</i></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>How so? You can make up any categories you want. Just as long as they don't get too big.</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p><i>What is your opinion on adding fauna of ___ to individual species?</i></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>It's pointless. I don't mean to sound negative, but think of the results. If you wanted the category "Fauna of Ghana", for example, to be complete, you'd be tagging articles almost forever, just for that one country. It would be huge! "Fauna" is too general: it means all the mammals, all the birds, all the reptiles, all the amphibians, fish, insects, arachnids, worms, etc., etc. The list is almost endless. And even if it were ever complete, it would be so long and so general, that it would be completely useless.</dd>
<dd>What I'm saying, is that it's therefore better to keep lists (or categories) like this relatively short; to something like a few hundred entries at most. For instance, at the moment all of the snake articles have "Snake" category tags in them, but that's really only good for getting an idea of how many snake articles there are. Otherwise, my feeling is that these Snake tags are pretty useless -- there are too many snake articles already! What good is a list of 4000 snake names? Completely useless!</dd>
<dd>That's why I'm saying, if you must make categories and add tags to everything, it's better to plan for smaller categories. For example: "The Snakes of Ghana". Or, even smaller: "Venomous Snakes of Ghana." Every category will results in a list, but that list must remain practical. Always think: "What will the results of my new category look like in 10 years time?" --<a href="../../../j/w/i/User%7EJwinius_b7e0.html" title="User:Jwinius">Jwinius</a> 23:28, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p><i>I strongly disagree with you because the majority of those things which I tagged don't have such a distribution.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, earlier you attempted to tag a widespread genus and an entire subfamily. What am I supposed to think? Plus, it's not just you; somewhere along the line, other people start to follow your example and just add tags like this to all of their articles without thinking. Your project begins to take on a life of its own, after which it becomes hard to stop. Soon the list of articles in your category becomes so long, that it becomes useless whether you planned it that way or not. Just because nobody stops and thinks about it; they just copy what the other articles look like. On the other hand, if you make the list yourself (an article, not a category), you always retain complete control and there's never any danger if it getting out of hand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>If the categories for Fauna of Central Asian countries become too big, they can be split at a later date.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And who is going to do that? Are you? For thousands and thousands of articles? I think not. Somebody would have to set up an automated process to do that, and that in itself would be a lot of work. And all that work can be avoided just by thinking a little in advance -- before you set the wheels in motion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Also, I would appreciate a little bit if you would soften your tone; I'm not sure if it's your intent, but you seem rather harsh.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There I think you have a point. I apologize for my tone. It's been a long day. However, you did ask for my opinion, and it was only after you tagged <a href="../../../v/i/p/Viperinae.html" title="Viperinae">Viperinae</a> and <i><a href="../../../m/a/c/Macrovipera.html" title="Macrovipera">Macrovipera</a></i> that I really began to think about this issue. Hey, all this time I've been tagging without thinking as well: all those Snake tags! I've got one in every single one of my articles, including the last one I created today, and now I realize how useless they are!&#160;:-)) I think somebody even tried to warn me about this early on, but I just ignored them. Sigh.<br />
Another user, <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshLin_f411.html" title="User:AshLin">AshLin</a>, has suggested to me several times now that we start up a wikiproject "Serpentes". So far, I haven't said anything to him about it, but I think now that that would be an excellent idea. It would certainly be a good way to tackle big problems like this useless "Snakes" category and discuss ways to replace it with something more intelligent before things really get out of hand. Smaller, nested categories might be a good solution, perhaps based on subfamilies (some are rather large though). However, our own wikiproject would be good for other things too.

<p>I'm not sure how much faster you'd be able to go: you seem to sort at a pretty remarkable rate already! But here's some possible ways of saving yourself some manual searching, and some typing. Firstly, StubSense isn't a bot, it's a toolserver query page: <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/queries/stub_sense" class="external free" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/queries/stub_sense" rel="nofollow">http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/queries/stub_sense</a>. Just fill in the fields, and you get a breakdown of existing stub-tagging, etc, in a particular category. I'd also suggest looking into <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a>, which is in effect a "semi-bot". You can get StubSense to produce output that can be fed straight into AWB to process a "batch" of stubs in a uniform manner, have it traverse a whole category, use results from a google search, etc. Finally, I use the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Using_the_python_wikipediabot" class="extiw" title="meta:Using_the_python_wikipediabot">pywikipedia</a> bot framework under the account <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlaibot_de3d.html" title="User:Alaibot">Alaibot</a> for things like removing, renaming and merging stub tags (either from WP:SFD, or on the basis of re-stubbing candidates from database dumps).

<p>I noticed that you recently added a link to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US-icehockey-team-stub&amp;oldid=74004048" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US-icehockey-team-stub&amp;oldid=74004048" rel="nofollow">here</a>. American is a disambiguation page as the phrase has many uses including a person from the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a> or the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. In the future, could you link the term to one of the articles listed on the American disambiguation term, that would be great. As an example, if you're linking to something related to the United States, you would input [[United States|American]].

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kazakh ministers</span></h2>
<p>I cannot keep current ministers in the gov category? Why? If they're currently ministers then they're high ranking members of the government. On another note, I think I already joined the Central Asia WikiProject. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 14:47, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well... creating a category on gov ministers is a possibility, but I think the template on Current Kazakh Ministers achieves the same purpose. What I've done so far is to put current ministers in Cat:Gov of Kaz and former ministers into Cat:Kaz pols.

<dd>What? No, no, you misunderstand. I'm only putting current ministers in that category. That's about 15-20 people. I'm creating pages on retired ministers but im putting those in the Politicians category.

<dd>Ah, I get it now. But do not worry, for lower level officials I use the Politicians category. Usually though, I dont spend my time working on anyone lower than a national-minister. Do you have expertise on Kazakhstan? I could use some insight into <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism_of_Kazakhstan_e986.html" title="Terrorism of Kazakhstan">Terrorism of Kazakhstan</a>.

<p>Hi Aelfthrytha</p>
<p>I'm glad you liked the new image. I think an image like <a href="../../../t/u/r/Image%7ETurkey_stub.png_ec69.html" title="Image:Turkey stub.png">Image:Turkey stub.png</a> is a lot better than <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Turkey.svg_be10.html" title="Image:Flag of Turkey.svg">Image:Flag of Turkey.svg</a> when it comes to geographical articles. I can't draw myself, so I've copied them from the Czech Wikipedia. Unfortunately, their list of images is pretty incomplete. I've found images for Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan (+ Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina and several other nations) but I can't find any for the last three Central Asian nations. Perhaps we should ask the Czechs for more images? <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valentinian_3b01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valentinian">(contribs)</a></sup> 21:07, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
