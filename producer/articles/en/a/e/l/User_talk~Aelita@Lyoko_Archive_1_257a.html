<p>Hi! Welcome to the Pedia! My name is Angie. I'm a <i>Code Lyoko]]</i> fan too! --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>

<dd>Hi Angie! Are you thinking of launching a CL remake? If so, I'd <i>love</i> to help! -- <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">Aelita@Lyoko</a></dd>

<p>I actually am doing a fanfiction version of a remake with a friend named Matthew Rozier. It's called "<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3069450/1/" class="external text" title="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3069450/1/" rel="nofollow">"New and Improved"</a>. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>

<dl>
<dd>&lt;lol&gt; Yeah, yeah. Get off the line, AF, I get to talk to <i>you</i> every day. Angie Y? I'm not sure I understand. Explain? Also, am I misremembering the trivia for the "Odd della Robbia" page or is your friend that wildcard's voice actor? --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">User:Aelita@Lyoko</a></dd>

<dd>Sweet! Odd has been my all-time favorite CL character since I first saw his kitty face in Lyoko! Well, whatever "New and Improved" is, I'd be glad to supply some ideas.

<dd>Well, we haven't had a rainy day all summer...probably aren't going to have one until winter gets closer. Most of the summer days are bright and sunny, and the later days have been HOT in the afternoons.

<p>Sorry if the heading is a bit cheesy. I just got back from the airport a couple hours ago and it's 2:17 AM East Coast Time. I couldn't think of anything else.</p>
<p>Anywho, hi there and welcome fellow Code Lyoko fan! I'm <i>truly</i> thrilled to have another wikifriend! It's GREAT that we have so much in common, especially in the food category! It should help us get along and give us something to talk about. Do you like other things I do (i.e. books, TV, etc.)? Sorry that you don't have cable. However, if you want to have Code Lyoko at your fingertips, I strongly suggest ordering the DVDs. The full Season 1 box set should release shortly. You sound strong in the writing department. Same here! I enjoy writing science fiction novels, short stories and graphic novels. I admire authors such as <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Bradbury_a4ab.html" title="Ray Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Burgess_55ab.html" title="Anthony Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldous_Huxley_db2b.html" title="Aldous Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a>. If you ever see a novel called "Yeriel" or "Centaurion" at your local bookstore, I probably wrote it. You probably won't see them for a <i>long</i> time though...I'm in a creative writing class at my high school where I write bleak future stories along the lines of the authors mentioned above. For graphic novels, I want to write/draw one called "Revered" which is basically about a mentally unstable guy who believes that he is Jesus and walks around Great Britain preaching.</p>
<p>About that fanfiction remake, I'm actually not the other author Angie is working with. I kind of help from a distance and read their story. I'd join FanFiction.net (where they write the stuff), but my email account's functionalism was obliterated by a poor ISP and I require email to activate any account. Wikipedia is the only place I can get on! However, I bet Angie has no problem with you helping.</p>
<p>Glad you could read my userpage. I thought it was too long for human eyes to read, so I put in userboxes for quick reference. If you want some check out <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_3753.html" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes">Wikipedia: Userboxes</a> to get some. I recommend it. Hurry though! The German Userbox Solution has those boxes moving to Userspace where I can't find them and I probably just confused you with a lot of wikislang. Sorry about that! I'll help you with the ins and outs of this place. Look forward to speaking with you again!</p>
<p>P.S., Head for the Desert Sector. There's an activated Tower there!</p>

<dd>Wow! We really <i>do</i> have a lot to talk about! --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">User:Aelita@Lyoko</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah! I read that you like writing myths and are really good at them. What kind of myths? Are they in the Homeric style of the <i>Illiad</i> and <i>Odysee</i> or are they in Roman format or do you just make up whole new ancient civilizations? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 18:50, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, um, yeah. Something like that. I've only written three myths, all for school. The first two are set in Ancient Egypt (The second is sequel to the first) and the third is set in Ancient Rome around the time when it burned down. Have you reached that part of ancient history in school? Oh, and I think you mean "Odyssey." Anyway, what I have the most fun making up and the hardest time writing are just plain stories - probably the reason why I have such a hard time putting them on paper is that I imagine them in moving pictures. The stories that I'm <i>really</i> obsessed with are - well, I'll bet you already know the answer to that, or can guess! Oh, and about the CL Season 1; I know that it's coming out in a boxed set sometime in September, and I think that pieces of it are already out on individual DVDs. Me, I'm obsessed with watching TV shows as close to in order as I can, so I'm just waiting for the boxed set. The biggest problem I have is acquiring it. I can't drive, I don't have a credit card, and for some reason I couldn't access my bank account last time I tried. I dropped some hints about it to my Grandma, though, so it might show up under the tree at Christmastime. By the way, while I'm thinking about this...I'm in California, where are you? --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">User:Aelita@Lyoko</a></dd>

<dd>My World History teacher didn't really teach history in a linear fashion. He would sprinkle the present in the past and vice versa. For example, we learned about Gandhi and the Indian Revolution at the same time we learned about Chaldean Babylon. I suppose we got up to...Napoleon, but we really finished at World War II since Hitler was sprinkeled around here and there. We actually skipped Ancient Egypt. My teacher said that Egypt would be repetative and it would be more important to learn about the obscure civilizations. We did do a long unit on Rome though. So, you're from California. I'm from the exact opposite end of the USA in Connecticut. I've been to the Golden State before, to the two places one thinks of: San Francisco and Los Angeles. I have also been to Orange County and the Palm Desert area. I hear you have year-round schools out there. Here we have summer vacation: 2.25 months of no school, which incidentally I am still on. How is it with Arnold as Guvunator?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>P.S. Is that really how they spell the Odyseey? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 01:50, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wow. You know, I had pretty well guessed we were on opposite coasts, but I never actually guessed Conneticut. Anyway, to answer that postscript: yeah, I think that's it. I have that book, but it's been a while since I pulled it out. I kind of make a big deal about spelling and grammar problems (through the combined efforts of my computer's spellcheck and my English teacher). My sister's reading this over my shoulder and she says that this chat thing is "like having internet pen-pals." I wonder who teaches teachers how to teach? 'Cause I think your WH teacher had trouble with organizing his material. If we have "year-round schools" out here, you couldn't prove it by me - I'm homeschooled. Oh, and there are some pretty neat books out there that have Egyptian myths in them. The one I have even has a Cinderella variant. Maybe someday my myths will be published. Oh, and about the <i>Governor</i> thing (spelling freak-out) I'm not really sure. I know Arnold better as an actor. Hey, whoa - I just looked at the date you signed your last note with, it's already Sunday over there? We still have, like, four hours to go! &lt;lol&gt; -- <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">User:Aelita@Lyoko</a> 20:39, 19 August 2006</dd>
</dl>
<p>P.S. What's UTC, anyway?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Universal Time Coordination. Since Wikipedia is an international thing, it spans all time zones. It wouldn't be fair to someone in Taiwan to base time off, say, East Coast Time. The whole UTC concept is based off mathematics and I don't get how they do it. I think teachers are taught by teachers in college programs. What I see out at my school is we have student teachers who teach classes for half a term and then go on to be full time teachers. About my history teacher, you'd have to meet him to understand why he teaches the way he does. He's actually extremely innovative in his methods and I sort of like that. It would be awesome if your myths were published. You could keep writing over the years and complie an anthology of sorts and get it published. I'll watch my local Border's Books! Btw, it's not actually Sunday yet. My laptop clock shows 11:50 PM...Okay, I'm 10 minutes away from Sunday. It only looks like Sunday because of UTC. Time confuses me. You know, it's entirely a human concept. Scientifically speaking, "time" doesn't really exist. There is only a present moment. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 03:52, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I read about the airline thing. Did someone get a picture of you wearing that crown? Mom was talking about turning off the restrictions on my email over Christmas, so whenever that happens I could give you my adress and you could email me with the picture. I'd love to see what everyone was staring about! (I'd give you my email adress now, but you would have to give me yours and I would have to get Mom to approve of it so I could get mail from you. Too much hassle.)</dd>
<dd>I knew you were talking with AF - she told me. This website is a great opportunity for new friends, isn't it? I didn't even know it was here, at first; I just came to Wikipedia for the articles. I started checking out discussion when... um... OK, let's just say my patience runs out very quickly when I don't know how long I have to wait. Thanks for finishing the recap.

<dd>No one actually got a photo of me at the airport, but I actually still have the crown in my room. I could put in on, take a photo and then email it to you. It's great that your Mom might turn of the controls. Why does she have so many up in the first place? You're older than me and it seems as if I have more Internet freedom than you, and my folks are still pretty conservative. Does it have to do with protection? I have to agree, Wikipedia is a wonderful place for friendship. I already have three here (Angie Y, you and Aelita Fan). And you're welcome for the recap. I never noticed anything <i>particularly</i> noteworthy from that episode (except for the "Jeremiefied" quote), but I don't mind so long as others are happy. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 13:49, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mom says that there are a lot of websites that aren't fit for us to access. If that means what I think she means, I don't see what the problem is - a lot of those "unfit" sites I wouldn't even be interested in! Sheesh! But anyway, one plus to having restrictions on my email is no spam. Although - I would almost rather have the spam. Do you remember from the "Odd della Robbia" page where it says that Odd suffers the brunt of XANA's wierder attacks? I always want to find out just how Odd handles those bizzare attacks, like with that experiment.</dd>
<dd>Season 1 is almost out in a boxed set, I wonder how long it'll take for Season 2 to follow suit. The very first CL episode I ever watched was "Saint Valentine's Day" (with all the previous episodes missed) and the last was "XANA's Kiss." And I've seen every episode in between. What can I say? Oh, and I only watched the <i>first</i> half of "Common Interest" and the <i>second</i> half of "Attack of the Zombies." It was a complete surprise to me to see Odd as a zombie! -- <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">User:Aelita@Lyoko</a></dd>

<dd>Odd is a weird person by nature. One just needs to look at his eccentric clothing and the way he eats. Perhaps his warped personality acts as a sort of cushion to allow him to tolerate these forms of attack. Also, Jeremie hypothesized that constant exposure to Lyoko helps the human immune system build up a number of B "Memory" Lymphocytes, causing a sort of immunity to XANA's presence. That might help explain. I hope it doesn't take too long for Season 2 to come out. It'll be nice to have every episode in reach. I'm not surprised that you were shocked to see Odd as a zombie. I've made the error of tuning in halfway through an episode and when something I'm not expecting has already happened and I'm seeing the effects, I reel. Now, all we need is Season 3. That goes into the history of Lyoko and Project Carthage. Yes! Government conspiracies and a more-powerful XANA. What are you most looking forward to about Season 3 and 4? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 17:36, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most? Uh, I don't know. Odd getting a girlfriend? I mean, according to the trivia at the bottom of Odd's page, he was pretty depressed in "The Key" when he wound up dateless. It would be nice to see him settle down on one girl. Do you think it really is going to be Sissi? I wouldn't have thought so, but...the kiss thing makes me wonder. Any ideas which season that's in? Oh, and "wierd person by nature"...I'll buy that; he'd have to be, to get so much enjoyment from putting his life on the line! If his clothes are eccentric, you couldn't prove it by me - I don't know what is and isn't, and besides, my watching "XANA's Kiss" was in January this year so I don't really remember his outfit. As for Jeremie's hypothesis, I have only one thing to say about it; "No means we take your word for it."

<p>You said you wanted to be part of Wikipedia in any way, shape or form? Well, how would you like to help me on a little pet project I started? There's an affiliated site called <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Simple English Wikipedia</a>. It's basically a Wikipedia for people learning the English language, so you have to use really um...simple and easy terms (i.e., see that tab on top of this page that says "edit this page"? On SEWikipedia the same tab says "change this page."). I realized that that site didn't have a Code Lyoko entry. For shame! I was wondering if you would like to help me make one. You have to make a new account on SEWikipedia, but it can be temporary. I'm going to write one line on my userpage there that says: "I'm here to make a Code Lyoko page. That's it." All the articles there are stubs, so we don't have to spend too much time writing. How would you like to help me?

<p>Glad you liked my recap for "Is Anybody Out There?"! I don't know how that boiler hatch closed. Personally, I'd actually believed that it just shut on its own, but knowing Code Lyoko I bet the ghost of Leon Corbé did it. As for your adventure with the Girl Scouts, WOW. Don't know how that happened. I'm a skeptic so I think the door opened due to a draft, but I wasn't there, so who am I to pass judgement? I'm a Boy Scout myself, in fact, that's why I was in New Mexico. I went to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philmont_Scout_Ranch_d3bb.html" title="Philmont Scout Ranch">Philmont</a> for two weeks. Those funny happenings you read about on my userpage occured during our tour in Albuquerque and Santa Fe, as well as on the flight home. I've never done anything seriously paranormal in Boy Scouts, except hear the legend of <a href="../../../d/u/d/Dudleytown%2C_Connecticut_8eaf.html" title="Dudleytown, Connecticut">Dudleytown, Connecticut</a>, which is...pretty darn freaky. Other ghost stories were minor, and would only scare me when I was a Tenderfoot. However, if I did meet a ghost, I'm right with you on setting the world record for running away. However, since I don't believe in ghosts I can't say I ever have. Well, I'm looking forward to tonight! My parents are taking me to a lobster shack for dinner. Yes! Seafood and no dishes to do! I'm salivating I tell you. Well, I'm almost done with my last Summer reading assignment and when I finish I'll do the rest of those episode recaps. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 20:34, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/l/User_talk%7EAelita%40Lyoko_Archive_1_257a.html" title="Edit section: Xanadu rundown">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Xanadu rundown</span></h2>
<p>My version of Xanadu looks like a cross between Lyoko and the Xanadu of Garage Kids. It's an island, supported up and away from the void below by large black cables that wind together. The cables can be visited, but it's hard to get around because there isn't very much space. There's a sector that manages most of the energy coursing through Xanadu. The gang calls it the "Sky sector" because it's cyan and it's over all the rest of Xanadu. They use the points of the compass to define direction, although they don't completely apply in the Internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>The "Carthage" sector is a bright blue bubble in the very center of Xanadu. It is linked by cables to towers everywhere in Xanadu. (like Lyoko) This sector has a large gate similar to the Stargates that allow it to connect to all seven of the other worlds in the Internet.</li>
<li>The "Transport" sector surrounds the "Carthage" sector similar to a planet's rings. This sector is always moving, and it is a very fast way to get from one sector to another.</li>
<li>The white "Glacier" sector is to the north.</li>
<li>The green "Forest" sector is to the south.</li>
<li>The yellow "Desert" sector is to the west.</li>
<li>The red "Mountain" sector is to the east.
<ul>
<li>There are two ways to enter Xanadu: one is virtualization, and the other is called "jacking in," which is done from a device called a console. You always have to virtualize first, because in order to jack in you have to be "assimilated," which can only be done with the towers. Virtualization is considered the more dangerous of the two, because (unlike CL) any injuries done to your virtual body are repeated on your real body after you leave unless you renew your life points in a tower first, and if your life points hit zero while virtualized you can't be brought back. (Steve does figure out how to bring his friends back somewhere at the end of Season 2; He's the only one who knows how to use this program, which makes for a problem in Season 5.) There are advantages, such as more than one person can use a scanner at a time, and there aren't any bodies left behind to be vulnerable.</li>
<li>Jacking in also poses many advantages: there are far more options for jacking in than there are for virtualization (like, if this were CL, Odd's catlike form wouldn't be possible unless he was jacking in) and you can jack in without help from someone at the supercomputer. Also, if your life points hit zero, you're just sent back to your body and injuries aren't repeated. There are two problems to jacking in, and both are connected to the same thing: your body gets left behind, which means that you're extremely vulnerable and that there's a limit on how many can jack in. (it <i>is</i> possible to remove one person from their console so another person can jack in, but that can shape up to some nasty problems if the wrong person gets devirtualized first.)
<ul>
<li>There is a return trip feature for this supercomputer, but it cannot turn back time indefinately. The amount of time it can go back is determined by the towers. Every time a tower is activated, it "charges time" for as long as it's active. The more charged time the supercomputer stores up, the farther back it can turn time. If multiple towers are activated, the time they charge is added together. For example, if two towers were activated at the exact same time and then were both deactivated five minutes later, ten minutes of charged time would be stored in the computer's memory system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's what I've got for Xanadu. -- <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">Aelita@Lyoko</a> 15:37, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem. It's actually a simple syntax code that installs the graphic. I'll add it to your talk page as a gesture of good will.

For now, I'll just default mine (on the Cheerful setting) onto your page and adjust it for you there. Also, nice work on the story arcs.

<p>Thank you, Jeremie@theLab! It looks great! I'll have to doublecheck the list of wikimood pictures to see which one really is me, but Cheerful works for today! Let's see...we're in September now...any ideas what week, at least, Season 3 comes out? I'm actually thinking next week! Oh, but I won't get to see it - not unless I get impossibly lucky; no cable! Oh, well. That's probably one reason the recaps are there, right? You know, I have never been able to figure out what Odd's problem was with Yumi's shoes when virtualized in <i>A Fine Mess</i>; All I knew was, he walked a couple steps and then fell over!

<dd>Go right on ahead with those recaps. Though, I'm not sure if Season 3 actually hits on September 16th. MoonScoop said that that date was "surprising" because they still have bugs to work out and they also have other shows to do. I am checking CartoonNetwork.com from time to time to see, but now I can't find Code Lyoko <i>anywhere</i> on that site. The 11:30 AM slot on Saturday mornings was usurped by "Squirrel Boy." Now I have to hate that new show forever for picking off CL. And on the mood, you seem more like an "Enthusiastic" to me, but only you know your true mood.

<p>Thanks! I think I saw that episode in January, so I don't exactly trust my memory on it. Heh, that's kind of like when I took a drama class and I got to perform a monologue. I picked one from an Aadams Family movie that was Wednsday in a Thanksgiving play, and I did great! I found out after I finished performing it that even though I had never seen that particular movie, I had done that monologue almost exactly the same way Wednsday did it in the movie!

<p>Sorry, I just pity anyone who doesn't know capitals and cities! Consider this your personal study guide/message. As for California...yes! That will work. Golden Gate Bridge destruction is my forte. Ever since Magneto used the whole bridge as a sky taxi in X-Men 3, I've been itching for more. No earthquakes though. 10.5 tried that and butchered it <i>horribly.</i> So, we can have this whole story set in the area of Foster City and San Mateo, two suburbs of San Francisco. Have Steve and Amy live in the condo blocks in Foster City, while the school, Kenshin and Odd are in San Mateo. Odd can be from Montana, since Montana is probably the most useless state in the union, and it needs a purpose, namely, Odd's homestate. Put his old house like, 250 feet from the Canadian border since <i>no one</i> lives there. Anyway, now that we've set a location I can have some fun. Xanadu and the other virtual reality worlds will be wreaking havoc all over the West Coast and Canada! --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 02:01, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Don't worry about how long it is; I'm planning on waiting until there are 26 different conversations before archiving anything. Are Foster City and San Mateo right next to each other? Because I was thinking of having the gang all drop by Steve's place to visit after Arc 1. BTW, you forgot Lara. I've already decided that her father is practically a millionare and they live in a mansion, so where's the mansion? I've seen X3 in theaters - it was pretty good, and I'd have liked it even better if NightCrawler made a reappearance! (I heard that he was <i>going</i> to show up in X3, but his part was so small that the guy who plays Kurt didn't want to go to all the time and money to do that huge makeup job.)

<dd>Yeah. First time I went to California I actually visited my Dad in Foster City where he was living for a while, since his job took him all around the world for some time. He lived off and on near San Francisco, sometimes in Foster City, other times in San Mateo. Anyway, yes, those two cities are practically neighbors. In fact, let me give you some links. <a href="../../../f/o/s/Foster_City%2C_California_e9d3.html" title="Foster City, California">Foster City, California</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Mateo%2C_California_1f3d.html" title="San Mateo, California">San Mateo, California</a>. As for Lara's mansion, Foster City is quite affluent. She can live on Whaler's Island, the snooty section of the town. That works out. About X3, I enjoyed it too. Dark Phoenix was banging! Did you see how, in two seconds, she converts the bodies of like, 300 National Guard soldiers into dust? That was AWESOME! Like you, I <i>was</i> disappointed that Night Crawler didn't come back. He was awesome in X-Men 2! I mean, they replaced him with Colossus, who didn't do much more than heft a TV and say one line to Wolverine. However, the directors made up for it by including Angel, Shadowcat and <b>BEAST!</b> Beast was one of the four original X-Men in the comic, so I was surprised they didn't have him until now. Did you know that Kelsey Grammer played Beast? I was surprised by that. When I think of Kelsey Grammer, I think of <i>Frasier</i> and <i>Cheers,</i> not action movies. But I loved it when he said "Oh my stars and garters!" And not to mention, Shadowcat sort of makes up for Nightcrawler since she can walk through walls. She was kicking in X3! Though, I didn't understand why she became an X-Man so fast, since every other X-Man is like, 30 or 19 years of age, and she looks 13. But whatever. Yes, the Golden Gate Bridge scene was awesome. When I saw the previews, I thought Magneto was just destroying it for kicks, but when I saw he had a <i>purpose</i> for destroying it, I thought, "Wow, now here's a movie that has graduated from destroy-for-thrills to destroy-for-use." Very innovative. Not to mention, the reactions are priceless. Those Chinese tourists are saying, "Cheese!" and about to snap a photo when the bridge just snaps and flies away. Then those people in the cable car see it floating slowly towards Alcatraz, and the National Guard soldiers just <i>look</i> at it. The ending was sort of sentimental though. I mean, in like two days they've already done half the construction necessary for a carbon-copy of the Golden Gate Bridge. Did they salvage the old one or something? It makes people feel good that we didn't lose the bridge, but let's be realistic. When the Twin Towers fell did we instantly rebuild them? Np, in fact, since we didn't we have the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Tower_a8ea.html" title="Freedom Tower">Freedom Tower</a> coming along. It's big news out here. In the real world, the government would have built a whole new bridge, and would have let the old one come to rest at the bottom of the bay. But anyway! I talk about movies too much! --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 11:09, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>&lt;lol&gt; And <i>I</i> talk about <i>cartoons</i> too much! See? we compliment each other! =D Have you seen the animated TV show <i>X-Men Evolution</i>? Kitty Pryde was fifteen in that, and she was an official X-man. I think she was the youngest in that, too. X2 was my favorite of the three X-Men movies, simply because Night Crawler was in it! (Yeah, he's my favorite; he's blue, he has a German accent, and a tail, and the animated version was so funny!) BTW, about the supercomputer that houses Xanadu: it's in a four-story house (three floors above ground, one below) that looks, as Odd said when he first saw it, "condemned before it was even built!" And it was, actually; the builders designed it that way to discourage unauthorized guests. Where should this house be? We need someplace fairly isolated, yet everybody can get there on foot if needs be. Is there anyplace that fits the bill? Oh, and another thing - you've read my rundown about Xanadu, right? If you need descriptions of what the gang looks like when virtualized and jacked-in (their V-keys and A-keys), this is what I've figured out in order of recieving them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steve: V-key outfit looks like the typical outfit in <i>The Matrix</i>, complete with sunglasses shaped like his glasses. A-key looks like the <i>Ben 10</i> alien <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnitrix.html#Grey_Matter" title="Omnitrix">Grey Matter</a>, only almost as big as he normally is.</li>
<li>Amy: V-key outfit looks like a costume for an African tribal princess (I think you can figure out what that would look like - modest though). A-key bears strong resemblance to Storm in a pink-and-white suit.</li>
<li>Lara: V-key outfit is a green shirt, brown shorts and backpack, and heavy-duty boots. A-key has pure white skin, light blue hair, deep blue eyes and a floaty silver-blue and white tunic (what she imagined a princess of Atlantis would look like!).</li>
<li>Kenshin: V-key outfit is a set of samurai robes. A-key is a <i>yokuryū</i> (Japanese winged dragon) done up in five colors; red, yellow, black, white and cyan. He can change the cyan to blue or green at will.</li>
<li>Odd: V-key outfit is a gangster look; jeans with ripped knees, boots, flashy belt, black shirt with the sleeves ripped off, a gold chain with a pendant (what do you know, it's a cat's face) gold dangle earrings that look like claws, a spiky collar and bracelets (have you seen these?), tattoos down both arms (left arm has a chain wrapped around it, right arm has silhouettes of cats) and a baseball cap with a razor-edged bill (it's not red, but I don't know what color it <i>is</i>). A-key is a cat that can walk on its hind legs with three colors in its fur (dark brown, light brown and white) and a collar. (and he still has the earrings from his V-key) his hair turns light brown and is a little over twice as long as his fur, and his left eye turns red! (his right eye stays blue)</li>
</ul>
<p>Steve's dad designs all of their V-keys except for Odd's (who didn't get there until after he disappeared). The A-keys were designed by the subconcious of the ones who recieved them (getting assimilated and designing the A-keys happen simultaneously)! K9's tapping her foot, so I'd better go. Later! -- <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">Aelita@Lyoko</a> 20:22, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good ideas! I like the descriptions for your virtual characters. I'm guessing that this means that Steve, instead of being mere operator, come into the worlds. Awesome. As for the location of the Xanadu housing unit...all right, since half the kids live in Foster and the other half in San Mateo, the house should be in between both cities. Have it on the San Mateo side of the border, but only 50 feet from Foster City limits, on a side street off of a big avenue. It can be nestled between some abandonned warehouses or something. Btw, I did see X-Men Evolution...one episode. I didn't really watch it, since I didn't like X-Men until the movies came out. My favorite X-Men movie was X-3.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Great ideas! Steve does go to the virtual worlds, but 2 through 5, he never sets foot in the scanners (arc 5, he doesn't even jack in). The only reason he still jacks in for arcs 2 through 4 is because for some reason he's the only one who can deactivate the towers. Sadly, the fact that he takes that duty on himself alone is the reason that he gets possessed; deactivating towers weakens his mental resistance to the virus, and he had very little physical resistance to balance. Arc 6 balances this out a little more, though: everyone else can deactivate towers, and the gym teacher knows how to use the supercomputer so Steve gets virtualized now and then (he still doesn't virtualize much, as he has no experience in dealing with the monsters and the gym teacher isn't confident in his usage of the recovery program). Steve's dad didn't design any of their V-keys with weapons, so Steve supplied all of those:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Kenshin - saber</li>
<li>Amy - bow/arrows</li>
<li>Lara - pistols, plus he can virtualize a rifle for her</li>
<li>Odd not only has his razor-billed cap for distance attacks, but he also has a switchblade for close quarters</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are other weapons for their A-keys, and a special setting for both, but I'll have to tell you about those tomorrow. -- <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">Aelita@Lyoko</a> 03:45, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks! Here's what I've got figured out for their A-key abilities:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Amy can fly (just thinks <i>fly!</i> and she's off) and throw bolts of rainbow energy (what color depends on what she wants to do).</li>
<li>Kenshin can also fly (much faster and longer than Amy can, but his flight is manual as opposed to her auto) and can reflect lasers off his scales. (out of all six Laser colors the Xanadu monsters can use, violet is the only one he can't reflect) He has bladed wings, sharp claws and teeth and short horns for close quarters combat, and can throw a violet pulse from his mouth that looks like the Blue-Eyes White Dragon's White Lightning attack for distance strikes.</li>
<li>Lara can control the virtual water and make it do whatever she wants. She can also generate crystal (liquid or solid - both have advantages). With a great deal of focus, she can become crystal. This maneuver reduces her speed, but gives her the ability to focus all colors of Laser attacks right through her without affecting her in any way. As for the six Impact attacks (different from Lasers in that they can't be reflected) three of them have no effect at all, and two (cyan and blue) make her stronger. Only a violet Impact attack can hurt her in full crystal. While crystallized she can restore her friends' life points.</li>
<li>Odd can climb any surface with his claws, fire missiles from his mouth (he calls them Fang Darts, and he has 30 of them at a time) and clone himself. The clones have all of his abilities except cloning, and look more like real cats than he does (if a real cat was 100%, Odd would be about 75%) and it takes him 11 life points to make one (one to make the cat, the other 10 for the cat's life points). This means that he can make up to nine at a time, leaving himself with only one life point. By fusing with the cats he can regain his life points and he gets more Fang Darts. Odd keeps in touch with his clones by a kind of telepathy. His cats stay virtualized even if Odd is destroyed as long as he stays in the console, and he can still control them. He also has the ability to turn invisible (and loves imitating the Sheshire Cat!).</li>
<li>Steve doesn't have very many abilities at first; their A-keys also need to be upgraded by the supercomputer in order to get weapons, but they have to be jacked in and Steve is the only one who can really use the computer. He can climb on any surface (even upside down) and is incredibly agile. During Arc 6 he gets some new abilities, but I haven't figured out what.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The special setting is basically being, as atheletes call it, "in the zone." This is using the abilities of the A-key when virtualized. Steve doesn't figure out how to do this until Arc 6 is nearly over, but the others accomplish this (Lara figures it out first by suddenly crystallizing when she had virtualized). Reaching this point is impossibly hard the first time, but once they do it gives them some new abilities; for example, when Amy gets the hang of being "in the zone" she gains atmokenesis. This can also have interesting side effects on them when they aren't even in the virtual worlds... -- <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">Aelita@Lyoko</a> 23:15, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm in Physics, so I should know what "atmokenisis" means, but I don't! What is it? Nice ideas by the way! We are going to have so much fun with this! Btw, what's back to school like? I noticed it's September 14, 3 days after school starts for you.

<dl>
<dd>&lt;lol&gt; I don't think it would be in Physics, since it's fictional. But to answer your question, Storm has atmokenesis - mentally effecting the weather! Back to school? It's not so bad. One of the classes I have I only selected because a friend of mine was taking it, but the teacher hands out candy every now and then so it's great anyway! Plus, that friend was taking another class that I was and I didn't even realize it! BTW...I've been thinking that Kenshin's new ability is something that Odd has in Code Lyoko first season. You know? Something else to keep in mind about Kenshin - he hates flying and says so every time he takes off. Is there a way to make a picture of your own on Wiki? I'd love to show you a picture of what Xanadu looks like so I don't have to spell it out, but my email is resricted, there's no scanner over here and I wouldn't know how to use it even if there was. -- <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">Aelita@Lyoko</a> 20:27, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, thanks for clearing that up. As for images, you have to upload them. That basically means scan them into your computer, then upload them onto Wikipedia using the upload form. Now, I've never done this and recent changes patrollers hold juristiction to terminate images they deem "unnecessary." Not that this will help you without a scanner, but if you want to send me pics check out <a href="../../../d/e/v/DeviantART_5bd3.html" title="DeviantART">deviantART</a>. By the way, I wanted to ask you this. What denomination of Christianity are you in?

<dd>Episco-what? I'm just a follower of Jesus Christ. If there are different versions of the same belief, I sure don't know anything about them! Anyway, as long as we're talking about religion, Steve is actually a Christian. In one of your conversations with Angie Y, either you or she said that Jeremie was probably an aethiest because you could imagine him giving ten reasons why God doesn't exist. Steve is devoted to God, but knows about the stereotype thing so he's hesitant about sharing his religious belief. Amy knows, or at least suspects, and is a Christian herself. Kenshin wasn't a Christian at first, but I don't know what he was. It took a while before he shifted gears (beginning of Arc 4, part of the reason he was having trouble at home). Neither Odd nor Lara put much faith in any religion at first, but Amy succeeded in converting Lara (don't know when). Odd decided to become a Christian all on his own in the last chapter of Arc 5, after being released from Xanadu. -- <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">Aelita@Lyoko</a> 20:27, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Episcopalian. It's basically a Protestant sect, an estranged part of the Anglican Communiun that puts a good degree of emphasis on organ or instrumental music during a service. The churches are usually simple. It was recently wracked and split 60-40 over a big scandal involving what I am <i>quite</i> sure is a direct infraction of Scripture. But if you just follow Jesus that is the <i>best,</i> mark my words <i>best</i> type of Christian to be. You're not corrupted by the politics, scandals or events. Not to mention, there's a lot of bad blood between some sects and others, often causing fights and pain. Then there are the Fundamentalists who are just flushing the whole point of our faith down the john. You're not just lucky, you are <i>blessed</i> not to be free of this. I'd like to be in your position, just following Christ and not concerned over politics. That's probably what original Christianity was. Keep going strong there. As for the fanfic, didn't know we were planning for religion! A totally Christian group, nice! Just make Kenshin a former <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinto.html" title="Shinto">Shinto Adherent</a>.

<dd>That still doesn't make much sense. Ah, well, each to his own, I guess. If I had my way, I'd only get involved in politics if I really <i>had</i> to. Yeah, the religion thing doesn't really come up much. Steve mentions that he's including something or other in his prayers (which he's very diligent about), Amy sings praises when she's <i>really</i> happy about something, that kind of thing. Sometimes when things are getting bad (or could get really bad), Steve sort of informally begs Jesus to let everything work out ok. At one point, Odd is about to do something insanely risky and he tells Steve, "You're a praying boy, right?...Well, pray that I survive this one." And Steve prays, all right! Odd makes it out of that one in one piece - barely. &lt;lol&gt; Anyway, that's something else you could keep in mind when coming up with ideas. Speaking of which, anything new? If so, start a new conversation; this one's getting very long. -- <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">Aelita@Lyoko</a> 03:26, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S. that's a good idea, what Kenshin is for Arcs 1-3; it really fits with what I'd already decided (he knows most of the old stories about the Japanese mythical entities, that kind of thing). Plus, his first language is Japanese; he can speak English very well, but his accent tends to show which language he knew first and he speaks a little of his native tongue around his friends (hello, goodbye, that kind of thing).</dd>

<p>I'm sorry, Jeremie; I talk like I'm pretty obsessed with my Xanadu story, don't I? I don't mean to be. You can go ahead and take your time coming up with ideas for the story arcs. I've already figured out how Arc 1 ends, and if you think that some details could use changing you could toss a few suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graduation ceremony, especially celebrating the 6th grade (going into Junior High), the 8th grade (Steve's grade; going into High School), and 12th grade (graduating). Steve steps forward to recieve his certificate (highest honors for his grade) and looks around at the audience, at the place where his dad had promised he would be. All he sees is an empty seat, which he stares at through the entire ceremony. The gang investigates, only to discover that Steve's dad has vanished. Steve thinks that his dad went to Xanadu on a mission, so he, Amy and Kenshin jack in to check (Lara's at home with her family; her parents were throwing a party for her because her grades made the top ten). They encounter monsters within two minutes of jacking in and Amy, Steve, and Kenshin were devirtualized, in that order (and Amy and Steve in quick succession of each other). This confirms Steve's fears that something had happened to his dad, but he's sure that his dad is alive and says that he would find him. Amy says that they would help, and may God grant them victory! (Kenshin looks uncomfortable at this, but says that he would help)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's where it ends; and like I said, you can take your time in helping me get there. I don't want to sound like this story is all I care about, because it isn't. I'd love to hear about what kind of things you're up to over there in Conneticut. You know, as soon as I've graduated and have enough money coming in for a vacation, I'd like to come visit you. You could even come visit me someday, if you want...just tell me <i>when</i> to start shadowing <i>which</i> airport! &lt;lol&gt; -- <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">Aelita@Lyoko</a> 03:17, 19 September 2006 (UTC) P.S.

<dd>As much as I'd like to meet you some day, I've been strictly blamed by my parents and doctor to not do that sort of thing until I learn self-defense. Self-protection and all that stuff, since a lot of <i>bad</i> stuff happens to people who meet based off online meetings (remember MySpace?). After all, I'm quite confident that you are completely honest, but I have no way of knowing. I could easily be a 40-year old sexual predator living in Montana as much as you could be an online grifter or a member of a Peruvian Child Slavery Ring. Of course, I'm not and you're not, but you know as little about me as I know about you. Elaborate forgeries are commonplace on the Internet, and you can say whatever you want about yourself. Do I sound derogatory? Sorry, it's just online safety stuff. I'm sure you can relate to that with your parents and all. Let's save "meeting" for a while, after all, you are older than me by a year and that puts me at a disadvantage. You wan't to meet? Fine, but not now. I could send you a picture over the email if you want me to, and you could do the same of you and K9-LVR. Visual confirmation always helps, but isn't all the way there. I still feel queasy about meeting people from online in real life.</dd>

<dd>Okay, public service announcement out of the way. You don't have to worry about being OCD on this story of yours. I actually enjoy tons of messages everyday about it. I just love it when I log in and I see the "You have new messages" bar. Good ideas on the Arc Finale! I'm going to have to think of the middle core, not easy when you do homework every waking hour of the afternoon. But that's okay, I'll think of something. As for updates from the East Coast, Wikipedia thrives out here. It's funny. I've suceeded in converting three kids at my school to Wikipedia, one of whom I'm waiting for a message from tonight if he can sign on. That's more converts than I've made to my own religion! (0)&#160;:}. Quite a few of my buddies on this site actually go to my school. Um...I mowed the lawn today...did a lot of homework...got on to Wikipedia...ate. That's actually my day-to-day existance. The only shakeup occurs when I watch "Evening Infotainment with <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katie_Couric_f7e1.html" title="Katie Couric">Katie Couric</a>" (not the real title, "CBS Evening News with Katie Couric", but I just call it that because it is about 50% real news and 50% reasonably entertaining stories about the Missouri State Fair or world's oldest woman). They actually had a funny graphic on tonight concerning elections in Missouri. It showed a Republican Elephant icon plodding destructively and sloppily across the whole state, while the Democrat Donkey icon galloped gracefully. Donkeys don't gallop! And Elephants don't walk around drunkedly! You can tell where CBS' political affiliations lie. But I can't hold much against CBS. It was them who stopped Joseph McCarthy in his tracks. Um...I'm listening to a really good <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Day_5412.html" title="Green Day">Green Day</a> song right now on my computer called <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_of_Suburbia_5eff.html" title="Jesus of Suburbia">Jesus of Suburbia</a>. It's an awesome 5-part rock opera. Election season is heating up out here. Our representatives (Nancy Johnson, Joe Courtney, Ned Lamont, etc) are starting to throat-grapple with attack ads. Fun FUn Fun! How is it California? Who are your representatives attacking each other? And, I've been wanting to ask this. If you and K9 are both largely German, do you two have those funny-sounding accents that are constantly spoofed? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 01:39, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I put the Season 3 box in, but Someguy removed it (being his usual stubborn self). I put the first episode back in however, with its English name as CN's now confirmed what it is: Straight to Heart, and its US air date of 4th October. Now seriously, what a crappy name. It'll always be called Right to the Heart in my eyes.&#160;:p ~<a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EINVERTED_f7b3.html" title="User:INVERTED">iNVERTED | Rob</a> (<a href="../../../i/n/v/User_talk%7EINVERTED_8c16.html" title="User talk:INVERTED">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_INVERTED_917a.html" title="Special:Contributions/INVERTED">Contribs</a>) 06:44, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for reminding me of just how little we really <i>know</i> about each other. I don't remember MySpace, I've never been there, but waiting does sound like a good idea. It would probably take a few years for me to earn enough money to take a trip across the country by myself, anyway (since I have yet to get a job and driver's licence), and by then we should have emailed pictures of ourselves to each other. (this restricted email thing is getting to be a drag.) Btw, Mom told me another reason why I have restricted access to the internet: "You girls spend too much time online already! What would happen if I let you have full access?" &lt;lol&gt; I'm worse at that than K9 is. And to get to your question about the accents...I think that those big-deal accents are people who spoke German and English with equal fluency since they first learned to talk, or something like that. About the only language K9 and I can speak really well is English (we both know a little Spanish, but I highly doubt we could hold a conversation with it). I can mimic just about any voice I want to, though. That's what I'm doing when I tell stories and I've gotten to a diologue part. Let's see...the only thing I really know about government-wise is that Arnold has competition for the governor's chair. Franz Hopper says that it's a choice between bad and worse, and that he's voting for Arnold (my dad's a Republican - he just doesn't agree with everything Arnold says). I can't even remember who the other guy is - just that most of the commercials say that he would drag the country's economy backwards. If the commercials are telling the truth about him, I'd agree with Franz. Another thing to thank you for: telling me that I'm <i>not</i> starting to get boring. I worry about that sometimes - I just go on and on. Hey! So <i>that's</i> when season 3 starts! I was beginning to wonder when they would confirm that. Thanks, INVERTED. <a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko">Aelita@Lyoko</a> 20:45, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>P.S. What's OCD?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OCD means "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder" it's a mental schtick that makes people start obsessing over one thing in particular. You don't have it, trust me. And a tip of the cap to you Rob, for telling us when Season 3 hits. That's perfect! It hits just 2 days before Season 3 of Battlestar Galactica (my <i>other</i> show that I obsess over). That'll be a Red Letter Week! Although knowing my luck, I'll have a mountain of homework on both days. I'm listening to a really good song by Marilyn Manson right now that is the theme for the Resident: Evil movies. I love the Resident Evil movies. Horror...zombies...corporate sabotage. What more could you ask for? My Dad says the movies suck because they are based off of videogames, but I find them awesome. They're not even that scary, just haunting. I love mild horror movies...(gets lost in the song). <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab"><b><span style="background:#009;color:#fff">&#160;Jer<span style="background:#f00">emie</span></span></b></a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJeremie%40theLab_fde1.html" title="User talk:Jeremie@theLab"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab&#160;</span></a></dd>

Even though I can't watch it until the magical day when it comes out on DVD, I can't stand the suspense waiting for other people to be able to watch it so those recaps can be written! Hey, I just thought of something - for cable boxes, there's that menu thing that you can scroll up and down to see what's on the different channels, you can also scroll across to see when something is on at a different time (that's how I first found Code Lyoko)!

<p>Yeah, life is taking a toll on me. Homework, research, responsibilites, Wikipedia, etc etc etc. My only reprieve is talking to you all on this sight and my own mind! Yes, my life has gotten in the way of me thinking about Xanadu. Sorry! But, I encourage you to think for yourself a little bit in order to cultivate that obvious talent of yours. As for quotes from the episodes, that usually happens when I see the episodes on rerun. I like to enjoy them the first time through and then analyze them on the second. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 02:48, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Makes sense. I would have guessed that the quotes were chosen by watching the episode, waiting a few days and then if there's a line or two that you still remember really well you write that. Part of the reason I was desperate for your help on Xanadu was because I can see what kinds of excitement can take place in every other arc - but not the first one! But, let's see what I can do. I'd better wait until the weekend before I even try to come up with any Arc 1 ideas, though - I still have homework, after all! Which I'm making slow and steady progress on, by the way, but keep praying. I'll keep you and your black holes in my prayers, too. --<span style="background:#fcc;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;"><a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><b style="color:black;">Aelita@Lyoko</b></a></span> 02:57, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, I know. What can I say? Mom has a new rule around the house: finish all the homework you have planned out for each day and she'll let us have internet time. Then she reinforces that rule by leaving herself logged on (and her screensaver has a password that I don't know) <i>all day!</i> :( Even with that, I could probably have gotten internet time except I'm still trying to figure out what does and doesn't work in my schedule. And so, I'd get almost everything done, and then it's too late to finish and still get time. Even harder, this week it's my turn to do the after-dinner chores. So, sorry about the absence; next week, I'll plan better.</p>

<li>2) She wanted to see me showing more...how had she said it?...I think it was, "responsibility."</li>
</ul>

<dd>I asked if that meant getting my schedule under control and she said yes. So, definately not this week. Next week, we'll see.

<dd>Awesome! It's great to see you and K-9 back on. I was wondering if you had gotten banned or grounded or shipped off to boarding school in Switzerland or whatever! I used to have organization/planning problems as well, so I've been working on those. Here's my daily schedule: Wake up with alarm, shower, breakfast, Wikipedia (if 10 minutes to spare), school, clubs and/or homework until dinner, wash dinner dishes, homework until 9:30, Wikipedia until 10:00, bed. Maybe that could give you some guidlines for your schedule. And I am looking forward to that email! But I'll need your address first, or else my dysfunctional account will immediately forward it to the nonexistant "suspect email box." I'll get my Dad to fix that tonightish.

<dd>I told K9 to let me tell you about our day at Six Flags. We had to do three sketches of animals for our art class (which we actually might have to drop due to missing assignments), and then we got to go ride roller coasters! We only got to ride two, though; it's a strange phenomenon - lines for rides are longer on the weekends. The first ride was <i>Medusa</i> (one of my favorites, flips upside-down a lot), and the second was a 3D theater ride...the same theater that was doing Stargate SG 3000 last time we went on it. This time, it was a haunted mine for halloween, and they actually handed out 3D glasses for it! One thing I'm probably never going to forget is how we got five minutes taken off our wait in line. See, there was this group of people just in front of us who all wanted to go together, and there were two pairs of glasses left. So the lady handing them out called out to the line, "Group of two?...Group of two?" It didn't take long to figure out what she was talking about, and I just raised my hand with K9 just after me. It was loads of fun, really, but... When I saw the sign for it, I thought, "Oh, I've seen all three <i>Indiana Jones</i> movies, I've been on the ride for those movies in Disneyland countless times, how scary could this be?" How scary?...I couldn't even scream. --<span style="background:#fcc;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;"><a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><b style="color:black;">Aelita@Lyoko</b></a></span> 04:50, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, my Code: FF thing was written at 12:00 AM because I didn't want to sleep and had nothing to do. I probably should fix it up...you sort of have to understand USA history to get parts of it though. Your theme park day sounds AWESOME! My local Six Flags would be <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Flags_New_England_d920.html" title="Six Flags New England">Six Flags New England</a>, but I prefer <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Compounce_94d5.html" title="Lake Compounce">Lake Compounce</a> to SF. If you ever come out here, I <i>will</i> take you to The Lake! So, when you say you can't scream, does that mean it was so scary you could not even speak, or it was just a crappy gimmick? I've also been to California Adventure. Awesome park! My favorite ride was the 3-D sky tour of the state. And thanks for your address! I must make preparations for my message! I'll send some pictures, and I'll add you to my list of contacts so your messages don't get sucked up by my vacuum of a security network. Boy, life <i>is</i> strange. In the last weeks since we had no contact I've had two dreams about meeting you! The first was in your house on a nice cul-de-sac in California and I met your parents (who acted like control freaks) and you and I did stuff together on line. The next dream came one night later when my school and your school set up a correspondence program so that students from each could meet each other. You and K-9 were both flying out to Connecticut to the rendezvous point at <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystic_Seaport_acb6.html" title="Mystic Seaport">Mystic Seaport</a> and my pal <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShogoFan3000_a9dd.html" title="User:ShogoFan3000">ShogoFan3000</a> and I messed with the Seaport's lighting system so that it would give you and K-9 a red-carpet style welcome with fireworks, strobes and everything. I suppose that subconsciously, I really want to meet you two. But first, it must be e-mail correspondence before the face-to-face! Here, why don't I send you a vanguard email with a short message.

<dd>Are you <i>serious?!?</i> I've been imagining what it would be like to meet you face-to-face since I first started talking with you! Mostly, my daydreams about that have been at the airport; you know, when we first see each other. Like, I'm at the airport in my pink hoodie waiting for the flight from the East Coast to unload. Then I see you, smile, and say, "Hi, welcome to Lyoko!" (Get it? my username has Lyoko in it - K9 says that it's lame) I've several ideas for the alternative, and I don't like any of them much. Yours are neat! I'd better email you first, though, before you send me anything - I really don't think it would make it through unless your adress were in my book, and the decision for that is still pending. (I'm not sure I've got that debate thing right - I mean that Mom hasn't decided.) Btw, the Haunted Mine? It was <i>definitely</i> scary! The only time I actually closed my eyes was when this other car rocketed down the rails right towards us and - <b>Aaagh!!!</b> I do <i>not</i> like things coming at my head! K9 and I were both down in the front row, too! Oh, and another thing - last thing, K9 says - I'd been thinking about Odd's V-key for my Xanadu thing, and the renaissance fair gave me an idea for a better key than what I'd decided before. Instead of a gangster, Odd's a jester! Gotta go - we'll talk later. --<span style="background:#fcc;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;"><a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><b style="color:black;">Aelita@Lyoko</b></a></span> 02:49, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you've had daydreams too! I've been having them as well. Last night after I left you a message, I had to walk the dog. As I rounded the block, I just kept <i>thinking</i> about meeting you and K-9. My fantasies consisted of me actually <i>being</i> in line for Medusa at Six Flags Marine World while on vacation or something like that, and then you two walk up behind me. I just peak and (based on your physical descriptions on your userpages) I automatically recognize you and K-9. It is sealed when you say something to the extent of, "(K-9's real name), when we get home, I can't <i>wait</i> to get online." K-9 says, "Why, to finish your government project from two weeks ago," You say, "No, to talk to Jeremie!" It is at that point that I do one of several things, 1) I just sort of nervously peak around and ask the Bill Engval-style dumb question, "so, you two riding the roller coaster?" and lead up to it from there. 2) I say "Code: SCIPIO" out of the corner of my mouth and you begin questioning me. 3) I whirl around immediately with a dumb grin on my face and say, "Hello Aelita and K-9, Jeremie@theLab at your service," complete with the egalitarian bow, and successfully leave you two dumbfounded or freaked out. I also imagined meeting you at <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradley_International_Airport_9e05.html" title="Bradley International Airport">Bradley International Airport</a>, you come out of the gate, past the McDonalds/CBS News store in the terminal, through security and I am holding a large sign (or sandwich-board) that says "Code: SCIPIO," and you identify me from that. I wouldn't be in a gray hoodie at that point, since my mom is going to throw it out because it is getting holes from the acid I encounter in Chemistry class. I have another hoodie coming, however. And <i>oops</i> about the email, since I already sent it. I thought the address-hand off was the green light. Sorry! But, I added your address to my list of contacts so my account <i>should</i> allow your messages in (I pray). Send me the note at <b>kevin.s.lee@adelphia.net</b>. And about Odd, Jester actually sounds much better than gangster, the gang thing made Odd sound sort of like a wannabe ghetto-boy, not too flattering. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab"><b><span style="background:#009;color:#fff"> Jer<span style="background:#f00">emie</span></span></b></a> <a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJeremie%40theLab_fde1.html" title="User talk:Jeremie@theLab"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab </span></a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>Like a what? Never mind, if it isn't flattering I probably don't want to know. Odd really is more like a jester than like a gangster, even though he can fight like one (the stuff you learn from too much TV). He's not the one who tosses the idea of a jester to Steve, though; it's Lara's idea, because he reminds her of a clown she saw in a circus once. Steve agrees because he knows that if Odd doesn't like it they can always scrap it and make a different look. As it turns out, Odd falls in love with it and in a very short while Lara is sorry she ever said anything. (Odd's cap has bells and he won't stop jingling them) And, about the address hand-off: I wish it was! Like I said, still pending. Although...my schoolwork for this week is practically finished, so I might just ask again. The answer might be different this time. That "in line for Medusa" thing sounds so crazy it could actually happen someday...although, Franz Hopper is teaching government and he would <i>never</i> let me get two weeks behind on an assignment. Art, maybe, or even bible. Oh, and I just don't identify with the "Code: SCIPIO" thing - I mean, in the episodes I saw he only called it up twice, and I wasn't really paying attention to what Jeremie was doing either time. Responses 1 and 3 are your best bets. I probably would "freak out" if I realized that someone I knew was right in front of me!</dd>

<dd>Ooops! Didn't notice that I hadn't left a response to this, which is strange because I thought I had. Well, anyway, Season 3 was amazing, and if you ever score the box set of DVDs, RELISH THE OPPORTUNITY! Recaps cannot hold a candle to the actual episodes. The creators are amazing, they took what was a crappy plot in Tidal Wave and turned it into a reasonably great episode! Well, I read up on your progress and that last name sits well with me. I have seen a couple episodes of Extreme Home Make-over, but I don't see it that often. Those guys are amazing though. My favorite episode was, I don't know if you saw it, they re-did the home of "Sweet Alice" from Watts, CA. Touching, especially when they do some great deeds for the flooded community and the neighborhood kids come and voluntarily help. And yes, Ty is insane. Last time I saw that, my Dad passed the channel because he thinks the crew is insane for demolishing the house they have to save. The last straw for him was when someone in the gutted living room asked for a wheelbarrow and another worker outside chucked it through the window. This is all while the family is watching from a DVD in a luxury hotel, mind you. But it is always funny to see them destroy the house and stand outside before demolition, holding up their tools and screaming like Viking raiders before descending on the helpless dwelling.

<dd>No, unfortunately! I think Season 4 comes out in early 2007. However, I am just as excited as you for the new uniforms! Especially Aelita's. Her new outfit looks stunning. And I understand why your brothers go insane for demolition. That's such a guy thing. And I never saw the episode of which you speak. Funny predicament though! I think global warming is kicking in...seriously! It's November and out here it is 60 F. 60 F! It is never 60 F this late in the year! Speaking of global warming and all the great political problems that brings up, how's the California scene after Election Day? I know Arnold is back in Sacramento, but did your congressmen get shaken up? Out here, we hung on to Joe Lieberman at least. But Rob Simmons lost to Joe Courtney. That's bad, because, although I will give the benefit of the doubt, Courtney wouldn't know what to do if the Pentagon decides to try and close our state submarine base again. It's all because of Virginia trying to consolidate all submarine manufacture in their state, which is tactically dumb in case of war. I think we should saw Virginia off the United States and let it sink...it hasn't done anything since the Civil War, where it betrayed us!

<p>Whoa! Hi! I had some extra credit homework involving who had what office over here in CA, but I don't really know how the canidates reacted. Franz Hopper explained a little about what was happening over there about Lieberman, and I thought it was a clever way to stay in the race! But...I don't like politics very much (some stuff is worth the laugh, though). Aelita's outfit looks stunning? &lt;sigh&gt; can you describe her? Odd and Ulrich both have descriptions on their pages about what they look like now, but the last time I checked neither girl's page said more than that they had new outfits. It's so annoying; I can't get online to see the pictures that do exist! --<span style="background:#fcc;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;"><a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><b style="color:black;">Aelita@Lyoko</b></a></span> 05:12, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Aelita is still pink, but she has gigantic boots and (antigravity?) pink and white skinsuit with a triangle in the middle. Yumi looks like a combination of her past geisha costume and a Borg. That's what the new costumes looked like as far as I could tell. And yeah, Lieberman's switch to Independent was awesome. Connecticut is now a Yellow state! (yellow being the "official" color of Independents, just like Republicans have red and Democrats have blue). Lieberman was the smartest choice, since he is the key swing vote between Democrats and Republicans and, with that swing vote, Connecticut wins either way. MY STATE IS GOING TO GET SO MUCH PORK IT WILL BE AWESOME! Happy Thanksgiving!

<dd>Sounds like Aelita's outfit makes her look physically capable of taking on a Tarantula all by herself. As for Yumi's...I can actually imagine what that looks like, sorta. Let's see, Ulrich has two swords instead of one, does that mean that everyone else has new&amp;improved weapons? Oh, and Sean Gorter offered to modify my signature so it would be flashier and have more colors in it. In honor of Aelita's new look, I'm going to take him up on that! One more thing; I've modified my Xanadian kids' A-keys a little. Steve and Kenshin are the same, but Lara always looks crystallized (part solid crystal, part liquid), Amy has true black skin as opposed to umber and a bright orange leotard, and Odd's fur isn't brown (I'm not sure what color it is yet, but it <i>is</i> outlandish for a cat and it <i>isn't</i> purple). --<span style="background:#fcc;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;"><a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><b style="color:black;">Aelita@Lyoko</b></a></span> 23:02, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I saw <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casino_Royale_%282006_film%29_af91.html" title="Casino Royale (2006 film)">the new James Bond movie</a> today. Holy crap that was awesome! The new Bond they've hired is probably the best yet. He out-Connereys Connerey at Bond! The camera work, blending and action was enough to get your adrenaline pumping so hard you would have headaches by the end of an action sequence where Bond saves an Airbus prototype or shoots up an African embassy. I hope you and K-9 had a great Turkey Day. I had the best Turkey of my life (the brining technique my relatives employed was superb) and, thanks to Trytophan, I had a great sleep!

So for tonight only, I have unrestricted access to the Internet as long as I don't go to porn sites or whatever. I've already finished with what I need to do, so now I'm off to see for myself what the gang looks like now! Oh, and Sean finished my sig.

<dd>WOW! NICE COLORS! That sig is actually better than mine! It looks almost exactly like the Cream Savers logo. And that's cool that you go unrestricted access for one night! How did you enjoy freedom, aside from all the thrills of seeing the gang and Garage Kids? As for Season 1 voices and all that, Jeremie and Odd sound almost nothing like they did in the pilot. The pilot is a very badly translated (hence lines like, "I go" and "No wait to come back later") and very French. Since the creators knew they were releasing this in the United States and they didn't want it to be a comedy, they cut the accents. Incidentally, the pilot is also the only time they've ever used the line "Oh my God" ever. My relatives left today, so Thanksgiving is officially over.

<p>I would never have noticed that! That is either a coincidence...or Ian Fleming was a genius.

<dd>Thanks for the compliment! I've asked Sean to change the letters blue, because Aelita's new outfit has blue. Besides, that's my favorite color. Of the three quotes you mentioned, I don't recognize the third one at all. I sort of remember the second quote (Yumi said it, right?). If I remember what the page GK has here on Wiki, it was never intended to be released on TV, so the quality wasn't surprising. As for the freedom, superb! I only really checked out websites that were related to Code Lyoko, though. The official site had cool backgrounds for desktop themes; if I had been thinking straight, I probably would have downloaded one for my own use. I looked through some of the screenshots, and they were great!...although there was one of Ulrich's and Odd's room that surprised me (see, I didn't remember their room being that clean!). While Mom was driving me home from guitar practice, she asked me what I wanted for Christmas. My answer? "Jeremie@theLab's email address on my list." &lt;lol&gt; I really am looking forward to Christmas, and to finally being able to get email from you. What <i>do</i> you look like? I have a kind of description on my page, so you know the basics of what I look like, but all I know about you is that you don't have blond hair (which doesn't help my imagination any). Oh, and next Monday is the last class day we'll have over here until next semester, so I'll probably be able to get on more!

<p>Someone's happy today! I noticed the "Runaway" marker on your WikiMood! What happened? It's great that you can get on more! I'm looking forward to that. I get out for Christmas break in a week and one day, so that won't be bad at all and we can talk a lot just like we did back in the days you first got on! And I'm flattered to think <i>I</i> am the subject of your Christmas gift request! I'm making up a Christmas list now, and it involves getting a lot of science fiction books, quantum physics manual, a United States History factbook and a cell phone. It all must sound terribly boring, but that's what I'd like to open for Christmas this year.</p>
<p>So, a description is what you'd like? Very well. A photograph (or a face-to-face meeting!) would be even better, but here goes:</p>
<p>I have brown hair that is medium length, coming down to the neck at this point (I regularly boycott the barber). You could say I have a quasi-mullet, or a cross between your short hair and K-9's long hair.</p>
<p>I have glasses that have, on NUMEROUS occassions earned me the nickname "Harry Potter" from everyone, from fellow students to a random FedEx delivery woman.</p>
<p>I have blue eyes</p>
<p>I had acne for a while when you and I first started talking, but I've been fighting it back with acid pads for a while now, so I look much better around the cheeks.</p>
<p>I'm caucasian (if that makes any difference...I personally think it doesn't)</p>
<p>My teeth are much healthier than they were, but are fettered by braces (currently dressed up in Christmas colors)</p>
<p>That's what I've got on myself, so I hope I didn't destroy your dreams of how I look. If you need a reference, look at a picture of Harry Potter and that will give you the <i>roughest</i> pictoral representation of how I look. The quote you didn't recognize was said by Odd when the XANA-ish ghosts blew out of Jeremie's laptop while the gang was on top of the school's roof (a location which has puzzled critics to this day). When the ghosts burst out, Odd said, "Oh my God, what's that again?" The "what's that again?" part doesn't make sense, since this has to be the first time Odd has seen XANA-ish ghosts. The second quote was said by Yumi. And I'm glad you got and enjoyed Internet freedom! Keep it up and you may get full access one day! Oh, btw, the crew has started voicing Season 4!

<dd>Hmmm. I can picture that. I've seen Harry Potter before, and I think he's kind of cute. As for my Wikimood, I was waiting for someone to ask me about that! On Wednsday, Mom and Dad had a change of heart about the Internet access K9 and I had, so they changed it! Now, the only sites I can <i>never</i> visit are the ones I wouldn't want to see anyway! K9 found a game for Code Lyoko on a Cartoon Network site, and the first time <i>I</i> tried to play it, I won without having to start over! Plus, did you notice the new userbox on my page? Last Saturday I got to watch Stargate Atlantis! (I couldn't believe it has been on Fox at 4:00 pm all this time and I never knew it!) Oh, and about the email thing. Franz Hopper said Tuesday night that I should only put the addresses of people I know in my book, but Mom said the next day that by Christmas our email will be opened up! There is a rule for that, though: no attachments. Meaning we can't email pictures even after we can write letters. I'm a little sad about that, but it's cool. Other than the email thing, life in general is very, <i>very</i> good over here, hence the "Runaway!" --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><span style="background:#FF9999;color:#a00"><font face="Script MT Bold"> Aeli<span style="background:#fff">ta@L</span>yoko </font></span></a> 23:36, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Excellent! I actually got a haircut today, so my "quasi-mullet" has been replaced with a really short boy's cut. Shave off 87% of Harry Potter's hair and that is what I sort of look like now. And that's really awesome about the Internet! Okay, that was an understatement. I'm so excited for you I can't actually formulate words! Too bad about the attachments, but that can be remedied later.</dd>

<dd>I'm out on Christmas Break now, which is great! I did my Christmas shopping, but my relatives on the West Coast (in Oregon, right next door to you guys) will be having belated gifts from me because it is December 23, I have no intention of wrapping them now, and they are not mailed! So, tomorrow is Christmas Eve and I'm skipping my church's Christmas Paegant. Instead, I'm going to a Roman Catholic church for Christmas mass with my Mom (she works for that church in music). That's going to be sweet, especially since my Physics teacher is a Catholic and goes to that church. Then its Christmas Day, then I can go to New York to see my relatives. So, <b>MERRY CHRISTMAS!</b> It's great to finally say that. All these freaking arch-liberals (notice I didn't say all liberals, just the crazy ones like the ACLU and American Atheists, etc.) have been waging the war on Christmas with great efficacy. No one even says Happy Holidays anymore! You and K-9 are two of the few people I can trust when saying Merry Christmas anymore. I'm getting so sick of this war on Christmas. The majority of people in the United States celebrate Christmas, majority rules, so <b>MERRY CHRISTMAS!</b> None of this political correctness now, I'll say Merry Christmas to everyone now. At least Christmas still holds on some places. The mall was playing "The First Noel" in public (Atheists forbid!) without complaint. <b>MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!</b> <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab"><b><span style="background:#009;color:#fff"> Jer<span style="background:#f00">emie</span></span></b></a> <a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJeremie%40theLab_fde1.html" title="User talk:Jeremie@theLab"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab </span></a></dd>

<dd>Merry Christmas to you, too!</dd>
<dd>Just curious, what's wrong with Connie? Also, do you have <i>any</i> thoughts as to a new name for Lara? I love the name for Odd's girlfriend, and I don't want to change it, but...both the current names have 4 letters, 2 syllables, and the second and fourth letters are both "A". I wasn't partial to "Lara" anyway. Gotta go - start a new conversation tommorrow! --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><span style="background:#FF9999;color:#009"><font face="Script MT Bold"> Aeli<span style="background:#fff">ta@L</span>yoko </font></span></a> 04:27, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So, sorry I haven't been on in oh so many days! Christmas got crazy and then I had a research paper and you know how life goes. But, believe it or not, I'm writing you from my aunt and uncle's house in Spencerport, NY. I brought my laptop along to do some work and, surprise surprise, they have a wireless network, so I connected and got online! Now, to business.</p>
<p>I don't know, I just don't like the sound of "Connie" it just sound...trite. Perhaps if you skipped the diminutive and always used the full form "Constance" it would be better. (you so took that name from <i>Redwall</i> didn't you?)</p>
<p>So what did you get for Christmas? I got</p>
<ul>
<li>Lindor 60% Extra Dark Chocolate Truffles</li>
<li>Other brands of candy (Peach-Os, JellyBellies, etc.)</li>
<li><b>The Dancing Wu-Li Masters</b>, a book on physics.</li>
<li>A beginner's manual to Quantum Physics and Quantum Mechanics</li>
<li>A USA History factbook</li>
<li>A book on cities</li>
<li><b>The Language of God</b>, a book by the scientist <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Collins_483f.html" title="Francis Collins">Francis Collins</a>, a collegue of my father, that is (finally!) a book that lines up with my opinion on evolution, religion and extremism.</li>
<li>A book on the poetry of Gwendolyn Brooks</li>
<li>Frank Herbert's <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dune.html" title="Dune">Dune</a></li>
<li>A tennis ball gun for my dog</li>
<li>A cell phone</li>
<li>A bath robe</li>
<li>New clothes (needed!)</li>
<li>Socks</li>
</ul>
<p>Boring, eh? Not really! I'm very pleased with my haul this year. I'm guessing you got a knitted purse or something from K-9 LVR and some other great stuff underneath the Aluminum Christmas tree.</p>
<p>So I can definitely talk tomorrow. I'm on vacation! --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">User: Jeremie@theLab</a>23:01, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You like dark chocolate, too? I didn't know that. Well, my list is pretty simple, really:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>A jewelry box</li>
<li>2 sets of earrings (one hoop, one <i>long</i> dangle, both pierced)</li>
<li>An egg whisk with a cute handle</li>
<li>A blue spatula (I found that and asked Mom if she was trying to tell me something)</li>
<li>An <i>Ove-glove</i> (except Franz Hopper sort of confiscated it to mess around with the fireplace, so now he owes me another one)</li>
<li>A day-by-day cat calender</li>
<li>An electronic Sudoku game</li>
<li>A complete watercolor paint set</li>
<li>A bulletian board</li>
<li>A gift card</li>
<li>A knitted cap with long ties to it (yes, from K9)</li>
<li>A gift card for $15</li>
<li>$20 in cash</li>
<li>A paper from the parents that they say is good for <i>$120</i> on clothes!</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'll have to doublecheck the paper for the exact amount, but that was about it. They said I could use it to buy a dress for the prom that we have coming up next year. To be completely honest, I'm looking forward to graduating...but I'm <i>dreading</i> this dance! I don't want to go alone, but I freak out so much in talking to the boys here that I could <i>never</i> ask one out! I just get so paranoid in a crowd. Mom says that if I had a chance to start over in a place where I didn't know anybody and they didn't know me, I would quickly be surrounded by friends. I hope she's right, or collage will be the worst time of my life!</dd>
<dd>K9 reads the Redwall series more than I do. Still, I thought about it and I decided that I would try a different name. "Amy" is even closer to "Maya" than "Lara," but Steve's girlfriend doesn't have to be named Connie. A few days ago I was reading a book of names that I have and I discovered that "Steven" is an international name. The list of international names isn't very long - it's all the names that have become popular in several different countries. William is international, too. My name isn't, but K9's is. (if you're interested in persuing hints) I decided to make Steve's girlfriend have an international name, too. So I went through the list and found a name that I had forgotten about: <i>Bridget</i>. I had seen a girl with that name in a different TV show, and she had been my favorite. Plus, it means "Strength," which suits my little Negro girl perfectly. How would that work? Steve and Bridget, the complimenting couple. I think it's close enough that I can say this: <b>Happy New Year!!!</b> --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><span style="background:#f99;color:#009;font-family:Script MT Bold"> Aeli<span style="background:#d00">ta@L</span>yoko </span></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/l/User_talk%7EAelita%40Lyoko_9fc0.html" title="User talk:Aelita@Lyoko">(talk)</a></sup> 21:59, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now <i>there's</i> a name that works! I can get behind that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, I can probably guess your name and K-9's due to your e-mail addresses, which I assume have contractions of your name and your last initial. Your's is Jennifer and K-9's is Elizabeth, or something like that.</dd>

<dd>Interesting gifts. Whatever do you need an egg whisk for? One of those aspiring chef types? And I'm not surprised Franz Hopper destroyed your Ove-Glove in the fire. My neighbor has one and she says it only works up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Your fire will be a tad hotter than that (try a couple-hundred degrees more).</dd>
<dd>I've found a brutally effective way to deal with my own prom dread (you and I are so alike! I'm vexed about proms too. Also, like you can't approach guys, I can't approach girls in real life either). I'm not going. Neither of my parents went to theirs, so I'll continue the family tradition. Of course that's only if I don't pull off some Hollywood-script stunt where I fly out to California and show up randomly as your date. My folks would kill me for airfare alone!</dd>
<dd>So where are you thinking about going to college? If you've got particular interests (such as cooking, history, etc) you should find a college ideally tailored to such a profession, or at least with a really strong department for it. I'm thinking about doing some history in college, with perhaps some science on the side.</dd>
<dd>I'm home now, and had a good visit. My oldest cousin is getting married next year to her best friend in the Peace Corps, so next Veteran's Day I'll be in New York again for the wedding on the shores of Lake Ontario.</dd>
<dd><b>HAPPY NEW YEAR!</b> <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab"><b><span style="background:#009;color:#fff"> Jer<span style="background:#f00">emie</span></span></b></a> <a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJeremie%40theLab_fde1.html" title="User talk:Jeremie@theLab"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab </span></a>23:02, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow, you're good!</dd>
<dd>Actually, that Ove-Glove is still in practically new condition. It just can't be used in the kitchen because it's got soot on it. And, I'm not exactly an "aspiring chef." When I pulled the spatula and that goofy egg whisk out of my stocking, I looked at my parents and asked, "Are you trying to tell me something?" I don't really cook if I can avoid it. The whisk and spatula are probably going in a hope chest or something like it for when I move out.</dd>
<dd>You might do <i>what?</i> Oh, can I blush now? I'd love it if that really happened, even if it does take a miracle.</dd>
<dd>What I want to do is go to some college with on-campus dorms, kind of like the Lyoko Gang's high school. Mom says that I'm starting at a nearby college while I'm still living at home, though. If I remember correctly, she said I need more discipline before flying off on my own.</dd>
<dd>Congrats on your cousin's wedding. It seems like none of my cousins have had a normal life worth anything. See, on my mom's side one of my cousins wound up with a baby girl before she was married, and the father ran off (or something like that). On the Hopper side, almost the exact same thing happened except the boyfriend stuck around. I think <i>they</i> will get married someday. I had to spend a couple of days in the same house with the mom's-side cousin, and a girl who I used to have so much fun with is now a complete stranger to me! I don't even know who changed more - her or me. Anyway, the life of my cousins is their business, and there isn't a whole ton I can do to change them.</dd>
<dd>K9's hassling me to get off because I'm on her Internet time. (I wouldn't be, except mine isn't working. Have to hassle mom again about it) Enjoy 2007! --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelita%40Lyoko_c6c3.html" title="User:Aelita@Lyoko"><span style="background:#f99;color:#009;font-family:Script MT Bold"> Aeli<span style="background:#d00">ta@L</span>yoko </span></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/l/User_talk%7EAelita%40Lyoko_9fc0.html" title="User talk:Aelita@Lyoko">(talk)</a></sup> 21:06, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
