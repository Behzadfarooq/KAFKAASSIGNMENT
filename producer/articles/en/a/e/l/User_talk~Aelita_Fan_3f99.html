<p>Hi there Aelita Fan, and welcome to Wikipedia's Code Lyoko community! I hope you like the site and decide to stay. If you need help, advice or someone to talk to, just leave a message on my talk page. I'll be around to answer it.</p>
<p>I've been talking to Aelita@Lyoko, who, from strikingly similar descriptions, I'm inferring is your twin sister. I hope to continue a great online friendship with you both through talking.</p>
<p>I'm trying to leave replies to all of your messages on <a href="../../../c/o/d/Talk%7ECode_Lyoko_df1b.html" title="Talk:Code Lyoko">Talk: Code Lyoko</a>, so check them and you'll probably find my signature underneath them.

<p>Thanks for contacting me! I usually prefer to respond on other people's talk pages because I know that they are guaranteed to notice my comments that way thanks to that yellow message alert bar. Yeah so, um, what's it like to knit? I've seen people do it before and its basically just sticking and moving needles around fabric, right? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 18:17, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's okay if you can't properly explain something. I really can't either! I tend to get very wordy and confusing, one of my English teacher's pet peeves. Like you, I share a similar like of seeing something organized form out of chaos by my own doing. I usually prefer to see it on the computer or on a piece of paper though. For some reason, vocational work with my hands has never really appealled to me. It might have something to do with my dad, but I don't know. At the same time, SERIOUS academic thought (like <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philology.html" title="Philology">philology</a> or philosophy) doesn't come easy either. I almost enrolled in a Tech School instead of my Secondary School because of fear of homework. I do fine in school, don't get me wrong, but I prefer the arts like Literature and History. Math and Science come easily enough, but they're not what I want to do for the rest of my life. What else do you like to do, besides knit and watch Code Lyoko? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 13:43, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your responses are never too long. Mine, however, are habitually lengthy. If you would like a perfect example, check <a href="http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/User_talk:Homeworld616#Music_to_work.2C_too" class="external text" title="http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/User_talk:Homeworld616#Music_to_work.2C_too" rel="nofollow">this out</a>. That's my talk page on Battlestar Wiki where I talk to an awesome British guy called The Merovingian. But, ouch. Strict family. I thought I had uptight folks, but I can relate with you and A@L's predicament. My family used to have only one computer and that really cheesed my Dad off since he works a lot, so he got my Mom and I laptops. However, I get in trouble for talking a lot on the Internet too. In fact,<i>should</i> be writing a paper on Malcom X for school right now, but I'm not. My parents don't like that. However, <i>at least</i> my parents trust me enough to not go to the Playboy website or whatever. Yuck! I hate erotica anyway! But it's great that you like to draw. So do I! In fact, <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">Angie Y.</a> has employed me to draw art for her fanfictions. It's no surprise that it's all Code Lyoko oriented. It's okay if your not great at drawing. I used to be horrible. I was good at drawing buildings but when it came to people I bombed. My characters didn't have ears, noses or eyebrows. I actually started copying the CL style and now my people drawing has improved. As for origami (yes, I answer every question I'm asked), I know Odd does it. In fact, he made an origami swan out of his Final Exam. I don't know about Yumi, alhtough it may be an as-of-yet unseen hobby. Send my regards to Aelita@Lyoko, and tell her I'm looking forward to her return. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 18:44, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah. Laptops are actually better than stationary computers in my opinion. There are a lot less wires for one thing. Laptops have fingerpads instead of mouses and the keys are a lot less thick. It was hard to navigate at first, but now I don't think I could <i>ever</i> get back on a traditional setup. Marine World Six Flags huh...Which city is that in? Long Beach or something? For my Six Flags needs out here I go to Six Flags New England, which is right on the border between my state and Massachusetts. You see, my Dad works at <a href="../../../p/f/i/Pfizer.html" title="Pfizer">Pfizer</a> and they have this employee-family day at some theme park, so I get to go there at least once a year. It's got great roller coasters (Superman, Batman, Cyclone, etc) a number of themes (Western, 1950s USA, DC Comics, etc) and thrill rides. The only other Six Flags I went to outside New England was Great Adventure in New Jersey. I went there twice. It has some of the same rides, but is actually quite different, which is refreshing. I've also been to Hershey Park in Pennsylvania, Disney World and (this is my all-time favorite), <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Compounce_94d5.html" title="Lake Compounce">Lake Compounce</a> in my own home state. I don't know why I prefer the last one over the modern thrill parks. It's just it's quaintness and history (they have historic buildings in the middle of the park) and it's the USA's oldest family theme park. That just appeals to me. That Stargate SG 3000 things sounds interesting. I watch that show, but the storyline you're describing doesn't ring a bell, though the concept of space and time travel does. Maybe that was because this took place in 3000 AD? Did it star the usual Stargate cast? (Daniel Jackson, Cameron Mitchell, Sam Carter, etc)? I hope it at least had Claudia Black in it. She's the best actress there. She really revived that show. And um, is it the end of the world yet?&#160;;) --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 11:59, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed on the end of the world thing. When I'm on a roadtrip, I try not to zone out. I usually have a book with me to keep me entertained. That came in handy when I was in New Mexico! The landscape there is so <i>monotonous.</i> It's just scrub, dirt and mountains in the distance. It's so bad it makes you want to bang your head against the window. However, the sky is a big improvement. Where I live, trees are everywhere so we hardly get any patch of sky. But out in the desert, you can see for miles (12 I think) and see like 27 different weather patterns going on concurrently. That was the only interesting thing about New Mexico roadtrips. Yeah, I watch Stargate, mainly because my Dad does. You see, it comes on before Battlestar Galactica and since I watch that show, Stargate kind of came naturally. As for what it's like...This could get long! Well, if you started watching it right now you might get confused so I'll fill you in on the backstory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, so, here's the Earth. The Americans and Russians found Stargates in Antarctica and the bottom of the Atlantic. Stargates are these big circle things built by a highly evolved (referred to in the show as "ascended") human race called the Ancients (originally the Alterans. That was their name when they were united. I'll go into their civil war later). They were the ones who built Atlantis (albeit on another planet in another galaxy called Pegasus), which is the subject of another Stargate spinoff series. They scattered these around different planets so new races could meet each other. There are a lot of different names for the gates. Earthmen only refer to them as Stargates. You might also hear "Chappa Eye" or "Ancestral Ring" or some other variation. Now, when we found these things in the 1960s we transported them to Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado (where NORAD is in the real world) but we couldn't figure out how to activate them since activation required an encoded sequence of chevron icons. Dr. Daniel Jackson (played by Michael Shanks) cracked the code and the original SG-1 team (comprising of Colonel Mark O'Neil, Daniel and Major Samantha Carter) started dickering around the galaxy via wormhole travel. No sooner do we get beyond the Solar System do we find a parasitic host race called the Goul'd (pronounced Go-ow-oold) is taking over humans (particularly a race called the Jaffa) and enslaving the Milky Way galaxy. After the Goul'd make a failed attempt to invade the Earth (no civilians noticed, conveniently, even though giant Goul'd Mother Ships were hovering over Europe). After that, our heroes find out the history of these folks. They had been on Earth before. In fact, they <i>built</i> the Egyptian civilization, Pyramids and all. A couple episodes actually go back in time to the Goul'd Pharoh's court. If it hadn't been for the Goul'd, Egypt would have been a nomadic back water in history. Basically, every god in history (exempt the Abrahmaic God, he's apparently the true God in this series) was a Goul'd. Amun Ra, Horus, Baal, Anubis. Most of them actually make appearances, with Baal as a recurring antagonist. However, with the help of Stargate team the Egyptian humans overthrew the Goul'd. Soon, after the invasion of Earth, SG-1 converts a Jaffa warrior named Teulk to the human side and they all go around the Galaxy, meeting races, getting into trouble, cracking jokes and blowing up the Goul'd. Anubis wants to destroy the Earth so he launches asteroids at it, etc, but SG-1 always foils his plans. Well, eventually the Goul'd fall and the Jaffa are liberated. The show starts to take a downward spiral so they revive it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, Colonel O'Neil is now General and leaves the team. He is replaced by Cameron Mitchel (played by Ben Browder) who is a wise-cracking "cowboy." Daniel Jackson runs into an old trouble maker, Vala Malderaan (played by Claudia Black, YEAH!). Vala is about as obnoxious as Cameron Mitchell, so the show is highly entertaining with <i>two</i> nutjobs running around. Daniel and Vala travel to what they believe is the Ancient homeworld, but they instead find a polytheistic medieval civilization who worship a group of gods called the Ori. Vala and Daniel are almost killed by the villagers, but saved by a Prior (a disfigured human with all the powers you'd expect Jesus to have. He brings Vala back to life after she died and can control stuff with his staff). He takes them to the Ori homeworld where Daniel discovers that the Ori are intent on having every human in the Universe worship them (humans are the most common type of species in the Universe, very basic lifeforms. More powerful races constantly like to pick on them). You see, the Alterans split at some point in history into the Ori and the Ancients. The Ori preferred religion while the Ancients prefered science. The Ori went gung-ho on their galaxy, conquering every species and forcing them to worship them as gods. Horrified, the Ancients (remember, both Ancients and Ori are ascended humans. They live in a completely different dimension) blocked every other galaxy, including the Milky Way, from Ori knowledge. The Ori have a religion called Origin which teaches that all the followers will attain enlightment and ascension, although this is revealed to be a bunch of lies by an Ancient messenger named Orlin. The Ori actually draw power from their converts, so the more worshipers the more power. Origin has its own Bible (Book of Origin) which is full of anecdotes, miracles and fire is the most important symbol in their faith. The Ori themselves appear to be fire, while the Ancients are pure light. The Ori then start sending Priors to our galaxy. Vala disappears for a while, but surfaces on another planet where she is posing as a Goul'd godess. The Ori are converting this world, as well as many others. At first, their message and miracles only appeal to anceint or medieval civilizations. Advanced civilizations know the Ori work is through science and technology, rather than magic. However, the Ori start converting more advanced worlds such as Tegallus, a planet in a huge World War. The Ori then start building a Supergate, a gigantic Stargate in space that can be constructed only throught the destruction of a planet. Vala destroys the first, at the cost of zapping her to the Ori galaxy where she lives until coming back as a permanent character. At this point, the Goul'd resurface, attempting to invade Atlantis (very unsuccessfully) and Baal has cloned himself and is trying to build an economic empire to take over the Earth with by buying out numerous aerospace, pharmeceutical and technology companies in Virginia. He even tries to blow up Seattle in one episode with a building laced with the highly volatile element Naquita. Now, the Ori are getting more annoying and ruthless. They start blowing up freed Jaffa worlds because of the refusal of the people to be converted from atheism. SG-1 stumbles across the Legend of King Arthur at this point. Arthur and all the Knights of the Round Table were good humans, highly advanced, who ruled England after the fall of Rome. Merlin was an Ancient and it turns out that the Holy Grail is the only weapon that can be used to defeat the Ori. It should be noted that this Holy Grail isn't the one used by Christ at the last supper, Daniel makes that clear. A lot of the characters from the Arthurian legend (Morgan Le Fay, Sir Gawaine, etc.) are referenced in more scientific and less magical terms. For example, Morgan Le Fay is actually a crazed microbiologist. But, the Vala returns and the Ori have a working Supergate. They invade the galaxy, blow up some Mother Ships and a <i>Gorlev</i> (a Russian space destroyer much like the USAF <i>Promethus</i> (also destroyed, but at Tegallus), <i>Daedelus</i> (in Stargate Atlantis) and the <i>Odyssey.</i> Yeah, the USA has space destroyers. They're AWESOME). After that, the Ori start invading Jaffa worlds. Vala had a baby named Orsai, who is endowed with Ori memories. You see, the Ori themselves can't enter our Galaxy due to the Ancient blocks, but humans can so they cheated. Orsai grows from an infant to like, 25 years old in a single day due to Ori technology and is a pretty evil girl who, however fanatical she is, wants Vala to approve of her blowing up people because Vala is the Mom. Vala actually calls Orsai "Aria" (named after Vala's mother, who was a "witch of a woman"). So, the Ori are winning and all the while SG-1 has to deal with old nemesises, allies, parallel universes and other science fiction stuff.</dd>

<p>That's everything in a nutshell...A rather large nutshell, but now you're caught up...mostly. I haven't seen the show for a while. The great thing (and annoying thing) about the Ori is that they're too <i>good</i> at everything. Humanity can't get a single hit in edgewise. The Ori are always a step ahead and always win. Not to mention, the SG creators are now appealing to people's religious zeal instead of physical zeal. The Ori call every other faith pagan and want them effaced from the Universe. Now, if any self-respecting Christian or Muslim or Hindu or whoever heard that in real life, they'd want to kill the Priors (not a cake walk. The Priors have those Jesus powers, which make them untouchable). Well, I hope that piques your curiosity about Stargate. It's on SciFi Channel here at Fridays at 8:00 so that would put it at...5:00 PM for you in California. Now, I know my responses are lengthy but this is my longest yet.

<p>Hard to say, I've been 3,000 miles away in both directions, East and West, from Connecticut (yeah, it's spelled really weird. Think "Connect"-ih-cut"). However, I'd have to say the farthest away I was was when I went to Great Britain in 2003. Oh, what a great trip. East Anglia, London, I saw all the good places. London was especially good. It was pretty fast paced. I had told my parents ahead of time I wanted to see "The Big 5" (as I referred to them). They were, in order: <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Abbey_ded8.html" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Ben_0dc3.html" title="Big Ben">Saint Stephen's Tower</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trafalgar_Square_a2c0.html" title="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Paul%27s_Cathedral_6017.html" title="Saint Paul's Cathedral">Saint Paul's Cathedral</a> and the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_of_London_bcf4.html" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>. We saw all of them in one day, surprisingly, and with those Routemaster double-decker buses we saw even more of the city. Probably my favorite place was <a href="../../../p/i/c/Piccadilly_Circus_f55e.html" title="Piccadilly Circus">Piccadilly Circus</a>, which you could say is London's Times Square. There were a lot of street performers there and lights. Very interactive. I can tell you more about the trip if you wish. By the way, I consider "a couple of days" 2. I think it's been two days since you told me Aelita@Lyoko was temporarily banned. Is she back on yet? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 12:55, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ooooh, Rome. I've always wanted to go there. What was it like? I'm betting you saw the Coliseum, Forum ruins, Vatican et cetera? As for my trip to England, it was to die for. We stayed in Norwich (the capital of East Anglia and Norfolk) for about 8 days. We saw that city's medieval castle (where I threw a whole British pound down a wishing well, much to the chagrin of some British kids), massive gothic cathedral, other churches, chapels, shrines, main square, guild hall and city hall. We actually met the Lord Mayor of Norwich as well! He wore a big gold chain signifying his position and served us complimentary orange juice with vodka. The balcony outside his office provided grea views of the central city. Apparently, the city of Norwich had 52 churches, one for each Sunday of the year, and 365 pubs, one for each day of the year, before World War II. A lot of the city and churches got bombed then. One of the historic chapels of patron Saint Julian was actually a reproduction. Around the city there were ruins of anchorages, small cells where nuns would lock themselves for extended periods of time and write/preach from the cell window. It was very interesting. We also saw Norwich's jailhouse and train station, as well as hilly residential neighborhoods. We took side trips to different parts of Norfolk: the seaside town of Cromer, famous for its crabs and high church tower (you were awarded a pin if you climbed it), the country church of Erpingham Saint Mary's where <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emma_Watson_23a7.html" title="Emma Watson">Emma Watson</a> (the girl who plays Hermione in Harry Potter movies) worships, the Caley Lavender farm and mill, and the historic railroad of Aylsham (the cars are about <i>half as high</i> as I am), very cramped quarters. En route to London, we saw Bury Saint Edmunds, a town with a ruined Roman Catholic monastary gutted by King Henry VIII when he created the Church of England and destroyed the Vatican's foothold in England. In London, we saw "The Big 5", Piccadilly, Kensington Palace and Dress Court Collection, Covent Garden, Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park, the Underground, the BT Tower (supposedly a British government secret, even though it's the third highest building in London), Tower Bridge, London's New City Hall, the Houses of Parliament, British Airway's London Eye (one BIG ferris wheel), double-decker buses, a pub, , full English breakfasts (sausage, bacon, fried eggs, potatoes, tomatoes, toast, etc.), various central districts of London such as Holborn and Soho, the Lion King musical at the Lyceum Theater and the One Canada, a huge skyscraper that has been the target of several attempted terrorist attacks. There are a lot of differences between England and the USA. For example: you either live in a town full of brick flats which are all connected to each other, or you live in the countryside where there are <i>no</i> houses whatsoever, just fields full of rolled bales of hay. The difference is striking. It's not like here in America where everything is largely evened out. For lunch, the British basically eat mixed salads (sometimes with cheese). While there, I got to try kippers, Yorkshire pudding, Fish and Chips "On the paper" (It was actually sausage and chips, as I hate codfish. "On the paper" means you get your food on a giant strip of greasy wax paper. Authentic!) They call "Take Out," "Take Away." Also, the British people don't really care about the Iraq war as much as you would think. They have their own problems to deal with, and they'd rather be friendly to Americans than not. There was an optional side trip we could have taken to Holland, but we went elsewhere in lieu of that. Darn! I was hoping to visit the most liberal country in the world! That was pretty much it. Oh yeah, we got to fly there and back on Virgin Atlantic, which is easily the best airline flight I've ever had. They served us the best airline food ever (salmon dinner, yum) and had TV, radio and video games as well as all the water and fruit juice you could drink. They actually had TVs in the backs of the seats, which was convenient. It's great that I get to hear from Aelita@Lyoko again. I'm really looking forward to it! Tell her to get on as early as humanly and permissively possible. We've much to discuss. Tell me about your exploits in Rome. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 00:48, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your trip to Rome and Greece sounded amazing. For my trip to England, I almost forgot to tell you that we went to Cambridge to see the colleges they have there, and I tried British lemonade. You know how here lemonade is an actual drink with lemons? To the British, "lemonade" is more like boxed 7-UP. As for the food you ate, lots of pasta. Sounds good to me. I can't get enough of that stuff. Besides, pizza isn't really Itallian. Pizza as we know it is American. My grandma went to Lake Garda (near the Swiss border) and had pizza. There's Tuscan pizza and pan sauce pizza. No crazy toppings. In my town we're about to have a Greek and Itallian food festival, so I'm really looking forward to it! It's the only time of year when international food comes to me so I'm all for it! Thanks for clearing up the homeschool thing. Sounds like you only go to school one day a week and then get loaded with homework. Hey, I could go for that! --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 21:16, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whew! Sorry I haven't been in contact with you for the last couple days. Things got insane here. First, my dog started having seizures because she has high levels of toxicity in her body, so we had to take her to the animal hospital at Tufts University, and today was my first day of school. And I didn't leave anything on Monday because you and Aelita's personal "<a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Hopper_84c2.html" title="Franz Hopper">Franz Hopper</a>" was on the computer. So, I'm back and, since you and Aelita are Christians, I humbly ask you both to pray for the well-being of my dog. Her prognosis is looking up, but she still has to pass a neurological exam. Just pray for her tonight, for success on the exam and pray that she doesn't, um, die. If both of you could, I would be indebted. Thank you. Anywho, enough with the morbid. How have you been holding up? Aelita tells me you two resume school on September 11. Kind of looms, doesn't it? It's funny how before 2001, September 11 was just another day on the calender, completely unspecial. But after 2001, it's name is now dark and reminds people of the events that happened then. I feel sorry for anyone whose birthday coincides with that day. Where were you and Aelita when it happened anyhow? I was in school, and I heard kids talking about the Twin Towers blowing up, thinking it was the Russians. I thought it was a movie at first, but then to find out it actually happened. &lt;shudder&gt;. And, now I realize I got into the morbid again. Darn it! On a happy note, anything fun coming up for you? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 20:54, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My dog is a German Shepherd-Siberian Husky hybrid, and a female. Her name is Tessa. You'd love her. She has the sweetest temperment and just wants to play and meet people. She's no guard dog, even though she looks like one. As for dog breeds, I recommend a Husky, or a Malamute or a German Shepherd. But, it's all up to you. If you get one (or two, or three, or four, or five, or) (LOL) tell me. As for what I've been doing? Trying not to die at school would be a good one for starters. I loaded my schedule this year. Physics, two History courses, Algebra, British Literature, etc. It's going to be a hard year. I might as well tell you that I probably won't be on as often as I was during the summer. I might get in at 9:00 PM every night if I can help it, but I'll try to answer messages at least once a day. As for fun stuff, well, I try to write stories, get on Wikipedia, draw, play computer games. In fact, I'm going to install a new one via AutoRun right now. And thanks for praying. That means a lot to me. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab">Jeremie@theLab</a> 21:20, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really want to thank you for praying for my dog. She is now out of the animal hospital, safe and sound with <i>no brain damage</i> and <i>no ill effects</i>! I am so happy and I owe it all to God, the doctors and you. I'm so happy to have her back and I wanted you to know how much I appreciated your intercession.

<dd>Yeah, I am trying to stay alive at school. It's coming easier than I thought it would, but I have several assignments I must complete over Labor Day weekend which is...right now! I didn't get to do anything this morning because I had to mow the lawn and carry stuff for my parents, who employ me. Thanks to that, I smell like gasoline right now and probably need a shower and a new set of clothes. Then I'll need to do some homework before a friend comes over this afternoon. Hey! Maybe I could coerce him into leaving a message on your page! That would be hilarious, worthy of inclusion in my "Funny Crap that Happened to Me Recently" section. =D -- <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremie%40theLab_9175.html" title="User:Jeremie@theLab"><b><span style="background:#009;color:#fff">&#160;Jer<span style="background:#f00">emie</span></span></b></a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJeremie%40theLab_fde1.html" title="User talk:Jeremie@theLab"><span style="background:#f00;color:#fff">@theLab&#160;</span></a></dd>

<p>I just talked to your sister. I'm new here. Have you ever heard of the greatest game called Shogo? If you haven't, play it now. It's about giant robots that kill each other. My favorite character of this game is Baku. My name is ShogoFan3000. And guess what, I'm that friend of Jeremie@theLab's who was put up to say this. But I'm genuinely excited about being here. Do you play Katamari Damacy? If you do, you probably don't know what true gaming is. Eat Dominic's Pizza. It's good for your soul. Please talk to me. I'm bored. THE END. --<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShogoFan3000_a9dd.html" title="User:ShogoFan3000">ShogoFan3000</a> 19:46, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My parents found out what my username is, and they don't approve of it. I shall now be called K-9 LVR, if anyone wishes to maintain contact. Materialization: Aelita Fan.</p>
