<li>Wikipedia does not allow advertising. The more you add to the article, the more it is likely to be deleted as spam. We certainly do not need the long list of publications - link to the list on the company's website.

<dd>Got your email. Generally speaking, unless there's something sensitive going on, I prefer to hold discussions like this on Wikipedia via User talk pages. Wikipedia uses an exact search rather than a fuzzy search, so searching for something that isn't exactly the article title may not give you the results you want. I'll create a redirect at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Ann_Liebert_76b6.html" title="Mary Ann Liebert">Mary Ann Liebert</a> to aid navigation. I think the <i>article</i> (not "listing" - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>) is already good enough that any complaints about it are addressable and it shouldn't be deleted, so don't worry about that. Also, please see <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> -- articles don't belong to anyone. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenbest_2617.html" title="User:Benbest">User:Benbest</a> was actually the one who put up the article in the first place. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 16:01, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

After looking at these and some of the other Liebert-related messages, I want to emphasize Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a directory or a Yellow Pages. In fact, it's not a lot of things; see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>, especially:</p>

<ul>
<li><i><b>"Self-promotion.</b> You are free to write about yourself or projects you have a strong personal involvement in. However, do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other, including the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view, which is difficult when writing about yourself. Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles is unacceptable. See <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a>."</i></li>
<li><i><b>"Advertising.</b> Articles about companies and products are acceptable if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small "garage" or local companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finishing_school.html" title="Finishing school">finishing school</a> for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> for guidelines on corporate notability."</i></li>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a> -- In a nutshell you should not be editing your own article or adding links to your web sites.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_bdee.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam">Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam</a> -- trust me, you don't want to get these people's attention as a "project"</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a></li>
<li><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spam_blacklist" class="extiw" title="meta:Talk:Spam_blacklist">meta:Talk:Spam blacklist</a> -- the Wikimedia global spam blacklist blocks all links on all Wikipedia and related sites (Wiktionary, foreign language Wikipedia versions, etc). The ultimate and inevitable shutdown for persistent link spammers</li>
</ul>
<p>We would love it if you stuck around to make edits other than those promoting your own business, but in the meantime, I think you stick to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">conflict of interest guideline</a>, refraining from editing articles related to your company or adding links to your publications.<br />

<dd>I also notice that multiple accounts are being used to add these links; on Wikipedia, this is called sock puppetry (or a variant, meat puppetry).

<dd>We are totally confused as to why the addition to the breastfeeding page is considered "Spam" &amp; we are now threatened with being blacklisted. It seemed entirely appropriate. Having said this, we have no plans to add any more info to this or any other area on wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>To address your confusion -- there was a long discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_459e.html#Need_help_with_Mary_Ann_Liebert.2C_Inc." title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam#Need help with Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</a> You and a colleague were asked not to add links to your publications and advised of Wikipedia's rules, but your organization continued to do so. Finally after multiple warnings, you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Spam&amp;diff=82125502&amp;oldid=82124502" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Spam&amp;diff=82125502&amp;oldid=82124502" rel="nofollow">wrote</a> this note:</dd>

<dd><i>Hope I am doing this right as I am still very new to this!</i></dd>
<dd><i>Regarding the above communications regarding the recent flurry of activity as far as adding various Liebert info/links to Wiki, I must take most responsibility &amp; offer apologies. My/our intent was never to "spam" or abuse wiki in any way. We find wiki (as many do) to be an increasingly important resource to all &amp; simply wanted to add our resources in the appropriate categories for any who would be interested. Tom Mulak is indeed at the company with me &amp; we both had been asked to take this on as a sort of project. I do not personally know Ben Best, but it seems he is someone outside the company who is aware of our presence in the industry &amp; added various info on us of his own accord. I actually thank him for this! I had not responded to JonHarder (&amp; others) sooner as 1, I really did not know how (I'm still unsure if this is the correct way) &amp; I only saw his message (&amp; others) after I'd finished adding what we thought were links within the wiki guidelines....um....yes.....I think we are "done" for now. &#160;;-)</i></dd>
<dd><i>Please accept my sincere apologies &amp; let me know what we can do to "fix" things or if we should just leave all as is for now.</i></dd>

I wrote the above because I was very much concerned this might continue. I wanted to ensure you knew that after a certain point, the whole process moved beyond just a bunch of volunteer editors telling you to knock off the spam. When those efforts fail, (and as of 26 October, they still weren't working with Mary Ann Liebert) then there's not much choice but to block links.</dd>

<dd>While it's unclear anything is going to come of it, there has been talk of making our black list available to search engine operators; see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_459e.html#Google_and_Wikipedia_share_a_common_interest_in_combatting_link-spam" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam#Google and Wikipedia share a common interest in combatting link-spam</a>.</dd>

<dd>For everybody's sake, I don't think any of us wants to see you head further down this road but the ball is in your court. I encourage you to read the links posted earlier to Wikipedia's rules on conflicts of interest, links, etc. I don't think it should be hard for you to just never add a link to one of your publications again, so your domains are in no danger of blacklisting unless you (or your staff) either add another such link or break another of the conflict-of-interest rules. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<dd>I added 1 more link as requested by my supervisors. I was not aware someone else had previously tried to add to this topic &amp; had it removed. I have informed them of our recent communications &amp; advised them very strongly to STOP &amp; NOT attempt to add anything else to wiki. I definitely agree blacklisting would not be in our best interest! I will not be adding anything as it pertains to the company or publications &amp; hope others in the office do the same &amp; listen to my advise. Thanks.</dd>
