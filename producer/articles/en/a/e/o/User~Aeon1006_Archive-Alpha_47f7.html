<p>Now, why would that be so funny? I know I write and edit articles late at night on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%27s_Well_13d2.html" title="Mary's Well">Mary's Well</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_Christian_32dd.html" title="Palestinian Christian">Palestinian Christian</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazareth.html" title="Nazareth">Nazareth</a>. I've mentioned my Christian background on talk pages there. And I also know I have a tendency to verbosity. But I don't think talk of forming a double tag team to drive a stake through me and stuff holy wafers in my mouth is remotely funny. It's actually totally offensive and threatening. Could you explain or clarify for me in case I have misunderstood? <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 19:05, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We (myself and doc Tropics) did not make any threats. We are just sharing a joke about that AfD. Sorry if it has irratated you but you must understand that that was a rather stressful AfD for all concerned and a little release was needed. The article in question in mine and several other opinion needed to be deleted, it was not notable enough to be in wikipedia. Please in the future not accuse anybody of making threats, it was a simple joke about the AfD (the fact that it wasn't until the next day that is was nomed for undelete.) and not ment to be anyhting but a joke. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006">Aeon</a> 20:23, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I gave <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> a serious answer on my Talkpage because he seems to be a serious editor. I doubt he would be so undignified as to fall out of his chair laughing.

<p>Hi Aeon, the page in question is <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Summer_Rain_a04d.html" title="Operation Summer Rain">Operation Summer Rain</a>. There's a lot of issues and bad edits going on. The problem from my side is the lack of willingness to accept even mainstream Western sources that have formed the majority of references for the posts I have cited. (Before today, when I tried to place more detailed casualty information as it appears on at www.pchrgaza.org, something that is getting talked out in a civil enough manner on the discussion page.) Everything, and I mean everything, just gets replaced with Jerusalem Post and Ynetnews, and information that indicates a civilian death is always thrown out in favour of another reference that indicates a militant death. Anyway, take a look for yourself. It's a fierce and furious editing pace though, so I won't blame you if you just give up trying to understand. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 22:38, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That it is. I've bowed out for now. No need for masochism. It's hard enough knowing that people are dying, but then having to justify inclusion of basic details that might humanize them a little like their ages, names, and how they died - it's too much. I'll try to get back to it a a much later date when the emotions have died down and a serious, comprehensive and factual accounting of what actually happened can go on. Thanks for your input. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 21:41, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aeon, I think our unfortunate misunderstanding with Tiamut is nearly sorted out. Since he posted at the Village Pump, I've asked that we conclude it there as well so that all comments will be available to the readers. I know that the situation frustrated you, especially after that contentious AfD, but I'm very encouraged that it can be resolved without resorting to more formal processes. At this point I mostly want to ensure that our reputations (poor ragtag things that they are) aren't "tarnished" by a misunderstanding that got out of hand. Thanks for keeping a cool head and trying to remain civil. I hope you don't mind that I teased you about your spelling on my Talkpage, it's actually a blatant case of the pot calling the kettle black since my spelling and grammer are atrocious&#160;:) --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 18:19, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wow! Thanks for the Barnstar, Aeon. I'm very flattered and I'll be proud to add it to my Userpage.

<p>Heh, saw your comments on the page in question. In reviewing the comments you received, I recognized the writing style as none other than the original author -- just thought you would want to know you were talking to a pile of socks. The problem with that article is that the list is heresay -- an actual copy of the supposed list does not exist, so it's not verifiable (i.e. there is no photocopy of the supposed original Clear Channel directive, and no copy of the supposed e-mail, just references to it by other people). So, how do we know what's supposed to be on the list, if there is no verifiable list? <a href="../../../m/a/t/Image%7EMatt_Devonshire2.jpg_8fd7.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/7/7e/Matt_Devonshire2.jpg/20px-Matt_Devonshire2.jpg" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../m/a/t/Image%7EMatt_Devonshire2.jpg_8fd7.html" /></a><a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire"><font size="2"><font color="blue"><b>Morton Devonshire</b></font></font></a><a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorton_devonshire_4a12.html" title="User talk:Morton devonshire"><i><sup><font color="red">Yo</font></sup></i></a> 05:26, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there, I am having trouble trying to add anything to the page Rick Ross (consultant) as I think the guy who seems to promote himself as chief moderator there just deletes anything I add. I am not a wiki pro, but I know that neutrality is a must. Rick Ross claims that the church I am in is a cult, and the links I provide defend that view. I am not sure if it is discrimination against me because I am a Christian and he is a Jew or whatever, but I am just aiming for a balanced debate. I put a little write up about how Ross comes against our church on the page but it was also just deleted and not edited. They are now saying that because I am in a cult I cannot provide adequate info, which is circular reasoning. Can you help. I don't really know what else to do! Nick.</p>

<p>Dear Aeon,</p>
<p>While things started off well, I feel things are not working out the way they should. I do not think that you are adaquately representing my interests in AMA discussion. Additionally, now you mistakeningly believe that UCRGrad and I are the same person. I would like to remind you that the original check user established the he and I were "two distinct groups."</p>
<p>In light of this, I feel it is no longer appropriate that you serve as my advocate. Best wishes. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsert-Belltower_b83a.html" title="User:Insert-Belltower">Insert-Belltower</a> 23:17, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is fine. I feel that you don't wish to solve this disput anyways, however I will remain involved in teh disput resoultion and attempt to settle this. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Aeon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 23:26, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Aeon1006, I personally do not wish your presence in the dispute resolution process. You were asked to be I-B's advocate, but from the very first day, you failed to represent your client's interests. You instead attempted to take the role of "mediator," which is not the same thing as "advocate." What kind of advocate requires their client to apologize to another individual for actions that didn't even affect that person? What kind of advocate invites OPPOSING parties to give their viewpoint (e.g. Elkevbo). What kind of advocate secretly suspects that his client is engaging in sockpuppetry and doesn't even have the decency just to ASK if this was happening? Advocates have a duty to support their client's best interests, and you failed miserably in that duty, if I may point out. If you really didn't believe in IB's case, you never should have agreed to be his advocate in the first place. In fact, I think you've "done enough" here. I have certainly lost faith in you, and I'm sure I-B has as well (since he was the one who fired you). Your continued involvement in this case will do nothing but antagonize me, and I'm sure I speak for Insert-Belltower. I hope that in your next advocacy case, you pay closer attention to your client's needs and actually BE an advocate. <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> 23:45, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I for one appreciate your tremendous efforts to gather and objectively evaluate all pertinent sources of information, Aeon. I'm sure WHS and I, as well as others currently posting to the article's talk page, will be willing to follow whatever further steps you and Caruso feel this case merits.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 00:07, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Aeon, I do indeed want to see these issues resolved and I think that they can be resolved through informal processes. I believe that you are taking this too personally when you should not. For the record, I object to a RFC because it is unnecessary. In this last debate, things got a bit disorganized and statements were not responsed to appropriately. I suggest that a more organized debate with two new advocates who represent both sides would be more productive.<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsert-Belltower_b83a.html" title="User:Insert-Belltower">Insert-Belltower</a> 02:25, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Aeon,</p>
<p>regarding the statement you requested for the rfc, couldn't we use the statements already present on your advocacy page to show that parties involved have already tried and failed to resolve matters? I personally don't feel it's necessary to go to ucrg/ib's user pages to make a point of further establishing what we already know. If you'd like, i suggest dividing work, however. i'll do ucrg's rfc if you do belltower's. sound good?--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 18:04, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>i don't have time to work on this more for the time being. incidentially, i'm ambivlant about pursuing the sockpuppet issue now because they apparantly have not attempted this recently. while i think it should be mentioned for completeness i don't think it should be emphasised that this is behavior we are currently concerned about. i think it should be emphasized that these are past violations and not current or ongoing ones.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 21:09, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hello aeon,</p>
<p>re your last suggestion, don't guidelines say they have to be filed seperately per user? i'd rather not get evidence between the two further confused than it already is. or do mean put both complete rfc texts on one page and work on them together on the same page?--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 23:11, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>hello aeon, i appreciate your work, but looking at other examples of ongoing rfcs it looks like what you've assembled looks more like an RFARB than an RFC. It seems for an RFC we need to provide examples of conduct violations in the form of edit differences with brief summaries and page links and we don't need to include any personal statements or allegations other than the general statement and description of what the contested conduct is leading to the rfc. anyway, we don't need to finish this tonight, i'm willing to spend a week or so on it to get this done properly. best,--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 23:45, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>no problem. thanks for all your help regarding this. i'll be working on adding more evidence to both pages also, and i think elkevbo and whs may help out with this as well.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 00:07, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>hey i've significantly updated the ucrg rfc. Will be continuing to edit both projects, but we should set a date for jointly filing these.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 21:53, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Aeon, As I understand the I-B RFC now, what you are doing is sending the whole advocacy case up to request comments from the wikipedian community. That is why it was structured differently. I was looking around page diffs in I-B's contribution history and could not find much that showed conduct violations as such. All he mainly does is revert pages and vocally support UCRGrad. While he has been uncivil occasionally how do you think we should structure his RFC in terms of the meatpuppet alligation?--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 23:20, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>ib could still work, but would have to center around the charge that his activities supporting ucrg are consistent with or show reason to suspect that his is a "meatpuppet" account. his not owning up to past sockpuppeting activities, and his consistently shared to the point of identical opinions on a range of issues with ucrg, all can support this claim. while he has not conducted many conduct violations on ucrg's behalf, still i think the rfcs should be filed jointly with the evidence on ib's going to show that he mainly operates as a "meatpuppet" of ucrg. the claim would be stronger if we filed them together, i think.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 15:24, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I advise keeping UCRG's sockpuppet info on IB's RFC for now as I'm thinking of copying the information to both pages. the informaton is currently not on UCRG's RFC and I'm thinking putting all the sock/meat puppet evidence on both pages would make it easier for users to see the pattern on both pages. I know guidelines say keep the charges seperate but when we are alleging meatpuppetry what else can we do? This info would be an addition to UCRG's RFC. I made some edits to your intro paragraph. --<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 19:29, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, I was thinking of filing them tomorrow to give others a chance of looking them over and adding any info.

<dd>Ok, Aeon. I've emailed Steve, and he suggested I file UCRGrad's RFC. So, I will do that within the next hour, notify everyone who worked on these, and see where it goes from there.

<p>There are a couple of different things going on here UCRG, but please don't jump to conclusions. Aeon knows that I'm interested in becoming more involved in the "processes" of <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a> and he invited me to comment there as a courtesy, <b>not</b> an attempt at collusion. While I respect Aeon's work I would never make a comment <i>anywhere</i> just for the sake of supporting another editor. Several editors send me pointers to various "controversies" and ask for my input, but it is <i>always</i> with the understanding that I will be voicing my honest independent (and hopefully rational) opinions, not automatically supporting their's. That was exactly the case in this situation. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 20:57, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You have recently either supported my userbox consolidation efforts or at least applauded them. Currently, I am putting together another larger batch of userbox deletions which will have master templates. (The master templates are not "live" yet.) Would you be willing to support me in this and any future consolidations? There will probably be a lot of resistance at first to this, so having a group of people supporting me would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>At the moment, 5 master userboxes are in the works to replace 72. That may increase significantly if I can get the sixth one to work as I would like. Some of the templates to be replaced are widely used, but with the consolidated templates there is more funcitionability.</p>

<dd>Hi Lady Aleena, as noted in an earlier discussion with you, I think consolidation is fine for thematically related userboxes. However, I also support diversity through mass customization, so I'm more inclined to support consolidations that maintain display differences in images, colors and especially wordings. That's easy enough to do with parser functions. I wish you all the best.

<dd>I don't overly care too terribly much. I will say that I think having generic userboxes is a good thing from one standpoint - it helps newbies learn Wikicode. If you can't just add {{User Hokie}} to your page but instead have optional parameters like {{User Hokie|year=2001|border=maroon|major=CS}}, that's definitely a good thing. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:21, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rfrisbie...have you thought about getting your Myers-Briggs templates deleted in favor of the combined one that Thadman created? That would be another 18 deleted. I did a survey of how many people were using each...</p>
<p>Some people have more than one of these on their user pages, so some of those are duplicates. I know that some look like a lot of people use them, but once we get people migrating from individual templates to master templates, it will get easier and easier to consolidate them. Hopefully we can keep user templates in Template space if we can show that we can police them. - <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELady_Aleena_2b68.html" title="User:Lady Aleena">LA</a> @ 22:48, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi LA, of course, we all know they're not “my” templates. I just moved some to userspace as part of the effort to find a userbox compromise most people could live with. I wasn’t kidding when I said I support diversity in userboxes. Although I think Thadman’s userbox {{<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Userbox_MBTI_b195.html" title="User:The Thadman/Userbox/MBTI">User:The Thadman/Userbox/MBTI</a>}} is cool, it displays differently than the others – only one color scheme with a set of profile scores – and it doesn’t use categories . I don’t have any problem with it or another template designed to consolidate the existing features of the other boxes for “elegance” reasons, <i>as long as no features are lost</i>. However, I do not see a “need” to do it. On a web site that went from 1 million articles to over 1.25 million in about four months, I really consider the number of userbox pages to be a non-issue. I’m also not aware of any material debates on keeping userboxes in templatespace <i>if</i> someone polices them. Maybe you can show me a link or two on that. In this particular case, it’s even more superfluous because all personality boxes already are in userspace (User:Rfrisbie/Userboxes/Personality) <b>and</b> the Wikipedia directory page was deleted. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Wikipedia%3AUserboxes%2FPersonality" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Wikipedia%3AUserboxes%2FPersonality" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="../../../r/f/r/User%7ERfrisbie_fdd2.html" title="User:Rfrisbie">Rfrisbie</a><sup><a href="../../../r/f/r/User_talk%7ERfrisbie_975e.html" title="User talk:Rfrisbie">talk</a></sup> 02:08, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the link. What that shows me is that you are very well-intentioned in your efforts, your rationale for this process as a means to keep userboxes in template space is not supported by consensus, and the specific case of the Myers-Briggs templates does not apply, since they already are ugly in userspace. Sorry, I'm still not convinced of the need or consensus to do this. However, if you're still interested in combining the boxes for "efficiency," without changing the displays or categories, it's fine with me. <a href="../../../r/f/r/User%7ERfrisbie_fdd2.html" title="User:Rfrisbie">Rfrisbie</a><sup><a href="../../../r/f/r/User_talk%7ERfrisbie_975e.html" title="User talk:Rfrisbie">talk</a></sup> 12:13, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have made four of those master templates live. I will not start the TfD process on the ones they are replacing for at least a week. I want to see how well they catch on without a TfD first.

<dd>Yes, and I was tempted to broadcast it more widely, but waited until I heard from you. Limiting the number of participants seems to have both advantages and disadvantages: It's <i>a lot</i> easier to get a reasonable dialogue going between 2 people than 7. OTOH, the larger situation (of editing the article itself) will require a consensus among all participants.

Thank you for your suggestion. At this point I think things are moving along better than they had been, so I don't think that mediation is necessary as of right now. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsert-Belltower_b83a.html" title="User:Insert-Belltower">Insert-Belltower</a> 23:31, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello again. I just wanted to say that even though you weren't my advocate for the UC Riverside article dispute, I must say that I was absolutely appalled by your actions as Insert-Belltower's advocate. Honestly, I think you're a good person. I think you were trying to be fair. I think that you were trying to do what you thought was right, and you were frustrated that I-B was being himself, while Amerique et al were being "especially nice" to win you over. However, what you SHOULD have done, in my opinion, was do what you promised to do - be Insert-Belltower's advocate. Your duty was not to be the judge or to decide who was right. Your responsibility to I-B was to be his advocate, to represent him, and to be act in his best interests. A good analogy would be a public defender representing a child molester. Even though that public defender likely disagrees greatly with his client's actions, he still has a fundamental and ethical duty to represent that child molester and act in his client's best interests. You are clearly unable to do this. You immediately took sides in the case, and you make excuses for it (i.e. blame Insert-Belltower). ...and to add icing on the cake, you completely breached the trust held in you and you started actively assisting Insert-Belltower's opposition, using the knowledge and trust he had placed in you. It doesn't GET any more unethical and irresponsible than that, in my eyes. Someone who has demonstrated such gross inability or unwillingness to act on someone's behalf without letting your personal beliefs/opinions get in the way should NOT be an advocate on WP. I hereby request that you permanently resign from the AMA. I have attached the following as a skeleton account of your advocacy for I-B:</p>
<p>Copy/pasted: I am concerned about the recent behavior of Aeon1006, a volunteer advocate of Wikipedia’s Association of Members’ Advocates (AMA).</p>
<p>It has come to my attention that Aeon1006 violated the trust of his client, Insert-Belltower, and acted in such a manner that was unbecoming of an advocate.</p>
<p>The facts of the matter are as follows:</p>
<p>On July 11, 2006, Aeon1006 agreed to be an advocate for Insert-Belltower, who was seeking help defending against hostile efforts of editors Amerique and WHS.</p>
<p>On July 12, 2006, Aeon1006 sought statements from Insert-Belltower (I-B), but strangely, also an opposing opinion’s from I-B’s direct opposition, Amerique and WHS. He did so without consulting with his client, I-B.</p>
<p>On July 12, 2006, Aeon1006 requested that ElKevbo bring his opinion into the discussion. ElKevbo was a party known to oppose I-B, and his testimony was in opposition to I-B’s cause.</p>
<p>On July 13, 2006, WHS (opposing side) complained to Aeon1006 that Insert-Belltower had made unauthorized changes to his user talk page. In response, Aeon1006 wrote “Thank you I will investigate that and notify Mackensen [admin].” Instead of advocating on behalf of his client, Aeon1006 attempted to bring charges against Insert-Belltower with the admins. In fact, he ratted out his client to this admin on his talk page.</p>
<p>On July 14, 2006, Aeon1006 attempted to required all editors to obey the “fairness of tone” policy in their TALK discussions. However, Aeon1006 erroneously applied WP:NPOV#Fairness_of_tone to TALK discussion, when this rule specifically applies to article content.</p>
<p>On July 15, 2006, Aeon1006 demanded, in a public discussion, that his own client apologize to individuals for sockpuppetry, even though I-B’s alleged sockpuppetry did not actually affec any of these particular individuals (occurred at a different time).</p>
<p>On July 15, 2006, Aeon1006 wrote that his client was “stubborn.”</p>
<p>On July 16, 2006, Aeon1006 began assisting I-B’s direct opposition, Amerique – volunteering to submit an RfC against I-B’s side of the disagreement. As an advocate, Aeon1006 had access to privileged and confidential information from I-B – Aeon1006 now violates that privileged role and has agreed to use his knowledge to support the party that originally opposed his client.</p>
<p>A quick read through each of Aeon1006’s statements on his desk reveals that NONE of his comments were in support of his client. About a third of them were in opposition to I-B, and another third were essentially praising I-B’s opposition. As you can see, even from day #1, (July 12), Aeon1006 failed to fulfill his duty as I-B’s advocate, despite his promise to do so. It is certainly possible that Aeon1006 did not agree with his client’s position. If that were the case, then the appropriate and responsible action, under his duty as AMA advocate, would be to let I-B know that he couldn’t represent him. Instead, Aeon1006 took actions that hurt his client’s position. Aeon1006 never gave I-B the benefit of the doubt, or discussed with him in private the best way to handle the case. A quick review of I-B’s talk page will reveal almost zero help from Aeon1006. The last straw, was when Aeon1006 took advantage of his role as confidant and privileged position as I-B’s advocate to file an RfC against I-B’s party on behalf of Amerique, I-B’s direct opposition.</p>
<p>All of the above can be confirmed by reading Aeon1006's talk page, where he supposedly acted as an advocate for I-B, but instead hindered him and supported his opposition instead. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aeon1006/AMA" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aeon1006/AMA" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aeon1006/AMA</a></p>
<p>REGARDLESS of whether I-B was in the right or wrong (and I believe I-B has been a valuable editor), Aeon1006’s conduct as supposed-advocate was a breach of trust and highly unprofessional. In fact, Aeon1006 would be hard pressed to demonstrate that he offered any advocacy at all, especially in the context of all the harm he did in his role. Such behavior is not consistent with the core goals and values of the Association of Member’s Advocates. Aeon1006 should not have the opportunity to violate the trust of another editor again. As such, I hereby request that Aeon1006 be removed from the AMA. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> (<a href="../../../u/c/r/User_talk%7EUCRGrad_ca37.html" title="User talk:UCRGrad">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_UCRGrad_090e.html" title="Special:Contributions/UCRGrad">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li>Probably as a result of the less than salutory experience he had recently, Aeon has already resigned from the AMA...you'd be posting directly under his resignation. Several of your comments have led me to believe you're missing a fundamental point: this is not the Real World, this is not Academia, this is Wikipedia. There are no professional advocates here...just people trying to help. Throughout this process Aeon has <i>tried to help</i>. You may not appreciate the form his assistance took, you may not be happy with the outcome, but he was trying to help. Especially after he has recently gone out of his way to promote mediation and other, less formal methods of dispute resolution, I regard this posting as a very shabby thing indeed. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 06:10, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In retrospect I was being too charitable. <b>This post is an <a href="../../../b/a/l/WP%7EBALLS_8227.html" title="WP:BALLS">utter crock of shit!</a></b> The "letter" to the AMA is actually a reprint of a 10 day old post which Aeon had already responded to.

<dd>Actually, you're not correct. The letter I wrote above was in response to my discovering that Aeon1006 had started engaging in other "roles of trust" on WP, namely he is now a mediator. The "evidence" that follows was copy/pasted from an AMA letter that was deleted and not responded to. Aeon1006 never really responded to these allegations at all. If I am incorrect, I would sure like to see a link. I firmly believe that mediators should be neutral, and for the above numerous reasons, I do not believe that Aeon1006 can be so. Furthermore, I do not believe that Doc Tropics can be neutral either, seeing as how he posted his opinion on an RfC BEFORE the accused party had even written a response AND because Doc Tropics was also an online friend of one of accusing parties. I understand the need for your to "stick up" for your friend here, but there really is no basis for your accusations that this was "mean-spirited attack." In fact, you're completely missing the big picture here - that Aeon1006 completely and unquestionably violated the trust of his client and turned against the very person he had promised to help.</dd>

<p>Hi, Aeon. I noticed that the WP:STALK section was added to the RfC page when I went to go add the timestamp to my endorsements. I'm glad that more evidence has been acquired so that we can potentially put an end to UCRGrad's contentious behavior, but I'm sorry that it had to come at the cost of you getting dragged into the ugly mess that he's left. Hopefully this episode will soon come to an end. Regards. --<a href="../../../w/h/s/User%7EWHS_187f.html" title="User:WHS">WHS</a> 02:38, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Dear Aeon,</p>
<p>Thank you for note on my talk page. While I 'personally' accept your offer at reconcilliation, I still that believe that your actions have harmed myself and others that were involved in the dispute resolution process. Thus, I still intend to pursue the complaint process to the full extent possible. I have still have a problem with the following:</p>
<p>1.) You sided against me against me in the dispute resolution process, and did not assume good faith. Although you did have concerns and questions about my prior actions, it would have been better if you consulted me before jumping to conclusions and then rebuking me on the dispute TALK page.</p>
<p>2.) You filed an RFC against me that, in my view, was unsubstantiated and lacked merit.</p>
<p>In order for this to be completely resolved, I will ask the you do the following: 1) Apologize for the RFC and write a note on it that now acknowledges that it was without merit, 2) remove yourself all advocacy groups for the time of 6 months. IF you do both these things, I will retract the formal complaint, and you and I will be "cool."</p>

<p>I wasn't aware that Esperanza organized userpage makeovers. I am pleasantly surprised, however I'm not sure that I want help from someone who has gone from merely ornery to enraged in the last few hours.&#160;:) Changing it is one of those things that's perpetually at the bottom of my to do list. I left the message on my page so that if someone felt inclined and inspired they would know they had permission. I don't really have any specific ideas and most of the syntax stuff I can figure out when I decide I want something (like the message me box at the top).

<p>Hey, Aeon. I want to say that I'm sorry again that you've somehow gotten caught in the wake of disruption that has left behind as a result of the UCR article. I've also noticed your Wikistress has been increasing lately, so I just wanted to let you know that you shouldn't take these personal attacks against you too seriously. It's just Wikipedia, afterall. In anycase, I think you've conducted yourself well, especially considering the circumstances, and I hope this whole situation clears up and your Wikirelaxation or whatever you'd call it goes up again.

<p>Geez for someone who has "left" you are sure on a hell of a lot.</p>
<p>You ought to read what Kelly Martin has to say on this behavior, here is a small quote:</p>
<p><i>Very often, a goodbye message is not an attempt to leave, but an attempt to draw all the attention upon oneself. In this way it is typically PassiveAggressive, as an intrinsically NonViolent act--the RightToLeave--is turned around to become a vehicle for violence. If it helps you think of it, the GoodBye message is seen as the author as a means to punish the rest of the community for failing him or her. As in, "Fine, I'll show you. I'm out of here."</i></p>

<dd>Even still it's not exactly a terribly appropriate thing to point out, and if you want to see him again is definitely <i>not</i> the way to say goodbye. Regardless, after just meeting you in a way I can't really give a good wikieulogy of sorts, but I will say that for someone who seems to have such talent in this leaving without a trace or a goodbye is a tad bit odd.
