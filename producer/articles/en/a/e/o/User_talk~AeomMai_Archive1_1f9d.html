<p>Hi, thanks for your message and suggestion. If you follow the history of the Qadianism article you will see that it was up for deletion/merger/redirection some time back [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Qadianism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Qadianism" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. The final decision was to merge and redirect. I believe that the decision was correct since most of the information on the Qadianism page is already present on the ahmadi page. However having a seperate article about Qadianism is also not a bad idea for two reasons: 1. The term "Qadianism" is used quite widely (mainly because of its derogatory connotations). 2. Having a seperate page for Qadianism helps cear up the ambiguity between the Ahmadiyya movement and Qadianism. The Qadianism page clearly states that it is other muslims you like to use this term for the Ahmadiyya movement. This ofcourse is my point of view - there may be better ways to present a npov. Please do discuss any issue you may have about the ahmadiyya pages. also you have as much right to edit wikipedia as anyone else. feel free to make any changes you believe will be an improvement (keeping wikipedia policy in mind). best regards <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 04:40, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>== Hi and Thanks for comments ==</p>
<p>Well I am a information juncky and try to improve my self, some time it is necessary to know about something just to understand it. I belief in God and try to find truth, I think our goal is same. "To find and understand the reality" any way, it is easy to have lots of information these days, it is not the matter of belief but to know something. Your suggestion to see Qadianism page, well I will look on it and see what can I do with it, you seems to have also good understanding of the matter, may be we can both work on it, regards <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 01:02, 2 May 2006 (UTC) Also need to know that what part of this page you want to improve, is there any particular aspect you are thinking to check, will be happy to hear your comments <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 01:39, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I may venture some advice: when working on an emotionally volatile topic such as the Ahmadiyya movement, it may be a good idea to give explicit reasons for why you are making a particular change. You can use the edit summary or if you need more space you can use the discussion page. Also if you are planing to make a change that you feel is likely to be controversial it will probably be better to discuss your proposed change on the discussion page before going ahead. This way there is less likely hood of starting an edit war. Also if you have a fair, logical and documented reason as to why you made the changes it will be easier for you to defend your position in case an edit war does ensue. It is also polite to inform any long time editors of a page directly if you are going to make drastic changes. Best regards and and best of luck. <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazli_42f2.html" title="User:Nazli">Nazli</a> 03:55, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The status of Ahmadi, Qadiani, Lahori etc. has been settled by 1974 constitutional amendment. The only result of continued controversy will be negative for Qadiani community in Pakistan.

<p>Ok if you consider it neutral than its Ok, but I will see how long your recent edit, will stay because user siddiqui, will repeat his attitude once again, regards.. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 22:47, 10 May 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>I hope not.. but what I meant every time you put some informative on this artical you just get a simple reversion to previous his own version, without any explainaton, because he thinks he is right.. thats the impression.. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 22:52, 10 May 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>No it not surprising at all infact, this just shows the mental state of the person, now I have no Idea what happend before between Yahya01 and Siddiqui, but I think it may be the same thing, he may have right something and siddiqui had revert it, without explaination <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 23:22, 10 May 2006 (UTC) Hi I made some minor improvement in your text on Qadianism Page <i>(<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 00:58, 11 May 2006 (UTC))</i></p>

<p>Hi, sorry for the rather delayed response, I was tied up with life outside of Wikipedia. Regarding your query - if you feel that your edits are being unfairly reverted then the first step is to try all efforts to communicate the problem to the repective editors and try to find a soloution. If that does not work and the other party is very unreasonable you can try contacting a administrator for advice on how to deal with the issue.

<p>Contrary to Siddiqui's claims above, the decision on whether or not to turn the article into a re-direct has already been made, and Siddiqui cannot unilaterally overturn <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">Wikipedia consensus</a> just because he disagrees. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 04:45, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's no article on House Frey.

<dd>I noticed you asked Arbor a question about the Freys. As I mentioned in the latest update to the article, Stevron was the one who died from wounds taken in the battle with Stafford Lannister's armies at Oxcross. The one killed by the Brotherhood Without Banners after Jaime sent him away was Ryman Frey, Stevron's eldest son. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendan_Moody_0029.html" title="User:Brendan Moody">Brendan Moody</a> 21:06, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just wondering if you can share your thaught on subject matter. Do you belief that physically Jesus was raised to heaven and he is still alive&#160;? <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 22:11, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes offcourse you can, I belief the human hand is necessary other wise no religion can grow, however, in which way you use your hand, is questionable. Having said that, I belief that Isa was not raised by God physically because it is not possible because of rules, which set by God himself. If you belief that the Isa is still alive then you have to accept also that he is Son of God!, why if you remember one sura of Quraan where some one ask Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) that if he true prophet, he should climb to heaven and bring proove then they will accept him immediately, and as you know he replied, that My Lord is pure from these nonsence, and I am a human. Now its clearly indicate that for a Human prophet its not possible to live physically in Heaven, so there are two possiblities and one is correct, you choose yourself, Either Isa is Son of God and he is still alive in Heaven, then people who belief that should join the Chris community or He was dead like all other Prophets and will not come back. you can choose regards <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 01:17, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You know the True Words of God is relative statement, that is why there is so many problem among the believers. Any way I think I asked about your openion about Hazrat Isa's decent to earth.. I am still waiting for your kind reply can you say something on this matter <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 17:20, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>ok then what happend with him do you belief God took him to Heaven and still alive&#160;? and he will come back&#160;? <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 16:05, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I belief that it is never possible for any human ever lived on this earth to live outside earth without earthly necessities, but that long, as Muslim belief Hazrat Isa (Peace be upon him) alive is.. this is clear violation of the Rules made by Allah. About the question of where he lived his later life.. well it is just the matter of belief, hard evidence may never be found.. any way, I like to work on physics projects, currently I am working on a Electric Generator which runs its own produced energy, as a self relient machine and prodice enough energy to use for other purposes also..

<p>If you say leav other to them, then they should leave the matter also right&#160;?, it is the basic mistak you make some time, in discussion, you should provide your statements and relevent prooves and other should do the same. In this whole discussion page, it is easy to see the different statements from different writers, so are you and me. As matter of fact I was thinking to ask you that why should people with belief the Jesus will return later some time back to earth, join the Christianity. At first they belief that Jesus is not son of God, but at the same time they belief that he is alive in heaven, and they also belief he was human.. well I think when a Chris ask them, when Kufar of Arab Asked the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) to climb to heaven and come back, he replied that my Lord is free of these non-sences and I am only Human&#160;! then how can a Human Prohphet like Jesus (PBUH) can go to heaven&#160;? if he is in the heaven then they should also acknowledge that he is Son of God and should Join the Christianity. what you say&#160;?? <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 23:11, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
