<p>I've just read the section on IPA on your user page and I sympathize. And I hope you never come across the German wikipedia where nobody would listen to such reasons when I tried to improve the way IPA is represented. Two side-thoughts: I'm not convinced of the use of <i>class="nounderlines"</i> since it's ultimately always a client side decision how the links are displayed. If a browser displays all links with default underline, then there's no way to override this. A possible reason why you have a IPA list to copy-paste might be that you're not using an IPA keyboard. I'm using a SIL IPA keyboard and it's a great aid for IPA input, see <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/Input" class="external free" title="http://scripts.sil.org/Input" rel="nofollow">http://scripts.sil.org/Input</a>. Of course, you might have plenty of other reasons, but I thought that link could be helpful if you weren't aware of that possibility yet. -- <a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._%27mach%27_wust_cfe4.html" title="User:J.

<p>I see from you talk page that linguistics is among your interests. Therefore the following advice will be useful for you whether you will like it or not. When disputing meanings of words you better consult an explanatory dictionary in the corresponding language, rather than a bilingual dictionary. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 16:58, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but the changes you made to attempt to fix your double-sized row problem result in the headers on the right end of the table being misaligned on my screen. If you want to fix this double-sized row problem without causing problems for anyone else, why not try (a) reducing your browser's text size setting, or (b) increasing your computer's screen resolution, if you use a CRT monitor?

<p>The voiced symbols ([b], [z]...) are supposed to inherently represent lenis sounds and the voiceless symbols ([t], [s]...) fortis sounds, since those are considered the default combinations. To represent voiced fortis and voiceless lenis sounds (the unusual combinations), one uses the symbol according to its inherent tenseness and a diacritic to alter the voicing, so a voiced fortis sibilant is represented as [s̬] rather than [z]. I'm not inventing this usage; right now I can't remember where I first learned about it, but you can check an academic reference for example <a href="http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/sounds-of-the-IPA.PDF" class="external text" title="http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/sounds-of-the-IPA.PDF" rel="nofollow">here</a> (look on page 6 toward bottom, where it says <i>"A voiceless lenis alveolar plosive [d̥ɑ]"</i> and <i>"A voiced fortis alveolar fricative [s̬ɑ]"</i>). This usage is also mentioned in a casual conversation in the <i>Linguaphiles</i> LiveJournal <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/linguaphiles/2062002.html" class="external text" title="http://community.livejournal.com/linguaphiles/2062002.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> (<i>"AFAIK, there isn't a diacritic for tenseness. [d] is inherently lenis; by adding the diacritic for "voiceless" (i.e. circle below), you get a symbol for a voiceless lenis alveolar stop"</i>). Note: The Extended IPA symbols for "strong" and "weak" articulation can be used to explicitly notate tenseness (though AFAIK they are seldom used), so that [s̬] (implicitly) and [z͈] (explicitly) would both indicate a voiced fortis sibilant (although the first would be more appropriate when the sound has some phonological relation to the voiceless fortis [s], as is precisely the case with the Spanish allophone of "s" in <i>desde</i>). Another Extended IPA usage is to indicate partial phonations (such as half-voiced) by using parentheses around the voicing diacritics, but I think this is not supported by Unicode so far. <a href="../../../u/a/x/User%7EUaxuctum_57d1.html" title="User:Uaxuctum">Uaxuctum</a> 04:42, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The PDF I referenced above is the script of a cassette recording by a professor of phonetics from the prestigious <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_College_London_3428.html" title="University College London">University College London</a>. I haven't had the opportunity to hear that recording yet, but if he made recordings of <i>"A voiceless lenis alveolar plosive"</i> and of <i>"A voiced fortis alveolar fricative"</i>, labelling them clearly as lenis and fortis independently of their voicing, it must be for a reason. Besides, read the article on <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortis_%28phonetics%29.html#Tenseness" title="Fortis (phonetics)">tenseness</a>. It says that the phonetic [f] pronounced in Ewe has a stronger articulation than the phonetic [f] heard in other languages (even though both are phonemically /f/), and that this is due to Ewe distinguishing bilabial from labiodental fricatives, so that the stronger-than-usual articulation [f͈] of Ewe serves to make the phonemic distinction /ɸ/ vs. /f/ more accoustically perceptible than it would be using the weaker [f] sound heard in other languages (which itself is stronger than the even-weaker sound [v]). I remember when I was learning English; I first tried to pronounce English [v] the way it is usually described, i.e. "a voiced version of [f]". However, I could notice the sound I was getting by merely voicing an [f] was not quite it. I knew there was something I was doing wrong, but it took me some time to realize that English [v] was pronounced "less strongly" than what one gets by merely voicing an [f] (i.e., less "strongly" than a voiced <i>fortis</i> [f̬]). The sounds [v] in English <i>love</i> and [f̬] in Spanish <i>afgano</i> are different. I can perceive that difference; that's why I find it inappropriate to use [v] to represent the voiced fortis allophone in <i>afgano</i>, even though I agree it may be difficult to pinpoint what exactly is the underlying phenomenon that creates that perception (though I suspect it may be VOT). My subjective impression of the phonetic difference is that in [v] the voiced quality is accoustically more salient than the fricativity, while in [f̬] the fricative quality is more salient than the voicing. <a href="../../../u/a/x/User%7EUaxuctum_57d1.html" title="User:Uaxuctum">Uaxuctum</a> 19:22, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have provided a reference showing that reputable linguists make use of a distinction in tenseness independent of voicing (which contradicts your personal assertion that "in totality the only difference between [v] and [f] is voicing"), and when I have given my own opinions I have marked them as such and tried to reason them. And it's not what "I" describe in Ewe, is what the Wikipedia article on tenseness describes as the <i>phonetic</i> difference between the actual <i>sounds</i> used for the /f/ phoneme in Ewe ([f͈]) and for the /f/ phoneme in other languages ([f]). We won't get anywhere if instead of trying to discuss with arguments and references you just try to discredit me with ad hominem attacks like suggesting that I have "never heard a fully voiced f" (pardon?) or that I'm "guilty of original research" (in any case, representing the voiced allophone as [f̬], which is perfectly standard IPA and a reasonable choice since it represents the voicing of a voiceless [f] by influence from the neighbouring sound, is <i>not</i> original research). <a href="../../../u/a/x/User%7EUaxuctum_57d1.html" title="User:Uaxuctum">Uaxuctum</a> 22:39, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your reverts on my edit were unwarranted. I am going to insert an example for Japanese to appease you. I believe the Spanish example was referring to some specific dialects of European Spanish, whereas it is an approximant in most other dialects. Riverense is taken directly from the article (if you disagree with it, then claim it's unsourced on the Riverense page). Secondly, it is very obvious that you tried to disguise your edits under a template change, when really you were attempting to put an interpretation of IPA.

<p>Greetings A+lots of vowels,</p>
<p>I noticed you reverted my spelling changes to the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingala_language.html" title="Lingala language">Lingala language</a> article. I disagree with them, but can't override the Wikipedia style guide, &gt;:( but give me time.&#160;:)</p>
<p>On another front, I thought I'd pick your linguistic brain for input on the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary_talk:IPA_pronunciation_key|name" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary_talk:IPA_pronunciation_key|name" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary IPA pronunciation Key Talk page</a>. See if my questions and comments at "Excellent resource...and recommended changes" will keep you busy for a bit while I sneak a few changes back into the Lingala page&#160;:). I look forward to your feedback. --<a href="../../../d/b/l/User%7EDblomgren_c6e4.html" title="User:Dblomgren">Dblomgren</a> 19:15, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have sent this proposal to the top wiki administarators:</p>
<p>I propose a new major sister project of wikipedia WikiLanguages or WikiLinguistics which specializes in the teaching of all languages. I have looked over the internet and have found some sites which do have several of the major languages giving knowledge of learning them but this wuould be huge and would provide all the information for learning languages such as most of the 250 languages that already have wikipedias. Learning a language is a major infomration source but wikipedia does not have this in detail. I beleive this wikipedia sister project would be developed into an extremwely valuable resoruce not only for achieving knowledge of major languages but also other world languages which are not always readily available to learn. Also many of the existing webistes which do atempt to provide some learning of language often involve a subscription and are not free.</p>
<p>If it is created I would hope that say five years down the line we should have the ultimate language learning resource in the world. If everybody contributes from their respective countris and knowledge of their languages we could see a resource which could allow you to potentially become fluent in hundreds of languages. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 12:08, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I strongly beleive this is what providing free easily accessible information is what wikipedia is all about and think this is an extrmely valuable component missing from the Wikipedia Foundation. E.g if I wanted to learn <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegian.html" title="Norwegian">Norwegian</a> or <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech.html" title="Czech">Czech</a> or FInnish at the highest possible level or whatever this resource would be there to provide this knowledge. WikiLanguages would be divided into 250 or whatever massive sub projects e.g WikiFrench WikiSpanish WikiNorwegian WikiFinnish WikiDutch WIkiItalian WIkiPortuguese WIkiThai WikiJapanese etc etc dedicated to providing an English encylopedia of languages<a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 12:13, 21 December 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p>Imagine if this major sister project could incorporate translation technology - imagine the immese benefit for learning but also for tranlsation from foreign wikipedias. This would be a highly useful tool for Wikipedia itself. The site could also incorpate audio technology so the resoruce would not only provide you with the detail to reading and writing a language fluently but provide you with the knoe how to pronouncre and speak a language well. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 12:28, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I strongly beleive that this is the next step for the Wikipedia Media series. The series attempts to connect the world up entirely providing 'the sum of all human knowedge freely' but I think a key to commuinication is language- a vital part of the project.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you think this is a good idea. I would like to organize a proposal petition with the top wikipedia foundation administrators to decide to start this. WikiLanguages would also provide specializes knowledge of localized dialects or whatever -the ultimate global language resource. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 12:40, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see you have done a super job on establishing the basics but this would take things to the next level to attempt to provide the knowledge of learning every language fluently. Each section of the WIkiLanguages would have a WIkiFrench or WIkiPortuguese etc sub project each with its own detailed language dictionary and hundreds of pages to attempt to teach the languages fluently. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 13:23, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi yes what I meant was one seperate Sister project WikiLanguages which would combine teaching 250+languages fluently. Each as I said WIkiFrench WikiSpanish etc wouold be all of the many sub projects of it. I have notcied that Wikiversity and books are attempting this but I believe that to teach 250 languages or whatever is massive and should have a website of its own rather than part of the WIkiversity. At present it is extremely poor in this and I didn't even know it existed with the Wikiversity. There should be one seperate site for languages. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 22:29, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

E,g look at main page of wikipedia I would prefer it to be like this with the project WikiLanguages in the left corner. I would like a seperate site easily accessible site where you can learn all these languages not jus tthe basic phrases but seriously flunetly with perahps a thosuand odd pages for each language <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 22:32, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I've noticed your contributions to the AAVE page, and I want to thank you for maintaining a scientific attitude towards this language variety. This article is very close to me, and I want the Wikipedia article to reflect the reality of AAVE, not some media stereotype of Black slang. On that note, I was thinking of putting up a chart of Well's lexical sets for AAVE. I'm trying to get AAVE formatted more like the articles for other varieties of English (There are more AAVE speakers than Australian English ones!), so I'd ideally like to have a phonology chart up, but I don't have the technical knowledge about how to do that (I'm a little bit new at this). If I put up a lexical sets chart, would you put up an IPA chart? <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakerowner_af62.html" title="User:Makerowner">Makerowner</a> 05:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, I meant that I would make a chart of the lexical sets that Wells invented (Kit, Trap, Dress, etc.) I thought that once I put up the lexical sets, you could put a vowel chart up from that. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakerowner_af62.html" title="User:Makerowner">Makerowner</a> 03:44, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. I'm puzzled by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=African_American_Vernacular_English&amp;diff=103897045&amp;oldid=103858585" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=African_American_Vernacular_English&amp;diff=103897045&amp;oldid=103858585" rel="nofollow">this edit of yours</a>. You added Smitherman's <i>Talkin that Talk,</i> among others. Since our somewhat underinformed fellow editor was (justifiably) moaning about the unexplained references to "Smitherman", I ignored this bibliographical datum and popped into the library today to borrow every book by her that was on the shelf. I found that every Smitherman citation was not from <i>Talkin that Talk</i> but instead from her much earlier and entirely different book <i>Talkin and Testifyin.</i> Thus your edit made the article not more informative or helpful but instead quite misleading. If you were sleepy and put in the information about a single wrong book, OK; but the horrible thought occurs to me that you may have committed the freshman undergraduate gaffe of merely <i>guessing</i> what each reference was about. If you did do that, please remove any other guesswork, and promptly; if (as I hope) you didn't, my apologies for the suggestion. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:23, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand that maybe you should take a look at it yourself. Russian is listed as number 8. Directing me to that page only solidifies my position. Please discuss the issue in the article's talk page before making any changes. I'm reverting your edit again and will consider a repetition of your edit to be vandalism. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><strong class="selflink"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></strong></span> 03:56, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No way. Russian is listed as number 7 and Japanese is listed as number 8. You should look at it very carefully.--219.125.6.248 04:01, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You ought to look at it again. There apparantly has been a dispute about the inclusion of Arabic and edit warring on the matter bumps the number of the other languages up or down. And for future reference, it's rarely constructive to not wait for a response before restoring edits your believe are correct. Usually one comment will not convince another editor and you reduce the chance of an edit war by giving the courtesy of waiting. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">Æµ§œš¹</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><strong class="selflink"><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></strong></span> 04:18, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, I have checked all the sources for these languages and they are pretty accurate. I had a source on Amami (a Japonic language ) and it had a dental fricative with its wordlist. I will try to find more. All of the Yukon Athabaskan languages are from the YNLC. <a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzalea_pomp_8528.html" title="User:Azalea pomp">azalea_pomp</a></p>

<p>I certainly sympathize with your announcement <i>I move that we table the "social criticism"/Cosby discussion on this talk page.</i> I'm less enamored of the idea that Dude Man might return to my talk page in order to continue banging on about this. Or to your talk page or to anyone else's.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are things to discuss (among sane people who are willing to look inside books, at least). Immediately above this suggestion of yours, we see Makerowner making the surprising remark <i>I think the article should</i> emphasize <i>the popular opinion of AAVE, because this is an important part of its speakers' experience of it.</i> (My emphasis of what he surely can't really want to be <i>emphasized.</i> <i>Mentioned,</i> perhaps?) Makerowner continues reassuringly: <i>It should be made clear, obviously, that linguists reject all these criticisms.</i> Well, it all needs discussion, and you can't discuss something while excluding one person from the discussion, however certain you (and I) might be that he'll contribute nothing of value and merely waste others' time.</p>
<p>Those matters aside, I don't think one can forbid discussion in an article's talk page of one ingredient in that article. If only one person claims it is an ingredient and everybody else disagrees, then (perhaps) OK; but I too must sadly join Makerowner in conceding that ignorance of AAVE has been significant and thus deserves a mention (though a very different kind of mention from that which Dude Man and the "mediator" want). -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:18, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gotcha. Without actually bothering to look up the verb "table" in a dictionary, I'll say that I thought it also meant "put on the agenda" or "discuss" -- that it was one of those rare words ("chuffed", "cleave") that can mean one thing and also something that's more or less its opposite. Obviously it didn't mean that here, but perhaps I was too quick to make a different misinterpretation.</dd>

<p>Thanks for the info. I had no idea there was a policy, but it makes sense as Cyrillic in italics to many of us is almost a different language. lol I was just going with the format that was already there first due to just getting the info out there and second because I am lazy! lol <a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzalea_pomp_8528.html" title="User:Azalea pomp">azalea_pomp</a></p>

<p>Hi. I've taken a quick look at Allen, W. Sidney. <i>Vox Latina</i>, and he does claim that long /i:/ had a different quality from short /i/, the latter being more open than the former. Also, long /e:/, /o:/ were more close than short /e/, /o/, according to him. I'm a little suspicious because he doesn't provide many arguments, and kind of waffles over the possibility that this difference might have been a charcateristic of late Latin, rather than classical Latin. But he does mention several ancient grammarians. I'll take a second look at it when I have the time, and reread it more carefully.</p>
<p>I still dislike deeply the use of the symbols /ɪ/ and /ʊ/ for the short vowels, because he never says they were more central than /i/ and /u/ (though he does use the <a href="../../../l/a/x/Lax_vowel.html" title="Lax vowel">vague and controversial</a> term "lax", which English speaking authors seem so fond of). Then again, he also describes the Latin short "i" as the English "i" in "bit", which has always seemed inaccurate to me... <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilipeS_f1e1.html" title="User:FilipeS">FilipeS</a> 20:56, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
