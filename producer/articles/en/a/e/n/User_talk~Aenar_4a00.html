<p>hi i am putting together an article on clairsentience , which seems to have fallen under the control of the parapsychology department , the difficulty being that they dont seem to understand the philosophical context which must be discussed to even begin talking about this issue . they talk about objectivity and neutrality , but as you and others have noted , there is no such thing and in fact some quite narrtow minded prejudices are being expressed across wikpedia on a wide range of subjects . <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesource42_31fe.html" title="User:Thesource42">Thesource42</a> 15:22, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>if wikpedia is going to have articles on people such as terence mckenna , robert anton wilson , barbara brennan , rupert sheldrake , ken wilbur etc then contibuters to these articles must be allowed to express some of the flavour and philosophy of these pioneering thinkers . knowledge if it is truly about exploration , discovery and curiosity should not be kept fozen stiff like a dead branch if it is to flourish . the rational yang is no good out of balance without the intuitive mystery and creative imagination of the yin . if psychadelic mushrooms are to be covered for example then why is the pre eminent scholar and ethnobotanist terence mckenna not referenced here. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesource42_31fe.html" title="User:Thesource42">Thesource42</a> 15:22, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>also , if someone with a progressive aproach such as rupert sheldrake given a page yet the quality and flavour of it is hacked at by vultures of dumb blind intent while elsewhere sheldrake is not considered a valid scientific source for reference by miopic wikpedians . the pedantry , rampant here where every tick and whistle is used as an escuse to hack at the body and spirit of large numgers of progressive articles across the site . it seems the closed minds here have not understood the true nature and spirit of knowledge which is a living flowing river , a living book , ever changing , always evolving . wasnt it just yesterday when " scientists told us that extra tererstrial intelligences were impossible , and didnt they keep it kina quite when they all changed their minds . hasnt the flat earth society always been this way . they starve wikpedia of the oxygen of creativity , imagination , joy , mystery .... it is rational yang out balance , which my friend is a cold dead thing with his consort , lady yin and her deep mysteries and intuition .<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesource42_31fe.html" title="User:Thesource42">Thesource42</a> 15:22, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>if your going to have a page on basrbara brennan or clairsentience then the philosophical issues must be allowed to breath and live without the bigots of empirical science hacking into the living branch.</p>
<p>if you could help me get my article into shape , specifically formating issues , it is posted on my user page for now . my main concern is that wiki formats are being abused and badly interpreted in order to vandalise to body and flavour of articles in wikpedia generally , especially ones who are discussing ideas at the forefront of eploration with regards to the object in hyperspace we are coming towards . i have referenced david bohm , lylle watson , rupert sheldrake , barbara brennan , ken wilbur , terence mckenna and robert anton wilson for this perpose , because it is the only way to establish a context for even the existence of clairsentience as an object. as i say in my article , implicit within nthe word itself is a higher dimensional sense world and higher tuned senses with which to aprehend it , therefore i have had to provide a background for understanding an alternative mechanism for both this unusual transmission of information and the existence of a more broadly defined holographic universe .<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesource42_31fe.html" title="User:Thesource42">Thesource42</a> 15:22, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>to bring a way of understanding the arrival in humanity of these new phenomena i have referenced ken wilber with regards to emergence and from pop culture , the x men and diana troy from star trk next generation to express the flavour of the idea of emerging newly evolved states of coscoussness , to which mckenna and a wilson are also allies in the understanding of other realities , shifted perception and altered states .<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesource42_31fe.html" title="User:Thesource42">Thesource42</a> 15:22, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>do you see , how , in the context of a dry empirical ration mode , none of this can be discussed , yet the existence of the word clairsentience begs for it and as i have previously said , if your going to have this word on your site then your going to have to allow it to breath its life into here . the word implies a sense which is super human and out of the range of empirical science , so in that case one cannot merely stick to entirely rational modes for describing ite place in the human mind , culture etc which is why i have had to draw on such i wide range of disciplines in order to define it . this then leads to the possibility that this subject should not be in th parapsychology section with their pretentions of science and should perhaps nest somewhere else , although each field i think mof seems inapropriate , eg . philosophy? psychadelia&#160;? altered states&#160;? spirituality&#160;? etc...<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesource42_31fe.html" title="User:Thesource42">Thesource42</a> 15:22, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>from the various things i have read in your user talk etc i can see that you have some insight (rare here ) into the irrationality and prejudices of those here claiming objectivity and neutrality and also the hypocracy of the attitides of moderators and editors with regards to who`s view are valued and who`s are not . as i have said elsewhere they hold some very closed minded philosophies yet are ignorant that they hold any philosophy at all . any help with regards the many issues ive raised here , but more specifically , with my article would be greatfully recieved. with many thanks , loon .<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesource42_31fe.html" title="User:Thesource42">Thesource42</a> 15:22, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I completely agree; that is the general tone of the article. more editing might need to be done then; for instance, most of the 2C-B etc articles start off with "an entheogen in the phenethylamine class . . . " but we have some standard usage of "entheogen" as opposed to "hallucinogen" and set up the category accordingly. --Heah 16:55, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Aenar,</p>
<p>I've reverted your edit over at <a href="../../../p/s/i/Psilocybin.html" title="Psilocybin">Psilocybin</a>, the one where you took psilocybin out of the entheogen category. Just in case I'm missing something, could you explain your reasoning for eliminating the category? I think it's a pretty good fit; psilocybin is often popularly referred to as an entheogen, and the Wiki category even contains articles about psilocybin-containing mushroom species. --<a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENeschek_113c.html" title="User:Neschek"></a> — <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENeschek_113c.html" title="User:Neschek">I.

<dl>
<dd>Hello Neschek. Please look at <a href="../../../e/n/t/Category%7EEntheogens_88f0.html" title="Category:Entheogens">Category:Entheogens</a> and its talk page, where I have described the reasoning. Regarding psilocybin, I kept <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychedelic_mushrooms.html" title="Psychedelic mushrooms">Psychedelic mushrooms</a>, but removed <a href="../../../p/s/i/Psilocybin.html" title="Psilocybin">Psilocybin</a> as the compound in itself doesn't have a history of entheogenic usages.</dd>
