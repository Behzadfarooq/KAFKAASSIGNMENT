<p>The link is to an edit of yours beginning "How old are you really? real american like you??" and is almost entirely a personal attack. You are not talking about the editorial matter. You are talking about the editor: this is known as "personal". You are being derogatory about him. This is known as "attack". I have posted a clear message on the article talk page insisting on civil conduct in what has been a very unpleasant environment. I would have blocked you already for the edit above, but I see you are a serious editor concerned for the subject, and I respect this. But you must curb your frustrations better. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 13:23, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's frustrating when he/she keeps stating that the correct sales-figures are this and that without providing any sources, well thanks for not blocking me right away, I'm gonna take it easy now. <a href="../../../a/e/n/User%7EAeneiden-Rex_0a9e.html" title="User:Aeneiden-Rex">Aeneiden-Rex</a> 13:27, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cool. I understand the frustration. Feel free to ask for intervention about the problem you stated. Sales figures without sources can be deleted immediately from the article. Simply ask for a verifiable source. It's that simple! I will leave a note on the talk page about verification. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 13:31, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a lot more latitude on the talk page. It may be that an editor will, for example, suggest something and ask for responses or if anyone can help to reference it etc. However, unsourced, POV statements have got out of hand on the MJ talk page. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 14:57, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is indeed a lot more latitude on talk pages and I have made no out of hand statements, except argubably my response ot the personal attack that was made on me as disscused above. <a href="../../../7/4/2E/User%7E74.65.39.59.html" title="User:74.65.39.59">74.65.39.59</a> 20:20, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please stop winding up the prats on the Jackson talk page. It's easier to outsmart them than insult them, be they overly pro or anti-Jackson. All that's going to happen is you'll anger them into vandelism or they'll goad you into personal attacks and you'll get blocked. By being overly protective of Jackson, you tend to make matters worse. For example, I love The Beatles another one of the worlds biggest selling acts, yet I never really feel the need to defend them. Then again, they were always intelligent and could stick up for themselves and were quite streetwise. And never got accused of kiddy-fiddling. So I can see the bind you're in. On a side note, I saw a funny Chris Rock show yesterday. He said "remeber those debates you used to have in the 80s about who was better, Prince or Michael Jackson? Prince won." Made me chuckle.

<p>The statement "Michael Jackson the biggest selling solo-artist ever" isn't verified, so it's polemical, is now disputed and is causing disruption, so should not be made in that form, if someone objects to it. Thanks.<br />
However, it would be good if <a href="../../../7/4/2E/User%7E74.65.39.59.html" title="User:74.65.39.59">74.65.39.59</a>, even if in the right here, concentrated on something more useful to wikipedia, instead of attending to what is a pretty trifling matter. It's obvious the user page is of a fan who wants to praise his favourite singer, and it's really not doing anyone any harm. I will support the amendment if you insist, but I'd prefer you to be a bit bigger than that and exercise some co-operation and tolerance by saying, "hey, it's not strictly correct, but I'm going to turn a blind eye, rather than cause a fuss and upset someone." If you're prepared to take that position, which would do you credit, please state that below. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:36, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No i'm not prepared to take that stance and "turn a blind eye", this is only your point of view and as this is Wikipedia it should not be one rule for all, one for another. So I will not agree with you that it should be turn a blind eye for one of the wikirules but be hot on all the others.

<dd>Why is it such a big deal for you? This is really just a "trifling matter" so why do you make such a big deal about it?

<p>The point of this discussion has been settled, as everyone has agreed. Aeneiden-Rex has co-operated by amending his user box, even though he plainly did not want to. Clearly a continuation of this discussion is irritating to him and he has asked 74.65.39.59 not to continue to post. As there is no need to discuss it further, any further comments can only serve to be a form of provocation and harrassment, and will be dealt with as such immediately. This is a warning. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 13:20, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, in the discussion page for the Michael Jackson article, under the "Lead statement" section (all the way at the bottom), I am proposing to include a statement from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can you please check that statement out and give your opinion on whether it should be in the article or not?
