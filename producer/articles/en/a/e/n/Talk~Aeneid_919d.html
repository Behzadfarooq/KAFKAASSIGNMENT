<p>The last is closest to the pronunciation used by the Romans. I-neigh'-id would be even closer. The first two are Anglified. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> 06:11 22 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>...since there is only one Latin pronunciation but at least three common English variants. The Latin pronunciation is arguably the correct one, is identical to one of the English pronunciations and is certainly the original one. Those are additional reasons why I think that the Latin pronunciation should come first. .-- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 14:01, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The word is not normally pronounced in English as in Latin. Of course, some academic types might pronounce it that way, but it's not the normal convention. I don't know much about Latin, so I'll take your word that its pronunciation hasn't shifted in ecclesiastical Latin or the like. Finally, the English pronunciation should come first, since this is the English Wikipedia—in the Latin version of this article, of course, the Latin pronunciation would come first (and probably be the only one listed). —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>) 08:31, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=aeneid" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=aeneid" rel="nofollow">Dictionary.com</a>, the only standard English pronunciation of <i>Aeneid</i> has the accent on the second syllable. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>) 08:49, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it just me, or does this article seem to take a bias leaning toward the fact that the teaching of the Latin language and Latin literature is no longer practiced? Should I pore through the whole thing to assure NPOV or am I being picky (and defensive, as a Latin student)? <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Cormany_3c00.html" title="User:Ed Cormany">Ed Cormany</a> 06:07 22 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's just you. The article implies -- mistakenly, I believe -- that the Aeneid is no longer required reading for Latin students but I can't see that it anywhere implies that Latin is no longer taught. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> 06:20 22 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Does the article imply even that? My intent was to explain that the <i>Aeneid</i> was part of the <b>traditional</b> curriculum: in other words, for almost 2000 years, if one learned Latin, one would eventually <i>have</i> to read the <i>Aeneid</i>. As an example, had I continued studying Latin past the 2nd year in the 1980's, that is something I would have done.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I have no information on the current practice of teaching Latin (except that the classes are getting harder to find), I can't say whether current students still must achieve this goal. For all I know, students are exposed to Latin using an <i>avant garde</i> technique of translating Shakespeare into Ciceronian periods. If a Classics teacher (or student) could state what the current practice is, I think everyone would be happy. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 20:04 22 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are (only) four Latin classes at the University of Western Ontario, and none of them have the Aeneid listed as required (though there is Cicero and Pliny in the senior classes...for the beginner classes there are just "short stories." Also, I never had Latin the opportunity to take Latin in high school, unfortuately. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 20:14 22 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will be majoring in classics beginning next year at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Michigan_a8fd.html" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, and have completed five years of high school Latin, which is a fairly common curriculum for American high schools that offer the language. The Advanced Placement program of the College Board offers two Latin assessments: AP Latin Literature and AP Latin Vergil. The latter is a year-long curriculum that is solely based on the Aeneid. Most Latin curricula do still require reading of the Aeneid, in whole or in part. Oh, and as for the avant garde approach, sounds fun, but I've never heard of it.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Cormany_3c00.html" title="User:Ed Cormany">Ed Cormany</a> 21:22 22 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I took Latin III this year in my high school in Florida and my class had to translate the first 400 lines of Book II of the Aeneid, along with some of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Next year, I'll be taking AP Vergil and AP Latin Literature, in which I'll translate more of the Aeneid, some Catullus, and some Horace. Sic, the classics are still taught in Latin classes.</dd>

<dd>In my Latin 3 advanced class at my high school, we translated the first book of the Aeneid in its entirety and read the first six books in english. Now in my senior year i will be continuing to study it in my AP Vergil class. After finishing the english a few days ago, I'm eternally greatful to Jesuit education for introducing me to this masterfully written work. 69.121.21.122 06:52, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Glad to hear it. I always enjoyed Latin poets, although I was too lazy to do really well in my Latin class. Vergil was enjoyable but I particularly liked Ovid (and still do). -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></p>
<p>Ovid has a certain flair to him. My favorite part thus far is in Pyramus and Thisbe where he compares dying Pyramus to broken plumbing.<a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanbro_d552.html" title="User:Evanbro">Evanbro</a> 03:03, Jan 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that in the influence section of the Aeneid article, it might make sense to incorporate at least one paragraph on the reception of the Aeneid--I would be willing to write that up. Another useful gauge of its influence might be Tennyson's "To Virgil."</p>

<p>Why is the only part of the story told here from the "Dido section?" If we are going to have a story section at all, I think we should put in a spoiler warning and give a complete (though brief) synopsis of the whole story.

<p>Note that "Æneid" is a mediaevalism. Virgil always spelt it "AENEID" since the Romans of his time only used separate upper case letters.

<p><b>Attention to all those who seek a translation of this epic online. Most translations you will find are the same. They are not in prose, and have a rhyme scheme. That is ludicrous! It should only have those if it is in Latin, it is the only way they would work. In English you can't possibly have it in poetic form with rhyme scheme without drastically changing the context and vocabulary. Also most translatios, in the first line, uses "arms" for <i>Arma</i> it should be "wars." Anyone taking First Year Latin would know that.

<p>Translations can and will never do justice to the <i>Aeneid</i> nor any other work. As for your complaint on the first line, if you wanted to be overtly correct, "wars" would work. But if you've read the <i>Aeneid</i>, you'll know that many words don't make sense per se. Take, for instance, the use of <i>tecta</i>, literally "rooves," to mean "houses." It's a figure of speech known as synecdoche, and it's what poets do. As any first year Latin student would know, literally, yes, it's "wars," but, as any student of Vergil would know, such a literal translation would do little justice to Vergil's mastery of the language. Thus, any translation I'll like will begin "I sing of arms and of the man." --Aekarn 02:33, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't think 'wars' is ever the most natural translation of 'arma'. Usually it should be translated (literally) as 'arms', with 'wars' a possible alternate meaning by synecdoche --172.142.147.231 18:25, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the context section of this article, it claims that the Greeks were respected by Romans, but after just finishing my class on Roman and Greek civilization, we were taught that the Romans certainly looked down apon the Greeks, while incorporating aspects of their society, the Romans did so with a sense of superiority (For example, most Romans were bi-lingual basically because they wanted to "prove" that they were "better" than the Greeks)</p>
<p>I think this should probably be changed as if one looks into the history of their culture, one would see that this line of the section isn't necessairly correct KurtFF8 23:15, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
You Grossly over-simplify. The Romans did not simply "look up to" or "look down on" the Greeks. Like all people, they were a little more complex than that. Consider this quote from Bertrand Russel, from the History of Western Philosophy, pp263-4:</p>
<p>"When the Romans first came in contact with Greeks, they became aware of themselves as comparatively barbarous and uncouth. The Greeks were immeasurably their superiors in many ways: in manufacture and in the technique of agriculture; in the kinds of knowledge that are necessary for a good official; in conversation and the art of enjoying life; in art and literature and philosophy. The only things in which the Romans were wuperior were military tactics and social cohesion. The relation of the Romans to the Greeks was somethign like that of the Prussians to the French in 1814 and 1815; but theis latter was temporary, whereas the other lasted a long time. After the Punic Wars, young Romans conceived an admiration for the Greeks. They learnt the Greek language, they copied Greek architecture, they employed Greek sculptors. The Roman gods were identified with the gods of Greece. The Trojan origin of the Romans was invented to make a connection with the Homeric myths. Latin poets adopted Greek metres, Latin philosophers took over Greek theories. To the end, Rome was culturally parasitic on Greece. The Romans invented no art forms, constructed no original system of philosophy, and made no scientific discoveries. They made good roads, systematic legal codes, and efficient armies; for the rest they looked to Greece.</p>
<p>The Hellenizing of Rome brought with it a certain softening of manners, abhorrent ot the elder Cato. Until the Punic Wars, the Romans had been a bucolic people, with the virtues and vices of farmers; austere, industrious, brutal, obstinate, and stupid. Their family life had been stable and solidly built on the patria potestas; women and young people were completely subordinated. All this changed with the influx of sudden wealth. The small farms disappeared, and were gradually replaced by huge estates on which slave labour was employed to carry out new scientific kidns of agriculture. A great class of traders grew up, and a large number of men enriched by plunder, like the nabobs on eighteenth-century England. Women, who had been virtuous slaves, became free and disolute; divorce became common; the rich ceased to have children. The Greeks, who had gone through a similar development centuries ago, encouraged, by their example, what historians call the decay of morals. Even in the most dissolute times of the Empire, the average Roman still thought of Rome as the upholder of a purer ethical standard against the decadent corruption of Greece."</p>

<p>For the love of Jove, if you're going to use Fitzgerald's translation, please don't post it as though it were prose instead of poetry.

<p>While checking the article for some backstory to incorporate into a report for my Latin taskmaster, my eye caught the first paragraph. "[The Aeneid] is split into two "volumes" and 12 "books", with books 1-6 being the <a href="../../../o/d/y/Odyssey.html" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a> and 7-12 the <a href="../../../i/l/i/Iliad.html" title="Iliad">Iliad</a>." Perhaps my understanding of classical literature is at fault, but I was under the impression that the Iliad and Odyssey were Homerian works dealing with the battle for Troy and Odysseus' voyage home, respectively, with only a minor mention of Aeneas in the Iliad. I find it unlikely that "Iliad" and "Odyssey" would be used for the titles of the two volumes, if only because of the nomenclature behind them (Iliad comes from Ilium, a name for Troy; Odyssey comes from its protagonist's name, Odysseus). Did I miss something? <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurai_fde2.html" title="User:Ourai">Ourai</a> 23:04, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your understanding is correct. However I think that what is meant in the opening paragraph is that Aeneid books 1-6 are <i>like</i> the Odyssey (they describe the wandering of Aeneas in place of the wanderings of Odysseus) and that Aeneid books 7-12 are <i>like</i> the Iliad (they describe the war between the Trojans and the Latins in place of the war between the Greeks and the Trojans).

<dd>I think that it should be noted that the ancient historian(actually grammarian) Servius (from the 4th century), who was a big commentator on The Aeneid, claimed that it was written to 1) Imitate Homer's works and 2) Praise Augustus. Servius may be one of the oldest authorities on the subject and should be mentioned in this section perhaps. I'll look at ways to impliment it soon.</dd>

<dd>This section (along with the Theme Section) was a summation of my year long course on the Aeneid. I need to find a direct citation beyond that of my professor's various lectures. As for the matter of it being opinion, this is why I bolded, and italicized the text in question to leave credence to the argument of Virgil's hidden message. When I have more time, I will find the passages in the original Latin, and add it along with the Fitzgerald translation already in use for textual evidence.</dd>

<dd>I don't mean to be rude, but the section oversimplifies a long-running and complex critical debate over the meaning of the <i>Aeneid</i>. To engage in the vice of oversimplification myself: the main issue that scholars talk about when discussing hidden meanings or "other voices" in the <i>Aeneid</i> is the poem's attitude towards Augustus. Most scholars would agree that Aeneas' struggles to found a new Troy reflect the civil wars and the establishment of the principate by Augustus. For a long time, Virgil was regarded as glorifying the rule of Augustus, and was even sometimes regarded as a propagandist for the new regime; this interpretation has come to be known as the "optimist" reading. On the other hand, many scholars have argued that Virgil casts doubt on the nobility of Aeneas and his mission, through the characterization of Aeneas, the use of ironic language, and through the poem's depiction of the savagery that leads to the foundation of the Roman race. This interpretation is known as the "pessimist" reading. Most scholars would now concede that both readings are too simplistic; Virgil is one of the most complex poets western literature has known. The bibliography on this is huge; R. O. A. M. Lyne, <i>Further Voices in Vergil's Aeneid</i> might be a starting point, a classic is W.R. Johnston's <i>Darkness Visible</i>. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 06:35, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>J. Farrell, "The Virgilian Intertext", <i>Cambridge Companion to Virgil</i>, p. 229: "...let us begin with the traditional view that Virgil's epic divides into 'Odyssean' and 'Iliadic' halves. Merely accepting this idea at face value is to mistake for a destination what Virgil clearly offered as the staring-point of a long and wondrous journey." That said, the idea that 1-6=Odyssey and 7-12=Iliad is a staple of the AP syllbaus, and a valuable service for the WP reader to indicate where this chestnut came from, and why they might want to question it. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 07:20, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi everyone, I'd like to see a little more hat-tipping to other theories about the gates of ivory and horn, which constitute an enigmatic and interesting part of the Aeneid. There are plenty of other theories about the passage – that Aeneas' time in the underworld was a false dream, that Aeneas himself was not a true member of the underworld during his time there, or that it was simply necessary for him to leave that way in order to come back out again. It would be nice to at least couch the posing of the questions about the passage in language that admits the ambiguity and uncertainty which the world of Vergilian scholarship expresses on this passage. <a href="../../../m/j/l/User%7EMjl0509_36f6.html" title="User:Mjl0509">Mjl0509</a> 05:29, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have started this section off as it is a very prominent theme in the poem that needs to be addressed. The section needs to be expanded, possibly with ideas of Virgil's that are not linked with previous epics. Phasler90 11:53, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can see the value of the topic. But as it was added—a bare list of correspondences—it had the appearance of a reader's impression of resemblances (which can't go into an encyclopedia). To be more, I'd say it needs either (1) citations of reliable sources who have made the associations; or (2) explanation of what in the poems' contents justify the connections between characters, episodes, etc. You needn't have (1) if you have (2)—at least I wouldn't revert a correct laying-out of the grounds for drawing a connection between Virgil's work and earlier (or later) epics. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareh_c537.html" title="User:Wareh">Wareh</a> 22:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
