<p>Hi, I'm fairly sure that the spirit in the church was actually supposed to be a full fledged conversation between cloud and Aerith, that was not put in due to there not being enough time. I would just go and change it, but I thought i should put something here. Actually i will change it , if anyone has any objections, feel free to change it back and I'll leave it alone. <a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVespertilio_82eb.html" title="User:Vespertilio">Vespertilio</a> 4 October 2005</p>

<dd>I, on the other hand, based on the evidence in the game, am convinced that present state suggests it was nothing but a glitch. An <i>appropriate</i> glitch, but a glitch nevertheless. I wrote a little bit more about this <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII/Glitches_and_errors#Aerith.27s_ghost" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Final_Fantasy_VII/Glitches_and_errors">in the wikibook</a> some while ago. However, I don't think this thing is a significant enough a fact to be mentioned in a Wikipedia article - it's a <i>very</i> small part of the game, which to my knowledge <i>hasn't been confirmed</i> by Square to be an intended feature either! If it were, it might be inclusion-worthy due to it's unusual execution and debate-worthiness. Now it's just a small detail in the game that gets a lot of discussion. --<a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">Wwwwolf</a> 13:15, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have always been under the impression that it was an Easter egg - considering the location (Aerith's Church), and the time that it appears (third disk) - it seems that it was added as an Easter egg to possibly remind the player about what had happened before the went to the North Crater for the final confirmation. Also as a programmer myself I would like to note that I find it to be far fetched that this is a glitch for very basic reason of the fact that her avatar is transparent, where as other character glitches in the game occur with the standard, non-transparent. It is my understanding - based on game play - that there is some code for transparent character models (due to the various ghost monsters) but this is not tied to standard NPC characters, as such a glitch in that area would be extremely unlikely. Also, the Aerith avatar only shows up in two different locations - either by the flower bed, or be the benches, there have been some reports that this is related to how she was treated thought out the game. If either of these items is true than that means that there is code tied to the appearance and that it would be an Easter egg as opposed to glitch. Also, it should be noted that she will consistently appear in one of the two expected locations – if this was a true glitch then the appearance area would be pseudo-random and there would also be a chance for no appearance. However, I do doubt that it was intended to be a full scene of any type, the impact of just seeing her before the final battle is enough to stir most players emotionally. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkstar949_7f19.html" title="User:Darkstar949">Darkstar949</a> 16:23, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>1) As another programmer, I have a different theory - game loads up static data and then corrects its mistake as soon as it catches up with itself: The game loads up the church area, looks at the static data and sees "Hmm, Aerith should be in either of those spots", loads up the character model, and sticks it there. Then it checks what content <i>really</i> should go in the church and notices "Oops, Aerith isn't here after all" and removes the model. 2) Is the character <i>really</i> transparent or anything? Last time I could see it, Aerith was full visible before disappearing. ... in short, I have plenty of reasons to believe this is just a glitch until either Square confirms this or someone figures out the game script format enough to figure out what was <i>really</i> going on here (ie, if there really is specific code that causes this behavior, then this is deliberate and definitely an easter egg). And I <i>still</i> think this is borderline fancruft. --<a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">Wwwwolf</a> 19:44, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it is fancruft in the context of the current article - it is better suited to being in the Easter eggs/glitches article. However, IIRC the PC version of the game came out after the PSX version - is the spirit confirmed to be in that version of the game as well? I will do some checking to see if the PC version is x86 native, or if they used an interpreter for that version of the game. If it is x86 native, and the spirit appears that might be another clue towards the nature of the spirit. Also, do we have a list where/when Aeirth appears in the church to determine if the location syncs with the location of the spirit? <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkstar949_7f19.html" title="User:Darkstar949">Darkstar949</a> 20:15, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm taking a flying leap and guessing that a large part of the PS version of the game was written in portable C or something (32-bit era was when people quit writing everything in assembly anyway). I think most modern games implement some form of virtual machine / interpreter that runs the game script and interprets game data. Plus even if the thing was in native code, so what? It definitely wasn't a 100% rewrite, and they would definitely not bother rewriting code that was in the *game script*. They just ported the game engine. Just proves that Square knows how to write portable code, even their glitches are portable. =) And by the way, This ghost doesn't necessarily have anything to do with Advent Children's end; has anyone thought that, like, this church is, like, an <i>important location</i> for Aeris? The end of AC boils down to "hey, look, this healing spring appeared in Aerith's church! Cloud is cured! The children are cured! And look, there's that flower girl's ghost! She used to hang around here, right?" Good, we've nailed down the <i>correlation</i>, now where's the <i>causation</i>? --<a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">Wwwwolf</a> 22:10, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Alright, I just remembered something I had read back in the day - here's the link to it: <a href="http://www.ff7citadel.com/secrets/sa_church.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.ff7citadel.com/secrets/sa_church.shtml" rel="nofollow">Ghost in the Church</a>. Based on this information my conclusion is a Easter egg and glitch in the same area. The Easter egg is her appearance in the church as a "ghost" - the glitch is that Square had the code written so that it did not activate until after her death (as it should have been written), instead, wrote it so that the various church events keep the flag for the code turned off. So the glitch is in the fact that Square did not anticipate people back tracking to the church before they left Midgar. Also, if you take into account how she appears in Advent Children at the end of the movie it seems that they are treating it as an official canon reference to the game. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkstar949_7f19.html" title="User:Darkstar949">Darkstar949</a> 15:15, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The PC version is a direct port from the playstation, but the port was created by EIDOS, not Square. <a href="../../../j/q/f/User%7EJQF_f600.html" title="User:JQF">JQF</a> 22:37, 5 October 2005
<dl>
<dd>You really suppose Eidos wrote the <i>whole thing</i> from scratch, remade all game script and all data from scratch, and in <i>no way</i> did Square give <i>any</i> data and code to Eidos? "Oh, hi, we need you to port our flagship game. Blindfolded and with your hands tied between your back." Pssshw. Get real. Eidos probably got full FF7 source code, just rewrote the Playstation-specific parts and checked up the game script. --<a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">Wwwwolf</a> 08:31, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just so everybody knows, you can see Aerith in the Church anytime RIGHT AFTER resucing her from the Turks on disk one. If you backtrack to the church, you will have Cloud and Aerith in your party, and the Spirit will be right their. This is all on Disk one. <a href="../../../j/q/f/User%7EJQF_f600.html" title="User:JQF">JQF</a> 16:37, 5 October 2005</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Place of death</span></h2>
<p>I originally added this bit to the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It has also been frequently suggested that Aerith's death was supposed to take place slightly later in the game (possibly Northern Crater); evidence for this isn't extensive but at least more substantial than any of the rumors for her resurrection.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think I'll now remove it (and maybe put it in Wikibooks later, when and if it gets Really Extensive which it isn't now), because I think I went a little bit fancruftaceous here. Changing small details like this are not really noteworthy; A lot of games get a lot of changes, sometimes far more dramatic, during the development. This was probably just one detail that the developers bounced around until settling it where it is in the final product, and as such I don't think it's not worth mentioning. --<a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">Wwwwolf</a> 10:15, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Linkspam</span></h2>
<p>Um... there's a whole bunch of External Links here! Should these go, as most are to fansites? I've often viewed these as linkspam unless the fan site is really notable and extensive (like ff7citadel.com, in case of the main FF7 article). It started to go this way in the Tifa article, but I just added note along the lines of "hey, the Offoapropated Fanlisting has a nice list of fansites, take a look there, WP:NOT a linkfarm" as a comment. The problem is, in Aerith's case, there isn't a nice list of fansites anywhere - We <i>could</i> just say "well, just look at Aerith fanlisting", but unlike in Tifa's case, they don't have a nice list of fansites, just a list of fans in general. So does anyone have any other ideas? I hesitate to do anything about this right now. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 18:59, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just so there won't be a war here, I'll put it in the discussions. It does NOT matter than most people don't have a musical ear -- the piece is SIMILAR, yes, but it's not in any way "based on" Aria De Mezzo. It's not really relevent (at least in my opinion) or at the very least it should be clear that they they are merely similar. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">Melodia Chaconne</a> 17:08, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So what if they are, Uematsu-san created them both. Many artists redux their works for use in other things, which in effect creates a completely new work (depending on certain elements of course).

<dd>probably because FFVII has prequels and sequels. ie, Advent Children is two years later, so everyone is 2 years older. before chrisis is so and so years earlier (too lazy to click and look up the date) so in that game their that many years younger. the original games serves as a reference point.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Romantic Issues Edit</span></h2>
<p>Hi. I've been trying to edit the Romantic Issues section of the article to reflect Aerith's actual feelings for Cloud, but it keeps getting changed back. As of right now, it's giving misleading information. This is what it says at the moment:</p>
<p><br />
In Benny Matsuyama's novel <i>Maiden Who Travels The Planet</i>, some fans interpret the following quote below as that most of what she saw in Cloud had been emulated from Zack, believing that Aerith loved Cloud because of the striking similarities between the two.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"But she couldn't figure out the truth. Her thoughts just went in circles. Aerith delved into her memories again. Memories that showed Cloud's individuality. The way he walked. She remembered all his actions one by one...</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Most of those thoughts merged into the Sea of Mako and awakened a character. The character recognized the image she recalled and he [Zack] woke up.</i>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, however, she mentions that both Cloud and Zack are different people. Also, it has been revealed that she truly loved Cloud for who he is and more than her first love, as she claims early in the novella.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"At first, she thought he somehow had some similarities to her first love. Even so, his looks, voice and personality weren't similar, and he also made her think of him as a mysterious person... But it soon didn't matter. She loved him much more than her first love."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
This is simply wrong. This is like quoting the flashback sequence in Mideel first, and then later quoting Sephiroth and Hojo's lines at the Northern Crater and trying to claim that Cloud's not a real person. Aerith never got to know Cloud for who he was order <i>to</i> love him for who he was. <i>Maiden Who Travels the Planet</i> never says that she loved him for who he was. It merely says that she loved him <i>more</i> than she loved Zack, and that's it. This was also <i>during Chapter 1</i>. In <i>Chapter 5</i> when she begins thinking about all the things about Cloud that she liked -- ironically, the things that she thought displayed his individuality -- it caused <i>Zack</i> to awaken, because those things were characteristic of <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>It is not "at the same time" that she mentions that they are different people. It is after Zack awakens, with the fact that the things about Cloud that she remembered being the characteristics he had adopted from Zack. For that matter, the only things she brings up that express a difference between the two are that Cloud's simplistic, as well as awkward around girls (some aspects of his personality), his appearance (though he still moved and walked like Zack), and his voice. Not exactly a huge list.</p>
<p>As the article's worded, it is <i>highly</i> misleading, and I can only conclude that it is being worded in that manner intentionally. This is an encyclopedia, which should be reporting facts, not twisting statements around across several chapters to make things look differently than they are.</p>
<p><i>Maiden</i> even goes so far as to have Aerith point out that she herself could not be the one to free Cloud's mind in the Lifestream because she simply didn't know the real him. She didn't know the truth about his past. Only Tifa could do it, because only Tifa was there. It's pretty hard to make an argument that Aerith loved him for the real him when she never met him and only met the nigh-complete imitation of Zack that he deluded himself into being, and when she even admits that she couldn't help him because she didn't know him. Hell, after Tifa helps him reconstruct his mind, it even says that it was only <i>then</i> that she knew the real Cloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"She was happy. She was happy that she now knew the real Cloud and was able to watch over him, even though it was just for a short while."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I'm going to change it back again, and I ask that anyone who deems it appropriate or necessary to alter it after that please explain why here. There's no point in an edit war going on and on here.</p>

<dd>It's only wrong in <i>your</i> opinion because things like this are more out of interpretation than simply stating a fact. SE is vague when it comes to concerning the LT because they, as Nomura had said in a Kingdom Hearts interview, that it was really all up to the reader and their own interpretation.</dd>
<dd>Xcomp's translation was down yesterday (the link didn't work for me), so I didn't know the order of the quotes. I am sorry if that came out intentionally—but whether or not, I meant to, I apologize for whatever I did wrong in being misleading with the intepretation. I was following in what I thought was a "factual interpretation", so maybe that does make it intentional (but not with a thought to maliciously twist facts);because MotP is not the only thing that I base on the whole interpretation of this only 'Romantic issue' on.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I am satisfied with the current version. I did not exactly follow the first version, because you seem to be stating that Aerith did not love Cloud, trying to rebuttle the last quote in the beginning of novella. In my opinion, I thought ending with the Zack quote was misleading in concluding that she did not really love Cloud—just as you thought that I was being misleading and twisting quotes. So all again, it's interpretation. However, now that you've added the last quote and paragraph, I am satisfied.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I hope that misunderstandings will be cleared up now...so, peace? —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirlen_c835.html" title="User:Mirlen">Mirlen</a> 22:42, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The easiest way to handle this is state all the facts without interpretation or pretense. Or, if you must add an interpretation, include both (or all) sides, but make it clear that neither is any less right or wrong than the other, and it is simply up to individual preference. So, state the facts as they are presented, and go from there. Be as neutral and objective as possible. Done deal. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil_c3d3.html" title="User:Eluchil"><font color="#6B6E85">Eluchil</font></a> 00:37, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, that's what I was trying to do: keep it NPOV as possible. Including Zerith and Clerith views, but I guess it didn't turn out that way&#160;:P. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirlen_c835.html" title="User:Mirlen">Mirlen</a> 02:22, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, it was definitely my intention that I only mention the facts involved. And, yes, Mirlen, there may be peace. Now that I've thought about it, I most definitely should have added that Aerith continued to love Cloud just as much as before once she knew who he really was the first time around. I never doubted that she loved him, and the novella doesn't indicate that she didn't, and I apologize if I made it appear that way. I just wanted to emphasise the fact that she loved him without knowing the real him, but she definitely did continue to love him just as much even after she knew who he really was.</p>
<p>If you're satisfied with the current form of the citations, then I guess all is well. No hard feelings and sorry if I came off a bit heated. I was just a bit frustrated, and that was probably made all the worse because I've got a cold.</p>
<p>By the way, I think XComp's site is dead and won't be coming back. Kind of a shame. If you can find <i>Maiden</i> online somewhere (you could probably request it on a forum; I'm sure someone saved it; you might be able to get someone to post it), then save it to your computer or e-mail or something.</p>
<p>Anyway, have a good one.</p>

<p>I think some elements from the Crisis Core trailer should be included. Perhaps mentioning something about her and Zack's "promise".

There's no audio for that part of <i>Kingdom Hearts</i>. It's just text. I'm going to fix this.</p>

<p>In a recent edit, Midnight Wolf wrote that in "Maiden Who Travels The Planet", the writers revealed "the fact that it was [Aeris] who called the Lifesteam into action to defeat the Meteor". I'm pretty sure that fact was obvious from the FF7 ending. Marlene says "The flower girl?" when the Lifestream starts to move, and in the end, we see Aeris' face glowing green. I'm changing it to say that Maiden confirms that fact. Viltris 08:47, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uh... maybe, but it doesn't have very specific criteria, and the "syndrome" itself is a debatable concept. I don't see it as relevant to this article. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 04:09, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>She almost certainly fits the profile: killed by a supervillain as a plot device and to create dramatic turmoil for the male hero. However, while the concept is easily amenable to other media, I don't think the term is frequently used outside of comic books. Indeed, the article on the concept doesn't really talk about it at length outside of comics. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 04:45, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I'd agree with that, but while her death -- and Jessie's -- does serve as a plot device, so did Zack's, Bigg's and Wedge's. It seems like a kind of... selective criteria that could be applied to many things if one tried to. I've heard that some people don't even think it should be used unless the character who was killed was killed because their reason for being targeted somehow related to them being female (like GL's girlfriend), so I can't really see the point myself. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 00:33, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Looking at it from the perspective of the fictional aspects of the story, a WiR victim generally <i>isn't</i> targetted because she's female: she's not the victim of <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_crime.html" title="Hate crime">hate crimes</a> or anything similar. GL's girlfriend wasn't killed because she was female, she was killed because she was a convenient way to get at the male hero. From a authorial perspective, it has everything to do with gender, of course: female characters are generally seen as more "disposable" than male characters, an attitude which is frequently defended by the argument that most of the audience for comic books are male, and theoretically more likely to identify/associate with male characters. By eliminating a major female character, you get the emotional impact of killing a major character, and all the drama that comes from that, but without losing a major male character and alienating your core audience. Aerith really is a textbook example of this kind of thing. Looking at the key points outlined in the WiR article, we've got
<ul>
<li>"...a gruesome injury or murder of a female character..." – quasi-ritualistic impalement would seem to qualify</li>
<li>"...at the hands of a supervillain..." – if Sephiroth isn't a supervillain, I'm not sure what he is</li>
<li>"...as a motivating personal tragedy for a male superhero..." – the specter of Aerith's death hangs over the remainder of the storyline, and according to Sakaguchi, it was a reflection of his own suffering following the death of his mother</li>
<li>"...[whose] death or injury... then helps cement the hatred between the hero and the villain responsible." – a given, really, but it's also worth pointing out that the death serves to cement the hatred of the <b>player</b> for Sephiroth by dramatically dispelling any sympathy for the character lingering from the Nibelheim flashback</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>While these criteria apply, in the broad sense, to the other deaths you mention (excluding the obvious "female" bit), there are very different connotations to Aerith's death, if only because Aerith's is a much more central character, and because her death is treated as more important by the story itself. How often are the other members of AVALANCHE even mentioned after the first disk? And, of course, the fact that Aerith is female <i>is</i> relevant: the concept of WiR was coined in response to the fact that such dramatically-charged, "motivational" deaths occur far more frequently to female characters than male characters. Considering how closely Aerith's murder matches the profile, it's very hard to write it all off as coincidence. It's rather sexist, IMO, but it's also deeply ingrained in our culture: part of the reason I don't think it's worth bringing it up here is because I think that expanding the definition of "WiR" to include all types of fiction would open the floodgates a little too wide. The other part of the reason is that it would be literary criticism, and litcrit is basically another form of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 07:21, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd say that we should keep this from enlarging to a debate on this discussion page since Wikipedia isn't a forum. But on the other hand, I can see how Aerith being a WiR is certainly arguable, but nevertheless, it isn't really all that important to the article so I don't think there's any reason to include this part in. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirlen_c835.html" title="User:Mirlen">Mirlen</a> 01:15, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because that page is ancient, and hasn't been updated since September 09, 1998. Square has since released other games that mention the character, spelling her name "Aerith". And then there's Advent Children, in which she is also called "Aerith", both in the original Japanese credits, and throughout the English release (dub, subtitles, etc.) The facts of the matter are pretty simple, despite the incredible amount of discussion on this page. Her name is, and has always been, "Aerith". Due to a translation error on Sony's part, or for other, unknown reasons, she was originally introduced to English-speaking countries as "Aeris" in Final Fantasy VII. This error propogated through the media of the day, including the English manual, strategy guide, web site, and so on. It also occurred in Final Fantasy Tactics, which was released in America only 5 months after the American release of FFVII. Sheesh... If we could only get a statement from Kitase or Nomura spelling it out for people, that might finally lay this matter to rest. I doubt that we're ever going to get it though, as they probably don't know that this misunderstanding exists, or that it's this big of a deal among the fanbase. And they're too high-profile to attend conventions, where someone could ask them the question, a member of the media could record the answer, and we could cite them. -- <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERablari_Dash_6f98.html" title="User:Rablari Dash">Rablari Dash</a> 08:09, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hearing no comment on this, I've changed the article to use {{<a href="../../../o/t/h/Template%7EOtheruses2_87e8.html" title="Template:Otheruses2">otheruses2</a>}} since <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeris.html" title="Aeris">Aeris</a> does NOT redirect here. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmalas_f8d6.html" title="User:Amalas"><font color="maroon"><b>~ Amalas</b></font></a> <a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmalas_8c3c.html" title="User talk:Amalas"><font color="navy">rawr</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Amalas_7b0d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Amalas"><sup>=^_^=</sup></a> 20:31, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">By the way... This page needs archiving.</span></h2>
<p>This talk page is getting pretty long, weighing in at over 100KB. I propose that it be archived by topic, with the lengthy name debates (which consume a good chunk of the page) being archived on Aerith Gainsborough/Name Debate Archive (with minor formatting edits to improve readability), with a section either on this talk page or at the head of the archive page summarizing the arguments, so that newcomers to the article will be able to grasp the situation faster, and avoid bringing up the same arguments over and over again. The section at the head of the talk page here summarizes the current consensus, but doesn't explain it or summarize the arguments.</p>
<p>I'm willing to do all this, but I realise that the process of archiving a talk page (particularly one with so much controversy) requires a certain amount of trust in the archiver, and I don't want to just nominate myself for the position, being relatively new here. That, and I don't have as much time for the Wikipedia as I might like, or as much experience with it as others here. So, any comments? Nominations? Volunteers? -- <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERablari_Dash_6f98.html" title="User:Rablari Dash">Rablari Dash</a> 09:32, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
