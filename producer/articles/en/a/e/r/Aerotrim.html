<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerotrim.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>There were 3 Patents filed for similar devices, one in 1907 and one in 1920, they were rectangular, not round. The first round human Gyroscope patent application was July 1964, Patent # 3141669</p>
<p>Originally conceived in the early eighties by <i>Heinz Suchy</i>, an Austrian inventor, as training machine for his own ailing spine, friends suggested its potential for gyms and hospitals. The first prototype was built by him in his garage and attached to the garage walls, but lacked general safety precautions and decent foot attachment mechanism, meaning that the machine was only accessible to people of a certain height.</p>
<p>Based on a profit sharing agreement, Mr. Suchy, who unsuccessfully had applied for a patent in Austria, passed on the rights to the German entrepreneur <i>Hermann Dittrich</i>, who through his import-export company <i>Contactos Trading, Gesellschaft fuer internationalen Handel mbH</i> at great cost applied internationally for patent. Mr. Dittrich also chose the name <b>Aerotrim</b> over Suchy’s original <b>3D-Fun</b>. In need to make it safer, he came up with handles, the overhead hand protectors made of Plexiglas and the height-adjustable foot mechanism that allowed even children (of a minimum height) to use the machine. As a result, it even passed the German TUV safety inspections. Contactos looked worldwide for manufacturers. The <b>Aerotrim</b> started to be made in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korea.html" title="Korea">Korea</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> and the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, were negotiations started to form a company named “Gyrotec” with the renowned Canadian “Hart Ski” and other investors. Unfortunately, not enough would understand this new fitness concept. Therefore, Contactos launched its own coordinated ad campaign single-handed, first in Germany and globally over the next few years.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerotrim.html" title="Edit section: The Idea">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Idea</span></h2>
<p>Contrary to the initial appearance, the <b>Aerotrim</b> is not a close-your-eyes-and-hold-on machine and does not cause dizziness or nausea if it is controlled by the rider himself. Like a dumbbell or bicycle, human strength is required to direct the motions by balancing the body weight. During a forward or backward spin to be in command of the machine becomes limited, but it is still possible to flip out of a spinning loop and translate the momentum from forward motion to a sideways, backwards, horizontal or vertical spin. It is the only stationary exercise machine known to have the ability to move into any direction by counterbalance alone.</p>
<p>It is this control, or ‘wheeling’, that requires every muscle in the body to be used evenly, even those not usually targeted by weight training or general cardiovascular exercise<a href="http://www.gyrogym.com/healthbenefits.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gyrogym.com/healthbenefits.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. A half-hour session in the <b>Aerotrim</b> equals a two-hour cardio session in an entire gym, including pool. The spinning motion gives a feel of weightlessness and it is this feeling that can cause a healthy addiction.</p>
<p>Regular users, colloquially known as <i>Wheelers</i> or <i>Aeronauts</i>, began to devise and name moves and routines, often to music (Rod Stuart’s <i>I Am Sailing</i> being the most popular) and sometimes in synchrony with two or more machines. Although the general workout lasts no longer than ten to fifteen minutes, many logged hours and developed tricks and stunts and even a world record published in Guinness’.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerotrim.html" title="Edit section: Going to Hollywood">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Going to Hollywood</span></h2>
<p>As soon as it hit television in Germany the <b>Aerotrim</b> was often featured and used as a prop in movies, television series, commercials and even as a prize in game shows. Its first appearance on American television was in a Pepsi commercial. Dozen more cameos followed, mostly in sci-fi themed shows and movies, including <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gattaca.html" title="Gattaca">Gattaca</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lawnmower_Man_90d9.html" title="The Lawnmower Man">The Lawnmower Man</a> (although it has been argued by purists that the machine featured here was only influenced by the <b>Aerotrim</b>) and more recently aboard <a href="../../../e/n/t/Star_Trek%7E_Enterprise_849e.html" title="Star Trek: Enterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerotrim.html" title="Edit section: Influence on the 80s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influence on the 80s</span></h2>
<p>Its large size and appearance made it an instant crowd pleaser, drawing masses in all its public appearances. It was readily featured in the general media, often in feature stories and cover pages, which is why it enjoyed a world-wide exposure.</p>
<p>However, most people missed its medical and health purpose and labeled it as a mere toy for thrill seekers: a dumbbell is one thing – wheeling your body around seems superfluous and downright dizzying. Also its size and retail price made it unreachable for most private owners and it was only large gyms, hospitals and even freestyle-ski resorts that acquired it, often several at once.</p>
<p>If it was a giant leap from gym equipment to toy, it was but a small step to space. It did not take long for the aeronautical community to pick up on its value for equilibrium and weightlessness exercise. An entire fleet was acquired by <a href="../../../l/u/f/Lufthansa.html" title="Lufthansa">Lufthansa</a>, another by the Korean air force and several were used by the German space agency for astronaut training. Most European astronauts that have gone to MIR used the Aerotrim for preparation. Soon the myth emerged that the Aerotrim “<a href="http://www.euroviva.com/rental_bungee_trampoline_jumping_ice_tower/aerotrim.html" class="external text" title="http://www.euroviva.com/rental_bungee_trampoline_jumping_ice_tower/aerotrim.html" rel="nofollow">was originally developed to prepare astronauts for weightlessness.</a>” This however is obviously inaccurate. To this day ESA uses the machine for its <a href="http://www.esa.int/esaHS/SEMMRU2IU7E_business_0.html" class="external text" title="http://www.esa.int/esaHS/SEMMRU2IU7E_business_0.html" rel="nofollow">official training programs</a>, as well as part of its <a href="http://www.mydays.de/aussergewoehnliche-geschenke/iss-esa-full-scale-training.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mydays.de/aussergewoehnliche-geschenke/iss-esa-full-scale-training.html" rel="nofollow">public training programs</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Variations" id="Variations"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerotrim.html" title="Edit section: Variations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Variations</span></h2>
<p>Several variations of the original were produced, some by <i>Contactos</i>, some by cloners. These include a children’s version (MiniAerotrim), wheelchair versions suitable for use by paraplegics or quadriplegics<a href="http://www.gyrogym.com/custombuilds.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gyrogym.com/custombuilds.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, as well as motorized versions.</p>
<p>Its primary role in sci-fi movies, besides futuristic astronaut-trainer, was as a Virtual Environment simulator<a href="http://vr.isdale.com/vrTechReviews/MotionLinks_2000.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://vr.isdale.com/vrTechReviews/MotionLinks_2000.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and <a href="http://usa.thegreatevent.com/content/themedetails.asp?themeID=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://usa.thegreatevent.com/content/themedetails.asp?themeID=4" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. But it was not until the mid-nineties that it actually was used as such. Adding VR goggles and a joystick it could be used to play a few games, but since its motion is controlled by the user, its application for VE simulation was limited. This was changed when a motorized version was introduced, which basically interlocked the Aerotrim and user in a VE. Designed as an entertainment device, this version supported VEs in a Head Mounted Display, 3-D binaural sound spacing and up to two joysticks, with either head tracking or user tracking based on the position of the gyroscope.</p>
<p><a name="Clone_Wars" id="Clone_Wars"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerotrim.html" title="Edit section: Clone Wars">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Clone Wars</span></h2>
<p>Just a year after the launch, the first clones appeared and <i>Contactos</i>, owning world-wide patents by then, saw itself involved in its inaugural patent-battle. But the clones kept on coming in the US, Italy, Korea, France, and other countries, trying to avoid the patents by changing the foothold and even the shape (some companies produced square and even <a href="http://www.stuermer.de/spacefly.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.stuermer.de/spacefly.htm" rel="nofollow">decagon shaped</a> clones) as well as the firm hip support which alone made the <b>Aerotrim</b> a controllable device. Over the following years international lawyers were hired to handle the various court cases. <i>Contactos</i> basically won all of them, but the legal fees soon outweighed the company’s income from this project and Contactos had to keep on financing it through other business activities. It seemed like a plot out of one of the many sci-fi shows it had stared in: a machine as successful and popular as the Aerotrim facing certain death by its own clones.</p>
<p>In a final desperate move to save a sinking ship, <i>Contactos</i> passed on rights to an Irish company named “Lifeway Ltd.” But even this movement could not save it from doom. Soon they too had to cease production. Nearly exactly ten years after its birth, the last true <b>Aerotrim</b> was produced in late 1990 and the patent rights were lost due to lack of interest in keeping them alive.</p>
<p>At present, there are several clone versions of the original <b>Aerotrim</b> with different names on the market, but the only company still buildingvariations with modest success seems to be <a href="http://www.gyrogym.com/home.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gyrogym.com/home.html" rel="nofollow">GyroGym, Inc.</a>. They try with more or less success to get people to understand this three-dimensional fitness concept. Unfortunately, it seems that the broad public is not able to grasp it and not enough sports enthusiasts know how to control the forces of the three rings of the <b>Aerotrim</b>.</p>
