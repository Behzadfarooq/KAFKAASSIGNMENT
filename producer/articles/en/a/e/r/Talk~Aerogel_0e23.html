<p>It appears bluish because the silicon dioxide scatters shorter wavelengths</p>
<p>Shouldn't this read that is scatters longer wave lengths, blue light is at the short end of the spectrum, it would have to scatter the red light out to appear blue. Change it if you agree.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, it is correct that it scatters shorter wavelengths - think about it, you only see the blue light because it has been scattered! Same thing with the sky - the sky appears blue because the blue light is scattered in all directions, including into your eyes. As the aerogel FAQ linked in the article says, if you look through a piece of aerogel directly at a white light source, you will see that the light appears yellow, because the blue light is scattered out of the way. It is the same phenomenon as the same way that the sun appears yellow/orange/red, especially at sunrise/sunset when you are looking through a greater depth of atmosphere. See <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/blusky.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/blusky.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> for example, for confirmation that it is scattering of shorter (blue) wavelengths that gives the blue appearance. Also NASA's aerogel FAQ <a href="http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/faq.html#aerogel" class="external autonumber" title="http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/faq.html#aerogel" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> - "The very small particles that compose the aerogel scatter blue light, the same as our atmosphere scatters blue light." 143.252.80.124 13:15, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are several highly technical descriptions of the properties of aerogel on this page but very little of what it's like to actually hold it. It's obviously very light but there's more then that. Currently all the article says is "it feels like hard plastic foam" but foam doesn't shatter like glass as this is excerpt from nasa's site notes:</p>
<p>"<b>What happens if I touch it?</b> Silica aerogel is semi-elastic because it returns to its original form if slightly deformed. If further deformed, a dimple will be created. However, if the elastic limit is exceeded, it will shatter catastrophically, like glass."</p>
<p>Should this be included as a quote, rephrased, or has someone actually held aerogel and can do better? <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 15:18, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I noticed your captions state it's a 4kg block of granite on a .5g piece of aerogel. Currently the article says aerogel can hold over 2000 times it's own weight, but it appears you did 8000 times without incident. Do you have any ideas what the threshold is likely to be? Is it near 16,000 times? The article currently isn't wrong, but it seems excessively modest also. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 23:45, 15 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the article is giving typical values. The 8000x loading I show in that picture is very close to the threshold (looking at the block, I scalloped off some of the edges). Really, it depends on a lot of factors how much you can load it; I've got the stuff in powdered form and you can grind in a mortar and pestle without it losing volume (i.e. once the particles get small enough, their specific strength is enough to keep them from getting ground down further). On the flip side, it's very difficult to handle the stuff without chipping corners off of it. Strong for it's weight doesn't mean strong... -- <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKaszeta_0108.html" title="User:Kaszeta">Kaszeta</a> 13:12, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although this is a "good article" I think it needs a significant remodel, which I have already begun. The portion before the table of contents was far too long and specific. I reorganized a little but I think the current section <b>Silica aerogel</b> needs to be split into two categories, the second being titled Silica aerogel and the first being titled <b>properties</b>, where silica aerogel only mentions the aspects that are unique to the silica variety. I also think the intro needs to be a <i>little</i> bit larger then I have made it.</p>
<p>Much of the Silica aerogel section includes uses which as much as possible should be moved to the <b>uses</b> section.</p>
<p>There's a bit too much esoteric lingo in my opinion such as diaphanous and hygroscopic. I wikified hygroscopic and replaced diaphanous with the synonymous but more readable translucent, but there are still many more difficult words.</p>
<p>I also noticed one glaring problem that became more obvious when I rearranged some paragraphs. "Carbon aerogels were first developed in the early 1990s." "Kistler's work involved aerogels based on silica, alumina, chromia, tin and carbon." Kistler died in 1975 so unless he developed carbon aerogels 15 years after his death this discrepancy needs rectified. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 15:41, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

To my understanding, the silica aerogel is a mixture of silicon dioxide and air, so can it really considered a solid in the chemical sense? It seems like it should be more like "lowest density solid material" where solid is an adjective describing a property. Then again, I could be completely wrong. Can anybody who knows lots of chemistry sort this out? 63.226.241.188 09:35, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd guess Guinness interprets "solid" as "solid material", and not in the scientific sense of the word "solid".</dd>

<p>This web page <a href="http://www.dansdata.com/danletters163.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dansdata.com/danletters163.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> makes the sugestion that it may be world's most expensive commodity by weight (assuming he meens avalable for private indivuals) at $US2083 per gram. I have to assume the web page author is talking about silica aerogel. It may make a good additon if some way was found to verify/reference it. Any thoughts?--<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue520_f758.html" title="User:Blue520">Blue520</a> 10:39, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Could an expert please verify/comment on the extremely low claimed thermal conductivity:</dd>
</dl>
<p>0.003 W/m.K - best insulator in Guiness Book of World Records - for SEAgel. (The SEAgel Wikipedia page doesn't repeat this claim.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The explanation given for it being a good conductive insulator is:</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Silica aerogel is a good conductive insulator because silica is a poor conductor of heat" Yet a Google search returns an unremarkable thermal conductivity for silica, as might be expected: <a href="http://www.azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1114" class="external free" title="http://www.azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1114" rel="nofollow">http://www.azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1114</a> reports 1.3 (1.4) W/m.K for quartz (fused silica).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since the aerogel is mostly air, a reasonable expectation would be a heat conduction value</dd>
</dl>
<p>similar to air, as I understand is the case with the best (i.e. closed cell) insulators based on air. The Wikipedia thermal conductivity article states the conductivity of air to be 0.0262 W/m.K and the Engineering Toolbox, <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html" class="external free" title="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html</a>, gives it as 0.024 as well as giving a generic entry "Insulation materials 0.035 - 0.16".</p>
<dl>
<dd>If I could hazard a guess, would it be possible that someone somewhere has inadvertantly stuck</dd>
</dl>
<p>in an extra zero in the the SEAgel conductivity and this error has been propagated? (Compare with the iron content of spinach, which I understand used to be a factor of 10 too high in many nutrition tables.) Or could there instead be some valid physical reason why SEAgel does an order of magnitude better than its dominant constituent, air?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Expert comments would be much appreciated ...</dd>

<p>Thanks, 202.74.220.117 02:19, 30 March 2006 (UTC)Bruce P.S. I have also put this comment in the thermal conductivity page, where the low value (0.003) also appears and it was noted in the comments that it had been reduced to this from 0.017.</p>

<p>Thanks to njh and Kjkolb for very helpful replies to my query that are given on the comments page for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity</a> . To add further information, Google returned a reference <a href="http://eetd.lbl.gov/ECS/aerogels/satcond.htm" class="external free" title="http://eetd.lbl.gov/ECS/aerogels/satcond.htm" rel="nofollow">http://eetd.lbl.gov/ECS/aerogels/satcond.htm</a> that quotes a typical total conductivity of 0.017 W/m.K for silica aerogels (i.e. the original value in the table that agrees well with the 0.016 recommendation of Kjkolb, and that was replaced by the value 0.003 W/m.K that I query). This is actually a well written and informative article on the thermal conductivity characteristics of aerogels and is part of an excellent more general write-up on aerogels, <a href="http://eetd.lbl.gov/ECS/aerogels/satoc.htm" class="external free" title="http://eetd.lbl.gov/ECS/aerogels/satoc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://eetd.lbl.gov/ECS/aerogels/satoc.htm</a> , that I would recommend as a reference for this topic, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerogel" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerogel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerogel</a> . At the risk of complicating this discussion, the thermal article also hints at another way that a thermal conductivity of 0.003 W/m.K might conceivably have been reported: they themselves report a similar minimum value for a silica aerogel with added carbon of ~0.0042 W/m.K . Crucially, however, this is by *evacuating* the aerogel - which is clearly not legitimate for a thermal conductivity table. (To show how absurd this would be, the record-holder for insulating materials in the Guinness Book of Records would then have to be for the trace gases in an ultra-high vacuum and that thermal conductivity would be dominated by radiative transfer and would depend on the temperature and emissivity of the vacuum walls rather than the thickness of the vacuum - in short, the coefficient of a total thermal conductivity with units of W/m.K ceases to make much sense for vacuum environments.) To give a second recommendation, I agree with Kjkolb that the entry in the table could be 0.016 or 0.017 W/m.K for a "typical silica aerogel". Or instead it could be left out of the table since the table doesn't yet even include such common and important substances as water: the value for water is 0.58 W/m.K, given in <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html" class="external free" title="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html</a> . This is a good comprehensive reference and my third recommendation is to add this to the general references for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity</a> .
