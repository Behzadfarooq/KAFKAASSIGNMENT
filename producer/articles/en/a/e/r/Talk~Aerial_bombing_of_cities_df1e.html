<dd>I don't think so. Strategic bombing mostly refers to level bombing of industrial and military facilities, even if the civilian part of the story is more discussed recently. Bombing of cities is exactly what it says: bombing of civilian targets on purpose.

<dd><i>SOMEONE CHALLENGE THE NEUTRALITY OF THIS ARTICLE PLEASE!!! Iraqi civilians were killed by "aerial bombardment of cites"?!? Would whoever posted this please look up the definition of bombardment?? Nothing but super-precise, laser-guided Tomahawk missiles were used in Iraq--to pinpoint SPECIFIC targets (the OPPOSITE of bombardment). Also, the 10,000 figure is total B.S. That's almost half the number killed in Hamburg during WWII (which actually WAS bombarded, with the express purpose of killing as many civilians as possible).</i></dd>

<p>I removed the above recent addition because the author seems confused between "Aerial bombing of cities" and "Aerial <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_bombardment.html" title="Area bombardment">Area bombardment</a>" of cities.</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree that the 10,000 figure needs a source.</li>
<li>But Hamburg was not bombed with the "express purpose of killing as many civilians as possible". It was that "<i>Operations should now be focussed on the morale of the enemy civilian population and in particular, the industrial workers</i>" Air Ministry directive issued to RAF Bomber Command on 14th February 1942 <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 12:17, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you are a little bit "blue-eyed" - the consequence out of: "<i>Operations should now be focussed on the morale of the enemy civilian population and in particular, the industrial workers</i>" was to attack the residential areas of Hammerbrook, Hamm, Eilbek etc. etc. to destroy their homes, but these houses were occuppied by civilians - therefore the task was to kill as many civilians as possible - I invite you to show you around here in Hamburg - which areas had been bombed.</p>

<dd>There is a difference, because this article is about cities and the bombing of towns, villages, and the staffing of roads are excluded. But leaving that aside for the moment. I think this needs further discussion before any merge is done because there are about half a dozen articles all much to do with the same thing: See the dormant discussions under <a href="../../../s/t/r/Talk%7EStrategic_bombing_during_World_War_II_9c26.html#Title" title="Talk:Strategic bombing during World War II">Talk:Strategic bombing during World War II#Title</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Military_history_Archive_18_92c2.html#Aerial_bombing" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history/Archive 18">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history/Archive 18#Aerial bombing</a>.</dd>

<dd>Personally I think that the "Terror bombing" article should be gutted and an explanation put in that it was a propaganda term popularised by <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Goebbels_d1dd.html" title="Joseph Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a> when Germany started to loose the air war. I think that the term inevitably leads to the negative POV that aerial bombing is bad, which is precisely why Goebbels used it. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 22:35, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know this is nitpicky, but there is a photo with the following slightly erroneous caption:</p>
<p>"The remains of German town of Wesel after intensive allied area bombing in 1945 (destruction rate 97% of all buildings)"</p>
<p>97% is the level of destruction, but it's not a rate. From the wiki article on "rate":</p>
