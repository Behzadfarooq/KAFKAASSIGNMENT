<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerojet.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Aerojet developed from a <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a> meeting hosted by <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_von_Karman_5d9c.html" title="Theodore von Karman">Theodore von Karman</a> at his house. Attending were a number of other <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caltech.html" title="Caltech">Caltech</a> professors and students, as well as self-taught rocketry experts <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Parsons_fbac.html" title="Jack Parsons">Jack Parsons</a> and Ed Forman, all of whom were interested in the topic of space flight. The group continued to meet time to time, but was essentially limited to discussions as opposed to experimentation. Things changed in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> when the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">US Army</a> offered two research projects, one for windshield de-icing on aircraft, and another for rocket engines to launch aircraft (today known as <a href="../../../j/a/t/JATO_5192.html" title="JATO">JATO</a>). Dr. Jerome Hunsaker at <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_dd6d.html" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a> had the first pick, and feeling that the rocket research was a "<a href="../../../b/u/c/Buck_Rogers_0fd2.html" title="Buck Rogers">Buck Rogers</a>" project, left rockets to the CalTech team.</p>
<p>Their first design was tested on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_16.html" title="August 16">August 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, consisting of a small cylindrical solid fuel motor attached to the bottom of a plane. The takeoff distance was shortened by half, and the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAAF_4158.html" title="USAAF">USAAF</a> placed an order for experimental production versions. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_19.html" title="March 19">March 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> the company was officially formed in <a href="../../../a/z/u/Azusa%2C_CA_6727.html" title="Azusa, CA">Azusa, CA</a>, known as <b>Aerojet Engineering</b>. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> the Army Air Forces finally placed a full order, demanding that 2000 be delivered before year-end. The company also invested in pure rocket research, developing both a liquid fueled design, and a new solid fuel design based on a rubber binding agent in partnership with <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Tire_30ed.html" title="General Tire">General Tire</a>. In the immediate post-war era Aerojet downsized dramatically, but their JATO units continued to sell for commercial aircraft operating in hot-and-high conditions.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a> their research into the rubber-binder had led to much larger engines, and then to the development of the <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerobee_rocket.html" title="Aerobee rocket">Aerobee</a> <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sounding_rocket.html" title="Sounding rocket">sounding rocket</a>. Aerobee was the first US designed rocket to reach space (albeit not orbit), and completed over 1000 flights before it was retired in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. The newly-formed <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Air_Force_5fa2.html" title="US Air Force">US Air Force</a> used Aerojet as the primary supplier on a number of their <a href="../../../i/c/b/ICBM_4c9d.html" title="ICBM">ICBM</a> projects, including the <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_%28rocket_family%29.html" title="Titan (rocket family)">Titan</a> and <a href="../../../l/g/m/LGM-30_Minuteman_38c9.html" title="LGM-30 Minuteman">Minuteman</a> missiles. They also delivered propulsion systems for the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Navy_8201.html" title="US Navy">US Navy</a>'s submarine-launched <a href="../../../u/g/m/UGM-27_Polaris_c7fc.html" title="UGM-27 Polaris">Polaris</a> missile. A new plant was set up in Sacramento that took over most rocket construction, while the original Azusa offices returned primarily to research. One of Azusa's major projects was the development of the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infra-red.html" title="Infra-red">infra-red</a> detectors for the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_Support_Program_9b4d.html" title="Defense Support Program">Defense Support Program</a> satellites, used to detect ICBM launches from space. The new research arm was formed as <b>Aerojet Electronics</b>, and after purchasing a number of ordinance companies, <b>Aerojet Ordinance</b> was created as well. A new umbrella organization oversaw the three major divisions, <b>Aerojet General</b>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">President Kennedy</a>'s challenge to place man on the Moon by the end of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> led to increased civilian work at Aerojet. In the past they had repeatedly lost contracts for large engines for the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturn_%28rocket_family%29.html" title="Saturn (rocket family)">Saturn</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_rocket.html" title="Nova rocket">Nova</a> boosters, being designed in the late <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, typically to their rival <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocketdyne.html" title="Rocketdyne">Rocketdyne</a>, but in the end were selected to develop and build the main engine for the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Command_Service_Module_9517.html" title="Apollo Command/Service Module">Apollo Command/Service Module</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> they were also selected to design a new upper-stage engine to replace the cluster of five <a href="../../../j/-/2/J-2_%28rocket_engine%29.html" title="J-2 (rocket engine)">J-2s</a> used on the Saturn second stage in the post-Apollo era, but work on their resulting <a href="../../../m/-/1/M-1_%28rocket_engine%29.html" title="M-1 (rocket engine)">M-1</a> design was later ended in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> when it became clear the public's support for a massive space program was waning.</p>
<p>The 1960s were also marked by an increased demand for various ordinance for the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, which Aerojet had branched into in the late 1950s. Similar work continued in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, delivering the 2nd stage motor for the <a href="../../../m/x/_/MX_missile_4aab.html" title="MX missile">MX missile</a>, the thruster systems for the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Shuttle_69aa.html" title="Space Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a>, and the first US-designed <a href="../../../c/l/u/Cluster_bomb.html" title="Cluster bomb">cluster bombs</a>. A contract for 30mm ammunition for the <a href="../../../a/-/1/A-10_Thunderbolt_II_4496.html" title="A-10 Thunderbolt II">A-10 Thunderbolt II</a> was so extensive that new branch plants were set up in <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downey%2C_California_43dc.html" title="Downey, California">Downey</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chino%2C_California_c84b.html" title="Chino, California">Chino</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>. Aerojet also purchased a number of other firms over this period, and their plant in <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonesborough%2C_TN_b6bc.html" title="Jonesborough, TN">Jonesborough, TN</a> developed the use of <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depleted_uranium.html" title="Depleted uranium">depleted uranium</a> ordinance. To this day they are the primary supplier of these weapons. Their electronics and ordinance divisions also collaborated on the <a href="../../../s/a/d/SADARM_b830.html" title="SADARM">SADARM</a> 8" anti-armor artillery round, but this was not put into production.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> saw a brief revival of the aerospace business during the heyday of <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Reagan</a>'s <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_Defense_Initiative_6454.html" title="Strategic Defense Initiative">SDI</a> program, but the company shrank continually during the late 1980s and into the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>.</p>

Since then, two State agencies and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency_8a4b.html" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> have been working with Aerojet to ensure that the company cleans up pollution caused by its operations at the site. Under state and federal enforcement orders, Aerojet installed several systems on the borders of its property to pump out and treat contaminated groundwater. Aerojet has also conducted a number of removal actions for onsite soils, liquids, and sludges. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, groundwater sampling data revealed a plume of contamination extending northwest under <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmichael%2C_California_b0f2.html" title="Carmichael, California">Carmichael</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>As Aerojet downsized, many of their industrial plants were idled, and the company looked for ways to capitalize them. Their massive investment in chemical mixing equipment used to build their solid fuel rockets was later leased to third parties, notably pharmaceutical companies, under the name Aerojet Fine Chemicals. The division was later sold. Aerojet Real Estate was "more direct", leasing buildings, or selling off undeveloped land. It owns approximately 12,600 acres (51 km²) of land, located 15 miles (24 km) southeast of downtown Sacramento.</p>
<p>The remaining research and development sections of Aerojet are currently organized into the Aerospace and Defense division (ADS). They continue to develop and produce liquid, solid, and air-breathing engines for strategic and tactical missiles, precision strike missiles, and interceptors required for missile defense. Product applications for defense systems include strategic and tactical missile motors; maneuvering propulsion systems; attitude control systems; and warhead assemblies used in precision weapon systems and <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missile_defense.html" title="Missile defense">missile defense</a>, as well as airframe structures required on the <a href="../../../f/-/2/F-22_Raptor_e789.html" title="F-22 Raptor">F-22 Raptor</a> aircraft and fire suppression systems for military and commercial vehicles. Their space-related products include liquid engines for expendable and reusable <a href="../../../l/a/u/Launch_vehicle.html" title="Launch vehicle">launch vehicles</a>, upper stage engines, satellite propulsion, large <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solid_rocket_booster.html" title="Solid rocket booster">solid boosters</a>, and integrated propulsion subsystems.</p>
<p>Most recently, Aerojet successfully qualified a 4.5kW <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hall_effect_thruster.html" title="Hall effect thruster">Hall effect thruster</a> electric propulsion system, which is the most powerful flight qualified hall thruster system in the world. Initially, the system will be for use on large, high-power communications satellites. The electric propulsion system, a popular choice for improving spacecraft efficiency in orbit, is now certified for flight for a variety of commercial and government programs. Aerojet is under contract to Lockheed Martin to provide the first two shipsets of the new thruster system for the next generation Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">Air Force</a> program.</p>
<p>Aerojet is currently owned by the company formerly known as the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Tire_30ed.html" title="General Tire">General Tire &amp; Rubber Company</a>, which changed its name to <a href="../../../g/e/n/GenCorp_88cb.html" title="GenCorp">GenCorp</a> in 1984.
