<p>Kiara's Past</p>
<p>When Kiara was 7 years old she was attacked by a evil man with long sliver hair, blue eyes, and wearing a black outfit, named Sephiroth. At that time a man with short blonde hair, and blue eyes was going to become Kiara's legal guardian and his name was Cloud Strife .He vowed to protect her from anyone including Erie and Kagome .One day Kiara was outside in her garden with Kagome and Erie .When a man snuck up from behind her.Kiara heard Cloud yell, “AERIS!” At first Kiara wondered who was Aeris then she looked up and saw the man getting ready yo stab his sword through her heart .Quickly without thinking Kiara closed her eyes .After a couple of minutes Kiara opened her eyes and saw a holy barrier around her, Kagome, and Erie .She sees Cloud charging at the man and yelling, “Sephiroth get away from her&#160;!” Quickly Sephiroth leaps into the air and laughs out evilly, “Go ahead Cloud protect her. I will just come back later to kill her&#160;!”As soon as Sephiroth left Kiara ran towards Cloud hugging him tightly .Cloud whispers in her ear, “Don't worry I won't let anything happen to you no matter what happens to me.” Kiara softly fell asleep in his arms .That very same day the queen ordered Cloud to lock Kiara's powers inside a holy locket and to hold on to it .Cloud quietly enter Kiara's room and says, “All are one ,and one is all, Ancient wisdom will rise and fall, Love is all but one of heart, It brings those together when far apart.”The holy locket absorbs Kiara's power within it. A year later Cloud made a magical staff that can only be held by Kiara only unless she cared about that person. This magical staff can change into any weapon or instrument .From that day Kiara and Cloud trained. Also Kiara's mother the queen had past away from an illness that seemed that she had for years .The queen never showed her illness .Kiara went to her mother's bed and found her mother still breathing and holding an infant . The queen handed Kiara the infant and says, “Kiara take care of your little sister Yuna(if you watch Inuyasha then you know who Rin is and that Kiara's little sister is the recarnation of Rin).” She is just like Rin and thinks about others more than herself and has long black hair, brown eyes, and wears her favorite pink kimono .If Yuna was captured Kiara would do anything to save her sister's life even if it means giving up hers .</p>
<p>Present Kiara is now 15 years old .She has just received a huge letter from Kagome .It told Kiara and Cloud all of her adventures with a half demon named Inuyasha .When Kiara had told everyone about the letter they didn't believe Kagome's adventures .One week from that day Kiara's best friend Erie became possessed by a demon named Jenova and kidnapped Kiara's little sister Yuna .Erie had summoned Sephiroth and destroyed Kiara's kingdom .Now the only ones left that Kiara cares for is Cloud, Erie, Yuna, and Kagome .After that horrible day Kiara went to go live with her cousin Kagome .But when she had arrived she saw Kagome arguing with a boy with long sliverish blue hair, golden amber eyes ,wearing a red kimono, has purple beads around his neck, and carries a blade around with him .When the boy notices Kiara he stops fighting with Kagome and to keep her quiet he stuffed a huge eggroll in her mouth .Kiara finally introduces herself to the boy, “Hi I'm Kiara and this is Cloud .You must be Inuyasha.” Quickly before the boy could answer Kagome stuffed a eggroll in his mouth .Kagome says, “This is Inuyasha Kiara!”Kagome looks around Kiara looking for something .Finally Kiara says, “Kagome what are you looking for&#160;?”Kagome answers to Kiara, “Kiara where is your little sister&#160;?”Kiara wondered about the letter she sent to Kagome before she left her old home.Before she could answer someone shouted Kagome's name and handed her a letter .Kagome quickly opens it up and reads all of it .She finally says, “I am so sorry Kiara.”Before Kiara could speak Inuyasha finally finished the eggroll that Kagome had shoved in his mouth and yells at Kagome, “KAGOME!Why did you shove a eggroll in my mouth!”Before Inuyasha could finish speaking. Kagome placed the letter under Inuyasha and yells, “INUYASHA SIT BOY!”Inuyasha came crashing to the floor on top of the letter. When Inuyasha was back up he stared at Kiara with a sad look in his eyes. Before he could say any thing Kiara speaks up, “Kagome why don't we go to your house before anything else happens.”Kagome and Inuyasha finally agreed on something. When Kiara finally arrived at Kagome's home Kagome takes her to her family shrine .Kagome asks Kiara to look down the well. When Kiara did she fell in .Kagome tries to get Kiara out of there but she had already went through. When Kiara came out of the well she realized that she wasn't in Kagome's family shrine nearby or even around .Kiara hears a distant scream and sees a little girl that looked like her sister Yuna.The little girl had long black hair, brown eyes, wore a reddish brown and orange kimono dress ran behind Kiara .Quickly without thinking Kiara took out her holy staff (magical staff)and changed it into a long holy blade and killed the creature that was chasing the little girl. Before Kiara asked the little girl what had happened a little pale green kappa demon with a two headed staff running towards Kiara and yells, “Rin!There you are what happened.”But before Rin could answer his question another demon with silverish long hair that flows straight down his back with golden-amber eyes .His armor has an armadillo rim-like piece around his left shoulder and going out onto his upper torso .Both his armor and his long flowing sash have a decided "Mainland". His Kimono is mostly white with a red honeycomb and flower crest at the collar, sleeves, and shoulder, most likely the crest of his family clan .He wears Sashinuki Hakama, (a type of traditional flowing Japanese "pants"), which are gathered at the ankles producing the "ballooning" effect. His footwear are flat pointed ankle-high boots, also reminiscent of Mainland influence .On his right arm, he has a fluffy cloth .On his arms are two maroon narrow slashes, also on his face is another pair of such slashes, and has a navy-blue crescent on his forehead easily shown by his parted bangs. He came out of the forest and saw Kiara with a blade in her hand .Before anything happened Rin yelled, “Wait mi lord she saved from a evil demon .Please don't hurt her .” The demon lowers his hand away from his toukjin .Rin turns around to face Kiara and starts to introduce everyone, “Hi I'm Rin ,that green demon with the two headed staff is Jaken ,and over there is Lord Sesshoumaru .Rin then asks Kiara, “What is your name and can you travel with us&#160;?” Kiara answers to Rin's question, “I'm Kiara Lionheart and I will travel with you all.”Rin smiled big and Jaken complained to Sesshoumaru and says to Jaken, “Quiet Jaken&#160;!Let her travel with us besides she can protect Rin when we aren't around.”Jaken agrees to Sesshoumaru's response. Before they moved on Kiara leaned towards Sesshoumaru (reason is that she for got to put her holy locket so now she feels weak and tired). Sesshoumaru catches her and thaey begin to head in a direction towards his castle. Before they had arrived Kiara woke up to a familiar scent .She jumps out of Sesshoumaru's arms and starts to run in a different direction .Rin tried to go after Kiara but Sesshoumaru stopped her .He went after Kiara himself because he knew that Rin would be crying if Kiara never came back. When he arrived to where Kiara was he saw a girl that looked like Rin in the arms of a demon and Kiara yells at the demon, “Jenova let Erie and my sister go!” Jenova pulls out one of blades and starts to attack Kiara without no regards. Before her blade could hurt Kiara .Sesshoumaru blocks Jenova's attack.Quickly he doesn't even notice that Kiara went after her sister and grabs her from Jenova's arms this made Jenova very furious .Before she attacked Kiara Sesshoumaru sliced her in half .But Jenova had turned into dust. Kiara bursts out, “Curse you Jenova another illusion spell.”With no regards Kiara gets out of Sesshoumaru's way and starts to walk off with her little sister. Before Kiara left Sesshoumaru's sight he says, “Kiara. You and your sister can come with us .Kiara nods with agreement and takes her sister with them..Sesshoumaru notices a navy blue cresent glow on Kiara's little sister .Without relizing it he says to Kiara, “Kiara. Your sister has a cresent on her forehead is she a demon&#160;?”Before he could say anymore Kiara turns around and faces Sesshoumaru and says, “Listen stay out of my sister's past this has no concern to you .”Rin comes running towards Kiara but before she could hug her Sesshoumaru says, “Rin do not bother Kiara and her sister.”Kiara shows a little smile and says, “Now Lord Sesshoumaru I will allow Rin to come see me whenever she wants just not now .My sister needs to get used to her surroundings.”Rin smiles and follows Kiara.Finally they all had arrived at Sesshoumaru's Castle. As they enter the castle Kiara notices a woman with long pink hair and brown eyes came rushing up to Sesshoumaru .She bows in front of Sesshoumaru and says, “Mi lord do you wish for me to show this beautiful girl to her room.” Sesshoumaru nods his head in agreement. The woman leads Kiara through the castle and says, “Hello I am Tama .”Kiara speaks, “Hi Tama .I'm Kiara and this little girl is my little sister Yuna.” Tama notices that Kiara and Yuna were both tired. Tama leads Kiara into a beautiful room it has a big balcony, a lovely huge bed, a elegant wardrobe and in one corner stood a girl that is 15 years old .She had long black hair it was up in a ponytail, has golden amber eyes , wears a purple kimono that looked like it was fit for a goddess. Tama leaves the beautiful room. The girl introduced herself, “Welcome I am Terra, you must be Kiara .I've heard so much from Rin already. It seems that she has know you forever.”Kiara walks over to the bed and placed her sister on the bed. Kiara says to her sister, “Wakey wakey sleepy head.” Slowly Yuna opens her eyes to see Kiara in front of her. At first she was scared but then she realizes that Jenova isn't around and sighs with relief .Terra rolls her eyes at Yuna and then notices the cresent on Kiara's and Yuna's head. She asks, “Are you half demons.”When she sees Kiara nods her head .Terra quickly warned them, “Listen Sesshoumaru despises half breeds including his half brother Inuyasha.” Terra guides Kiara and her sister to the dining room .When they had arrived everyone stared at Yuna (except Sesshoumaru. He was to busy eating).Kiara steps infront of her sister and yells, “Whats the matter never seen a little girl before&#160;!” Then everyone just looks away and continues to eat. Yuna thanked her sister grabbed a plate and sat with Rin. Kiara did the same thing except had to sit next to Sesshoumaru which she wasn't to happy about. After acouple of bites out of the food Kiara felt ill and ran to her room .When she finished puking a famliar face enters the room. ]]<i><b>Bold text</b></i> If you wish to find out what happens then read my story called The Affection Beyond it's a love story with one of the Inuyasha charaters. But I am sorry to Inu-Lovers and others but Kiara will not fall in love with Inuyasha, Miroku, or Kouga. OKAY!!!</p>
<p>Maybe I 'll finish it here who knows just keep coming to this site.</p>
