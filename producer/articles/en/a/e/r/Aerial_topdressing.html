<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerial_topdressing.html" title="Edit section: Other aerial applications">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other aerial applications</span></h3>
<p>The first known <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerial_application.html" title="Aerial application">aerial application</a> of agricultural materials was by John Chaytor, who in 1906 spread seed over a swamped valley floor in <a href="../../../w/a/i/Wairoa.html" title="Wairoa">Wairoa</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, using a <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_air_balloon.html" title="Hot air balloon">hot air balloon</a> with mobile tethers.</p>
<p>The first known use of a heavier-than-air machine occurred on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_3.html" title="August 3">3 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a> when as the result of advocacy by Dr Coad, a <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAAC_6162.html" title="USAAC">USAAC</a> <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtiss_JN4_ddf7.html" title="Curtiss JN4">Curtiss JN4 Jenny</a> piloted by John MacReady was used to spread <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead_arsenate.html" title="Lead arsenate">lead arsenate</a> to kill catalpha sphinx <a href="../../../c/a/t/Caterpillars.html" title="Caterpillars">caterpillars</a> near Troy, <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. The first commercial operations were attempted in the US in 1924 and use of <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insecticide.html" title="Insecticide">insecticide</a> and <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fungicide.html" title="Fungicide">fungicide</a> for <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crop_dusting.html" title="Crop dusting">crop dusting</a> slowly spread in the Americas and, to a lesser extent, other nations. Crop dusting poisons enjoyed a boom in the US and Europe after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> until the environmental impact of widespread use became clear, particularly after the publication of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Carson_367f.html" title="Rachel Carson">Rachel Carson</a>'s <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silent_Spring_3e9d.html" title="Silent Spring">Silent Spring</a>. Crop dusting was not adopted in New Zealand until after top dressing was well established.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerial_topdressing.html" title="Edit section: Early suggestions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early suggestions</span></h3>
<p>Initial interest in New Zealand concentrated on seed sowing, but much of New Zealand's central North Island farmland, given to returned servicemen after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, had proven deficient in trace minerals such as <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobalt.html" title="Cobalt">cobalt</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copper.html" title="Copper">copper</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selenium.html" title="Selenium">selenium</a>, forcing difficult topdressing by hand in rough country, or abandoning the land for <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forestry.html" title="Forestry">forestry</a>. The possibility of using aircraft soon occurred.</p>
<p>Spreading <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superphosphate.html" title="Superphosphate">superphosphate</a> by <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agricultural_aircraft.html" title="Agricultural aircraft">agricultural aircraft</a> was independently suggested in 1926 by two New Zealanders, John Lambert of <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunterville.html" title="Hunterville">Hunterville</a> and Len Daniell of Wairere. There was some publicity when in 1936 <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawkes_Bay_b146.html" title="Hawkes Bay">Hawkes Bay</a> <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farmer.html" title="Farmer">farmer</a> Harold McHardy used a <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Gypsy_Moth_da7d.html" title="De Havilland Gypsy Moth">de Havilland Gypsy Moth</a> to sow <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clover.html" title="Clover">clover</a> <a href="../../../s/e/e/Seed.html" title="Seed">seed</a> on his own land. This led the Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Council to decide to fund aerial sowing and topdressing trials in 1937 to prevent <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erosion.html" title="Erosion">erosion</a>, but little progress was made, despite strong advocacy by Doug Campbell.</p>
<p>At that time it was illegal to drop anything from an aircraft, which dissuaded several advocates who felt a law change was needed before experiments could begin. Eventually Esmond Gibson would get that law change, but long before that news of early experiments was spread by a pilot for the Ministry of Works who simply took the risk of publishing an article showing he broke the law.</p>

<p>The idea of spreading seed also occurred to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Pritchard_e24e.html" title="Alan Pritchard">Alan Pritchard</a>, a <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviator.html" title="Aviator">pilot</a> for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Ministry_of_Works_725f.html" title="New Zealand Ministry of Works">Public Works Department</a>, as he was flying E. Madden of the Ministry of Works in a de Havilland Moth, sharing grapes and throwing the seeds out of the open cockpits. A few months later Prtichard was tasked with conducting an aerial survey in Northland. the survey was delayed when the Ministry's <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_Whitney_Straight_3ff9.html" title="Miles Whitney Straight">Miles Whitney Straight</a>, ZK-AFH, was grounded by bad weather. A supervisor, J. L. Harrison, complained that Pritchard was holding back men needed to sow <a href="../../../l/u/p/Lupin_seed.html" title="Lupin seed">lupin seed</a>. Remembering the grape seeds, Pritchard suggested sowing the seed by air. Burying the hatchet, Harrison and Pritchard spent that evening experimenting with methods of dispersal, before settling on sewing a sack onto a piece of downpipe. The following morning, <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_8.html" title="March 8">8 March</a> 1939, Pritchard flew over <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninety_Mile_Beach%2C_New_Zealand_8274.html" title="Ninety Mile Beach, New Zealand">Ninety Mile Beach</a> while Harrison, on his signal, held the downpipe out a window and emptied the sack. They then landed and examined the spread of the seeds. It was found a distribution of 1 seed per square foot was obtained from a height of 100 to 150 feet. On Monday 10 March, they sowed 375 acres, using 2 lb/acre (224 kg/km²) instead of the 5 lb/acre (560 kg/km²) used when sowing by hand. The pair returned to examine the site at 2 weeks, 1 month and 2 years and at all points the aerially-sown land was indistinguishable from that sown by hand.</p>
<p>Pritchard wrote up the experiment in the NZ Journal of Agriculture (vol 70 p117-120). This came to the attention of the Minister <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Semple_d04b.html" title="Bob Semple">Bob Semple</a>, who Pritchard occasionally flew as a VIP. Semple asked how Pritchard had obtained permission. Pritchard admitted he had not, and had "cribbed" back the time in the ZK-AFH's <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logbook.html" title="Logbook">logbooks</a> by extending the time of other flights. Semple encouraged Pritchard to continue, adding "Don't let anyone catch you, and if they do, send them to me". After the outbreak of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, he had the good fortune to retain the use of ZK-AFH, when most aircraft were impressed for war service. Pritchard conducted various trials between 1939 and 1943, from an early stage adding fertiliser to the seeds, which was found to dramatically improve growth. The success of the fertiliser was such that his trials came to concentrate on this aspect, and its possible application to existing pasture.</p>
<p>As a result of Pritchard's experiments, in 1945 the Department of Agriculture estimated aerial topdressing would cost about £4 per ton of fertiliser (on a basis of 2 cwt per acre), which was economic (in actual fact, this price turned out to be a significant overestimate). Pritchard now found an ally who could officially sanction further trials.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerial_topdressing.html" title="Edit section: Doug Campbell">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Doug Campbell</span></h3>
<p>Doug Campbell was an agricultural academic concerned about soil erosion. He had been suggesting the spread of both seed and fertiliser for erosion control and aerial spreading of trace minerals since the 1930s, but had not conducted trials until he met Pritchard. Campbell brought official backing and academic responsibility to Pritchard's work. Immediately after the war, he obtained permission to build a sheet metal hopper for ZK-AFH to test the spread of blue stone crystals. In 1946 the first pure topdressing flight was conducted without seed. Mixtures of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copper%28II%29_sulfate_2390.html" title="Copper(II) sulfate">bluestone crystals</a>, sulphate of ammonia, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcium_hydroxide.html" title="Calcium hydroxide">slaked lime</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/o/Soot.html" title="Soot">carbon black</a> were used. The lack of a lid for the hopper initially resulted in irritating dust spreading through the aircraft in turbulence: in cold wet conditions it was necessary to heat the hopper to prevent the fertiliser coagulating, while in dry conditions the powder tended to disperse in the wind before reaching the ground. Nevertheless in July Campbell arranged for ZK-AFH to topdress 1,100 acres (4.5 km²) of a copper-deficient farm. In August 1947 trials with cobalt sulphate in liquid form were conducted on the farm of K. M. Hickson near <a href="../../../t/a/u/Taumarunui.html" title="Taumarunui">Taumarunui</a>, with a horseback-mounted radio used to convey results to the pilot. It was soon suggested that cobaltised superphosphate would be easier to spread, although it was felt a specialised aircraft would be needed to do this.</p>
<p>Campbell published his research in the New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology, Volume X, 1948 as "Some observations on top dressing in New Zealand".</p>
<p>Convinced by the trials, Campbell formed the co-ordinating and advisory committee on aerial topdressing with representatives from the Ministry of Public Works, Department of Agriculture, Department of Air, <a href="../../../d/s/i/DSIR_3ae4.html" title="DSIR">DSIR</a> and the Soil Conservation Council. At the committee's first meeting on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_27.html" title="November 27">27 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> it resolved to ask the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_New_Zealand_Air_Force_5675.html" title="Royal New Zealand Air Force">Royal New Zealand Air Force</a> for assistance.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerial_topdressing.html" title="Edit section: The RNZAF trials">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The RNZAF trials</span></h3>
<p>Between the second world war and the cold war, the <a href="../../../r/n/z/RNZAF_245f.html" title="RNZAF">RNZAF</a> was a large and competent organisation without a lot of work to do. It responded enthusiastically to Campbell's suggestion, initially proposing to use <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Moth_6e31.html" title="Tiger Moth">Tiger Moth</a> and <a href="../../../d/c/-/DC-3_e82c.html" title="DC-3">DC-3</a> aircraft, but concerns about corrosion lead them to use "expendable" war surplus <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grumman_Avenger_69bc.html" title="Grumman Avenger">Grumman Avengers</a>.</p>
<p>Experiments were resumed on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_5.html" title="September 5">5 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> using a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_Whitney_Straight_3ff9.html" title="Miles Whitney Straight">Miles Whitney Straight</a> and three Grumman Avengers; the RNZAF put superphosphate in a converted long range fuel tank in Avenger NZ2504 and dropped it over the concrete runway at <a href="../../../o/h/a/Ohakea.html" title="Ohakea">Ohakea</a>. (NZ2504 is now preserved in the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_New_Zealand_Air_Force_Museum_e067.html" title="Royal New Zealand Air Force Museum">Royal New Zealand Air Force Museum</a>).</p>
<p>The superphosphate was too powdery but a more granular form was found before final trials measuring distribution pattern of spread by air on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_16.html" title="September 16">September 16</a> 1948. The results were considered very promising. Trials proceeded to hill country at Te Mata near <a href="../../../r/a/g/Raglan.html" title="Raglan">Raglan</a>, and were extended to three other sites.</p>
<p>For 1949 a Research and Development flight was formed under Stan Quill, equipped with the three Avengers and a <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_DC-3_fa22.html" title="Douglas DC-3">Douglas DC-3</a>, while instructions were sent to England to modify 2 RNZAF <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_Aerovan_433d.html" title="Miles Aerovan">Miles Aerovans</a> then on the production line to carry one-ton hoppers. A ground convoy of station wagon, car, one-ton truck, jeep, fuel tanker and radio van supported them. The 1948 fuel tank was replaced by a hopper with sides angled at 60° with a vibrating rod to loosen the superphosphate. Large-scale topdressing started on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_14.html" title="March 14">14 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> spreading clover-super mix. The "Topdress III" trials culminated on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_21.html" title="May 21">21 May</a> 1949 with a demonstration drop on 11 different properties close to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masterton.html" title="Masterton">Masterton</a> in front of large numbers of farmers and press. These trials were calculated to have spread 2.5 cwt/acre (31,000 kg/km²) at an all-up cost of 15/-, despite the use of inappropriately over-powered combat aircraft. Further public displays were given to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_%28government%29.html" title="Minister (government)">cabinet ministers</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">30 August</a> at <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnsonville%2C_New_Zealand_b4cb.html" title="Johnsonville, New Zealand">Johnsonville</a>, on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">9 September</a> at Ohakea and at a <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_17.html" title="September 17">September 17</a> Air Force Day air show. As these trials were a resounding success, in addition to the Aerovans, 12 <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Freighter_f73f.html" title="Bristol Freighter">Bristol Freighters</a> then under construction for the RNZAF were modified to take superphosphate hoppers.</p>
<p>Following these successful trials, in 1950 farmers' groups lobbied the government to have the RNZAF provide subsidised topdressing with the Bristol freighters and even advocated using large <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handley_Page_Hastings_b349.html" title="Handley Page Hastings">Handley Page Hastings</a> planes. But by this time government work was being overtaken by private enterprise as ex-airforce pilots bought New Zealand-built <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Tiger_Moth_e4d0.html" title="De Havilland Tiger Moth">De Havilland Tiger Moth</a> biplanes cheaply, placed a hopper in the front seat and went into business flying from the paddocks of any farmer willing to pay. The RNZAF was waking up to the "Communist threat" and preferred to concentrate on defence, and the government was reluctant to spend money or interfere with the increasing number of commercial operators.</p>

<p>Faced with far greater difficulty of operating aircraft from small British farms, the British Government assumed topdressing aircraft would need to operate from an ordinary runway. Economies of scale then dictated using large aircraft, which would in turn have to fly higher. Accordingly in 1950 the RAF conducted trials over Scottish farm land with <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avro_Lincoln_5ca4.html" title="Avro Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a> and <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avro_Lancaster_d160.html" title="Avro Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> bombers carrying canvas trays with 5 tons of superphosphate in 14 lb and 28 lb paper bags designed to burst on impact. These trials were a failure due to poor spread achieved from the bags. The <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company_bac9.html" title="Bristol Aeroplane Company">Bristol Aeroplane Company</a> conducted private trials on hill country in the same year with scaled-up versions of the New Zealand hoppers fitted to Bristol Freighters. The success of these trials was widely publicised through Farmers' Weekly magazine. Hopper conversions were marketed for the Freighter and the even larger <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handley_Page_Hastings_b349.html" title="Handley Page Hastings">Handley Page Hastings</a>. However low capitalisation for start up costs and the difficulties of low level operation in large transports led British private industry to use smaller machines, even though they could not operate directly from farms.</p>

<p>Several factors lay behind the development of aerial topdressing in the apparent backwater of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. The New Zealand <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_service.html" title="Civil service">public service</a> gave its employees time and resources to pursue their ideas and publish research. Many farms included hill country, where it was impossible to spread fertiliser by truck. New Zealand farms tended to be large enough to make the costs worthwhile. High prices for <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamb.html" title="Lamb">lamb</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wool.html" title="Wool">wool</a> in the early 1950s gave farmers the extra capital. World War II had left behind cheap war-surplus Tiger Moths and highly trained ex air force pilots.</p>
<p>The majority of the 40,000 plus New Zealanders trained by the RNZAF were aircrew, because most were sent to Europe, and served in squadrons where the ground crew were from the United Kingdom. On returning to their rural homes, many bought cheap war-surplus aircraft, particularly the <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Moth_6e31.html" title="Tiger Moth">Tiger Moth</a> primary trainer, available for £100. These were used for weekend flying, but also dropping fencing, feed and people into remote areas, as well as occasional aerial sowing and dropping of <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbit.html" title="Rabbit">rabbit</a> poison.</p>
<p>By the end of 1949 there were five firms; Airwork had five Tiger moths, James Aviation three, Aircraft Services three, Gisborne Aerial topdressing (which was to become Field Air) had one, and Southern Scenic Airtrips had converted an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Auster.html" title="Auster">Auster</a>. In addition Wally Harding was top dressing his own property with his private Tiger Moth. Within the following five years nearly 50 other companies - mostly one-man operations - joined as competition. Collectively, they were called the 'Super men', and when amalgamation occurred it was these pioneers who came to dominate the New Zealand industry.</p>

<p>Since 1947, Airwork (NZ) Limited had been operating Tiger Moths for rabbit killing by spreading poisoned carrots in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury%2C_New_Zealand_22ed.html" title="Canterbury, New Zealand">Canterbury</a>. In early May 1949 Charles Brazier used ZK-ASO to spread lime. Airwork was aware that Fred "Popeye" Lucas had conducted aerial seeding as well as rabbit poisoning and discussed the possibility of dropping seeds with fertiliser (as Pritchard had done) with Ces Worrell, a grain and seed merchant. He suggested spreading superphosphate alone would be more profitable, (a suggestion he may have wished he had kept to himself - the following year, Worrell started a rival firm, Aerial Sowing). Acting on Worral's suggestion, Airwork arranged a public demonstration on Sir Heaton Rhodes's property at Tai Tapu, south of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christchurch.html" title="Christchurch">Christchurch</a>, on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_27.html" title="May 27">27 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>. They advertised spreading superphosphate for £5 per ton, and several orders came from the audience.</p>
<p>Airwork pioneered the technique of landing on the farmer's property, loading and turning the aircraft round in three or four minutes. To save time, bulk loading from a vehicle was pioneered instead of emptying bags into the hopper. For the first drop a hurriedly-converted <a href="../../../h/u/p/Hupmobile.html" title="Hupmobile">Hupmobile</a> was used, but this soon broke down and was replaced by a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_Rover_6b48.html" title="Land Rover">Land Rover</a> chassis fitted with hydraulic arms. This investment was justified when Pyne Gould Guinness placed the first large contract at Christmas 1949. Airwork would go on to have a major role in the development of the Fletcher aircraft.</p>

<p>Lawson Field (1896–1981), a farmer and pilot, converted one of <a href="../../../g/i/s/Gisborne%2C_New_Zealand_a737.html" title="Gisborne, New Zealand">Gisborne</a> Aero Club's de Havilland Tiger Moths, Barbara II, so that Ken Young could drop superphosphate during the week and the club could fly the plane at weekends. The arrangement was typical of the system adopted by all early firms; a steep sided hopper was installed in the Tiger Moth's front seat, which the pilot released by pulling a lever. When the club complained the hopper could not be removed from the passenger seat without causing structural damage, Field bought Barbara II and started the Gisborne Aerial Topdressing Company on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">2 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>. He calculated his first drop cost £2.10s. per ton of fertiliser, and he was able to charge farmers £5 per ton. In September 1949 he became the founding president of the New Zealand Aerial Work Operators' Association, later the Aviation Industry Association of New Zealand. In 1951 he renamed the company Fieldair Limited and brought in modern <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-2_Beaver_9312.html" title="De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver">De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beavers</a>, and in 1955 <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_Lodestar_175c.html" title="Lockheed Lodestar">Lockheed Lodestars</a> and DC-3s. Fieldair developed the tractor-mounted hopper loader, adopted throughout the industry, and became the largest topdressing firm in the country by the time of Field’s death in 1981.</p>
<p>Fieldair's logo is a strangled <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goose.html" title="Goose">goose</a>. According to legend, a hungry Fieldair pilot flying between airstrips saw a single goose which looked like dinner. His somewhat hopeful method was to attempt to manoeuvre alongside the bird, side slip into it and grab hold. The first few attempts failed and the goose got wise. A dogfight developed, and both fliers lost altitude. A hundred feet over a gully the goose broke towards the aircraft, and hit the prop, breaking it. The pilot force landed, and concocted a suitable story of bird strike, which was sadly undone when the farmer requested the company's services, as "You blokes must have the best pilots in the country...one of your blokes chased this goose around my farm for about a half an hour. He must have just missed by inches every tree on my place. And to top it off this bloke succeeded in killing the goose and landed to pick it up". (Ewing &amp; MacPherson, p182).</p>

<p>By 1952 there were 38 firms in the business in New Zealand, operating 149 aircraft, of which 138 were Tiger Moths. A smattering of higher powered <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-2_Beaver_9312.html" title="De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver">de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beavers</a> were the only modern types. By 1956 there were 182 aerial topdressing Tiger Moths but it was obvious the lightweight Tiger Moths would need to be replaced. At the beginning of the 1950s there were no specialist designs for even crop dusters, due to the proliferation of World War II surplus trainers. But for topdressing something larger and more robust was needed.</p>

<p>Conversions of more robust <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> aircraft started. In 1954 the RNZAF had conducted some further topdressing tests at <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masterton.html" title="Masterton">Masterton</a> using a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Freighter_f73f.html" title="Bristol Freighter">Bristol Freighter</a> fitted with three 2 ton hoppers, though to appease higher command the aircraft was given civilian registration ZK-BEV and hired to the private company "Industrial Flying Limited".

<p>The DHC Beaver was purchased in numbers and there were abortive plans to build it under license in New Zealand, but its high wing and bulky cabin were unsuited to the role.

<p>Entirely new designs were clearly needed in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australasia.html" title="Australasia">Australasia</a>. In Britain Auster produced the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Auster_Agricola_f505.html" title="Auster Agricola">Auster Agricola</a> and Percival the Percival EP-9 for the New Zealand market, both robust but primitive fabric covered aircraft, while in Australia the small but more advanced Yeoman Cropmaster was developed.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, Fletcher Aviation Corporation was persuaded by a delegation of New Zealanders to develop an aircraft for the New Zealand market, and Jim Thorpe adapted a design for the FD25 Defender light attack aircraft into the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fletcher_Fu24_5c35.html" title="Fletcher Fu24">Fletcher Fu24</a>, a stressed skin monoplane with a high lift wing, more than three times the load of the Tiger Moth, and the cockpit located well forward, ahead of the hopper, giving the pilot all round view. This – with a few changes, such as an enclosed cockpit - turned out to be the winning formula and orders soon reached three figures. Cable Price Corporation funded two prototypes with the New Zealand Meat Producers Board acting as financial guarantor; Gibson having brow beaten a reluctant Fletcher board into building a prototype, Airparts was formed to assemble the American kits. The first prototype was flown in America in June 1954, the second in New Zealand in September 1954 and received type approval in May 1955. A hundred Fletcher kits were delivered to New Zealand that year. Airparts bought out the rights and continued development locally.</p>
<p>Specialist crop dusters such as the Schweizer Agcat emerged in America in the mid 1950s, designed for the flat mid west. These generally had poorer forward vision and lesser payload to weight ratios than the Fletcher, which continued to dominate the New Zealand market - however in places where aircraft primarily were used to drop insecticide, these American designs were superior.</p>

<p>By 1958 there were 73 aerial topdressing firms in New Zealand, flying 279 aircraft - but although the amount of superphospate dropped and the area it fell on would continue to increase, from now on the numbers of companies, aircraft, and pilots dropped, as the larger more expensive Fletchers came to dominate the market and the one man companies that began in the 1940s were amalgamated.</p>
<p>By 1965, a million tons of superphospate was being dropped annually, spread over 9 million acres (36,000 km²). The amount an aircraft dropped had increased from 2.5 tons to 8 tons and there were 10,000 privately owned airstrips for topdressing in New Zealand. Other work was also done by agricultural aircraft, as in foreign countries, particularly outside the February to May prime season; clover seed is sown and spraying is carried out with <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insecticide.html" title="Insecticide">insecticides</a>, <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fungicide.html" title="Fungicide">fungicides</a>, and weed killers as well as general utility work. Aerial Topdressing has been attributed with vastly increasing agricultural production - in New Zealand alone, sheep numbers increased from 40 million to over 70 million, the majority of the increase being attributed to the increased feed superphosphate made available.</p>

<p>Ironically, given the industry was started by government research aimed at soil <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservation_ecology.html" title="Conservation ecology">conservation</a>, a number of negative impacts have emerged. The two major criticisms are the run off of fertiliser into streams and waterways which encourages marine plant growth, leading to choking of the waterways and altering the fresh water ecosystem, disadvantaging many fish, (and frustrating <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angler.html" title="Angler">anglers</a>). To minimise impact, topdressing is now prohibited within certain distances of water. The second impact is less direct. By enabling sheep to be run profitably on steep hillsides, the topdressing industry stopped reforestation of otherwise uneconomic land, contributing to the erosion it was originally designed to prevent.</p>
