<p>Since her name has been officially changed back to <i>Aerith</i> in localizations, shouldn't we change the article name to her original <i>Aerith Gainsbourg</i>, and mention that it was translated <i>Aeris Gainsborough</i> in older translations?

<dd>On what basis is this "official"? <a href="http://na.square-enix.com/games/ff7/aeris-char.html" class="external text" title="http://na.square-enix.com/games/ff7/aeris-char.html" rel="nofollow">Her page</a> on the Square-Enix website still says "Aeris". Hard to see how "Aerith" in Kingdom Hearts is more canonical than FF7 itself, except that KH is more recent. The <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_VII_f2ee.html" title="Final Fantasy VII">Final Fantasy VII</a> page does a better job than this one of explaining the romanization issue (note that in Japanese, she's "Earisu", which is an approximation of "Earth" with Japanese characters - interesting that there's such a hangup on the equally-valid readings of "th" and "s" as transliterations of "su", yet nobody complains that the "E" and "A" are switched in English). Anyways, this is a hot-button issue, and saying that Aerith is an "official" renaming may be an overstatement. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvalidname_9652.html" title="User:Invalidname">Invalidname</a></dd>

The biggest problem is the inconstancy that Square has in it's localization of games – in some areas they use Aerith and in others they use Aeris; however, if you go by the original name used in Japan then we have Aerith as the official name. This is the name that is used on official Final Fantasy VII merchandize that has been released in Japan. As for the website referred to above – it might as well not be taken into consideration, in part because it has not been updated in an extremely long time - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkstar949_7f19.html" title="User:Darkstar949">darkstar949</a> 14 July 2005</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You're right that it's a matter of inconsistent localization, and the only name that's plausibly right is what they used in Japan. Unfortunately, that means changing the name of the article to エアリス, which isn't going to work for an "en" locale site. -<a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvalidname_9652.html" title="User:Invalidname">invalidname</a> 7/16/05</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, there are several instances of official Japanese FFVII literature (intruction booklet, players guides, art books, etc.) which spell the name in romaji/English, along with with the katakana spelling. And that official romaji spelling is "Aerith." <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDruff_9796.html" title="User:Druff">Druff</a> 01:36, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My argument though is that in the game itself, as presented to an English-language audience, Square chose the spelling "Aeris", not "Aerith". The names used on merchandise in Japan are nowhere near as relevant or interesting to English speakers as the name that appears in the game itself. If Square now prefers "Aerith", that's fine, but they have not made that preference in any way clear, as indicated by the mixture of "Aeris" and "Aerith" spellings that appear in the related universe of merchandise, spinoffs, etc. If they go with "Aerith" in the localizations of <a href="../../../a/d/v/Final_Fantasy_VII%7E_Advent_Children_a2be.html" title="Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children">Advent Children</a> or <a href="../../../d/i/r/Final_Fantasy_VII%7E_Dirge_of_Cerberus_3c22.html" title="Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus">Dirge of Cerberus</a>, then that would be a far more compelling claim for an "official" name change.

<dd>This isn't aimed at you, darkstar949, because your post is very reasoned and thoughtful, but I do think there's an element of the FFVII contingent that seizes on the "Aerith" spelling as a means of saying, in effect, "we know better than you proles who only played the game." Just because they're louder, it doesn't mean they're right. -<a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvalidname_9652.html" title="User:Invalidname">invalidname</a> 7/16/05</dd>

<dd>From what I can tell, 'Aerith' is the earliest translation. I remember, way back in '96 when all the game info was starting to be released, she was always referred to as 'Aerith'. But when the English translation was made it became 'Aeris', which is an acceptable transliteration of 'エアリス' (since, as many of you may know, there is no 'th' sound in Japanese, thus they compensate for that by using the 'su' sound). I guess, since most English speaking game players know her as Aeris, Square-Enix have decided to use Aeris, though rather inconsistantly.&#160;:/ --Ludi 11:46, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The official name is "Aerith", through confusion in teh translatingit was changed. User:220.239.189.51</p>
<p>I suppose this discussion has pretty much blown through to its conclusion by now, at least until Advent Children is released in an English-speaking country, but I thought I'd mention a few things. First, wasn't Final Fantasy VII translated by Sony, not Square? I was surprised to find that Sony's involvement wasn't even mentioned on the talk page here. I'd hardly consider Sony's translation to be "official", particularly opposed to the various products released in Japan with Aerith's name written in romaji as "Aerith". On another note, doesn't anyone find the "Name Spelling Debate" section rather vitriolic, or at least POV? Eh, maybe I'll try to clean it up and tone it down later, if nobody minds. -- <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERablari_Dash_6f98.html" title="User:Rablari Dash">Rablari Dash</a> 11:20, 2006-01-02 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A question- Since they're both pronounced the same, and since the Japanese do not have the "th" sound, what was the *point* in making the change from Aeris to Aerith in english speaking countries? From an english speaking standpoint, the spelling of "Aeris" is closer to what the Japanese were saying when they spoke Aerith's name outloud ('Heiressu' if I'm not mistaken)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most english speakers, upon seeing "Aerith", will pronouce it "Air-ith", which, quite frankly, sounds terrible...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, don't get me wrong, I've accepted the change, since it seems clear that Square-Enix want "Aerith" to be the way her name is written. But since it should *still* pronouced as Aeris(Heiress)... I fail to see the point and it's bound to confuse people - in fact, we'll probably end up with the English translation of Advent Children saying "Air-ith".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This means that we'll have gone from the not unbearable situation of Aeris' name being spelled "incorrectly" but being pronounced right to the opposite. Which will be *further* from what the creators intended. Gah!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It should have just stayed Aeris for the English speaking audience. After all, do we have this much fuss over the fact that Terra was called Tina in Japan? (195.92.168.174 20:15, 12 January 2006 (UTC))</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Er, another question- on what basis is the assertion made that 'Aeris' and 'Aerith' are pronounced the same way? Certainly, both are pronounced (and spelled) alike in Japanese, but I can think of no sensical reason why the same should be true in English. After all, Sephiroth in Japanese is also pronounced with an 's' sound at the end, and you won't find anyone claiming that the name is meant to be said as 'Sephiros.' 67.9.105.197 07:34, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's my take: If we use Aerith, we'd have to use names like Cain, Gilbert, Terah, Tina, Rokku, Mash, Tida, Ceres, Citan, Cefka, Ryukku, and countless others. Change it to Aeris. And don't change it back. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyswordsman_e813.html" title="User:Crazyswordsman">Crazyswordsman</a> 04:31, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why would we have to do any such thing? I suggest you read the preceding discussion before jumping in: the problem is that both "Aeris" and "Aerith" have appeared in English language material relating to the game, whereas "Cefka" has pretty much always been "Kefka" in English language literature. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 04:56, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm willing to make the contention that we should be using those names. I believe we should respect the original names if we respect the media. It would seem strange to say "I love your games, but refuse to call the characters by the names you gave them." Doesn't that seem very rude? And ethnocentric? At the very least, the commonly used English name and the original Japanese name should both be mentioned. -- <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERablari_Dash_6f98.html" title="User:Rablari Dash">Rablari Dash</a> 07:13, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I thought you guys might appreciate this information (I was just dropping it off in the Jenova discussion section of all places):</p>
<p>"Aeris' name is just a Japanese transliteration of the English word 'Earth.' If you'll notice, in katakana (the Japanese alphabet used for words that are not of Japanese origin), the name is written as 'Earisu.' It's the tendency of vowels to follow consonants in Japanese ('n' being the only exception; thus, the 'i' after 'r') and the Japanese language has no 'th' characters, instead using 'su.' It became 'Aeris' as a result of writing it in romaji (the alphabet in which English characters represent Japanese sounds) to represent how it sounds when spoken in Japanese ('Air-reese').</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, the katakana for "Earth" is NOT "earisu" (エアリス), but "aasu" (アース). The game, "Fantasy Earth", for example, has the katakana of "ファンタジーアース". Earth Day is "アースデー". So while "Earisu" might be a derivative of the word, don't stretch the connection too much. --151.202.50.185 19:44, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>'Aerith,' by the way, the other popular -- and actually official -- romanization of the name, should technically never occur. As it's written, it's essentially a combination of the romaji form of the Japanese transliteration and the original English word that was transliterated. It's technically impossible because there is no 'th' sound in Japanese to be represented by romaji characters. Nonetheless, it's the official romanization chosen by the creators of Final Fantasy VII."</p>
<p>The matter of "Earth" being the word of origin is stated in the Final Fantasy VII: Kaitai Shinsho book on Aerith's profile page. Here's a scan for proof:</p>
<p><a href="http://img30.imageshack.us/my.php?image=aerith6ot.jpg" class="external free" title="http://img30.imageshack.us/my.php?image=aerith6ot.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img30.imageshack.us/my.php?image=aerith6ot.jpg</a></p>

<p>The text there is as follows: "ネーミングの来由 Earth（大地）の読みかたを変えて命名"</p>
<p>--Squall of SeeD January 2006</p>
<p>The article itself says that Aerith shouldn't exist,. There's no TH sound in Japanese, nor does it have the letters. Even in japanese, the name is pronounced similair to the English spelling of Aeris. The original FfVII, as well as tactics, and parasite Eve all reference her name as being Aeris. Yes, Kingdom Hearts uses the name Aerith, but it's an entriely different world, and Squal has become Leon. You don't hear anybody arguing the name Leon should be used for Squall. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 24.26.88.88 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.26.88.88.html" title="User talk:24.26.88.88">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.26.88.88_bbe3.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.26.88.88">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>"Th" is a valid, though rather antiquated, romanization of the katakana character "ス." Without any other point of reference, yes, the most sensible and "correct" way of rendering the name would be "Aeris." <i>However</i>, as was said by Squall above, Japanese language materials have presented her name in both kana and romanized form, and the romanized form they have <i>always</i> used has been "Aerith." Given that our Japanese source materials use "Aerith," and more recent English materials use "Aerith," it seems to be the most logical choice for this article, as well. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 13:44, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to mention a few things to this discussion, as it apparently refuses to stay dead (yes, I know I'm contributing to that). First, I'd like to thank Squall of SeeD, both for his scans, and for <a href="http://db.gamefaqs.com/portable/psp/file/final_fantasy_vii_ac_plot.txt" class="external text" title="http://db.gamefaqs.com/portable/psp/file/final_fantasy_vii_ac_plot.txt" rel="nofollow">his excellent Advent Children FAQ</a> (That is you, right?). I just haven't had the opportunity to thank him for that, hope he reads this.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I think there's an assumption being made here that isn't necessarily valid: that Japanese artists always name things in Japanese. Specifically, it seems as if the arguments here are assuming that "エアリス" is the original spelling, and that "Aeris" and "Aerith" are attempts at romanizing the katakana. However, the scans that Squall of SeeD has produced say that she was "named after an alternate reading of the English word earth". The two kanji right after EARTH, 大地, disambiguates the meaning, which is "the ground", or "the land", rather than "The planet Earth". My point is that "Aerith Gainsborough" is her proper name, and that "エアリス・ゲインズブール" just tells a Japanese person how to pronounce the non-Japanese name. It is common for characters in modern Japanese stories to be <i>gasp</i> not Japanese. Thus, they do not have Japanese names. Amazing how that is, isn't it? They're supposedly such a closed, elitist culture, and yet they write stories in which the characters are not of their own race.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, ス is a common way to transliterate (sheesh, we have a word for converting kana to roman letters, but not one for the other way around?) the English consonant blend "th". They don't have anything better. Well, ソ is also used. It depends on the flow of the word.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, I contend that "Aerith" is the original, correct spelling, even more so than "エアリス", and that it's probably pronounced how it looks: "Air-ith". "Air-iss" is just the closest set of sounds in the Japanese language, and thus, how they would probably pronounce it, even realizing that it is not perfectly accurate. It's difficult to make sounds that you were not raised to speak, and often equally difficult to recognize the difference between them. For example, it's difficult for most native English speakers to correctly pronounce the Japanese character つ. And just as Japanese speakers frequently have trouble differentiating between the English "L" and "R", English speakers have an equally difficult time correctly pronouncing the characters らりるれろ, which sound similar to both "L" and "R", but not exactly like either of them. -- <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERablari_Dash_6f98.html" title="User:Rablari Dash">Rablari Dash</a> 07:13, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm just throwing this on here in a few places for information purposes- the IMDB has listed the US voices for AC, and they have her US name as Aeris.</p>
<p>From the full cast list on IMDB- Maaya Sakamoto .... Aerith Gainsborough (voice: Japanese version) Mena Suvari .... Aeris Gainsborough (voice: English version)</p>
<p>Now, argue away about proper or inproper translations, but alot of people here have voiced that we should "wait and see what the english version of AC names her," so there you go.</p>
<p>For my two cents, I'm fairly neutral on the subject. I use Aeris, but have no problem with people using Aerith. But I think if the argument swings back to "what US sources" use, well Kingdom hearts is hardly canonincal. So if one were to argue that point, the useage of Aeris in FF7 and AC would certainly overshadow what KH used, considering that her appearence in KH amounts to a cameo. <a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a> 01:30, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This the most ludicrous form of <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedantry.html" title="Pedantry">pedantry</a> I've ever seen on Wikipedia. "Aeris" is obviously the appropriate spelling for an English-language encyclopedia article about the character. "Aerith" is nothing more than a silly fanboy <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shibboleth.html" title="Shibboleth">shibboleth</a>. --24.131.209.132 00:46, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's not just silly fanboy stuff because the Japanese do transliterate it as Aerith most of the time. However, I agree on Aeris, since FF7 is the main source on her and that was how they did it there. AC remains to be seen, and KH is merely a cameo . Some point to KH, but that no more solidifies Aerith than FF Tactics did Aeris, newness aside. Non-canon appearances don't count for this sort of thing. I mean, the Chrono Trigger pages use Magus, even though his Japanese name was Mao. They mention both names, but use the name anyone using English wiki is likely to use. That's my 2 cents anyway. If AC uses Aerith, it seems that's Square's final resolve on US spelling, and they have the right to spell it as they wish. <a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a> 20:32, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the Sephiroth article, they mention the reference in Tactics, where part of his name is written '-phiros' instead of '-phiroth'. So, if a more recent spelling takes precedence for kingdom hearts, then why not for tactics? Personally, I think it's a silly argument to make. If you're going to write the english spellings, then it makes more sense to list the english name. Heck, look at some of the other arguments you'd otherwise encourage...<br />
What about in dragonball, where the romanizations are constantly given different spellings? How do you choose which one to use? For most cases, they just use the english name in wikipedia.<br />
To be perfectly honest, the only (valid) reason I can think of for using the name 'Aerith' instead of 'Aeris' is that 'Aerith' seems to be more popular with the fans that have kept interest in the franchise alive. I don't know if that's enough or not. But what I do know is that that isn't enough to call her 'Aerith' specifically in the section of the article where she's mentioned in Tactics. The way the article is currently written, it says that she appears in tactics as Aeris, but the article still calls her Aerith for that section. So, I'm editing that one section, because I don't see any argument listed for calling her Aerith in her Tactics appearance specifically. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 00:00, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're referring to the same character in that section, thus, we use the same name for consistency, and in an attempt to avoid confusing the reader of the article. So unless you want to make the argument that the "Aeris" in Final Fantasy tactics is supposed to be an different character named "Aeris", rather than the same character... It just isn't going to happen. -- <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERablari_Dash_6f98.html" title="User:Rablari Dash">Rablari Dash</a> 07:33, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok... The issue in Aeris vs Aerith isn't Kingdom Hearts, it was an article in a strategy guide put out in Japan... The guide said the name was a katakana spelling of earth, which 1. is eroneous (yes, god-forbid the Japanese not get the English language correct)and 2. Wouldn't lead to Aerith being her name, but it would lead to Earth being her name... Perhaps Gaia or Terra to make it more feminine. The creators of the guide didn't understand the Latin, not English, origins of the name. Aeris (not Aerith) is the latin word for both Air and Aether. What is Aether? Aether is the mythical substance that the universe was made of. The spelling of Ether (which is a chemical that puts people to sleep) in the games would be more accurately Aether, though even the Aether in the Aether theory is often spelled Ether... Now, doesn't that seem to fit Aeris, as the face of the Lifestream? The word Aeris shows up (logically) in the latin Opera Carmina Burana, as does Materia. What is carmina burana? Well, it is the opera that the lyrics from One Winged Angel were pulled from (the original game version, I'm not sure about the new one on Advent Children) Earisu would correspond perfectly with the real latin word aeris, but the word Aerith didn't exist until the katakana earisu was incorrectly romanized as Aerith in the original FF7 game (at the same time, Cloud was called Claude, because Kuraudo could be read as cloud or claude, among other nonsensical renderings) So, her name is Aeris... Not Aerith... The strategy guide and the subsequent fan battle (with the aerith supporters) and eventually Kingdom Hearts were all wrong on this matter.<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhateverTS_6f70.html" title="User:WhateverTS">WhateverTS</a> 23:32, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your premise is incorrect. The Final Fantasy VII: Kaitai Shinsho book does not say that "Aerith" is a katakana spelling of earth, it says that "Aerith" is a <b>name</b> <i>based on the English word earth</i>. There's a difference there. While your theory is an interesting one that would be worth researching, it does not in its current state invalidate the claims of the Final Fantasy VII: Kaitai Shinsho book, which is a far more authoritative source than the English version of the game, which was translated by Sony, not Square. -- <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERablari_Dash_6f98.html" title="User:Rablari Dash">Rablari Dash</a> 07:33, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry, but katakana renderings never use ri as a devoiced consonant. Therefore, Earisu would make no sense. At the very least, if that was earth, it would have to be Earusu. All consonants taken from standalone consonants in foreign words end in u, except for the t like and the d line, which end in o, and the standalone nasal n. No, the book that everyone keeps quoting simply made a guess, and a bad one at that. It was, essentially, incorrectly reverse engineered... As for the Aerith that shows up in the debug menu, you'd have to use Claude too if that were the case. 65.115.123.226 14:34, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm sort of new to having discussions on Wikipedia, but I just wanted to ask: Who is the person who wants the listing to use "Gainsbourg" at her last name? Personally, I think it would be better to use "Gainsborough". Her last name is listed as "Gainsborough" on all of the official guidebooks, documents, manuals, websites, and merchandise, which I think is compelling enough to have the article title changed to "Gainsborough". ... Also, I noticed in the editing form of the article, somebody included a small note in the header asking that the name "Gainsbourg" remain unchanged. May I ask who included this note? It's such a small detail, but I'd really like to talk about where this name came from, and why this person insists on keeping it. Surely there must be a good argument for it. I run a website about Final Fantasy VII, so I'm very interested in knowing more. ~ Sara</p>

This Gainsbourg/Gainsborough issue is causing image issues with the images on the page breaking, as such we need to settle on name to use so that the templates will remain correct. Currently the images are using the name of <i>Aerith Gainsbourg</i> for the references, where as much of the page is <i>Aerith Gainsborough</i>. Which means that for now we have a situation where the FFVII character template says <i>name = Aerith Gainsbourg</i> so that the images will not break, but the <i>aka = Aerith Gainsborough</i> is what the "official" name seems to be. – <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkstar949_7f19.html" title="User:Darkstar949">darkstar949</a> 1511, 18 July 2005 (CST)</p>

The name used on concept art or previews is irrelevant.

<p>Yes but the character's main canon appearance is FF7. Mention of her roles in FF Tactics, KH, etc are included because, as you said, this is about the character and FF7...but for story purposes and main biographical info on the character (which would include name), FF7 and FF7-related material are the main sources. For example, the character of Aeris/Aerith is currently deceased, as is relfected in Advent Children, but not in Kingdom hearts. Her having a cameo in KH does not mean the character is now "alive." That'd be like saying that after FFX Auron went to the Disney Underworld, or that Sora was intrumental in defeating Captain Barbossa. <a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a> 21:00, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>NEW ADDITION March 30, 2006&#160;!Aeris is probably the proper name because Kingdom Hearts is divided between Squaresoft and Square Enix causing a major mistake in name spelling causing people to believe that Aeris's real name is "Aerith" when if you look at the original Final Fantasy VII (U.S.A. Version) her name is Aeris Gainsborough. Remember she was created originally for FFVII not Kingdom Hearts. Other thing how is she in kingdom Hearts if she died by a blow in the back/abdomen by Sephiroth?!

<dd>I was the one who originally renamed the article to Aerith Gainsbourg, as (1) It was the first name I knew her as (exposed to the first Japanese resources), and (2) It was what she was called in Kingdom Hearts. However, this option sounds the most reasonable. We should wait until <i>Advent Children</i> is officially localized, and it should decide whether the older <i>FF7</i> or the newer <i>KH</i> is more authoritative in this matter. And unless the translation is <i>really</i> bad (and <i>Legend of the Crystals</i> had a pretty crappy translation, I remember), I won't dispute the outcome. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 06:45, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to disagree to some extent. Aeris is one of the primary characters in Final Fantasy VII, and apparently did not exist in any kind of Square production before that (not that I am aware of anyway). Aeris Gainsborough is the localized name used in all of the *production* literature I have seen for this character. KH and AC are more like afterthoughts, when one thinks about it, and I am fairly certain that a huge percentage of those seeking information on this character will be searching for such information as it relates to Final Fantasy VII. I propose that the alternative spellings and their explanations be redirected and outlined in a dedicated section of the page, but the article *REALLY* should be named the official english localized name Aeris Gainsborough. If the name is changed in Advent Children, we can make a note of that, but considering Aeris is not even prominent enough in AC for Square Enix to put her on the character list on their Japanese AC page, I don't think it would be appropriate to follow the argument that newer means more correct. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaivox_64e2.html" title="User:Daivox">Daivox</a>

<dd>Negative, the standard name used in Japan is Aerith, which is where in lies the localization issues. One example of this usage is that all official merchandise coming out of Japan is <i>Aerith</i> as opposed to <i>Aeris</i>. Also, the reason that Aerith is not listed on the AC site is partly the same reason that we have yet to have been shown her full face - S-E is trying to build her character up and maintain a sense of mystery around her. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkstar949_7f19.html" title="User:Darkstar949">Darkstar949</a> 16:03, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am reading in various places that Aeris was one of those errors in transliteration when moving from Japanese to English. Aerith apparently is indeed the "correct" way to spell/say the name, but Aeris is the most familiar version for FF7 (eng) players by a large margin, primarily for the familiarity (the books say Aeris, the games say Aeris, it must be Aeris) and the fact that moving from Aeris to Aerith sounds rather lispy. If this is indeed correct, I am comfortable with the first name being Aerith, provided an explanation is given in the text regarding the Aeris name. Gainsbourg's got to go, though. It sounds like a type of cheese.&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaivox_64e2.html" title="User:Daivox">Daivox</a>

<dd>Lispy quality is irrelevant. Cheese-sounding is irrelevant. If you speak with an air of cultural ridicule, you weaken your argument. It is also potentially offensive to those with true laminal or dental lisps to cite lispy quality as a detracting factor. Wikipedia is not a play test center, and it is not market research for what "sounds good." It is a dry academic database. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 12:35, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Dry database or not, this part of it's targeted towards English-speaking audiences, and as such, the intense familiarity amongst a majority of individuals in primarily English-speaking countries with the full name "Aeris Gainsborough" due to its repeated appearance in their localized version of the game in which this character originated, as well as numerous official and un-official strategy guides released both in print and in digital form, dictates that these individuals in search of this specific character will be searching for the familiar name. This is in itself more than adequate reason to use this name as the article title. Even if this is a "dry academic database," pure scientific research will not be able to resolve anything which is a matter of opinion; in this case, the assertion that any given incantation of this character's name is "more correct" than the other, either because "it was on the original concept" or "it was what was chosen for the finished product" or "a later product contained a 'correction' of this." My opinion and my reasoning stands. Also, to address your attack on the use of "lispy" in my opening sentences, I shall quote it in entirety and bold for your narrowly-focused eyes to examine one more time: <b>"I am reading in various places that Aeris was one of those errors in transliteration when moving from Japanese to English. Aerith apparently is indeed the "correct" way to spell/say the name, but Aeris is the most familiar version for FF7 (eng) players by a large margin, primarily for the familiarity (the books say Aeris, the games say Aeris, it must be Aeris) and the fact that moving from Aeris to Aerith sounds rather lispy."</b> Please notice that the beginning is "I am <i>reading in various places</i>" which means that the following sentence comtains information that is derived from what I have "read in various places" and is not necessarily reflecting my reasoning. You, sir, have offered up a red herring by proverbially "shouting racist." Regardless of your personally percieved intelligence level and vocabulary skills, you have not provided any helpful dialog regarding what I have actually said, only attacked me on a personal level for not being "politically correct." Your attack on the cheese remark is clearly missing the point. The textual smiley-face&#160;:) indicates a lack of seriousness and as such the prior remark is to be taken in a less dry academic manner and a more human one. This is not the article. This is the Discussion page, and as such, there will be comments where one must actually interpret what is being said as if a living being is generating it, not a robot. If you wish to bring factual arguments back to the table, do so. If you wish to offer non-logical attacks and red herrings, you have even stated in your own way that this is not the location to take part in these non-contributional ramblings. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaivox_64e2.html" title="User:Daivox">Daivox</a></dd>

<dd>Also consider, it's not really that much different from the nameing of the series itself. FFVI was originally FFIII.

<dd>The big difference there is that an entire series of games was produced in Japan, but only select parts of that series were translated for english distribution. Rather than make English-speaking gamers question "where is FF IV and why can I not get it in the english language," the selections were numbered consecutively and the fact that more games existed was conveniently hidden. The interesting part is that FF7us = FF7j instead of being, say, FF4us. Nevertheless, the renaming of a series of productions is far different from the simple two-letter change in a translated name, and as such, I feel that this point is not quite hitting the mark. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaivox_64e2.html" title="User:Daivox">Daivox</a></dd>

<p>Gilgamesh, it seems like you're the only one campaigning for keeping the current article title and you're doing it just for your own satisfaction. The last name in particular is not something I, myself have heard in any localization but I have never played Kingdom Hearts. Also, this is the ENGLISH wikipedia....the japanese version can have it spelled however they want but since this is the ENGLISH wikipedia the name should be changed to the one English speakers are more apt to recognize.</p>

<dd>Assuming, of course, you ignore the comment immediately above his, and the various other undecided comments scattered throughout this page. While there was (IIRC) an agreement that "Gainsbourough" was probably the more reasonable surname, the "Aeris"/"Aerith" debate is still unresolved.

After that, we can revisit the argument. Until then, there are redirects in place to mitigate confusion. Also, it would help if you could sign your comments.

<dd>All else being equal, I do tend to agree that a name change would appropriate. However, I still maintain that we should wait until the English language release of <i>Advent Children</i> before committing to it.

<p>The thing I don't understand is that if the two sounds are interchangeable, wouldn't it just be a matter of interpretation, rather than which is more correct? I mean, plenty of Record of Lodoss War fans were used to translating it is Rodoss or Rodosu, and neither is inherently "wrong." Yet the articles are named for the official English release, because that's what english-speaking fans are most likely to be searching for (old-school fansubbing community aside). Another example is Fist of the North Star. Hokuto no Ken translates literally as Fist of the Big Dipper, so in a localization effort was changed (otherwise the meaning would have been lost in translation if left at it's most literal state). Nobody argues that the page titles should be Fist of the Big Dipper or Hokuto no Ken, but rather that those names be given mention in the article and that the familiar English name be used for English wiki. And thus far, Aeris has appeared in officially translated English materials in FF7, FFT, KH, and KH2...and the last 3 were guest spots. Of those 3 guest spots, two are from a series that has a lot of people's hands in the cookie jar aside from the original team. Seeing as how nobodies lobbying for a change to of Cid to Shid or Cait Sith to Cait Shi, I'd say that for English info on the character, Aeris is by far more familiar, and a solid case for Aerith can't be made until the US releases of AC and Dirge. <a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a> 15:11, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If it were only a matter of romanizing Japanese syllables, this debate (hopefully) wouldn't have gone on as long as it has. Yes, there's some flexibility in romanization, and when the localization team agrees on a romanization, we typically go along with it. However, there are two issues that make the situation here unusual: first, the romanization "Aeris" was invented by Sony, and not Square, thus rendering it less official. Second, "Aerith" is the original name, not エアリス, as explained in the Final Fantasy VII: Kaitai Shinsho book. Her name was based on the English word "Earth", not the Japanese loanword for Earth, which is "アース" (Both of these points were made earlier, in the <a href="../../../a/e/r/Talk%7EAerith_Gainsborough_8b33.html#Aerith_or_Aeris" title="Talk:Aerith Gainsborough">Aerith or Aeris section</a>.

<dd>Aeris wasn't invented by sony, it's a real Latin word that was in Carmina Burana (as was Materia) and it meant air and Aether, which is the mythical substance that created the universe? Sound a bit like lifestream? yeah... Earth doesn't katakana as earisu, but as Aasu, as was used previously in the series. The strategy guide can't be taken as difinitive on every issue... The guide itself was wrong... Why create a new pronunciation of an english word that's allready been used? Ayarth isn't a more "correct" way of saying earth... No english speaking countries say it like that, wheras aasu would be closer to the way at least some english speakers pronounce the word. Earisu corresponds to the latin word, and in all likelyhood the word was pulled out of carmina burana, just as the One Winged Angel lyrics were, and likely the word Materia was as well... If it was just earth, then Aerith would STILL be wrong... Her name should be earth... Aerith was made up by that strategy guide... That word didn't exist before then... <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhateverTS_6f70.html" title="User:WhateverTS">WhateverTS</a> 23:52, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We never really had a true vote. I think many people have lost interest in this detail at this point. As an individual who has played the English localization of Final Fantasy VII as distributed in the United States by Squaresoft (now Square Enix), I would never have found this article without proper redirection in place. Ever. I am being rather forceful in my demands that the last name be changed to "Gainsborough" because of two things: 1. All official English literature put out by Square appears to use the full name "Aeris Gainsborough" throughout; this includes (but may not be limited to) the character profile in the manual included with the CD, the online version of said profile, the official FF7 strategy guide, <b>the actual game itself in which this character originates</b>, etc. 2. The appearance of any last name other than "Gainsborough" appears to be so scarce that the casual Final Fantasy fan will most likely never know of it. For the sake of completeness, a note of this spelling should be made, but it should not dominate the entire article. For these reasons, as well as to better this corner of Wikipedia in general, I am attempting to force a finalization of this change. Also, the debate has raged on plenty long enough, and decisions cannot be put off forever as we argue over it. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaivox_64e2.html" title="User:Daivox">Daivox</a> 03:55, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Which is all well and good, and I don't think we had any real argument against changing it to "Gainsborough" (and, indeed, it could probably have been done much earlier).

<dd>I was only intending to be "pushy" about the last name, not the first. Honestly, I could care less whether the first name used is "Aeris" or "Aerith" because I've seen both used, apparently based solely on personal exposure and preference. My only argument in favor of "Aeris" is that it is all that Square has "officially" put out for this character in the game of origination. Waiting to see what FF7:AC says the name should be is probably a very good idea. If I continue, I will begin talking in circles, so I shall leave my end of it there. Until specified otherwise, I simply vote for "Aeris" and shall fade back to silence for now. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaivox_64e2.html" title="User:Daivox">Daivox</a> 06:56, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I thought you guys might appreciate this information (I was just dropping it off in the Jenova discussion section of all places, as well as another article on this discussion page):</p>
<p>"Aeris' name is just a Japanese transliteration of the English word 'Earth.' If you'll notice, in katakana (the Japanese alphabet used for words that are not of Japanese origin), the name is written as 'Earisu.' It's the tendency of vowels to follow consonants in Japanese ('n' being the only exception; thus, the 'i' after 'r') and the Japanese language has no 'th' characters, instead using 'su.' It became 'Aeris' as a result of writing it in romaji (the alphabet in which English characters represent Japanese sounds) to represent how it sounds when spoken in Japanese ('Air-reese').</p>
<p>'Aerith,' by the way, the other popular -- and actually official -- romanization of the name, should technically never occur. As it's written, it's essentially a combination of the romaji form of the Japanese transliteration and the original English word that was transliterated. It's technically impossible because there is no 'th' sound in Japanese to be represented by romaji characters. Nonetheless, it's the official romanization chosen by the creators of Final Fantasy VII."</p>
<p>The matter of "Earth" being the word of origin is stated in the Final Fantasy VII: Kaitai Shinsho book on Aerith's profile page. Here's a scan for proof:</p>

<dd>Ok, sorry to repeat myself, but I'm answering this wherever it shows up on the discussion... Aeris is not a Japanese transliteration of Earth. That book, though it may have been "official" was wrong. Aeris is an actual word, a latin word. Aerith is not. Earth doesn't become earisu, it becomes Aasu. If it were an alternate katakana rendering of the word as someone said, it would not be eaRIsu at all, but earusu. Ri always indicates the sounds "Ree" or "Lee" never just "r." And if her name were a result of a transliteration of Earth, then Earth would be her proper name, not Aerith. <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhateverTS_6f70.html" title="User:WhateverTS">WhateverTS</a> 16:09, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>and the naming by the official guide wasn't about the spelling of the word, but just an assumption as to the origin which would be believeable if it weren't for the fact Aeris (much like cloud or strife or sephiroth) is a real word that existed before Final Fantasy 7... <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhateverTS_6f70.html" title="User:WhateverTS">WhateverTS</a> 16:21, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In reference to the mention that the name Aerith "could also be based off of the Hebrew name Erith, which means "flower"": I would like to point out that there is no 'th' sound in Hebrew.

<dd>I don't know much about Hebrew vocabulary, so I had to go look it up. According to Wiktionary and a couple of other online dictionaries, the Hebrew word for 'flower' is <i>perakh</i>. So, whatever word Erith is supposed to refer to, my guess is that it's either <i>Eris</i> or <i>Erit</i>, depending on what letter it ends with. (I've asked some friends, waiting to hear an answer. I'll post here when I learn more.) <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordAmeth_30dd.html" title="User:LordAmeth">LordAmeth</a> 11:00, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>For all those interested, I have heard back from my friends in Judaic Studies. There is a flower called <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphodel.html" title="Asphodel">asphodel</a> which, in modern Hebrew transliteration would be spelled "irit". In older forms of pronunciation, it is quite conceivable that this word would be pronounced "erith," much as many synagogues use "Beth" for "Bet" or "Beit". Erith/irit is spelled ayin-yod-resh-yod-tav. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordAmeth_30dd.html" title="User:LordAmeth">LordAmeth</a> 15:34, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't pretend to know any Hebrew, however from what I've researched, "tav" has both a "T" or "S" sound, interchangeably. So, as it seems to me, both "Aeris" and "Aerith" are still correct. I would then think it's a completely individual preference. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EEreinion_4e78.html" title="User:Ereinion"><font color="#6B6E85">Ereinion</font></a> <a href="../../../h/i/v/Image%7EHiveneo.gif_05d0.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/a/a3/Hiveneo.gif/14px-Hiveneo.gif" alt="" width="14" height="16" longdesc="../../../h/i/v/Image%7EHiveneo.gif_05d0.html" /></a> 22:51, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're absolutely right; the letter <a href="../../../t/a/w/Taw_%28letter%29.html" title="Taw (letter)">tav</a> can have a 't' sound, or an 's' sound.

<dd>If this is the case, however, 1. Her name should be Erith, not Aerith. 2.

<p>In the original American PSX release of FF7, her name was Aeris Gainsborough. Whomever has a scan of the original American instruction manual can upload that as a source if need be. (I, unfortunately, have lost mine.) While the article may have originally been called "Aerith Gainsbourg", at NO POINT IN HISTORY was the character in question ever called that. (Except for possibly in fan translations, but those have little, if any, authority.) Unless someone has a good reason otherwise, I'm removing the phrase "originally Aerith Gainsbourg."

<dd>I have no problem with it being removed from the page -- and in all honesty, its presence never sat well with me to begin with due to there not being a source for it -- but I must protest having the article read as "formerly 'Aeris Gainsborough.'" It was <i>not originaly</i> "<i>Aeris Gainsborough</i>." This game is from Japan, not the United States. The "original" American manual does not have the original spelling. Japan -- and Aerith's creators -- have always used "Aerith" as the official romanization of her name, and that's also the romanization now used in official materials in the United States. Thus, it should read as "also known as 'Aeris Gainsborough'" instead.

It is in the game, it is in the instruction manual, it is on www.ffonline.com/ff7/, it is almost everywhere CORRECT.

<dd>Okay well I get your point but I do not have a clue why they would actually think it was "Aerith". Do you really think I play Kingdom Hearts, and do you really think I would look at the fake facts? I dont think anyone has noticed but the only reason people think it is "Aerith" is because they heard it from some doped up guy that has been sucking on the wrong of his joint.

<dd>(Please sign your posts with "~~~~", not nicknames) Yeah, and how weird do you think it looks to someone who only played Japanese version and every game subsequent bit in English? =) And if we really want to go with your logic, we might as well delete most of the games in the database, I mean <i>I</i> didn't play them, how they can be verifiable at all? Look, sometimes you just have to make a judgement based on available data (ie, we see how the character name was translated in all of the products), rather than to make an educated guess with a limited data. (ie, just one translation of a game). =) And Aerith isn't even alone in this group (think of Marth, who was first translated as Mars in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_Emblem_%28anime%29_298c.html" title="Fire Emblem (anime)">English anime translation</a>, then when SSBM was released to the world, the character was forevermore Marth...) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 19:07, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If there is to be any implication of Square-Enix officially changing her name to Aerith, I believe it should have a citation for proof, otherwise not mentioned at all.</p>

<p>Well, judging from IMDB info, that's how the name appears in Advent Children, I think it's <i>so far</i> safe to say it's true.

Actually the IMDB now says that for the english version of AC it's "Aeris." Just thought I'd point that out.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Something strange about the name</span></h2>
<p>Isn't it odd that the opening of this page states "it is Wikipolicy to use the official name" when, actually, it isn't? Wikipolicy is to use the most common name. Thus, this article should actually have been called 'Aeris Gainsborough' all along, simply because this is the most commonly known name. The truth can, of course, be explained in the article. (Note: I'm not arguing which form is right, simply which Wikipolicy states should be used). --86.144.234.245 21:52, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>(Apologies in advance - this analogy regrettably invokes Politics. I don't care about Politics and thus this isn't intended as a political statement. This is just a rhetorical example.) You notice we have an article titled "George W. Bush" which is the <i>official</i> name; if we'd go by "use the really common name" logic, we'd have to move the article to "Dubya" or maybe even "Bush (43rd President of the United States)", both of which are probably <i>way</i> more common names in the everyday discourse. Or perhaps we'd have to listen to what the trolls and vandals have been saying and rename the article to "The Chimpanzee," since that's the "common" name. Also, just last night I looked at the article <a href="../../../c/s/s/CSS_Virginia_d06d.html" title="CSS Virginia">CSS Virginia</a>; I'm in a distant country where the school history textbook, when discussing the famous sea battle, called the ship "Merrimac". As the article states, that was a wrong name despite that being rather common. Believe me, using <i>correct</i> names for things is a solidly employed policy here. Why it isn't listed in the policies? Well, it is - in form of "<a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUse_common_sense_cd4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Use common sense">use common sense</a>". It isn't listed under "things that <i>should</i> be obvious", AFAIK there's no such list. =)</p>
<p>I do admit as much that the policy documents (<a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>) doesn't really have any real guideline that applies to this specific situation. It has "use what names people really use", but this policy concerns <i>format</i>, not spellings; ie, use the name <i>format</i> the person/fictional author uses, don't go for really nitpickingly technically correct name. "Aerith Gainsborough" satisfies this requirement and "Cetra Aerith Gainsborough, daughter of Ifalna and Gast" would be an example of what we shouldn't use; no gamer would use that form, nor would the characters themselves, nor is such form used anywhere else, and hey, it's a quasi-spoiler too...</p>
<p>So in closing, the name does satisfy whatever policies we have about the title <i>format</i>. Alternate spellings of the name are also handled the way the policies ask (in form of redirects). If Square has stuck with this name forevermore, that's what we're using - it's common sense. After all, they have full reason and right to decide the spelling; it's gotten so fudged lately that it's not entirely unreasonable for them to settle on a spelling and we should thus follow them. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:19, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding "th" statement</span></h2>
<p><i>"Aerith," the actual official romanization of the name, would rarely occur in the romaji system due to the lack of a "th" sound in Japanese, though "th" is a valid, if not somewhant antiquated rendering of "su" (ス).</i></p>
<p>I've never heard of this, and quite frankly, I doubt that it's true. The <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hepburn_romanization.html" title="Hepburn romanization">Hepbrun</a> system, which is the first "modern" one, has always had it as "su", and the Japanese developed (<a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihon-shiki.html" title="Nihon-shiki">Nihon-shiki</a>, <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kunrei-shiki.html" title="Kunrei-shiki">Kunrei-shiki</a>) systemss certainly wouldn't have it. Was the polite copula was romanised as "deth" in the past? Hou about "suteki", was it "thteki"? I doubt it. The only way I can think of it being true is from very early romanisation based on Portugese (first to come to Japan and so on), what with "s" being pronounced as "th" in some words, and these wouldn't have been "standard" by any means. Any explanation? --88.105.241.73 01:21, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm... I guess the statement is a little confusing, if you don't already know what it's talking about. "ス" is never romanized as "th", but the "th" in loanwords (and names) is generally written using "サ","シ","ス","セ", or "ソ" in katakana. For example, "Thank you" is written "サンキュー" in katakana. Also, the Japanese pronounce the word like they write it, because it's as close as they can typically get to the original pronunciation of the loanword. So, to keep going with my example, they would pronounce "Thank you" as "Sankyuu". They don't have a "th" sound, so it's hard for them to pronounce. Therefore, they replace it with the closest sound that they can pronounce, which, in this case, is "ス". I guess the biggest confusing factor here is calling "Aerith" a romanization, which it isn't. It's her original name, and "エアリス" is the Japanese transcription of "Aerith". Hmm... Now that I've thought this out, that weird-sounding sentence seems more than out of place -- It's misleading and confusing, if not flat-out wrong. -- <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERablari_Dash_6f98.html" title="User:Rablari Dash">Rablari Dash</a> 02:30, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know that the "s" line is how "th" is approximated in Katakana English, it's just that the sentence claimed that it was an "antiquated romanisation", when it is neither antiquated or a romanisation. Heh.--88.105.243.4 15:21, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
