	    <p><b>Aeroponics</b> is the process of growing <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plants.html" title="Plants">plants</a> in an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air.html" title="Air">air</a>/<a href="../../../m/i/s/Mist.html" title="Mist">mist</a> environment without the use of <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soil.html" title="Soil">soil</a> or an <a href="../../../c/o/n/Construction_aggregate.html" title="Construction aggregate">aggregate</a> media.</p>
<p>The word <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeroponic.html" title="Aeroponic">aeroponic</a> is derived from the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> meanings of 'aero' (air) and 'ponic' (culture). Aeroponic growth refers to growth achieved in an air culture. Such conditions occur in nature. For example, in tropical climates orchids develop and grow freely in trees (Rains, 1941). <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Laboratory research on air culture growing utilizing vapors began in the mid-1940's. Today aeroponics is used in agriculture around the globe. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Aeroponic culture differs from both <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydroponics.html" title="Hydroponics">hydroponics</a> and in-vitro (<a href="../../../p/l/a/Plant_tissue_culture.html" title="Plant tissue culture">Plant tissue culture</a>) growing.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydroponics.html" title="Hydroponics">Hydroponics</a> (water culture) uses lots of water and essential minerals to sustain plant growth. Hydroponic growing requires the roots to be submerged in water or water soaked aggregate, with air bubbled into the mix. In-vitro (meaning "under glass") tissue culture utilizes an agar media to supply the necessary essentials to sustain plant cell growth.</p>
<p>Aeroponics offers something to plants that hydroponics, to a degree, can't supply enough of – and that is air (<a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen.html" title="Oxygen">Oxygen</a>). <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Oxygen in the air is what makes all plants live. Plants must have it and have lots of it, or they become silted and die. For example, a waterlogged plant dies because it suffocates; although its leaves may be blowing in a gentle breeze, its roots are starving for oxygen.</p>
<p>Aeroponics is all about air --and lots of it-- especially when air is combined with micro-droplets of water. Add a few trace minerals and macro-nutrients to the water, and almost any plant can grow to maturity in air.</p>
<p>Aeroponic systems are favored over other methods of hydroponics because the increased aeration of nutrient solution delivers more oxygen to plant roots, stimulating growth and preventing <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathogen.html" title="Pathogen">pathogen</a> formation. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The basic principle of aeroponic growing is to allow plants to grow under pesticide-free and disease-free conditions, growing in a natural healthy manner where the aeroponic environment mimics environmental conditions in nature. These conditions advance plant development, health, growth, flowering and fruiting for any given plant species and cultivars.</p>
<p><a name="Methods" id="Methods"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeroponics.html" title="Edit section: Methods">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Methods</span></h3>
<p>Aeroponics refers to the methods and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine.html" title="Machine">apparatus</a> used to cultivate, grow, and sustain plant and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crop.html" title="Crop">crop</a> growth in an air culture.</p>

<p>To grow aeroponically refers to the necessary processes needed to achieve a sustainable aeroponic growth.</p>
<p>Aeroponics is not to be confused with either the <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydroponic.html" title="Hydroponic">hydroponic</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoponic.html" title="Geoponic">geoponic</a> technique. Aeroponic plant growth is sustained by the intermittent spray of a hydro-atomized nutrient solution as it remains suspended in air. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a true hydroponic apparatus, the plant's <a href="../../../r/o/o/Root.html" title="Root">root</a> system is totally submerged in <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a> ('hydro'); while growing geoponically requires the plant to naturally root itself in <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soil.html" title="Soil">soil</a>/<a href="../../../g/r/o/Ground.html" title="Ground">ground</a> ('geo').</p>
<p>In an aeroponic system, however, the plant is suspended into an enclosed air environment where the lower portion <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stem.html" title="Stem">stem</a> and roots protrude into a hydro-atomized nutrient solution and environment. The leaves and crown of the plant extend into the air above. The root and crown of the plant are separated by the plant support structure. The lowest stem portion and root system are sprayed/misted for short durations with a hydro-atomized pure water/nutrient solution. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeroponics.html" title="Edit section: Ecological Advantages">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ecological Advantages</span></h3>
<p>Aeroponic growing is considered to be safe and ecologically friendly for producing natural, healthy plants and crops. The main ecological advantages of aeroponics are the conservation of water and energy. When compared to hydroponics, aeroponics offers lower water and energy inputs per sq meter of growing area.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeroponics.html" title="Edit section: Apparatus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Apparatus</span></h3>
<p>The first commercially available aeroponic apparatus was manufactured and marketed by GTi in 1983. It was known then as the <i>Genesis Machine</i> - taken from the second <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star-Trek_ea6c.html" title="Star-Trek">Star-Trek</a> movie. The <i>Genesis Machine</i> was marketed as the 'Genesis Rooting System'.</p>
<p>GTi's device incorporated an open-loop water driven apparatus, controlled by a microchip, and delivered a hi-psi, hydro-atomized nutrient spray inside an aeroponic chamber.</p>
<p>At the time, the achievement was revolutionary in terms of a developing (artificial air culture) technology. The <i>Genesis Machine</i> simply connected to a water faucet and an electrical outlet, and actually grew plants in air - and fast too! <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeroponics.html" title="Edit section: Aeroponic Propagation (Cloning)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aeroponic Propagation (Cloning)</span></h3>
<p>For the first time in agricultural history, greenhouse growers could propagate and grow inside a self-contained aeroponic system.</p>
<div class="thumb tright">

<p>Numerous plant species could now be started by vegetative cuttings. It gave growers an opportunity to clone all types of plants, trees, shrubs, cacti, and ground covers from a simple stem cutting.</p>
<p>Suddenly aeroponics surpassed hydroponics and tissue culture as means for sterile propagation of plant species. With the <i>Genesis Machine</i> any grower could clone plants, plants that were traditionally considered hard to root. Plants could be cloned and grown using aeroponics by the hundreds or even thousands. Cloning became easy because the aeroponic apparatus initiated faster and cleaner root development. And it cloned them fast, according to Colorado State University (Hughes, 1983). <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Aeroponics time-warped tissue culture technology. It cloned plants in less time and reduced numerous labor steps associated with tissue culture techniques. Aeroponics could eliminate stage I and stage II plantings into soil (the bane of all tissue culture growers).</p>
<div class="thumb tright">

<div class="thumbcaption">Cloned aeroponics transplanted directly into soil – its air roots made it all possible (1983)</div>

</div>
<p>Tissue culture plants must be planted in a sterile media (stage-I) and expanded out for eventual transfer into sterile soil (stage-II). After they're strong enough they are transplanted directly to field soil. Besides being labor intensive, the entire process of tissue culture is prone to disease, infection, and failure.</p>
<p>With the <i>Genesis Machine</i> growers cloned and transplanted air-rooted plants directly into field soil. Aeroponic roots were not susceptible to wilting and leaf loss, or loss due to transplant shock (something hydroponics can never overcome). Because of their healthiness, air-rooted plants were less likely to be infected with pathogens. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The efforts by GTi ushered in a new era of artificial life support for plants capable of growing naturally without the use of soil or hydroponics. GTi received a patent for an all-plastic aeroponic method and apparatus, controlled by a microprocessor in 1985.</p>
<p>Aeroponics became known as a time and cost saver. The economic factors of aeroponic’s contributions to agriculture were taking shape.</p>

<p>This second generation aeroponic apparatus was a closed-loop system. It utilized recycled effluent precisely controlled by a microprocessor. Aeroponics graduated to the capability of supporting seed germination, thus making GTi's the world's first plant and harvest aeroponic system.</p>
<p>Many of these open-loop unit and closed-loop aeroponic systems are still in operation today.</p>
<p>In a true aeroponic apparatus the plant is totally suspended in air, giving the plant access to 100% of the available <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen.html" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> in the air. This maximizes the level of oxygen surrounding the stem and root system, accelerating and promoting root growth within the plant. While there is a constant available source of oxygen, the intermittent hydro-atomizing of a spray/mist of the water-nutrient solution provides the necessary moisture and essential minerals to keep plants turgid and alive. <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>Air cultures optimize access to air for successful plant growth. Materials and devices which hold and support the aeroponic grown plants must be devoid of disease and pathogens as well. A distinction of a true aeroponic culture and apparatus is that it provides plant support features that are monomial. Monomial contact between a plant and support structure allows for 100% of the plant to be entirely in air. Long-term aeroponic cultivation requires the root systems to be free of constraints surrounding the stem and root systems. Physical contact is minimized so that it does not hinder natural growth and root expansion or access to pure water, air exchange and disease-free conditions.</p>

<p>Clean air supplies oxygen which is an excellent purifier for plants and the aeroponic environment. It is required for all life, including plants. For natural growth to occur the plant must have unrestricted access to air. Plants must be allowed to grow in a natural manner for successful physiological development. The more confining the plant support becomes, the greater incidence of increasing disease pressure of the plant and the aeroponic system. <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some researchers have used aeroponics to study the effects of root zone gas composition on plant performance. Soffer and Burger [Soffer et al., 1988] studied the effects of dissolved oxygen concentrations on the formation of adventitious roots in what they termed “aero-hydroponics.” They utilized a 3-tier hydro and aero system, in which three separate zones were formed within the root area. The ends of the roots were submerged in the nutrient reservoir, while the middle of the root section received nutrient mist and the upper portion was above the mist. Their results showed that dissolved O2 is essential to root formation, but went on to show that for the three O2 concentrations tested, the number of roots and root length were always greater in the central misted section than either the submersed section or the un-misted section. Even at the lowest concentration, the misted section rooted successfully. <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>Plants in a true aeroponic apparatus have 100% access to the CO2 concentrations ranging from 450 ppm to 780 ppm for photosynthesis. (At one mile above sea level the CO2 concentration in the air is 450 ppm during daylight. At night the C02 level will rise to 780 ppm.) Lower elevations will have higher levels. In any case, the air culture apparatus offers ability for plants to have full access to all the available C02 in the air for photosynthesis.</p>

<p>Aeroponics can limit disease transmission since plant-to-plant contact is reduced and each spray pulse can be sterile. In the case of soil, aggregate, or other media, disease can spread throughout the growth media, infecting many plants. In most greenhouses these solid media require sterilization after each crop and, in many cases, they are simply discarded and replaced with fresh, certified sterile media. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>A distinct advantage of aeroponic technology is that if a particular plant does become diseased, it can be quickly removed from the plant support structure without disrupting or infecting the other plants.</p>

<p>Aeroponic equipment involves the use of sprayers, misters, foggers, or other devices to create a fine mist of solution to deliver nutrients to plant roots. Aeroponic systems are normally closed-looped systems providing macro and micro-environments suitable to sustain a reliable, constant air culture.

<p>The key to root development in an aeroponic environment is the size of the water droplet. In commercial applications, a hydro-atomizing spray is employed to cover large areas of roots utilizing air pressure misting.</p>

<p>Water droplet size is crucial for sustaining aeroponic growth. Too large of a water droplet means less oxygen is available to the root system. Too fine of a water droplet, such as those generated by the ultra-sonic mister, produce excessive root hair without developing a lateral root system for sustained growth in an aeroponic system. <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>In their study, these researchers found that by measuring the concentrations and volumes of input and efflux solutions, they could accurately calculate the nutrient uptake rate (which was verified by comparing the results with N-isotope measurements).

ODC is derived from natural aquatic materials.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>By 1997, Stoner’s biocontrol experiments were conducted by NASA. BioServe Space Technologies’s GAP technology (miniature growth chambers) delivered the ODC solution unto bean seeds. Triplicate ODC experiments were conducted in GAP’s flown to the MIR by the shuttle space&#160;; at the Kennedy Space Center; and at Colorado State University (J. Linden). All GAPS were housed in total darkness to eliminate light as an experiment variable. The NASA experiment was to study only the benefits of the biocontrol. <sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>NASA's experiments aboard the MIR space station and shuttle confirmed that ODC elicited increased germination rate, better sprouting, increased growth and natural plant disease mechanisms when applied to beans in an enclosed environment. ODC is now a standard for pesticide-free aeroponic growing and organic farming. Soil and hydroponics growers can benefit by incorporating ODC into their planting techniques. ODC meets USDA NOP standards for organic farms. <sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1998, Stoner received NASA funding to develop a high performance aeroponic system for earth and space. Stoner demonstrated that a dry bio-mass of lettuce can be significantly increased with aeroponics. NASA made history by utilizing numerous aeroponic advancements developed by Stoner.</p>
<p>Abstract: The purpose of the research conducted was to identify and demonstrate technologies for high-performance plant growth in a variety of gravitational environments. A low-gravity environment, for example, poses the problems of effectively bringing water and other nutrients to the plants and effecting recovery of effluents. Food production in the low-gravity environment of space provides further challenges, such as minimization of water use, water handling, and system weight. Food production on planetary bodies such as the Moon or Mars also requires dealing with a hypogravity environment. Because of the impacts to fluid dynamics in these various gravity environments, the nutrient delivery system has been a major focus in plant growth system optimization.</p>

<p>There are a number of methods currently utilized (both in low gravity and on Earth) to deliver nutrients to plants. Substrate dependent methods include traditional soil cultivation, zeoponics, agar, and nutrient-loaded ion exchange resins. In addition to substrate dependent cultivation, many soilless methods have been developed such as nutrient film technique, ebb and flow, aeroponics, and many other variants. Many hydroponic systems can provide high plant performance but nutrient solution throughput is high, necessitating large water volumes and substantial recycling of solutions, and the control of the solution in hypogravity conditions is difficult at best.</p>
<p>Aeroponics, with its use of a hydro-atomized spray to deliver nutrients, minimizes water use, increases oxygenation of roots, and offers excellent plant growth, while at the same time approaching or bettering the low nutrient solution throughput of other systems developed to operate in low gravity. Aeroponics’ elimination of substrates and the need for large nutrient stockpiles reduces the amount of waste materials to be processed by other life support systems. Furthermore, the absence of substrates simplifies planting and harvesting (providing opportunities for automation), decreases the volume and weight of expendable materials, and eliminates a pathway for pathogen transmission. These many advantages combined with the results of this research that prove the viability of aeroponics in microgravity makes aeroponics a logical choice for efficient food production in space. <sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>

<p>Abstract: Aeroponics International’s (AI’s) innovation is a self-contained, self-supporting, inflatable aeroponic crop production unit with integral environmental systems for the control and delivery of a nutrient/mist to the roots. This inflatable aeroponic system addresses the needs of subtopic 08.03 Spacecraft Life Support Infrastructure and, in particular, water and nutrient delivery systems technologies for food production. The inflatable nature of our innovation makes it lightweight, allowing it to be deflated so it takes up less volume during transportation and storage. It improves on AI’s current aeroponic system design that uses rigid structures, which use more expensive materials, manufacture processes, and transportation. As a stationary aeroponic system, these existing high-mass units perform very well, but transporting and storing them can be problematic.</p>
<p>On Earth, these problems may hinder the economic feasibility of aeroponics for commercial growers. However, such problems become insurmountable obstacles for using these systems on long-duration space missions because of the high cost of payload volume and mass during launch and transit.</p>
<p>The NASA efforts lead to developments of numerous advanced materials for aeroponics for earth and space. <sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

<p>Plants grown using aeroponics spend 99.98% of their time in air and 0.02% in direct contact with hydro-atomized nutrient solution. The time spent without water allows the roots to capture oxygen more efficiently. Furthermore, the hydro-atomized mist also significantly contributes to the effective oxygenation of the roots. For example, NFT has a nutrient throughput of 1 L/minute compared to aeroponics’ throughput of 1.5 ml/minute.</p>
<p>The reduced volume of nutrient throughput results in reduced amounts of nutrients required for plant development.</p>
<p>Another benefit of the reduced throughput, of major significance for space-based use, is the reduction in water volume used. This reduction in water volume throughput corresponds with a reduced buffer volume, both of which significantly lighten the weight needed to maintain plant growth. In addition, the volume of effluent from the plants is also reduced with aeroponics, reducing the amount of water that needs to be treated before reuse.</p>

<p>A variety of different nutrient solutions, for example, can be administered to the root zone using aeroponics without needing to flush out any solution or matrix in which the roots had previously been immersed. This elevated level of control would be useful when researching the effect of a varied regimen of nutrient application to the roots of a plant species of interest. In a similar manner, aeroponics allows a greater range of growth conditions than other nutrient delivery systems. The interval and duration of the nutrient spray, for example, can be very finely attuned to the needs of a specific plant species. The aerial tissue can be subjected to a completely different environment from that of the roots.</p>

<p>The design of an aeroponic system allows ease of working with the plants. This results from the separation of the plants from each other, and the fact that the plants are suspended in air and the roots are not entrapped in any kind of matrix. Consequently, the harvesting of individual plants is quite simple and straightforward. Likewise, removal of any plant that may be infected with some type of pathogen is easily accomplished without risk of uprooting or contaminating nearby plants.</p>

<p>Aeroponic systems are more cost effective than other systems. Because of the reduced volume of solution throughput (discussed above), less water and less nutrients are needed in the system at any given time compared to other nutrient delivery systems. The need for substrates is also eliminated, as is the need for many moving parts, resulting in lowered manufacturing cost and reduced maintenance costs.</p>

<p>Plant are most susceptible to loss from pathogens during the first 21 days of their life cycle. The aeroponic technology developed by the PI utilizes a patented plant support structure that separates the plants from one another. In a hydroponic or aggregate-based system, pathogen infections can easily spread throughout the entire system due to the plants’ common source of water or medium. In the ideal aeroponic system pathogens can be reduced and controlled by:</p>
<ul>
<li>separating the plants - thus preventing the pathogen from spreading infection from one plant to another.</li>
<li>applying disinfectants and fungicides to the aerial and root zones individually,</li>
<li>applying the water/nutrient at intervals that are best suited for plant development and growth,</li>
<li>allowing the plant to expand without interference of restricting physical barriers,</li>
<li>reducing the per plant exposure to surfaces where pathogens can linger or proliferate.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeroponics.html" title="Edit section: Use of Seed Stocks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Use of Seed Stocks</span></h3>
<p>With aeroponics, the deleterious effects of seed stocks that are infected with pathogens can be minimized. As discussed above, this is due to the separation of the plants and the lack of shared growth matrix. In addition, due to the enclosed, controlled environment, aeroponics can be an ideal growth system in which to grow seed stocks that are pathogen-free. The enclosing of the growth chamber, in addition to the isolation of the plants from each other discussed above, helps to both prevent initial contamination from pathogens introduced from the external environment and minimize the spread from one plant to others of any pathogens that may exist.</p>
