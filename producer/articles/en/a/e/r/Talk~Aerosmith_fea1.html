<p>While it is nice to have this, I think this section is much to large and may confuse ordinary people who visit the page. Additionally, there are no sources/citation present for this information. Any thoughts on condensing it, citing it, and making it an embellishment of the page rather than the entire meat of the page?</p>
<ul>
<li>It needs to be re-formatted so that it doesn't take up so much of the Table of Contents, needs to be verified, and should be written in an encyclopedic tone (particularly the sectin's lead paragraphs). I'll put a {{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_1f97.html" title="Template:Verify">verify</a>}} tag on to hopefully speed up the process. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harr</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">o</font></a><b><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarro5_1808.html" title="User talk:Harro5">5</a></b> 05:01, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Several of the largest musical artists have separate sub-pages for things like Discography, Trivia, and other sections, featuring only a limited version of that information on the main page, and the full detailed versions on the sub-pages. I was wondering if we should do the same thing for Aerosmith, as the article is becoming larger than the alloted limits. This also assures that things like the details of the band's history will not need to be compromised.</p>

<p>The opening of this page is fancruft, and the information could easily be contained in a section of the main page entitled, 'Other Media' or something like that. Preferably, the information could be incorporated into the history section.

<li><b>Oppose</b> - The page was created because the trivia list was becoming too long. In addition, one of the major reasons behind Aerosmith's longevity and widespread knowledge among people is due to their appearance in movies, on TV, and in video games, and it is important to have a section chronicling that. If you look at other major artists like Michael Jackson, the Beatles, and Madonna and how in depth some of the sections are, it should not be a problem having a small article about Aerosmith's presence in popular culture. The major reason I created the articles relating to Aerosmith awards, discography, and contribs to pop culture is to help the main page maintain the standards for article size, and to expand the knowledge of Aerosmith. I agree with the above poster, and Wikipedia is an un-limited resource of knowledge and experts in their relative areas should be expanding (not limiting) articles and knowledge as much as possible. If you want to change some of the wording around in the intro of Aerosmith's contribs to pop culture, fine. But the rest is all fact and should not be tampered with. <a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 02:18, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I removed the "america's greatest rock ban" thing. It isn't very encyclopedia like to call anything the greatest, since it's a matter of opinion. If you really feel they are the greatest band, lines in the article like "The band have scored twenty-one Top 40 hits, have won four Grammy awards, and continue to tour relentlessly" are a much more professional way to indicate that they are the greatest. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 138.89.191.46 (<a href="../../../1/3/8/User_talk%7E138.89.191.46.html" title="User talk:138.89.191.46">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_138.89.191.46_c320.html" title="Special:Contributions/138.89.191.46">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>PRWire and Aerosmith themselves are not considered reliable sources. The third source is also a PR type item. Until this comes from a reputable source, it has to be removed.

<p>Anon user, the source on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame page is Steven Tyler himself. Please read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, as I've suggested, to get an idea of what a reliable source is.

<p>Just cause it's not CNN/AP/AOL Time Warner, does not mean it's not reputable. A press release is just as good. Remember, I said they are "regarded as America's greatest rock and roll band". I never said that they are in fact America's greatest rock and roll band. Just, that they are often referenced and nicknamed as such to the general public. You yourself are also violating the 3-revert rule. 131.156.238.75 21:31, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, actually it does matter, per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, the document I have asked you to read.

<p>Additionally, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame article indirectly claims Aerosmith to be America's greatest rock band, or one of the greatest by saying how almost alone they were able to send a fesity retort to the British Invasion bands, and went on to achieve greater success and longevity than all of them. 131.156.238.75 21:40, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the "America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band" came about as an ironic extension of the analogy describing Aerosmith (mainly in the '70s) as the '<b>Rolling Clones'</b> implying a certain similarity in style to the Stones and thus making Aerosmith "America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band" while the Stones remained "The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band" - a title they gave themselves in 1968 to sell tickets on their first post Brian Jones US tour. I've changed the phrase to "often described as..." which I think is indisputable even if you argue that the contention is false <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanic_15ef.html" title="User:Megamanic">Megamanic</a> 08:59, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Often described by who? Rolling Stone magazine? My point is that it doesn't matter what the wording is, the statement still needs to be sourced. I'm not disputing Aerosmith's status as a great American band, I'm disputing the lack of sources. Maybe I'm just being picky, but I'm trying to be consistent, and follow the same guidelines that I have been urged to follow on other articles in the past. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 08:20, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is the current state of play:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joe Perry and Tom Hamilton moved to Boston in September of 1970. There they met Joey Kramer, who was, coincidentally, from Yonkers, New York, and also knew Steven Tallarico (soon to be Tyler). Shortly after meeting and after hearing Perry and Hamilton play, Kramer agreed to join the band they were forming, with the understanding that Tyler, whom he'd always hoped one day to play with, would be the Lead Vocalist. Steven Tyler then joined them in Boston in October of 1970 and Aerosmith was born. The five original members were: Steven Tyler (Vocals), Joe Perry (Lead Guitar), Tom Hamilton (Bass), Joey Kramer (Drums), and Ray Tabano (Rhythm Guitar). It wouldn't be until the summer of 1971 that Ray Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford of <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading%2C_Massachusetts_e1a0.html" title="Reading, Massachusetts">Reading</a>, Massachusetts on guitar, and that Aerosmith would be complete. Other than a period from July 1979 to April 1984, this is the line-up that is still Aerosmith today. <a name="1960s"></a></p>

<p><a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Tyler_6293.html" title="Steven Tyler">Steven Tyler</a>, who was to become Aerosmith's lead singer, was in the following list of bands: the Vic Tallarico Orchestra (as a drummer during the summers of 1964-66 in Sunapee, NH); <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Strangeurs_Chain_Reaction_a8f4.html" title="The Strangeurs/Chain Reaction">The Strangers</a> (drummer/vocalist 1964-65); The Strangeurs (vocals 1966); a band called <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Strangeurs_Chain_Reaction_a8f4.html" title="The Strangeurs/Chain Reaction">Chain Reaction</a> (vocals 1966-68) (not to be confused with Chain Reaction that formed in 1976 with future members of the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_e31d.html" title="Red Hot Chili Peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>), who recorded a single in 1966 (partly available on Aerosmith's 1991 box release <i><a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandora%27s_Box_%28album%29_5e15.html" title="Pandora's Box (album)">Pandora's Box</a></i>); The Chain (drummer/vocals 1968-69); Fox Chase (drummer/vocals 1969-70); William Proud (drummer/vocals summer 1970). In 1969, Tyler met Joe Perry, who was at the time playing in a band called the Jam Band with bassist Tom Hamilton and drummer David "Pudge" Scott, while Perry was washing dishes at the Anchorage in Sunapee Harbor, NH. This meeting eventually led to the formation of Aerosmith.</p>

Tyler, who was originally a drummer and singer, adamantly refused to play drums, insisting he would only be in the band if he could be the frontman and lead vocalist.

<p>Look at the first bit &amp; the start of the "1970's" bit. This is self contradictory - did Kramer get Tyler to join or did Tyler insist Kramer joined? Also do we need a list of all of the bands Steven Tyler was in in the 1960s in Aerosmith's history? I personally say no - move it to Tyler's biography if it's not already there and refer to Tyler being a "veteran of several bands in the 1960's" or something in the Aerosmith article. If we are going to add earlier bands into this article (which I don't support) how about the other four members? <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanic_15ef.html" title="User:Megamanic">Megamanic</a> 09:09, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I cleaned up the early history section, and included everything involving the formation of the band from the late 1960s to 1971 as "Formation" as opposed to having one thing said in the opening paragraph, repeated again in both the 1960s and 1970s sections. I updated it to the best of my judgement and tried to keep many of the sentences that were previoulsy written intact. If you notice any inaccuracies, missing information, or still have questions about the formation, discuss it here, or change it yourself. I just tried to make things easier to read and understand for the general population. <a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 16:29, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Still not properly sourced, the article has the phrase in quotations. The writer is not saying it, the newspaper is not saying it, they are merely quoting the band themselves, hence the quotation marks.</p>
<p>Saying they consider themselves to be "America's greatest rock band" doesn't sit well with me either, I could deem myself "America's smartest woman," but that doesn't make it so. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 01:58, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of course it doesn't mean that they are, just like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> aren't the "World's Greatest Rock Band", yet that is still mentioned in that article since they are often regarded as such, just like Aerosmith is often tagged "America's Greatest Rock Band", and as we've seen, the phrase comes from many sources, from their record label, to the media, to everyday people. If they were indeed America's Greatest Rock Band, I would just type it "Aerosmith is America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band." However, when we add the phrase "often regarded", it means that they are just often referred to and heralded by that title, but not necessarily all the time or by everyone.</p>
<p>So please, go hound the people over on the Stones' page, cause I will not stop fighting this until that is changed. Additonally, the Rolling Stones' citation doesn't even link to anywhere. Because, The Rolling Stones aren't the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band any more than Aerosmith is America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band. That still doesn't deny the fact that they are both heavily referred to by their respective titles. 131.156.238.75 03:28, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not working on the Rolling Stones page, I'm working on this page. Until you have a proper cite for it, it doesn't belong here. That's not my rule, it's Wikipedia policy, stated clearly here: <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 03:48, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is properly cited. Try policing articles that aren't properly cited. 131.156.238.75 04:07, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, Madonna is listed on Wikipedia as being the "Queen of Pop", Elvis Presley is listed as being "The King of Rock n' Roll", and Bruce Springsteen as "The Boss". Of course, whether Madonna is really the "Queen of Pop", Elvis "the King", and Bruce Springsteen "The Boss" could be disputed. However, it is undeniable that they are commonly referred to by these nicknames/taglines. Same thing with Aerosmith being commonly referred to as "America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band", in the vein of the Stones' "World's Greatest Rock Band" title. In no way, are we implying that they are the Queen, the King, the Boss, the Greatest, etc., just that these prominent musicians are commonly referred to, nicknamed, taglined, and heralded by such titles. It is only fair that if we let these other articles on prominent musicians mention the musicians' nickname/tagline/title in the lead paragraphs, then the Aerosmith article shall as well. I really think this is just a case of you being nit-picky or having some type of grudge against Aerosmith or something, otherwise as a true Wikipedian, you would be going after articles on equally prominent musicians that make use of these "Greatest", "King/Queen" type titles. I am always finding articles that mention Aerosmith as being "America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band", yet you always seem to deny the credibility of the source, or the fact that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of articles out there that mention the "America's greatest" title. But believe me, the sources I provide are usually credible, and a lot more credible than what I am seeing for some of these other articles. Please, can we end this now? I find it just a tad bit ridiculous that you try and come back here every month or so, tyring to deny the prominence of an important American rock n' roll music group, the credibility of the sources to back it up, and the widespread usage of the term. 131.156.238.75 03:33, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please stop removing Skid Row, Warrant, Poison, Cinderella, and Pearl Jam. I actually went to allmusic.com and found that these bands were listed in the "influenced" section on Aerosmith's page on allmusic.com. And anyone who knows anything about rock knows that these bands were highly successful on the hair metal scene (well except for Pearl Jam, who was successful in the grunge/alternative scene), and much of their influence lies in bands such as Aerosmith. Additionally, let's try to keep the insignificant and unsuccessful artists, such as Faster Pussycat, who only had one gold album, off the list. 131.156.238.75 18:21, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Skid Row and Warrant are "significant" but Faster Pussycat aren't, you're joking right?Your edits are highly POV and you only seem interested in adding bands that you are a fan of, not ones who you can actually hear the influence of Aerosmith in their music. - <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a> 01:14, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, considering Skid Row, Poison, and Warrant actually had mainstream success (multiplatinum albums, hit singles), they are worth mentioning. If you add Faster Pussycat, that's opening the floodgates too much. Take a look at Aerosmith's page on <a href="http://www.allmusic.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmusic.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, it actually shows "similar artists" and "followers". Since, Faster Pussycat is listed, then that's fine, we'll keep them. But Poison and Skid Row are also listed and should remain. Warrant is not, so I deleted them. <a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 02:45, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Sure, the Jam Band had its origin in Sunapee, but Aerosmith did not. And yes, Steven Tyler may have had a chance meeting with Joe in Sunapee, yet the band was still not formed yet. The formation of Aerosmith did not happen until 1970 in Boston, MA, when Tom and Joe quit the other band, met up with Steven Tyler, Joey Kramer, and Ray Tabano.

<p>""king of rock 'n' roll" from elvis article, "godfather of soul" from james brown, "world's greatest" from rolling stones, etc.. no double standards please.)"</p>
<p>"King of Rock and Roll" and "Godfather of Soul" are widely used nicknames, not a declaration by the band themselves, or PR lackeys. As for the Rolling Stones, the title of "greatest rock and roll band" is credited to a reputable source. I've had this argument 3 times on the this talk page, and would really like for an admin to get involved to settle it once and for all. ~~</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>A) "The Godfather of Soul" is a nickname James Brown invented himself, as are most of his other nicknames. It even says so in the lead of that article. Please do a little research before assuming.</li>
<li>B) The Rolling Stones source is from the band itself as well (a video)...they were introduced as such during a tour by their own people...the same thing you wrongly criticize Aerosmith of.</li>
<li>C) "America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band" is a widely used nickname for Aerosmith. Type it into any search engine if you don't believe me. I also have at least one credible newspaper source using the nickname, and there are plenty more out there. When their new album comes out and they have another tour this year, the nickname will be back in full force again. Just watch the headlines and quit denying the truth.</li>
<li>D) Please no double standards. If you're going to do it for one prominent musician with a tagline/nickname, you need to do it for the rest, or at least believe that their nicknames/taglines need to be removed as well, otherwise you're guilty of POV yourself.</li>

<dd>Have you looked at the sources lately. It's the Bradenton Herald and the House of Blues. It's not the band itself like it once was. This isn't fancruft. Everywhere you look, it's "America's Greatest Rock Band." It's not something I made up. It's not even something the band made up. They've been known as that for a long time. And even the press notes it at the beginning of most articles. Same with the Stones. They're not the World's greatest rock band, but it's a common nickname (even though THAT one was started by the band), as is Aerosmith's.</dd>

<dd>A more appropriate thing to have done would have been to mark questionable/controversial statements with a "citation needed" tag, as I'm finding that many of the things you have issue with and have taken out can be proven. I am finding sources for many of these questionable statements, and may even put some back in. But as you simply removed them, it seems obvious you remain more interested in denying and hiding Aerosmith's success rather than simply getting sources for the statements.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Additionally, when an album gets 4-star and 5-star ratings in almost every major music magazine and goes 7 times platinum, I think it's safe to consider it a critical and commerical success.

<dd>Well, obviously you believe I'm conspiring to make this a fan page, when I am currently finding sources for pretty much everything you removed. Nevertheless, by outright removing phrases, instead of specifically tagging them and discussing them and finding sources for them like normal people do on Wikipedia, you're just outright removing things, which is pretty irresponsible and suggests that you would rather try to deny and hide Aerosmith's success instead of verify it. --<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 04:13, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "facts" that I removed are not really facts; in reality, they are adjectives and descriptives that you are using to describe the band. Any sources that you find will still need to be acceptable per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 04:22, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They are facts if they can be verified. Additionally, enough with the "you" statements. I didn't write this article from the start, and I'm not responsible for including many of these pharses. However, I do think that we should try and verify these statements first before deleting them. --<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 04:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I'm sorry; you're correct. You didn't write the statements in question; I meant to say the statements you are referring to. By all means, if you can source these statements, then readd them, per WS guidelines. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 04:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As you already deleted most of the peacock terms and I accounted for the remainder you posted here, I removed the "peacock terms" tag. The only other major problem remaining would be the last sentence in the lead, which acts more of a summary and ending point more than anything. I'll try and think about it and work on it though. If you have any other issues, please just put a "citation needed" next to the specific phrase, and if it is truly "peacock term" in nature and there is no source to back it up, we can then remove it. But really, there isn't anything so obvious and glaring like "the best", "the most famous", "wonderful", and other terms that are currently uncited that would warrant this tag. --<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 05:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>this is one of the best band articles i have ever read on wikipedia. SO well organized. makes The Rolling Stones look like garbage (in article comparsion).
