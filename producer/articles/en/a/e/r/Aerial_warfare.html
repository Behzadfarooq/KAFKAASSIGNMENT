<p>Some minor warfare use was made of balloons in the infancy of aeronautics. The first instance was by the French Aerostatic Corps at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fleurus_%281794%29_7061.html" title="Battle of Fleurus (1794)">Battle of Fleurus</a> in 1794, who used a tethered balloon, "l'entreprenant", to gain a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vantage_point.html" title="Vantage point">vantage point</a>.</p>
<p>During the American Civil War, balloons were used by both the North and South as a means of observing battlefields - initially it was thought they could be used for preparing better maps. In one instance the balloon of Prof. <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thaddeus_S._C._Lowe_f50f.html" title="Thaddeus S. C. Lowe">Thaddeus S. C. Lowe</a> was used as an FAO (Forward Artillery Observer), by which Lowe was able to ascend to a height from which he could view an "unseen target," and with a series of flag signals was able to call artillery fire in from an unseen fire base.</p>
<p>Balloons had disadvantages. They could not fly in bad weather, fog, or high winds. They were piloted at the whims of the winds and were also a very large target. Union Army balloons were always under fire, and whatever type of shot, rifle or cannon, was aimed at them and missed, they fell on the Union side of the battlefield. Confederate balloons faced bigger problems. Because of embargoes they had no access to balloon <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silk.html" title="Silk">silk</a>. They used what there was of dress-making silk material to fashion balloons. Often the city, usually Richmond, had no inflation gas.</p>
<p>The use of balloons in warfare was not seen for another 30 years. The invention of the blimp, or dirigible, with its mechanical means of propulsion and steering made inflatable aerostats more useful. Added to this was the idea of dropping ordinance from the blimps onto enemy positions. The use of military aerostats became practical during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, and helium made the use of inflatables safer and more dependable during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerial_warfare.html" title="Edit section: Union Army Balloon Corps">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Union Army Balloon Corps</span></h4>
<p>The American Civil War was the first war to witness significant use of aeronautics in support of battle. In June 1861 <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thaddeus_S._C._Lowe_f50f.html" title="Thaddeus S. C. Lowe">Professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe</a> left his work in the private sector as a scientist/balloonist and offered his services as an aeronaut to President Lincoln, who took some interest in the idea of an air war. Lowe's demonstration of flying his balloon the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Enterprise_%28balloon%29.html" title="Enterprise (balloon)">Enterprise</a> over Washington D. C. and transmitting a message via telegraph to the ground was enough to have him introduced to the commanders of the Topographical Engineers.</p>
<p>Lowe's first action was at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bull_Run_6993.html" title="Battle of Bull Run">Battle of Bull Run</a> in July 1861 with General Irvin McDowell and the Grand Army of the Potomac. With the use of his balloon Enterprise Lowe did a free flight observation of the Confederate positions, but as he had no identifying insignias or colors he was turned away by Union forces who could not identify him. He was forced to land behind enemy lines, but was rescued before he was discovered.</p>
<p>In another demonstration, Lowe was called to Fort Corcoran by artillery General W. F. Smith. Lowe ascended to a given altitude in order to spot rebel encampments at Falls Church (Va.). With flag signals he directed artillery fire onto the sleeping encampment. As the General put it: <i>"The signals from the balloon have enabled my gunners to hit with a fine degree of accuracy an unseen and dispersed target area."</i></p>
<p>By October he had orders in hand to build four balloons with portable hydrogen gas generators for use in aerial reconnaissance. Working with several other prominent American balloonists he formed the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Army_Balloon_Corps_adc9.html" title="Union Army Balloon Corps">Union Army Balloon Corps</a> who never received commissions, working as civilian contractors, This was of great concern should the aeronauts be shot down over enemy lines, as civilian spying is summarily punishable by death. Therefore Lowe instructed on the strict use of tethered (as opposed to free) flight, by which the balloons remained attached to ground crews by cable. By attaining altitudes from 1,000 feet to as much as 3-1/2 miles, an expansive view of the battle field and beyond could be had.</p>
<p>Lowe built seven balloons: <i>Eagle</i>, his first; <i>Constitution</i>, one of the smaller balloons; its sister, <i>Washington</i>; <i>Intrepid</i>, a larger balloon and his favorite; a sister, <i>Union</i>; <i>Excelsior</i>; and <i>United States</i>, which never came out of storage.</p>
<p>As the Confederates retreated toward Richmond (Va.) the War turned into the Peninsular Campaign. Due to the heavy forests on the peninsula, the balloons were unable to follow on land. Lowe was introduced to the <i>George Washington Parke Custis</i>, a coal barge converted to a flat top that would serve as the first aircraft carrier in effect. The balloons with their gas generators were loaded aboard and taken down the Potomac, where reconnaissance of the peninsula could continue. The <i>GWP Custis</i> was taken up the Pawmunkey River, where Lowe was reunited with McClellan's army.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Prof. Lowe ascending in the <i>Intrepid</i> to observe the Battle of Fair Oaks</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Lowe's most dramatic action came in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fair_Oaks_a802.html" title="Battle of Fair Oaks">Battle of Fair Oaks</a>, where he was able to view the advancing of Lee's army onto the isolated detachment of General Heintzelman. Working from two balloon camps, one at Mechanicsville and one at Gaine's Farm, Lowe galloped six miles twice daily to keep up with the reconnaissance reports. McClellan was sure that the rebels were feigning an attack, but Lowe could see differently. Heintzelman was left stranded on the other side of the Chickahominy River with the bridges having been taken out overnight by the swollen waters. Lowe sent a dispatch of utmost urgency to have the bridge repaired immediately and reserves sent to Heintzelman's aid. He then sent dispatch from Mechanicsville to Gaine's Farm calling for the immediate inflation of the large balloon <i>Enterprise</i>, which would aid him in overlooking the imminent battle.</p>
<p>When Lowe arrived at Gaine's, the <i>Intrepid</i> will still far from being inflated. In a quick work of inventive ingenuity, Lowe had the bottom of a camp kettle cut out and joined the valve ends of the <i>Intrepid</i> and the partially inflated <i>Constitution</i> hooked together, thereby transferring the gas from the latter into the former. Within 15 minutes he was in the air to oversee the battle. McClellan took Lowe's advice and came to Heintzelman's aid, saving the day.</p>
<p>Lowe fell prey to malaria during Fair Oaks and was out of commission for more than a month. On his return he found that the Balloon Corps had been stripped of horses and wagons and left out of service for the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Antietam_e90e.html" title="Battle of Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a>. Lowe was called back into service at Sharpsburg and later responded to Gen. Burnside's army at Vicksburg. The ensuing defeat of the Union Army in what was referred to as the "Mud March" led to Gen. Joseph Hooker's replacement of Burnside. By this time the Balloon Corps had been assigned to the Engineers Corps, and a newly promoted Captain Comstock cut Lowe's pay dramatically.</p>
<p>Lowe tendered a letter of intent to resign and was released from military duty in May 1863. The Balloon Corps continued to operate under the direction of the Allen Brothers who were ill-equipped to run the corps effectively. By August the Union Army Balloon Corps was disbanded.</p>

<p>Due to the effectiveness of the Union Army Balloon Corps, the Confederates felt compelled to incorporate balloons as well. As coke gas was not always available in Richmond, the first balloons were made of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgolfier.html" title="Montgolfier">Montgolfier</a> rigid style, cotton stretched over wood framing and filled with hot smoke from fires made of oil-soaked pinecones. They were piloted by Captain John R. Bryant for use at Yorktown. Though Bryant's performance was not all that bad, his handlers were poorly experienced and his balloon was left in the air spinning like a top. Another incident had one of the handlers becoming entangled in the ascending tether rope which had to be chopped loose, leaving the Captain free-flying over his own Confederate positions whose troops threatened to shoot him down.</p>
<p>Attempts at making gas-filled silk balloons were hampered by the South's inability to obtain any imports at all. They did fashion a balloon from dress silk (purportedly silk for making dresses, not from silk dresses themselves). The inflated spheres appeared as multi-colored orbs over Richmond and were piloted by Captain Landon Cheeves. Before the first balloon could be used it was captured during transportation on the James River by the crew of the Monitor. A second balloon did see action until summer 1863, when it was blown from its mooring and taken by Union forces only to be divided up as souvenirs for members of the Federal Congress. As the Union Army reduced its use of balloons, so did the Confederates, and much to their relief.</p>

<p>The armies of many countries evaluated the use of aircraft for observation purposes. Naval aviation was pursued as well; several tests were made in which <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floatplane.html" title="Floatplane">floatplanes</a> were launched by catapult from ships at sea, and recovered later by crane.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">U.S. Navy</a> had been interested in naval aviation since the turn of the 20th century. In 1910-1911, the Navy conducted experiments which proved the practicality of carrier-based aviation.

<p>Initially during that war both sides made use of tethered balloons and airplanes for observation purposes, both for information gathering and directing of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> fire. A desire to prevent enemy observation led to airplane pilots attacking other airplanes and balloons, initially with small arms carried in the cockpit (even resorting to such objects as bricks), but due to the technology of the time pilots couldn't have forward facing machine guns. It wasn't until the Germans developed the Interrupter Gear which worked by jamming the gun every time the propeller was in front of the guns. Eventually the Allies were able to capture German fighter with the Interruptor Gear and reverse engineering it, this would lead to the birth of the dogfight. Unfortunately there were no set tactics or rules for dogfighting so many pilots had to go into combat through trial and error. Eventually the German ace Oswald Boelcke created the Dicta Boelcke, which contained the eight rules of dogfighting. <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_fight.html" title="Dog fight">Dogfights</a> occurred when planes fought each other at close quarters, leading to the development of maneuvering tactics. Both sides also made use of aircraft for <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombing.html" title="Bombing">bombing</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strafing.html" title="Strafing">strafing</a> and dropping of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>.

<p>By the end of the war airplanes had become specialized into bombers, fighters and observation aircraft.</p>

<p>Between 1918 and 1939 aircraft technology developed very rapidly. In 1918 most aircraft were biplanes with wooden frames, canvas skins, wire rigging and air-cooled engines. Biplanes continued to be the mainstay of air forces around the world and were used extensively in conflicts such as the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>. Most industrial countries also created <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_force.html" title="Air force">air forces</a> separate from the army and navy. However, by 1939 military biplanes were in the process of being replaced with metal framed <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monoplane.html" title="Monoplane">monoplanes</a>, often with stressed skins and liquid cooled engines. Top speeds had tripled; altitudes doubled (and oxygen masks became commonplace); ranges and payloads of bombers increased enormously.</p>
<p>Some theorists, especially in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>, considered that aircraft would become the dominant military arm in the future. They imagined that a future war would be won entirely by the destruction of the enemy's military and industrial capability from the air. The Italian general <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giulio_Douhet_7275.html" title="Giulio Douhet">Giulio Douhet</a>, author of <i>The Command of the Air</i>, was a seminal theorist of this school, which has been associated with <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Baldwin_84d4.html" title="Stanley Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a>'s statement that "The bomber will always get through"; that is, regardless of air defenses, sufficient raiders will survive to rain destruction on the enemy's cities.</p>
<p>Others, such as General <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Mitchell_5084.html" title="Billy Mitchell">Billy Mitchell</a> in the United States, saw the potential of air power to neutralize the striking power of naval surface fleets. German and British pilots had experimented with aerial bombing of ships and air-dropped torpedoes during World War I with mixed results. But the vulnerability of capital ships to aircraft was finally demonstrated on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_21.html" title="July 21">21 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a> when a squadron of bombers commanded by General Mitchell sank the ex-German battleship <a href="../../../s/m/s/SMS_Ostfriesland_8e26.html" title="SMS Ostfriesland">SMS <i>Ostfriesland</i></a> with aerial bombs.</p>
<p>Germany was banned from possessing a significant air force by the terms of the WWI armistice. The German military continued to train its soldiers as pilots clandestinely until Hitler was ready to openly defy the ban.</p>

<p>Military aviation came into its own during the Second World War. The increased performance, range, and payload of contemporary aircraft meant that air power could move beyond the novelty applications of WWI, becoming a central striking force for all the combatant nations.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_bombing.html" title="Strategic bombing">Strategic bombing</a> of civilian targets from the air was a strategy first proposed by the Italian theorist General <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giulio_Douhet_7275.html" title="Giulio Douhet">Giulio Douhet</a>. In his book <i>The Command of the Air</i> (1921), Douhet argued that future military leaders could avoid falling into bloody World War I-style trench stalemates by using aviation to strike past the enemy's forces directly at their vulnerable civilian population. Douhet believed that such strikes would cause these populations to rise up in revolt and overthrow their governments to stop the bombing.</p>
<p>Douhet's ideas were paralleled by other military theorists who emerged from World War I, including Sir <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Trenchard_b28a.html" title="Hugh Trenchard">Hugh Trenchard</a> in Britain. In the interwar period, Britain and the United States became the most enthusiastic supporters of the strategic bombing theory, with each nation building specialized heavy bombers specifically for this task.</p>
<h4>Luftwaffe</h4>
<p>In the early days of WWII, the Luftwaffe launched devastating air attacks against the besieged cities of Warsaw and Rotterdam. In both cases, each city had managed to resist German ground forces, and the air attacks were seen as a means of breaking the city's will to fight. During the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe, frustrated in its attempts to gain command of the air over Britain in preparation for the planned invasion, turned to the bombing of London and other large English cities. However, the Luftwaffe found that these raids did not have the effect that was predicted by prewar airpower theorists.</p>
<h4>Royal Air Force</h4>
<p>The British, erroneously believing that the German civilian morale was easier to break, started a strategic bombing campaign in 1940 that was to last for the rest of the war. The British bombers of the early war were all twin-engined designs and were lacking in defensive armament. Therefore they were quickly forced to adopt a policy of night bombing, which meant that they were never able to hit specific targets such as factories or power plants.</p>
<h4>Military Air Forces of the Workers and Peasants Red Army</h4>
<p>Abbreviated in Russian as ВВС РККА, and commonly known as the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Air_Force_3d9e.html" title="Red Air Force">Red Air Force</a> during WW2, it was organised according into Air armies, Air forces of the Fronts, Air forces of the (ground) Armies, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_district.html" title="Military district">Military district</a> Air forces and Air Forces of the Military Fleets. There were also numerous independent <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Corps_e4f3.html" title="Air Corps">Air Corps</a>, divisions, brigades, regiments and squadrons, many of which were awarded the additional title of <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guards.html" title="Guards">Guards</a>. During the course of the war the Red Air Force underwent numerous changes, the major of which were: Air forces of the Military districts were transformed into Air Armies on commencement of war; Air forces assigned to ground Armies were disbanded in May 1942; by the end of the Second World War there were eighteen Air Armies generally assigned at a rate of one per Front, and four <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet.html" title="Fleet">Fleet</a> Air forces, as well as four <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flotilla.html" title="Flotilla">flotilla</a> Air forces. Although lacking a strong <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_bombing.html" title="Strategic bombing">strategic bombing</a> air forces, the Red Air Force was famous for its <a href="../../../i/l/y/Ilyushin_Il-2_6a9f.html" title="Ilyushin Il-2">Ilyushin Il-2</a> Shturmovik Ground Attack aircraft, and use of aircraft to support partisan troops operating behind the <a href="../../../w/e/h/Wehrmacht.html" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> lines.</p>
<h4>U.S. Army Air Force</h4>
<p>When the U.S. <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighth_Air_Force_f1db.html" title="Eighth Air Force">Eighth Air Force</a> arrived in England in 1942, the Americans were convinced that they could do what the RAF and the Luftwaffe could not. The 8th was equipped with <a href="../../../b/-/1/B-17_Flying_Fortress_15c9.html" title="B-17 Flying Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortresses</a> and <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-24_Liberator_9446.html" title="B-24 Liberator">B-24 Liberators</a>, both high-altitude four-engined designs with turbo-superchargers. The new bombers also featured the strongest defensive armament yet seen - up to 13 <a href="../../../m/2/_/M2_Browning_machine_gun_1bc2.html" title="M2 Browning machine gun">.50 caliber machine guns</a>, depending on the version, most of them in power-operated turrets. Flying during daylight in large, close formations, U.S. doctrine held that tactical formations of heavy bombers would be sufficient to gain <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_superiority.html" title="Air superiority">air superiority</a> in the absence of escort fighters. The intended raids would hit hard on chokepoints in the German war economy such as <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_refinery.html" title="Oil refinery">oil refineries</a> or <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ball_bearing.html" title="Ball bearing">ball bearing</a> factories. The U.S.A.A.F. was compelled to change its doctrine that bombers alone, no matter how heavily armed, could achieve air superiority against single-engined fighters. Loss rates rose from five per cent to twenty per cent in a series of missions penetrating beyond the range of fighter cover between <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_17.html" title="August 17">August 17</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_14.html" title="October 14">October 14</a> 1943, when raids against <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schweinfurt-Regensburg_mission_30c9.html" title="Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission">Regensburg and Schweinfurt</a> resulted in the loss of 60 bombers on each mission.</p>
<h4>Air superiority</h4>
<p>During the Battle of Britain many of the Luftwaffe's best pilots had been forced to bail out over British soil, where they were captured. As the quality of the Luftwaffe fighter arm decreased, the Americans introduced the long-ranged <a href="../../../p/-/3/P-38_Lightning_8e83.html" title="P-38 Lightning">P-38 Lightning</a> and <a href="../../../p/-/5/P-51_Mustang_6b8f.html" title="P-51 Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a> <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escort_fighter.html" title="Escort fighter">escort fighters</a>, carrying drop tanks. Newer, inexperienced German pilots—flying potentially superior aircraft like the <a href="../../../f/o/c/Focke-Wulf_Fw_190_f767.html" title="Focke-Wulf Fw 190">Focke-Wulf Fw 190</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinkel_He_162_c6c0.html" title="Heinkel He 162">Heinkel He 162</a> and the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messerschmitt_Me_262_3e84.html" title="Messerschmitt Me 262">Messerschmitt Me 262</a>—gradually became less and less effective at thinning the late-war American <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomber_stream.html" title="Bomber stream">bomber streams</a>. Adding fighters to the daylight raids gave the bombers much-needed protection and greatly improved the impact of the strategic bombing effort.</p>
<h4>Effectiveness</h4>
<p>Strategic bombing by non-atomic means did not win the war for the Allies, nor did it succeed in breaking the will to resist of the German (and Japanese) people, but in the words of the German armaments minister <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Speer_ddb0.html" title="Albert Speer">Albert Speer</a> it created "a second front in the air" long before <a href="../../../d/-/d/D-day.html" title="D-day">D-day</a> created the second front on the ground. Speer succeeded in increasing the output of armaments right up to mid-1944 in spite of the bombing. Still, the war against the British and American bombers demanded enormous amounts of resources: antiaircraft guns, day and night fighters, radars, searchlights, manpower, ammo and fuel. As a result, the German army groups in Russia, Italy and France rarely saw friendly aircraft and constantly ran short of tanks, trucks, and anti-tank weapons. The only option left was to create World War I-style slit trench defenses quite unlike the Blitzkriegs of 1939-1941. <a name="Tactical_air_support" id="Tactical_air_support"></a></p>

This accounted for the presence of large numbers of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Dive_bomber.html" title="Dive bomber">dive bombers</a> in the make-up, and the scarcity of long-range heavy bombers. This 'flying artillery' greatly assisted in the successes of the German Army in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_France_ab9b.html" title="Battle of France">Battle of France</a> (1940). Hitler determined that <i>air superiority</i> was a requirement for the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Sealion_782a.html" title="Operation Sealion">invasion of Britain</a>. When this was not achieved in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Britain_2389.html" title="Battle of Britain">Battle of Britain</a> during the summer of 1940 the invasion was cancelled, making this the first major battle whose outcome was determined primarily in the air. The <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Air_Force_8557.html" title="Soviet Air Force">Soviet Air Force</a> was also primarily used in the tactical support role and towards the end of the war was used very well in the support of the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Army_ccba.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> in its advance across <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Europe_ef2f.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a>.

<p>Military transport aviation was invaluable to all sides in maintaining supply and communications of ground troops, and was used on many notable occasions such as resupply of German troops in and around Stalingrad after <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Uranus_a231.html" title="Operation Uranus">Operation Uranus</a>, and employment of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airborne_troops.html" title="Airborne troops">airborne troops</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerial_warfare.html" title="Edit section: Post World War II">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Post World War II</span></h2>
<p>Military aviation in the post-war years was dominated by the needs of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. The post-war years saw the almost total conversion of combat aircraft to jet power, which resulted in enormous increases in speeds and altitudes of aircraft. Until the advent of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercontinental_Ballistic_Missile_f087.html" title="Intercontinental Ballistic Missile">Intercontinental Ballistic Missile</a> major powers relied on high-altitude bombers to deliver their newly-developed nuclear deterrent; each country strove to develop the technology of bombers and the high-altitude fighters that could intercept them. The concept of air superiority began to play a heavy role in aircraft designs for both the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Americans developed and made extensive use of the high-altitude observation aircraft for intelligence-gathering. The <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_U-2_ae78.html" title="Lockheed U-2">U-2</a>, and later the <a href="../../../s/r/-/SR-71_Blackbird_d4d3.html" title="SR-71 Blackbird">SR-71 Blackbird</a> were developed in great secrecy. The U-2 at its time was supposed to be invulnerable to defensive measures, due to its extreme altitude. It therefore came as a great shock when the Soviets downed one piloted by <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Powers_9116.html" title="Gary Powers">Gary Powers</a> with a ground-to-air missile. Air combat was also transformed through increased use of air-to-air <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guided_missiles.html" title="Guided missiles">guided missiles</a> with increased sophistication in guidance and increased <a href="../../../r/a/n/Range.html" title="Range">range</a>.</p>
<p>In the 70s and 80s it became clear that speed and altitude was not enough to protect a bomber against air defences. The emphasis shifted therefore to maneuverable attack aircraft that could fly 'under the radar', at altitudes of a few hundred feet.</p>

<p>The development of the helicopter revolutionised the entire battlefield by the improvement of the "Third Dimension" of "Vertical Envelopment" that had been introduced shortly before World War II with the development of Airborne units (pioneered by the USSR). This included the aerial support of ground forces, and expansion of the "<a href="../../../p/i/n/Pincer_movement.html" title="Pincer movement">Cannae Maneuver</a>" from two dimensions (Encirclement) to one of Three Dimensions (Encirclement and Vertical Envelopment). In addition, the introduction of the helicopter removed most barriers to troop movement on the battlefield, and provided the sort of mobility that the artillery had been dreaming of since its inception. A helicopter could deliver troops and weapons quickly to areas inaccessible to fixed-wing aircraft - and, unlike paratroops, they could be recovered again. Likewise, ground units could call for aerial fire support that could save them from capture or destruction. The first such operation was undertaken by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a> during the <a href="../../../s/u/e/Suez_Crisis_2713.html" title="Suez Crisis">Suez Crisis</a> of 1956. This led to an entirely new class of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airmobile.html" title="Airmobile">airmobile</a> troops, and the introduction of "<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Cavalry_1f2d.html" title="Air Cavalry">Air Cavalry</a>" in the U.S., able to land unexpectedly, strike, and leave again. Such tactics played a major part in the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, and is today an integral element of US tactical thinking for all forms of warfare. Soviet campaign in Afghanistan also saw widespread use of helicopters as part or the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Assault_91d4.html" title="Air Assault">Air Assault</a> (Воздушный десант) brigades and regiments.</p>

<p>The collapse of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> in 1991 forced Western air forces to undergo a shift from the massive numbers felt to be necessary during the Cold War to smaller numbers of multi-role aircraft.

About 14,000 sorties were flown, and at a cost of $1 million dollars each, 800 <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomahawk_cruise_missile.html" title="Tomahawk cruise missile">Tomahawk cruise missiles</a> were fired at numerous targets in Iraq from <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_19.html" title="March 19">March 19</a> until mid-April 2003.
