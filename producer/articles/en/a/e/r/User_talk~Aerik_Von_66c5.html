<p>Occasionally there are some things to do in Oneonta after dark besides go to the bars and drink: one can go to the bars and watch a band. Most of the times the band is a mellow, lame cover band or some local talent looking for an audience. In the case of Black Moon Rising, this is not nessceraily true. They are a local band, which happens to do a few covers, but mellow and lame is not something you can put in their description.</p>
<p>The music is loud mixture of punk, heavy metal, and classic rock in the same manner of Credence Clearwater Revival, Black Sabbath, and The Misfits. One can hardly call that mellow and lame. On the nature of the songs, songwriter Aerik Babral says, "It's not stuff that isn't pretty, nor is it anyhow catered to being user friendly. I'd like to think that we'd be as hated as we are loved, as hate is sometimes a better compliment coming from certain people. Lyrically, I am influenced by the more horrible parts of life: drug addicts, war, and personal issues become a bit more entertaining as they provoke thought. The world is full of raw nerves, failures, and horror and it's a lot more interesting to me to pull the damaged skin back"</p>
<p>The members, who are or were Hartwick College students, include Aerik Babral as the lead singer and guitarist, Erik Kjellquist as the drummer, and Jonah Smiley and Kevin Stube and the various bassists. Babral is at the heart of the band for it is his lovechild and creation. The other members have come together to perform with him by way of Phi Mu Alpha, the men's music fraternity on campus. The basis of the band is more or less a bunch of guys paying homage to the music and the songs that they grew up with and now want to put their spin on it, not to mention having fun doing it.</p>
<p>One may ask, "Where did they get the name 'Black Moon Rising'?" According to Babral, "I had managed to lose our original name to another band. Ironically, this band never used the name. An old supporter of mine from Canada compared us to an 'evil-rock' band in the vein of CCR mixed with Black Sabbath. Hence 'I see a Black Moon Rising'...the rest is history."</p>
<p>If one has been to The Silver Bullet recently, one may realize that they know this band. On Saturday, Black Moon Rising made their second appearance at The Silver Bullet on Main Street next to the firehouse. Although the crowd was small, from what Smiley said was due to "lack of advertisement", a dedicated group of individuals cheered them on. Although the play-list was short, they rocked the bar with covers of Eric Clapton's Cocaine, and The Ramones' Beat on the Brat and Blitzkrieg Bop along with originals like The Hangman, Built to Burn, and Pain and Suffering (Nothing to Lose). There was also a special guest, Eric Regnell, whom helped out the band by singing the vocals on a cover of AC/DC's Highway to Hell.</p>
<p>The music was loud and rocking, just the way that the members like it. The atmosphere was something akin to what one would imagine an early Ramones or Misfits gig was like. If one is looking for something different than the current music scene, download Black Moon Rising's music on www.mp3.com, see them live at various bars downtown, or wait for their much anticipated CD to come out later this year. Any way one may look at it, there seems to be a black moon rising over Oneonta that cannot be ignored.</p>
