<p><b>Aerial refueling</b>, also called <b>Air refueling</b> or <b>in-flight refueling</b> (<b>IFR</b>) or <b>air-to-air refueling</b> (<b>AAR</b>) or (in the UK) <b>tanking</b>. Note that AAR also stands for "After-Action Review" (de-briefing) and in aviation, IFR also stands for "Instrument Flight Rules" (flight by instrument references only such as in cloud ).</p>
<p>Air refueling is the process of transferring <a href="../../../f/u/e/Fuel.html" title="Fuel">fuel</a> from one <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft.html" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> (the tanker) to another (the receiver) during flight. This allows the receiving aircraft to remain airborne longer and, more important, to extend its range and therefore those of its weapons or its deployment radius. A series of air refuelings can give range limited only by crew fatigue and engineering factors such as engine oil consumption.</p>
<p>Because the receiver aircraft can be topped up with extra fuel in the air, air refueling can allow a <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeoff.html" title="Takeoff">takeoff</a> with a greater weapon <a href="../../../p/a/y/Payload.html" title="Payload">payload</a>, less fuel maintaining the allowed maximum takeoff weight. Alternatively a shorter takeoff roll can be achieved because takeoff can be at a lighter weight before refuelling once airborne (as with the US <a href="../../../s/r/-/SR-71_8b89.html" title="SR-71">SR-71</a> Blackbird reconnaissance aicraft).</p>
<p>Usually, the aircraft providing the fuel is specially designed for the task, although refuelling pods can be fitted to existing aircraft designs if the "probe and drogue" system it to be used (see later). The cost of the refueling equipment on both tanker and receiver aircraft and the specialised aircraft handling of the aircraft to be refueled (very close "line astern" formation flying) has resulted in the activity only being used in military operations. There is no known regular civilian in-flight refueling activity. In large-scale military operations, air refueling is extensively used. For instance, in the 1991 conflict with Iraq over its occupation of Kuwait and the 2003 war against Saddam Hussein's Irag, all coalition air sorties were air-refueled except for a few short-range ground attack sorties in the Kuwait area.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest experiments in aerial refueling took place in the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>, when it was as simple as two slow-flying aircraft flying in formation, with a hose run down from a hand-held fuel tank on one aircraft and placed into the usual fuel filler of the other. A <a href="../../../d/h/-/DH-4_966c.html" title="DH-4">DH-4B</a> <a href="../../../b/i/p/Biplane.html" title="Biplane">biplane</a> remained aloft with mid-air refueling for 37 hours on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_27.html" title="June 27">June 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a>.</p>
<p>Development was rapid. In 1929, a group of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Air_Corps_f227.html" title="United States Army Air Corps">U. S. Army Air Corps</a> fliers, led by then Major <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Andrew_Spaatz_3131.html" title="Carl Andrew Spaatz">Carl Spaatz</a>, set an endurance record of over 150 hours with the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Question_Mark_%28airplane%29_9c6f.html" title="Question Mark (airplane)"><i>Question Mark</i></a> over Los Angeles. In 1930, the Hunter brothers set a new record of 553 hours 40 minutes over Chicago. Aerial refuelling remained a very dangerous process until <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a> when brothers <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flying_Keys_3098.html" title="The Flying Keys">Fred and Al Key</a> demonstrated the first spill-free refueling nozzle, designed by A. D. Hunter. They exceeded the Hunters' record by nearly 100 hours in a <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtiss_Robin_a167.html" title="Curtiss Robin">Curtiss Robin</a> monoplane, staying aloft for more than 27 days.<sup id="_ref-HistAv19_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistAv19" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the UK, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Cobham_5dcf.html" title="Alan Cobham">Alan Cobham</a> pioneered research on the probe and drogue method, and gave public demonstrations of the system. In 1934, he founded <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_Refuelling_Ltd_aeba.html" title="Flight Refuelling Ltd">Flight Refuelling Ltd</a>. (FRL), and by 1938 had used an automatic system to refuel aircraft as large as the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_Empire_edf3.html" title="Short Empire">Short Empire</a> flying boat <i>Cambria</i> from an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armstrong_Whitworth_AW.23_3f33.html" title="Armstrong Whitworth AW.23">Armstrong Whitworth AW.23</a>.<sup id="_ref-HistAv19_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistAv19" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handley_Page_Harrow_2c01.html" title="Handley Page Harrow">Handley Page Harrows</a> were used to refuel the Empire flying boats for regular transatlantic crossings. FRL still exists as part of <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobham_plc.html" title="Cobham plc">Cobham plc</a>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, specialized <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanker_%28aircraft%29.html" title="Tanker (aircraft)">tanker</a> aircraft have equipment specially designed for the task of offloading fuel to the receiver aircraft, based on Hunter's design, even at the higher speeds modern <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_aircraft.html" title="Jet aircraft">jet aircraft</a> typically need to remain airborne.</p>

<p>In the late 1940s, General Curtis LeMay, commander of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), asked Boeing to develop a refueling system that could transfer fuel at a higher rate than had been possible with earlier systems using flexible hoses. Boeing engineers came up with the concept of the “Flying Boom,” system that is described in more detail below.</p>
<p>The B-29 was the first to employ the flying boom system, and between 1950 and 1951, 116 original B-29s, designated KB-29Ps, were converted at the Boeing plant at Renton, Washington State.</p>
<p>Boeing went on to develop the world’s first production aerial tanker, the <a href="../../../k/c/-/KC-97_Stratotanker_479b.html" title="KC-97 Stratotanker">KC-97 Stratotanker</a>, a piston-engined Boeing Stratocruiser (USAF designation C-97 StratoFreighter) with a Boeing-developed flying boom and extra kerosene (jet fuel) tanks feeding the boom. The Stratocruiser airliner itself was developed from the B-29 bomber after World War II. In the KC-97, the mixed gasoline/kerosene fuel system was clearly not desirable and it was obvious that a jet-powered tanker aircraft would be the next development, having a single type of fuel for both its own engines and for passing to receiver aircraft. It was no surprise that, after the KC-97, Boeing receiving contracts from the USAF to build Jet Tankers based on the Boeing 707 airframe. This modified B707 became the KC135 Stratotanker and 732 were built. Modern air refueling as we now know it, was born.</p>
<p>The Boeing "flying boom" is a long, rigid, hollow shaft fitted to the rear of the aircraft, in which is tube that can pass fuel. The end of the fuel tube can be exended rather like a telescope. The telescoping fuel tube has a valve at the end that mates to the "receptacle" in the receiver aircraft. The <a href="../../../p/o/p/Poppet_valve.html" title="Poppet valve">poppet valve</a> prevents fuel from exiting the tube until "contact" is properly made between the tanker's boom valve and the receiver's receptacle. Mounted on the hollow shaft surrounding the fuel tube are small <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wing.html" title="Wing">wings</a>, or <i>ruddevators</i> (visible in the picture, in a "V" shape). This enables the boom operator to "fly" the boom into alignment between the end of the boom and the receptacle. Once aligned, the fuel tube is <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydraulics.html" title="Hydraulics">hydraulically</a> extended to effect "contact". Toggles in the receptacle engage the valve assembly, holding it locked during fuel transfer. The receiver's receptacle is fitted on the top of the aircraft, usually on its centerline behind the pilot.</p>
<p>During refueling operations the tanker aircraft will fly at a constant altitude and speed with the boom unlatched and flying in the "trail" position (see the photo). From an initial rendezvous point (the "RV"), the receiver aircraft manoeuvers into the "pre-contact position", a standard position behind and below the tanker. This is to enable a closer approach to the tanker, enabling "contact" with the boom within its movement and extension limits.</p>
<p>Receiver positioning is aided with either voice or visual commands from the crewmember operating the boom, called a "<a href="../../../b/o/o/Boom_operator_%28military%29.html" title="Boom operator (military)">boom operator</a>" or "boomer". In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">USAF</a>, the boomer is usually an enlisted aircrew member. The boom operator faces toward the rear (i.e., toward the receiver aircraft) during refueling, lying prone in the <a href="../../../k/c/-/KC-135_264c.html" title="KC-135">KC-135</a> or sitting in a rear-facing seat in the <a href="../../../k/c/-/KC-10_e4cf.html" title="KC-10">KC-10</a>. For radio-silent operations, visual commands are through pilot director indicators (PDIs) on the bottom of the tanker. The boomer illuminates these, directing the receiver pilot to move fore/aft and up/down into the correct position. Once in position, the receiver pilot holds this position with resect to the tanker. This is made more difficult by turbulence or poor tanker flying. Normally, the tanker autopilot is engaged for refueling, but may be disengaged if malfunctioning or for training. Once the receiver is in the <i>contact position</i>, the boomer flies the nozzle into alignment with the receptacle by positioning the ruddevators with a control stick. At the same time, the boomer extends the nozzle at the end of the fuel tube into contact with the conical receptacle using the extension control lever. <a href="../../../p/u/m/Pump.html" title="Pump">Pumps</a> operated by the pilot on the tanker drive fuel through the fuel tube into the receiver.</p>
<p>While in contact, the PDIs show the boom's position to the receiver pilot so that he can fly close line astern formation to remain within the <i>air refueling envelope</i>. In addition, the inner extensible tube of the boom has color-coded stripes to aid the receiver pilot in keeping it extended to a proper length. The air refueling envelope is different for each receiver; it is based either on the boom's mechanical limits, or to prevent the receiver from moving into a position where any portion of the boom might contact the receiver outside the receptacle while in contact. When fueling is complete, either aircraft (typically the boomer) can effect a disconnect by sending an electrical signal through the boom, disengaging the toggles in the receptacle. An automatic <i>pressure disconnect</i> can also trigger this disengagement when the receiver's fuel system has been filled to capacity. The boomer retracts the fuel tube from the receptacle and "flies" the boom clear of the receiver. While not in use, the boom is "flown" up to the bottom of the tanker to minimise drag, and latched in position.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of the boom method is a high fuel flow rate(up to 1000 US gallons per minute for the <a href="../../../k/c/-/KC-135_264c.html" title="KC-135">KC-135</a> tanker). This is because the diameter of the fuel pipe in the flying boom was greater than could be achieved by the rival "probe and droge" system (see below) at the time. High fuel transfer rate was considered vital for the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_Air_Command_6b3b.html" title="Strategic Air Command">Strategic Air Command</a> bomber fleet when this system was selected because pilot fatigue during the refueling operation was a concern. Receiver pilots need high concentration to fly close linbe-astern formation throughout the procedure. Another feature of the boom system is the cost of the "boomer". In addition to US Air Force, the boom system is in use by the Netherlands (KDC-10), Israel (modified Boeing 707) and Turkey (ex-USAF KC-135R). Iran is also understood to operate a boom-equipped Boeing 747 tanker - possibly the largest tanker aircraft.</p>
<p>The European EADS group has developed a boom refueling system using "fly-by-wire" controls that is compatible with other boom systems. This is offered on modified European Airbus type aircraft that are to function as tankers.</p>
<p>The simpler and cheaper probe-and-drogue system is used by many other military organizations including the US Navy and Marine Corps and many non-US forces. The lower flow rates then available from the lower pressure and limited diameter of the hose used in the probe-and-drogue system result in longer refueling times compared to the Flying Boom system. However, lighter aircraft are refueled quicker because their fuel capacity is smaller.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The <i>drogue</i> (or <i>para-drogue</i>), sometimes called a <i>basket</i>, is a fitting resembling a plastic <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuttlecock.html" title="Shuttlecock">shuttlecock</a>, attached, at its narrow end, with a valve, to a flexible hose, running from the hose drum unit (HDU) or boom to drogue adapter (BDA). The receiver has a <i>probe</i>, which is a rigid arm placed on the aircraft's nose or, in some aircraft, to the side of the nose. At the end of the probe is a valve that is closed until it mates with the drogue, after which it opens and allows fuel to pass from tanker to receiver. The valves in the probe and drogue that are most commonly used are to a NATO standard and were originally developed by the company Flight Refuelling Limited. This standardisation of refuelling valves makes the probe and drogue system worldwide. Drogue-equipped tanker aircraft from many nations can refuel probe-equipped aircraft from others. The NATO standard probe system incorporates shear rivets that attach the refueling valve to the end of the probe. This is so that, if a large side-load or up-and-down load develops while in contact with the drogue, the rivets shear and the fuel valve breaks off rather than the probe itself being structurally damaged. Since the probe has a strong structural attachment to the aircraft fuselage, this also prevents the possibility of damage to the fuselage of the receiver aircraft itself. A so-called "broken probe" (actually a broken fuel valve, as described above) may happen if poor flying technique is used by the receiver pilot, or in turbulence.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerial_refueling.html" title="Edit section: Probe and Drogue - Receiver Flying Technique">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Probe and Drogue - Receiver Flying Technique</span></h3>
<p>The tanker aircraft flies straight and level (S&amp;L), and the drogue attached to its hose (flexible fuel pipe) is allowed to trail out behind and below the tanker under normal aerodynamic forces. The pilot of the receiver aircraft must then use his normal flight controls to "fly" his refueling probe directly into the basket so that the basket and probe refuel valves lock together so that fuel can flow from one to the other. This requires a closure rate of at least two knots or so, less gives a so-called "soft contact" in which the valves are not properly locked and fuel can spill out, for instance over the receiver aircraft's windscreen. Too high a contact speed is dangerous and can lead to a bow developing in the hose that can cause a side-load on the valve at the end of the probe, severing its mounting on the probe, ending the refueling and maybe leading to a diversion to another airfield. The optimal approach to the drogue is from behind and below (not level with it) along the line of the hang of the drogue below its Hose Drum Unit (HDU). A good rule for the receiver pilot is, when formating behind and below the tanker, the receiver is positioned so that the drogue is visually in line with the Hose Drum Unit on the tanker. This juxtaposition of drogue and HDU as a slow approach to the drogue is made ensures that, after initial contact, the velocity vector of the receiver aircraft is in the right direction to slowly push the drogue towards the tanker at the correct angle without further flight path adjustments, allowing the hose to reel a short distance on to the HDU drum, thereby opening the main fuel valve of the tanker and allowing refueling to start. Because of the significant inertia of large aircraft when approaching the drogue, the above technique is normally followed. However, with lighter and more manouevrable fighter aircraft there is the temptation to "rush" at the drogue from the same level. This sometimes leads to a so-called "broken probe" in which the shear rivets that attach the short refuelling valve to the probe itself, break. Note that if that if this happens, the probe itself should not be damaged, just the fuel valve at the end. Sometimes the valve is retained in the tanker drogue and prevents further refueling from that drogue until removed ready for the next sortie. With proper training of receiver pilots, this sort of event should be minimised.</p>
<p><a name="Hose_Drum_Units_.28HDUs.29" id="Hose_Drum_Units_.28HDUs.29"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerial_refueling.html" title="Edit section: Hose Drum Units (HDUs)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hose Drum Units (HDUs)</span></h3>
<p>Here, a long hose (flexible fuel pipe) connects the drogue to the unit in the tanker aircraft that is to supply the fuel, the Hose Drum Unit, HDU or "Hoodoo". The hose and drogue can be either reeled in completely to the HDU for transit flight, or "trailed" to the full length of the hose so that the receiver aircraft can approach to make a refueling "contact". After initial contact, when the hose and drogue is pushed forward by the receiver by a certain distance (typically, a few feet), the hose is reeled slowly back onto its drum in the HDU and the tanker's main refuelling valve opens to allow fuel to flow to the drogue under the appropriate pressure for air refueling. The hose is aerodynamically "balanced" so as to make it easier (even, possible) for the receiver aircraft. If the natural aerodynamic drag on the drogue was, for instance, 1000 units, unless something is done, the receiver aircraft would have to push forward on the drogue with this large force, the flexible hose would bend rather than reel in and the side-load would cause the refuelling valve at the end of the probe to break off. To avoid this, a motor in the HDU provides a balacing force to the aerodynamic drag of the drogue. If the drag force is 1000, the HDU balacing force might be 950, resulting in only a small forward force being needed from the probe after initial contact to reel in the hose and open the tanker's main refueling valve. In this situation, after initial contact, the velocity vector of the receiver carries it further towards the tanker, the hose slowly reels in to the HDU, the fuel valve opens and the receiver throttles so as not to get too close to the tanker.</p>

<p>Here a short hose is attached to a flying boom system and has a drogue on the end. In this system, the tanker boom operator (the "boomer") "flies" the boom into a position which experience has shown is optimal for the receiver aircraft. After the receiver pilot calls "contact" the boom operator starts the refueling. The receiver maintains his position during refueling, keeping an eye on the hose to make sure he remains in a suitable position. When fueling is complete, he slowly backs off until the probe refueling valve disconnects from the valve in the basket.</p>

<p>Some boom-carrying tankers have special hoses which can be attached before flight to the end of the boom to allow them to also refuel probe-equipped aircraft. Others boom-carrying tankers may have both a boom and one or more hose-and-drogue assemblies attached to the wing tips known as the Multi-Point Refueling System or MPRS.</p>

<p>The U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and other NATO nations use the probe and drogue system rather than the boom. Unlike the boom system, multiple aircraft can be refuelled simultaneously if more than one drogue unit is fitted to the tanker aircraft, typically by pods fitted under each wing. A centre-line HDU is also available and allows more fuel flow than wing pods. Drogue-equipped tankers can have up to three refueling points, centre-line and two on the wings.</p>
<p>The probe-and-drogue method allows aircraft not originally designed as tankers to be converted by attaching a refueling pod. The pod contains a drogue and hose reel. Where similar types of fighter ground-attack aircraft are pod-equipped (compared to large tansport aircraft) this is known as "buddy tanking" or "buddy-buddy" refueling.</p>
<p>This system was first used on late models of the <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-29_Superfortress_variants_fcfe.html#KB-29M" title="B-29 Superfortress variants">KB-29M Superfortress</a>. Its first use in combat occurred on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_29.html" title="May 29">May 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a> when twelve <a href="../../../f/-/8/F-84_Thunderjet_cdc0.html" title="F-84 Thunderjet">F-84s</a> were refueled during a mission from Itazuke, Japan to Sariwon, North Korea.</p>
<p>The incompatibility of probe-and drogue and flying boom refueling is a problem for military planners. This problem was experienced during the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_bc7b.html" title="Gulf War">Gulf War</a> of 1991, leading to consideration by the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAF_6999.html" title="USAF">USAF</a> of converting boom systems to probe-and-drogue. Advancements of the probe and drogue system now allow a fuel flow comparable to the boom method. In some cases, such as the KC-135FR in service with the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Air_Force_4968.html" title="French Air Force">French Air Force</a>, refueling-boom equipped tankers can be converted to an all probe-and-drogue system. The KC-135FR retains its articulated boom, but has a hose at the end of it instead of the usual nozzle.</p>

<p>In this method, similar to the probe and drogue method but more complicated, the tanker aircraft released a flexible hose from its wingtip. An aircraft, flying beside it, had to catch the hose with a special lock under its wingtip. After the hose was locked, and the connection was established, the fuel was pumped. It was used on a small number of Soviet <a href="../../../t/u/-/Tu-4.html" title="Tu-4">Tu-4</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/-/Tu-16.html" title="Tu-16">Tu-16</a> only (the tanker variant was Tu-16Z).</p>

The bombers would fly orbits around their assigned positions from which they were to enter Soviet airspace if they received the order, and the tankers would refill the bombers' fuel tanks so that they could keep a force in the air 24 hours a day, and still have enough fuel to reach their targets in the Soviet Union. This also ensured that a <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_strike.html" title="First strike">first strike</a> against the bombers' <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airfield.html" title="Airfield">airfields</a> could not obliterate the U.S.'s ability to retaliate by bomber.

<p>In the UK, Valiant tankers were operational from 1958 and had one HDU mounted in the bomb-bay. Valiant tankers were used to demonstrate radius of action by refueling a Valiant bomber non-stop from UK to Singapore in 1960 and a Vulcan bomber to Australia in 1961. Other UK exercises involving refueling involved Valiant tankers and Javelin and Lightning fighters. For instance, in 1962 a squadron of Javelin air defence aircraft was refueled in stages from the UK to India and back (exercise "Shiksha"). After the retirement of the Valiant in 1965, the Handley Page Victor took over the UK refueling role and had three hoses (HDUs). These were a fuselage-mounted HDU and a refuelling pod on each wing. The centre hose could refuel any probe-equipped aircraft, the wing pods could refuel the more manoeuverable flighter/ground attack types.</p>
<p>A byproduct of this development effort and the building of large numbers of tankers was that these tankers were also available to refuel <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cargo_aircraft.html" title="Cargo aircraft">cargo aircraft</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_aircraft.html" title="Fighter aircraft">fighter aircraft</a>, and <a href="../../../g/r/o/Ground_attack_aircraft.html" title="Ground attack aircraft">ground attack aircraft</a>, in addition to bombers, for ferrying to distant theaters of operations. This was much used during the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, when many aircraft could not have covered the transoceanic distances without aerial refueling, even with intermediate bases in <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> and <a href="../../../o/k/i/Okinawa.html" title="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>. In addition to allowing the transport of the aircraft themselves, the cargo aircraft could also carry <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mat%C3%A9riel.html" title="Matériel">matériel</a>, supplies, and personnel to <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> without landing to refuel. KC-135s were also frequently used for refueling of air combat missions from air bases in Thailand.</p>
<p>The USAF <a href="../../../s/r/-/SR-71_Blackbird_d4d3.html" title="SR-71 Blackbird">SR-71 Blackbird</a> strategic reconnaissance aircraft made frequent use of air-to-air refueling. Its home base was at <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beale_AFB_442d.html" title="Beale AFB">Beale AFB</a> in central California, but to make actual reconnaissance missions over enemy territory, it was necessary to deploy the craft to forward bases in Okinawa or in Europe. Hence, there were lots of trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic flights. Also, for safe <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeoff.html" title="Takeoff">takeoff</a> performance, it was necessary for the SR-71 to take off with less-than-full fuel tanks. The SR-71 would the rendezvous with a specially <a href="../../../k/c/-/KC-135_264c.html#modifications" title="KC-135">modified KC-135</a> to top up its tanks. Then the SR-71 was capable of flying for many hours on its own. This tanker variant was necessary because the SR-71 used a special fuel, <a href="../../../j/p/-/JP-7_00f7.html" title="JP-7">JP-7</a>, with a very high <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flash_point.html" title="Flash point">flash point</a> (needed to withstand the high skin temperatures of Mach 3+ cruising flight) which could not be used in other aircraft engines and the <a href="../../../k/c/-/KC-135_264c.html#modifications" title="KC-135">KC-135Q</a> was equipped with a separate internal bladder system to carry and deliver this non-standard fuel.</p>

<p>The capability of refueling after takeoff conveys two considerable tactical advantages to those forces with access to tankers. It allows attack aircraft, fighters, and bombers to reach distances they could not without refueling, and patrol aircraft to remain airborne longer. Additionally, since an aircraft's maximum takeoff weight is generally less than the maximum weight with which it can stay airborne, this allows an aircraft to take off with only a partial fuel load, and carry additional <a href="../../../p/a/y/Payload.html" title="Payload">payload</a> weight instead. Then, after reaching altitude, the aircraft's tanks can be topped up by a tanker, bringing it up to its maximum flight weight.</p>

<p>It was common for USAF fighter-bombers flying from Thailand to North Vietnam to refuel from KC-135s en-route to their target. Besides extending their range, this enabled the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-105.html" title="F-105">F-105s</a> and <a href="../../../f/-/4/F-4_Phantom_a9dc.html" title="F-4 Phantom">F-4 Phantoms</a> to carry more bombs and rockets. Tankers were also available for refueling on the way back if necessary. In addition to ferrying aircraft across the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ocean_bdb7.html" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, aerial refueling made it possible for battle damaged fighters, with heavily leaking fuel tanks, to hook up to the tankers and let the tanker feed its engine(s) until the point where they could glide to the base and land. This saved numerous aircraft.</p>
<p>The US Navy frequently used carrier-based aerial tankers like the <a href="../../../a/-/3/A-3_Skywarrior_4987.html" title="A-3 Skywarrior">KA-3 Skywarrior</a> to refuel Navy and Marine aircraft such as the F-4, A-4, A-6, and A-7. This was particularly useful when a pilot returning from an airstrike was having difficulty landing and was running low on jet fuel. This gave him fuel for more attempts at landing for a successful "trap" on an aircraft carrier. The KA-3 could also refuel fighters on extended Combat Air Patrol and E-2 Hawkeye Airborne Electronic Warning aircraft on extended patrol. USMC jets based in South Vietnam and Thailand also used USMC KC-130 Hercules transports for air-to-air refueling on missions.</p>

<p>Aerial refueling played a vital role in all of the Argentine successful attacks against the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>. The <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_Air_Force_091d.html" title="Argentine Air Force">Argentine Air Force</a> had only 2 KC-130H Hercules available and they were used to refuel both Air Force and Navy <a href="../../../a/-/4/A-4_Skyhawk_6839.html" title="A-4 Skyhawk">A-4 Skyhawks</a> and Navy <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Etendard_8b33.html" title="Super Etendard">Super Etendards</a> in their <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exocet.html" title="Exocet">Exocet</a> strikes, with the two models achieving almost all of the British ships sunk. The Hercules on several occasions approached the islands (where the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_Harrier_6456.html" title="Sea Harrier">Sea Harriers</a> were in patrol) to search and guide the A-4s in their returning flights. On one of those flights (callsign <i>Jaguar</i>) one of the KC-130s went to rescue a damaged A-4 and delivered 39,000 lb of fuel while carrying it to its airfield at <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_San_Juli%C3%A1n_eba3.html" title="Puerto San Julián">San Julian</a>. On the other hand, the <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirage_III_c59c.html" title="Mirage III">Mirage IIIs</a> and <a href="../../../i/a/i/IAI_Nesher_09ee.html" title="IAI Nesher">Daggers</a> lack of air refuelling capability prevented them from achieving better results. The Mirages were unable to reach the islands with a strike payload, and the Daggers could do so only for a 5 minute strike flight.</p>
<p>On the British side, air refueling was carried out by the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handley_Page_Victor_ec03.html" title="Handley Page Victor">Handley Page Victor</a> K.2 and after the Argentine surrender by modified C-130 Hercules tankers. These aircraft aided deployments from the UK to the <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension_Island_4d32.html" title="Ascension Island">Ascension Island</a> staging post in the Atlantic and further deployments south of bomber, transport and maritime patrol aircraft. The most famous refueling missions were the "<a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Black_Buck_e004.html" title="Operation Black Buck">Operation Black Buck</a>" sorties which involved 14 Victor tankers refueling single <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avro_Vulcan_142b.html" title="Avro Vulcan">Avro Vulcan</a> bombers to attack the Argentine-captured airfield at Port Stanley on the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falkland_Islands_2644.html" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a>. They attempted to knock out the Port Stanley runway, blocking the Argentine C-130 Hercules re-inforcement operations. The raids were the longest-range bombing raids in history until surpassed by the <a href="../../../b/-/5/B-52.html" title="B-52">B-52</a> in the 1991 <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_bc7b.html" title="Gulf War">Gulf War</a> and later <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-2_Spirit_9d58.html" title="B-2 Spirit">B-2</a> flights.</p>

F-14 Tomcats from the Red Sea and Persian Gulf await their turn refuelling from a KC-10A over Iraq during Desert Storm.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>During the time of Operation Desert Shield, the military build up to the Persian Gulf War, US Air Force KC-135s, McDonnell Douglas KC-10As, and USMC KC-130 Hercules aircraft were deployed to forward air bases in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diego_Garcia_76a2.html" title="Diego Garcia">Diego Garcia</a>, and Saudia Arabia. Aircraft stationed in Saudi Arabia normally maintained an orbit in the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq-Saudi_Arabia_neutral_zone_a57c.html" title="Iraq-Saudi Arabia neutral zone">Iraq-Saudi Arabia neutral zone</a>, informally known as "Frisbee", and refueled Coalition Aircraft whenever necessary. Two side by side tracks over central Saudi Arabia called "Prune" and "Raisin" featured 2-4 basket equipped KC-135 tankers each and were used by Navy aircraft from the Red Sea Battle Force. Large Navy strike groups from the Red Sea would send A-6 tankers to the Prune and Raisin tracks ahead of the strike aircraft arriving to top off and take up station to the right of the tankers thereby providing an additional tanking point. RAF <a href="../../../v/c/-/VC-10_5b15.html" title="VC-10">VC-10</a> tankers were also used to refuel coalition aircraft and were popular for their docile basket behavior and having three point refuelling stations. An additional track was maintained close to the northwest border for the EA-3 ELINT aircraft and any Navy aircraft needing emergency fuel. These 24-hour air-refueling zone helped make the intense air campaign during Operation Desert Storm possible. An additional 24/7 tanker presence was maintained over the Red Sea itself to refuel Navy F-14 Tomcats maintaining <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combat_Air_Patrol_36eb.html" title="Combat Air Patrol">Combat Air Patrol</a> tracks. During the last week of the conflict, KC-10 tankers moved inside Iraq to support barrier CAP missions set up to block Iraqi fighters from escaping to Iran.</p>
<p>On January 16-17 1991, the first combat sortie of Desert Storm, and the longest combat sortie in history, at that time, was launched from <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barksdale_AFB%2C_Louisiana_b4a1.html" title="Barksdale AFB, Louisiana">Barksdale AFB, Louisiana</a>. Seven B-52Gs flew a thirty-five hour mission to the Persian Gulf region, and back, to launch Boeing Air Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCMs) with the surprise use of conventional warheads. All of this was made possible by in-flight refueling, and by the secret switch away from nuclear warheads on the ALCMs.</p>
<p>An extremely useful aerial tanker in Desert Storm was the USAF KC-10A <i>Extender</i>. Besides being larger than the other tankers, the KC-10A is equipped with the USAF "boom" refueling and also the "probe-and-drogue" system. This makes it possible for the KC-10A to refuel USAF aircraft, and also USMC and US Navy jets that use the "probe-and-drogue" system, and also allied aircraft, such as those from the UK and Saudi Arabia. KC-135's may be equipped with a drogue depending on the mission profile.</p>
<p>The KC-10A was originally designed for the support of NATO in Europe by the USAF. In the case of armed conflict, with a full jet fuel load, the KC-10A is capable of flying from a base on the east coast of the US or Canada, flying nonstop to Europe, transferring a considerable amount of fuel in air-to-air refueling, and then returning to its home base, all without landing anywhere. This could have been very useful in the case when numerous European bases become disabled by Warsaw Pact strikes in Germany, Holland, France, and Great Britain.</p>

<p>In 2003 the U.S. Air Force and Far Technologies applied secretly for patents on mid-air rearming of aircraft. The technique proposed is similar in many respects to airborne refueling, with a number of notable modifications. The air borne rearming system is comprised of a rearming plane with an internal bomb storage area and loading device consisting of a large aft door and a modified remote-driven robotic arm (boom) equipped with a day-night camera as well as sensors. On the attack aircraft, a special pylon to receive the arms from the boom. At present financial and technological problems stand in the way of aerial rearming; mainly the need for an automatic system to perform the rearm currently under development for aerial refueling <a href="http://www.tfot.info/content/view/81/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tfot.info/content/view/81/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>A variation of aerial refueling is when a naval <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopter</a> approaches a warship (not necessarily suited for landing operations) and receives fuel through the cabin while hovering.</p>
<p>Note: Alternatively, some helicopters equipped with a probe extending out the front can be refueled from a drogue-equipped tanker aircraft in a similar manner to fixed-wing aircraft by matching a high forward speed for a helicopter to a slow speed for the fixed-wing tanker. Therefore a less ambiguous meaning for the abbreviation HIFR would be <b>HOVER</b> In-Flight Refueling.</p>
