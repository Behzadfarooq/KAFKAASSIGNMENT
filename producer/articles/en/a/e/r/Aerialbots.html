<p>The five Aerialbots are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../s/i/l/Silverbolt.html" title="Silverbolt">Silverbolt</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Concorde.html" title="Concorde">Concorde</a>)</i>&#160;: The leader. Afraid of heights. It was due to the fact he was built from a low-altitude transport, as opposed to the spacecraft his comrades were made from. Optimus Prime gave him command of the team so that his concern over the well-being of the others would take precedence over his irrational fear. As a result, it was a while before the others accepted him as their leader. Motto: <i>Don't look down, look straight ahead.</i> He was voiced by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Adler_4e27.html" title="Charlie Adler">Charlie Adler</a>.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Raid_%28Transformers%29_291a.html" title="Air Raid (Transformers)">Air Raid</a></b> (Air Rider in Japan) <i>(<a href="../../../f/-/1/F-15_Eagle_89ec.html" title="F-15 Eagle">F-15 Eagle</a>)</i>&#160;: The most impulsive member of the group, he likes to fight Decepticons right up close, Motto: <i>If you look first, you may not leap.</i>He was voiced by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Paulsen_4b63.html" title="Rob Paulsen">Rob Paulsen</a>.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../f/i/r/Fireflight_%28Transformers%29_f682.html" title="Fireflight (Transformers)">Fireflight</a></b> (Firebolt in Japan) <i>(<a href="../../../f/-/4/F-4_Phantom_II_3f6f.html" title="F-4 Phantom II">F-4 Phantom II</a>)</i>&#160;: A reckless flyer, pays no attention to the safety of others as he can get easily distracted by the vistas he sees below while in flight. Motto: <i>When I'm flying, no enemy is safe - nor friend.</i>He was voiced by Jeff MacKay.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../s/k/y/Skydive_%28Transformers%29_57c4.html" title="Skydive (Transformers)">Skydive</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../f/-/1/F-16_Fighting_Falcon_2462.html" title="F-16 Fighting Falcon">F-16 Fighting Falcon</a>)</i>&#160;: A <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theorist.html" title="Theorist">theorist</a>, would rather research and study battles than fight in them, though he is the fastest and most skilled flyer among the Aerialbots, and one of the most skilled flyers among all Transformers. Motto: <i>Only by studying the past can we win the present.</i>He was voiced by Laurie Faso.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../s/l/i/Slingshot_%28Transformers%29_8885.html" title="Slingshot (Transformers)">Slingshot</a></b> (Sling in Japan) <i>(<a href="../../../a/v/-/AV-8B_Harrier_II_6c5b.html" title="AV-8B Harrier II">AV-8B Harrier II</a>)</i>&#160;: A self-centered, loud-mouth <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braggart.html" title="Braggart">braggart</a> who likes to take credit for others' work. It's his way of compensating for his severe confidence problems.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerialbots.html" title="Edit section: Animated series">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Animated series</span></h3>
<p>They were created on <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybertron.html" title="Cybertron">Cybertron</a> around the same time as the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stunticon.html" title="Stunticon">Stunticons</a> as a countermeasure to the new Decepticon car team after the mainly land based Autobots proved woefully inadequate as a counter. Their first appearance came in the two-parter <i>Key to Vector Sigma, pts: 1 &amp; 2</i>. They were created to combat the Stunticons, after the latter had run rampant over the Autobot cars. To do this, <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> journeyed to Cybertron, with his troops rebuilding old planes and shuttles into the Aerialbots. <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Trion_e945.html" title="Alpha Trion">Alpha Trion</a> sacrificed himself, merging with <a href="../../../v/e/c/Vector_Sigma_6c1a.html" title="Vector Sigma">Vector Sigma</a> itself to give them life. On Earth, while the Aerialbots quickly proved themselves competent warriors, they also became overconfident and arrogant, with leader Silverbolt failing to keep them in line due to their fear of heights. After a heated discussion over whether they should stay with the Autobots, they battled the Stunticons as they tried to steal a device that could turn organic matter into metal. The two teams battled as Superion and <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menasor.html" title="Menasor">Menasor</a>. The Decepticon combiner gained the upper hand, but was eventually defeated when <a href="../../../o/m/e/Omega_Supreme_6360.html" title="Omega Supreme">Omega Supreme</a> intervened. Silverbolt conquered his fear of heights to keep <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatron.html" title="Megatron">Megatron</a> from escaping with the weapon.</p>
<p>The Aerialbots and Stunticons squared-off again, later in the episode <i>Cosmic Rust</i>, where Superion defeated Menasor in a Combiner v.s. Combiner rivalry. Later on, in the episode <i>War Dawn,</i> they were sent back in time 9 million years ago by the Decepticons in an attempt to lose the Aerialbots forever in the dawn of time. At first, they question the motives of the early Autobots. But after a series of events, and seeing Megatron's cruelty in the past, they witnessed death of a young Autobot named <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion_Pax_7707.html" title="Orion Pax">Orion Pax</a>, who was rebuilt by Alpha Trion as their leader, <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a>. They become convinced, and finally accept the ways of the Autobots. A subsequent appearance saw them battling the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combaticons.html" title="Combaticons">Combaticons</a>, and later their combined form of Bruticus, in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Although the Aerialbots did not appear in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Transformers%7E_The_Movie_6230.html" title="The Transformers: The Movie">The Transformers: The Movie</a></i>, they continued to put in regular appearances in the third season (unlike many of the season 1/2 cast, who were either killed in the Movie or phased out). In "Five Faces of Darkness", they arrived in a shuttle to save <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodimus_Prime_0745.html" title="Rodimus Prime">Rodimus Prime</a> and his group from the destruction of the planet <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quintessons.html" title="Quintessons">Quintessa</a>. They later went time-travelling once again, when they discovered a Quintesson time machine, and a young Autobot named A-3. Due to time distortions, Superion ended up battling alongside a second Superion, routing the Quintessons. It was then the truth was revealed - A-3 was a young <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Trion_e945.html" title="Alpha Trion">Alpha Trion</a>, and they had just won the first battle in the Transformer rebellion against their masters.</p>

<p>The Aerialbots had many other adventures, returning to the Middle East alongside Prime to investigate the schemes of <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octane_%28Transformers%29_60e5.html" title="Octane (Transformers)">Octane</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/y/Trypticon.html" title="Trypticon">Trypticon</a>, thwarting a Quintesson attempt to drive the Transformers into a blood rage using a special trnsmitter, going on a solo attack against Trypticon, and being infected by the <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_Plague_ceb1.html" title="Hate Plague">Hate Plague</a>. As a maddened Superion, they attempted to deny the resurrected Optimus Prime access to the centre of Cybertron, but were cured when Prime released the power of the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobot_Matrix_of_Leadership_caf8.html" title="Autobot Matrix of Leadership">Matrix</a>.</p>
<p>The Aerialbots were among those who reappeared in season 4, in the three part episode "The Rebirth". When the Decepticons once again invaded Cybertron, the Aerialbots were among those who tried to stop them, being driven off by <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorcon.html" title="Terrorcon">Abominus</a> initially. However, when they returned, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galvatron.html" title="Galvatron">Galvatron</a> ordered <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixshot.html" title="Sixshot">Sixshot</a> to take them out. He did so, using each of his alternate modes to take out the entire team. The Decepticons then scavenged their parts to construct a super engine to move the planet Cybertron.It is unknown if they survived or not.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerialbots.html" title="Edit section: Marvel Comics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marvel Comics</span></h3>
<p>The Aerialbots also appeared in the accompanying Transformers comic by Marvel, although they had a lesser role. They originally appeared in the UK Marvel Transformers comics in a very odd way - as part of a dream sequence. In previous stories, <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> had transferred part of the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobot_Matrix_of_Leadership_caf8.html" title="Autobot Matrix of Leadership">Matrix</a> to <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witwicky_family.html#Buster" title="Witwicky family">Buster Witwicky</a>. During a mission, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soundwave_%28Transformers%29_9a71.html" title="Soundwave (Transformers)">Soundwave</a> detected this and used one of <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insecticons.html" title="Insecticons">Bombshell</a>'s cerebro-shells to tap into his mind. Buster's vision showed the future of the Transformer race - the combiners. The Aerialbots and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protectobot.html" title="Protectobot">Protectobots</a> battled the Stunticons and Combaticons in their various combined modes with <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shockwave_%28Transformers%29_2cc4.html" title="Shockwave (Transformers)">Shockwave</a> and Prime looking on. This set the wheels in motion for more combiner teams on both sides.</p>
<p>They appeared in the main continuity in US issue #21, having been created by the power of the Matrix to replenish the recent Autobot losses on Earth. However, when the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insecticons.html" title="Insecticons">Insecticons</a> attacked a dam, the Aerialbots were dispatched to investigate, despite the fact that <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheeljack.html" title="Wheeljack">Wheeljack</a> had only completed Silverbolt's mind. They ended up battling <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirge_%28Transformers%29_4d50.html" title="Dirge (Transformers)">Dirge</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrust_%28Transformers%29_7750.html" title="Thrust (Transformers)">Thrust</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramjet_%28Transformers%29_de73.html" title="Ramjet (Transformers)">Ramjet</a>. While they emerged victorious after merging into Superion, Silverbolt forcibly disassembled them when they threatened a human under Megatron's control.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skids_%28Transformers%29_e209.html" title="Skids (Transformers)">Skids</a> was threatened by the newly created <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stunticon.html" title="Stunticon">Stunticons</a>, the Aerialbots arrived to save him, and the two teams battled in their combined modes. However, when the mentally unstable Tranformer hating <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_Breaker_%28Transformers%29_2b30.html" title="Circuit Breaker (Transformers)">Circuit Breaker</a> arrived, the Stunticons made it appear as if they were protecting Skids. Circuit Breaker attacked and disabled Superion, allowing Menasor to easily defeat him.</p>
<p>They were then captured by <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_Breaker_%28Transformers%29_2b30.html" title="Circuit Breaker (Transformers)">Circuit Breaker</a> and her <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapid_Anti-Robot_Attack_Team_ca18.html" title="Rapid Anti-Robot Attack Team">Rapid Anti-Robot Attack Team</a>, taken to her lab and then dissected After capturing the <strong class="selflink">Aerialbots</strong> she encountered a new problem - the Decepticon <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlechargers.html" title="Battlechargers">Battlechargers</a> <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runabout_%28Transformers%29_18bb.html" title="Runabout (Transformers)">Runabout</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runamuck_%28Transformers%29_6381.html" title="Runamuck (Transformers)">Runamuck</a> were causing mayhem across America. Using the parts from all the captured Autobots she created a giant Autobot with herself in control, striking a deal with them that if they would co-operate she would let them go. Circuit Breaker then used them to battle the two Decepticons, who were attacking the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statue_of_Liberty_c55e.html" title="Statue of Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>. After defeating the Decepticons with Circuit Breaker the Autobots were released.</p>
<p>The Aerialbots' appearances declined after this, as more new characters were introduced. They were amongst those who battled the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underbase.html" title="Underbase">Underbase</a> powered <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starscream.html" title="Starscream">Starscream</a>, and were deactivated by his power. They were later resurrected by <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimlock.html" title="Grimlock">Grimlock</a> using <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nucleon_%28Transformers%29_543c.html" title="Nucleon (Transformers)">Nucleon</a>, and fought against <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicron.html" title="Unicron">Unicron</a>, but were all killed again in <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bludgeon_%28Transformers%29_24df.html" title="Bludgeon (Transformers)">Bludgeon</a>'s ambush, only to be resurrected once more by Optimus Prime and the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Autobot_5061.html" title="Last Autobot">Last Autobot</a>. Thy reappeared in the <i><a href="../../../g/e/n/Transformers%7E_Generation_2_d770.html" title="Transformers: Generation 2">Transformers: Generation 2</a></i> comic, battling <a href="../../../j/h/i/Jhiaxus.html" title="Jhiaxus">Jhiaxus</a>' Gen 2 Decepticons in the air above the planet Ethos. Seemingly outnumbered and outgunned, they were saved when <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skywarp.html" title="Skywarp">Skywarp</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thundercracker.html" title="Thundercracker">Thundercracker</a> led a Decepticon aerial armada into the fray to bail them out - something they found humiliating in itself. They were again in action when Jhiaxus discovered their secret base. In the final battle against the <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swarm_%28Transformers%29_c0bc.html" title="Swarm (Transformers)">Swarm</a>, Slingshot was one of those consumed, dying alongside <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slag_%28Transformers%29_c657.html" title="Slag (Transformers)">Slag</a>. It is unknown if the other Aerialbots survived.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerialbots.html" title="Edit section: Dreamwave Productions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dreamwave Productions</span></h3>
<p>The Aerialbots had a very different origin in Dreamwave comics, being a group of Autobot jets from Cybertron. In the backstory established in <i>Transformers: the Ultimate Guide</i>, by <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Furman_383c.html" title="Simon Furman">Simon Furman</a>, they were part of an experiment to duplicate the combined form of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructicons.html" title="Constructicons">Devastator</a>. Later they came to Earth, refomatted into Earth-style forms.</p>
<p>Upon the awakening of Optimus Prime in Dreamwave's first Generation One mini-series, the Aerialbots were among the Autobots summoned by Optimus to rescue the remaining Autobots, who had been turned into mind-controlled weapons of mass destruction by a human arms dealer. During a subsequent battle with the Decepticons in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, the Aerialbots, merged as Superion, battled Devastator, but lost when the Decepticon <a href="../../../s/e/e/Seekers_%28Transformers%29_bef4.html" title="Seekers (Transformers)">Seekers</a>, hit their weak points, forcing them to separate. They then sacrificed themselves to stop an incoming nuclear missile, launched by rogue elements in the U.S. military to eradicate both factions of Cybertronians in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Later, it was revealed that parts of Superion, including his head, were recovered by the faction of the U.S. government that also recovered Devastator and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scourge_%28Transformers%29_a62e.html" title="Scourge (Transformers)">Scourge</a>, hinting that they were possibly trying to rebuild him.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerialbots.html" title="Edit section: Transformers/G.I Joe">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Transformers/G.I Joe</span></h4>
<p>The Aerialbots also made an appearance in Dreamwave's alternate reality G.I Joe/Transformers series, where they were reconfigured as World War 2 fighter planes. Superion was used as the spearhead of the combined Autobot/G.I Joe attack on the <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobra_Organization_9dbd.html" title="Cobra Organization">Cobra</a> Terrordrome, but was gunned down by <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shockwave_%28Transformers%29_2cc4.html" title="Shockwave (Transformers)">Shockwave</a>'s artillery cannon mode.</p>

<p>The Aerialbots were re-released in new colors for Generation 2. Additionally Air Raid was the name given to a new Autobot Cyber-Jet toy later in the line, seemingly the same character as the Aerialbot.</p>

<p>A group of five Autobot combiner jets formed a giant robot called Superion Maximus. Although they had different names in the US, their Japanese names were the same as the Generation One Aerialbots. Here, only the combined mode was shown to have any intelligence.</p>

<p>Originally Superion Maximus was one of the Guardians of the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energon_%28power_source%29.html" title="Energon (power source)">Super Energon</a> at Cybertron's core, alongside <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructicons.html" title="Constructicons">Constructicon Maximus</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combaticons.html" title="Combaticons">Bruticus Maximus</a>. However, they were then awoken by <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galvatron.html#Unicron_Trilogy" title="Galvatron">Galvatron</a>. While Superion refused to join him, Bruticus and Constructicon did, and he could only watch helplessly as they destroyed the one dormant combiner Guardian - his brother. Superion Maximus then joined the Autobots to battle Galvatron's forces. His end came in battle with Bruticus Maximus and Constructicon Maximus. Although he killed Constructicon Maximus, he was at the mercy of Bruticus - until the ghost of his dead brother appeared and distracted Bruticus. Superion Maximus then assumed the blown off limbs of Constructicon Maximus, and killed Bruticus Maximus. It is unclear if he survived the end of the series or not.</p>

<p>Characters named Air Raid, Fireflight, Skydive and Silverbolt all appeared as Autobots in the Transformers: Universe series, but no direct connection is made between them and the original Autobots bearing those names. Although Silverbolt is established to be the Silverbolt from Beast Wars and Beast Machines, the others received no biography and may or may not be the same characters. Air Raid in particular is a recolor of his Generation 2 Cyberjet mold, so he may be the same character.</p>
<p>A recolor of the Japanese exclusive Sixwing was released in Transformers: Universe, whose new name is Superion. Many of his component Micromaster Autobots are named after the Aerialbots, except for Slingshot. In addition two other Micromasters are named Storm Jet and Ro-Tor.</p>

<p>The Micro series of Transformers contains a repaint of Micro Jetfire painted red and named Fireflight. According to Hasbro sources at Botcon 2006 this toy was originally intended to be called <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powerglide_%28Transformers%29_5987.html" title="Powerglide (Transformers)">Powerglide</a>, but they can't get a trademark on that name.</p>
