<p>Zvi Kamil, an <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israeli</a> <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inventor.html" title="Inventor">inventor</a>, filed his UK patent application number 8600691 for a "telephone system" on 13 January 1986, claiming <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priority_right.html" title="Priority right">priority</a> from two previous Israeli patent applications filed on 13 January 1985 and 10 November 1985. The application related to a "special" <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone_exchange.html" title="Telephone exchange">telephone exchange</a>. A <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calling_party.html" title="Calling party">caller</a> has an account with the owner of that exchange and deposits a <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit_%28finance%29.html" title="Credit (finance)">credit</a> with him. The caller has a <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code.html" title="Code">code</a>. To make a call he calls the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phone_number.html" title="Phone number">number</a> of the special exchange and inputs his code and then the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Called_party.html" title="Called party">callee</a>'s number. If the code is verified and there is enough credit he is put through: the call will be terminated if his credit runs out.</p>
<p>The application was published as <a href="http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=GB2171877" class="external text" title="http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=GB2171877" rel="nofollow">GB&#160;patent application&#160;2171877</a> on 3 September 1986 and and the patent was granted with effect from 21 December 1988.

<p>Aerotel sued Telco Holdings Limited for patent infringement in February 2005 and Telco counterclaimed for revocation of the patent. The action started in the Patents County Court, but HHJ Fysh QC transferred it to the High Court in November 2005. In February 2006, Telco applied for summary judgment on its counterclaim, basing the application on the exclusion to patentability. This application succeeded before Lewison J who ordered revocation of the patent on 3 May 2006.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Macrossan's <a href="http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=GB2388937" class="external text" title="http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=GB2388937" rel="nofollow">GB&#160;patent application&#160;2388937</a> has a December 2000 priority date. It was for a new <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automated_method.html" title="Automated method">automated method</a> of acquiring the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Document.html" title="Document">documents</a> necessary to <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incorporation_%28business%29.html" title="Incorporation (business)">incorporate</a> a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Company.html" title="Company">company</a>. It involved a user sitting at a computer and communicating with a remote <a href="../../../s/e/r/Server.html" title="Server">server</a>, answering questions. By posing questions to the user in a number of stages, enough information was gleaned from the user's answers to produce the required documents. Questions posed in the second and subsequent stages were determined from previous answers provided and the user's answers were stored in a <a href="../../../d/a/t/Database.html" title="Database">database</a> structure. This process was repeated until the user had provided enough information to allow the documents legally required to create the corporate entity to be generated. A number of <a href="../../../d/o/c/Document_template.html" title="Document template">document templates</a> were also stored and the data processor was configured to merge at least one of these templates with the user's answers to generate the required legal documents. The documents could then be sent to the user in an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_document.html" title="Electronic document">electronic form</a> for the user to print out and submit, mailed to the user, or submitted to the appropriate <a href="../../../r/e/g/Registration_authority.html" title="Registration authority">registration authority</a> on behalf of the user.</p>
<p>The UK patent office did find that Macrossan's process was both novel and involved an <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inventive_step.html" title="Inventive step">inventive step</a>, but nonetheless rejected the application for a patent since the claimed subject matter was not <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patentable_subject_matter.html" title="Patentable subject matter">patentable subject matter</a> under <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_patents_under_United_Kingdom_patent_law_2930.html" title="Software patents under United Kingdom patent law">UK patent law</a>.<sup id="_ref-UKPO_Mac_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UKPO_Mac" title="">[7]</a></sup>. The UK patent examiner found that the claims related to a <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_method_patent.html" title="Business method patent">method for doing business</a> and a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_program.html" title="Computer program">computer program</a> as such.</p>
<p>Macrossan sought a review of the patent examiner's finding, by way of a hearing before a UKPO hearing officer - she held<sup id="_ref-UKPO_Mac_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UKPO_Mac" title="">[7]</a></sup> that the application related to a computer program as such, a method for doing business as such, and a method for performing a mental act as such, and thus was excluded from patentability on each of those three grounds.</p>

<p>Macrossan then appealed to the High Court. The High Court concurred in finding<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup> that the application related to a computer program as such, and to a method for performing a mental act as such and was unpatentable for each of those two reasons. However the High Court specifically overruled the UKPO hearing officer on one of the three grounds of exclusion, by holding<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup> that the application did not relate to a method of doing business as such.</p>

<p>The judgment approved a new four-step test to be used when assessing whether or not an application actually describes an invention. The four-step test is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Properly construe the claim;</li>
<li>Identify the actual contribution;</li>
<li>Ask whether the contribution falls solely within excluded subject matter; and</li>
<li>Check whether the contribution is technical in nature.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second step, that of identifying the contribution, was highlighted as being the most problematical since it may be difficult to determine what the contribution actually is.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerotel_v_Telco_and_Macrossan%27s_application_0674.html" title="Edit section: Aerotel v Telco">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aerotel v Telco</span></h3>
<p>Aerotel's patent was found to relate to a <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patentability.html" title="Patentability">patentable</a> <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invention.html" title="Invention">invention</a> in principle because the system as a whole was <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novelty_%28patent%29.html" title="Novelty (patent)">new</a> in itself, not merely because it is to be used for the business of selling phone calls. While this system could be implemented using conventional computers, the key to it was a new physical combination of hardware. The judge felt that this was clearly more than just a method of doing business as such. The method claims were construed as relating to a use of the new system and were also deemed to relate to a patentable invention in principle. The additional questions of whether the claimed invention was novel and <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness.html" title="Inventive step and non-obviousness">involved an inventive step</a> were not considered directly by the judge, although the implication is that the invention was at least novel.</p>

<p>In relation to Macrossan's patent application, it was held that the subject matter was unpatentable on the grounds of the computer program and business method exclusions. However in relation to the mental act exclusion, the Court of Appeal made no specific finding.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>In both cases, the judgment does not explain in detail how the contributions provided by the claimed inventions were identified and provides little guidance for how the second step of the test could be carried out in other cases.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[11]</a></sup> Instead, the reader is directed to the lengthy summary of past case law that is included as an Appendix to the judgment to understand the reasoning of the judges fully. Based on this summary of the case law, the judgment rejects the notion set out in the earlier judgment concerning <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_patents_under_United_Kingdom_patent_law_2930.html#Fujitsu.27s_Application" title="Software patents under United Kingdom patent law">Fujitsu's application</a> that the UK Courts should be guided by the case law of the EPO since the judges were of the opinion that EPO case law was too unsettled. The judgment proposes several questions to be put to the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_procedure_before_the_European_Patent_Office_7cb2.html" title="Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office">Enlarged Board of Appeal</a> in an effort to resolve the perceived conflicts between the different decisions of the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_procedure_before_the_European_Patent_Office_7cb2.html" title="Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office">Boards of Appeal</a>. In response to this, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alain_Pompidou_617a.html" title="Alain Pompidou">Alain Pompidou</a>, president of the EPO, wrote to Lord Justice Jacob to say that while clarification of certain issues relating to excluded subject matter would be welcomed, there were currently insufficient differences between relevant Board of Appeal decisions that would justify a referral. Instead, a referral would be appropriate if the approach taken by one Board of Appeal would lead to the grant of a patent whereas the approach taken by another Board would not.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The judgment briefly mentions<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[13]</a></sup> the <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agreement_on_Trade-Related_Aspects_of_Intellectual_Property_Rights_e060.html" title="Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights">TRIPS agreement</a> and the fact that its lack of a list of exclusions from patentability and its requirement that patents should be available in "all fields of technology" puts political pressure on Europe to remove or reduce the categories of non-inventions. However, Jacob had previously ruled<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[15]</a></sup> that TRIPS does not have direct effect on UK law and thus did not affect the case in question. Instead, cases relating to the exclusions from patentability must be decided by simply trying to make sense of the language of the EPC without bias for or against exclusion.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>Citing as reasons a clear divergence in reasoning between the UK courts and the European Patent Office, Neal Macrossan sought leave to appeal the refusal of his patent application to the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>.<sup id="_ref-Marks_Clerk_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marks_Clerk" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Register_2006_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Register_2006" title="">[18]</a></sup> Within the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_attorney.html" title="Patent attorney">patent profession</a> it was hoped that a ruling by the House of Lords would clarify the extent to which patent protection is available to computer-implemented inventions. The House of Lords had already tackled fundamental questions such as <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novelty_%28patent%29.html" title="Novelty (patent)">novelty</a><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[19]</a></sup>, <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness.html" title="Inventive step and non-obviousness">inventive step</a><sup id="_ref-MWE_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MWE" title="">[20]</a></sup>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claim_%28patent%29.html" title="Claim (patent)">claim construction</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufficiency_of_disclosure.html" title="Sufficiency of disclosure">sufficiency</a><sup id="_ref-Boult_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Boult" title="">[21]</a></sup> during 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p>The House of Lords refused leave to hear the appeal, citing the reason that the case "does not raise an arguable point of law of general public importance".<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-IP_Kitten_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IP_Kitten" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Register_2007_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Register_2007" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some patent attorneys have expressed surprise at this decision since, while the merits of Macrossan's case might have been arguable, it was felt that there are issues with the law that require resolving. Consequently, there is disappointment at this missed opportunity to better establish where the boundary lies between patentable and non-patentable software. The <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_a_Free_Information_Infrastructure_bc36.html" title="Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure">Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure</a> have expressed the view that the decision of the House of Lords confirms that the correctness of the Court of Appeal.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>

<p>The first judgment of the High Court<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[29]</a></sup> following the Aerotel/Macrossan judgment concerned two appeals filed from decisions of the UK Patent Office to refuse applications of Cappellini and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloomberg.html" title="Bloomberg">Bloomberg</a>. Taking the lead from Jacob LJ's approach of killing two birds with one stone in Aerotel/Macrossan, Pumfrey J decided that, since the decisions raised similar questions, it would be convenient to deliver a single judgment in respect of the legal issues, dealing with the facts relating to each case after considering the law.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>

<p>A European patent application, namely <a href="http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=EP1346304" class="external text" title="http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=EP1346304" rel="nofollow">EP&#160;patent application&#160;1346304</a>, in the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_family.html" title="Patent family">patent family</a> of patent application GB 2388937 filed by Macrossan, is currently pending at the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Patent_Organisation_46dd.html" title="European Patent Organisation">European Patent Office</a> (EPO).</p>
<p>On Monday <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_30.html" title="October 30">30 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (the first business day following the handing down of the Court of Appeal's judgment on Friday <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_27.html" title="October 27">27 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>), the Search Division of the EPO in charge of establishing a search report for the European patent application issued a declaration under <a href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/r45.html" class="external text" title="http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/r45.html" rel="nofollow">Rule 45</a> <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Patent_Convention_3d4a.html" title="European Patent Convention">EPC</a> that a search could not be established.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[31]</a></sup> The declaration indicates that the EPO search examiner is of the opinion that Macrossan's application contains nothing of technical merit, but only commonplace technical features (i.e. a computer) for implementing a business method. As a consequence, no meaningful search was considered to be possible.</p>
<p>Current <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_patents_under_the_European_Patent_Convention_0ffd.html" title="Software patents under the European Patent Convention">EPO practice when examining computer-implemented inventions</a> is that any technical feature in a claim, such as a computer, results in the finding that there is "an invention", but only those features which provide a technical solution to a technical problem (as opposed to a business problem) can contribute to an inventive step. In contrast to the UK Patent Office and courts, therefore, the EPO is unlikely to refuse the application as relating to a computer program or a method of doing business <i>as such</i> (<a href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/ar52.html" class="external text" title="http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/ar52.html" rel="nofollow">Article 52(2) and (3)</a> <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Patent_Convention_3d4a.html" title="European Patent Convention">EPC</a>), but will probably use reasoning relating to the question of whether the invention involves an <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness.html" title="Inventive step and non-obviousness">inventive step</a> (<a href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/ar56.html" class="external text" title="http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/ar56.html" rel="nofollow">Article 56</a> <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Patent_Convention_3d4a.html" title="European Patent Convention">EPC</a>).</p>
