<li>This article name is "Aerith Gainsborough". This is not a typo, nor is it incorrect.</li>
<li>Please do not change any name spellings - these changes have been made many times and have always been reverted. Please also be aware that when editing the template values it may affect the display of the images.</li>
<li>Any discussion on this should occur below. People are aware in FFVII English localisations Aerith's name is <i>Aeris</i> but it is policy on the English Wikipedia to use the official name, and Aeris was merely the official English name. Changes may occur dependant on the name spellings used in upcoming <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> sequels.</li>
<li>Be sure to read through the topics below, and if you want to ask a team of Final Fantasy editors, see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Final_Fantasy_af99.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Final Fantasy">Wikipedia:WikiProject Final Fantasy</a>.</li>

<p>Popular theory is that Aerith became a goddess of the planet in Advent Children. She was able to physically touch and interact with teh living children in Advent Children...and it is debated that she revived Cloud when he died. Though that would be sad is they killed Cloud like that. Just figured that should be added.</p>
<p>And just to let you know, since I keep seeing this whole "reviveal of Aerith stuff", Aerith was planned on being a summon once they decided to kill her off but that got cut due to time. Also, you can glitch the game and see Aeris speak to you in disk 3 at North Crater with no Tifa. She was originally meant to live but Nomura decided that he didn't like Aeris's design. So instead of just giving Aeris Tifa's design...he made an entirly new character and changed the plot....thus leading to many of these confusing plot points in the game.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um... any chance you have anything you can cite to back that up? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 00:27, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The glitch takes Action replay to use. And check some old interviews for the Nomura thing...although he changed his story to "honoring someone's momwho died during production" later. I doubt the old interviews are even around still. I'll check but I doubt I'll find anything (meaning chances of getting edit in...slim)</p>

<dd>We're referring to the same character in that section, thus, we use the same name for consistency, and in an attempt to avoid confusing the reader of the article. So unless you want to make the argument that the "Aeris" in Final Fantasy tactics is supposed to be an different character named "Aeris", rather than the same character... It just isn't going to happen. -- Rablari Dash 07:33, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
First off, she ISN'T the same character. This is factually indisputable. Tactics was an alternate timeline. It's debateable whether or not that's even the same 'cloud', but that is <i>certainly</i> not the same Aeris.<br />
It is another Aeris that happens to be a flower-girl. The whole point of the caption in the article there is that she resembles/mirrors the 'aerith' of FF7, but ISN'T her.<br />
"taken aback by her resemblance to the Aerith he knew. Aeris asks Cloud if she reminds him of someone, but he denies this and walks away." She isn't the same character; in the sense of being literally the same person. It's an absolute certainty that it's a different Aeris. (obviously an <i>identical</i> character, but they aren't one and the same)<br />
As such, Final Fantasy Tactics is the <i><b>only</b></i> reference available for that character. <i>Nothing</i> else that's being cited applies to her. Since there is only a single source of reference for that character's name in tactics, that is the name that will stay.<br />
Don't change it unless you can cite an example of her being called 'Aerith' <i>in Final Fantasy Tactics</i>.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to call people on calling her Aerith elsewhere, even though what they choose to call her now has zero relevance on what her name was in the game. (They could start calling her "Harold" in all future works; that wouldn't change the fact that her name was "Aeris" for FF7.) But frankly, I don't care. Valid or not, the name 'Aerith' is pretty common among people who actually still care, so that lends it a bit of credibility. However, there is only one source for the name of the character found in Final Fantasy Tactics. Calling her anything else is a fabrication or a whim. Give a citation for <i>that</i> character in <i>that</i> game, or drop it. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't played much of Tactics, and have never seen the scene in question, so I was not certain whether or not it referred to the exact same character. However, I'd say that it is also indisputable that the name of this character in the Japanese version of FFT is the same as the character in the Japanese version of FFVII. They characters themselves look the same, and are obviously supposed to essentially be the same character, though they're from alternate universes, and have different pasts, memories, etc. Much like "Aerith" and "Cloud" in Kingdom Hearts. They're still the same character, they're just placed in a different setting and story. This isn't that unheard of in Japan, unlike over in the western world.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think it should be obvious what the intentions of the writers were in this instance, and it should also be obvious what happened. Final Fantasy Tactics was translated and released by <b>Sony</b> in America only 5 months after the American release of Final Fantasy VII, which was also <i>translated and released by Sony</i>. It's not a matter of Square-Enix <i>changing</i> her name, which was, and always has been, "Aerith". Any proof that her name was originally "Aerith" and was miswritten by Sony as "Aeris" applies equally well to the incarnation of the character in FFT. Why would this character be named "Aeris"? I really doubt that the original Japanese writers intended for her to have a slightly different name than the character she resembles. For the Japanese audience, the two characters had identical names. Thus, they should also have identical names in the English versions. Her name has been written in roman characters in Japanese publications as "Aerith", and I imagine that any Japanese publications that mention her appearance in FFT spell it "Aerith". If someone has a copy of the Japanese FFT strategy guide and could scan the relevant page for us, that would probably settle the debate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm still rather boggled how anyone can insist that <b>Sony's</b> translation is somehow more official than all the media printed by Square-Enix. Americans were first introduced to the character as "Aeris", but first impressions aren't always right. And correcting a mistake made by a third party isn't the same as changing your mind.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I've left your edits for the time being. I don't want to start another revert war over this. Ok, time to take a step back, and breathe. And then attack the metadebate, which means laying our cards out on the table, trying to understand each others' positions, and resolve concerns, rather than staking out positions and attacking each other. Sheesh, that's what I usually do in an argument: address the reasons the person is making the argument, instead of butting heads from the limited viewpoint of being in the argument. Well, now I know what it is to be embroiled in one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, here's my honest position. I'm not a big fan of Final Fantasy VII, or even the Final Fantasy series in general. I've usually preferred Square's other titles, and have always been irritated by how much some people obsess over the Final Fantasy series, how "RPG" and "Final Fantasy" are synonymous to so many people. Or how some of the fans insist that every installment of the series is automatically better than every other game in the world. I didn't play and obsess over FFVII when it came out. I don't have this emotional attachment to the characters. I think that a lot of the people who argue that Aerith's name is spelled "Aeris" are either eurocentric and believe that only the English version matters, or they're just so attached to their personal experience of the game, attached to the character, and emotionally attached to the spelling "Aeris". I don't find either of these to be strong positions. Which is why people don't argue from them. They make up other reasoning, but hide their true reasons, because they realise that their selfish, personal reasons wouldn't stand up to scrutiny. Or maybe they don't even realise that's why they hold the position they do. Neither of those are typically conscious things.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's how I see the situation. Maybe I'm wrong. If I am, I'd like someone to correct me on it. Now, here's why I care that her name is spelled "Aerith" and not "Aeris": respect for the creators of the character. Were someone to translate my works into another language, and change the names of my characters, I would be offended if someone insisted that the names I have chosen for my own characters are somehow "wrong" or "less official" than the names created by the foreign publishing company. So for me, it's a simple application of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethic_of_reciprocity.html" title="Ethic of reciprocity">The Golden Rule</a>. I would want people to respect my decisions about my characters, and therefore I feel that I should respect other people's decisions about their characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnocentricity.html" title="Ethnocentricity">ethnocentricity</a> really bothers me, so I try to fight it wherever I see it. People believing that somehow their culture is absolutely superior to all other cultures tends to prevent them from learning from other cultures, and also prevents them from seeing anything rotten within their own culture. It frustrates human evolution, which already frustrates me with its lethargic pace.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So that's it. In summary, I don't personally care about the name of this character. I care about how the works of any artist are treated, and I care about correcting obnoxious attitudes towards other cultures. Most of the arguments about Aerith's name, or a number of other similar arguments about translations of Japanese media, pretty much sound to me like "Just gimme the game and shut up, you stupid jap!". I know that's an exageration, but there's just so much disrespect for the creators of things people love. -- <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERablari_Dash_6f98.html" title="User:Rablari Dash">Rablari Dash</a> 20:09, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It stems from familiarity, in some cases. So you shouldn't take it so hard. Sometimes it is as you said, and I've seen that too. Personally, I call her "Aeris" because it's what I'm familiar with. The 100 + hours I've sunk into FF7 hasn't been succesfully overwritten in my heart and mind by two KH cameos and one FF7-inspired movie. However, I do support Aerith. I mean, go to the DBZ article for Freeza and write "Frieza" (and then state that "this is English wiki" as your reason) and see how long that edit holds up. Wikipedia should uphold the original intentions and most accurate information. Translated or dubbed names must be noted, but the main name should be the one given by the creators, not a localization team. <a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a></dd>

<dd>I'm not sure if you're talking about in general, or specifically for FFT. (the comment was under the FFT section) So, I'll address it either way.&#160;:) If you mean for FFT, then there isn't actually any material for what to call her in FFT other than the game itself. Conclusions made about her FF7 name might logically be tempting to apply to FFT, but that's really stretching the reasoning. There's only <i>one</i> source of material for the unique character found solely in FFT, and that said Aeris, so that's the name of the flower girl in FFT, even if it's a bit inconsistent or unwieldly for the article.</dd>
<dd>However, I'm guessing that you were talking about in general. First off, I should like to point out that mentioning DBZ is actually a good idea... but it speaks against your case. There were different, rather inconsistent, names for the characters in it. In one case, where the androids are scanning the protagonists, you actually see Piccolo identified as 'Piccoro', spelled out clear as day. However, his name is still listed as Piccolo, because that's what his name is known as in English. Furthermore, while although I am loathed to cite wikipedia when discussing what should be done in wikipedia (the practice should generally be avoided, as it tends to propagate errors), there's an alternate reason provided for listing Frieza as "Freeza". The translations of the <i>manga</i>, which are considered to be a more reliable canon than the anime, list him as Freeza. That is to say, since the show is less canon than the manga, it cannot override something established in it. In this case, that means he gets listed as "Freeza", as weird as that spelling looks to me.</dd>
<dd>Now, the core 'canon' in this case really should be considered to be FF7 itself. There is only one english version of the original game. It's been re-released, including a computer port. The spelling is always Aeris. Thus, as far as 'canon' is concerned, her 'real' english name is 'Aeris'. Kingdom Hearts is immaterial and unreferencable, as it isn't Canon. It doesn't even qualify as a what-if. Even Advent Children, and other media centred around the original timeline/story, don't count. Because they don't change what her name WAS. If Aeris were a real person, then yes, she could be renamed. The best that you could say is that her name was Aeris in FF7, and Aerith in Advent Children. But nothing will change what her name was in FF7. If they follow through with a re-release on the PSP, or a remake on the PS3, <i>and</i> change her name to Aerith, then there might be room for discussion. However, until that time, there is absolutely no question that, in Final Fantasy VII, the Playstation Game, her english name was Aeris.</dd>
<dd>That said, I still don't really care how she's listed in general in the article. The second criteria for deciding how to list characters' names is how they are "best known". And this is why I prefer listing Teknoman as "Tekkaman Blade" in the appropriate article. His english name was Teknoman, but to anyone who still remembers/cares about the series, he is <b>best known</b> as Tekkaman Blade. Similarly, though I can't cite evidence to the effect, I suspect that most people who still <i>care</i> about FF7 tend to call her Aerith. Certainly, nearly every single forum, fansite, web reference, etc, I've ever seen have listed her as Aerith. And <i>that</i> is why I can accept her being listed as Aerith in general. Because there's precedent set for listing characters as they're most commonly known. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 15:21, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd just like to point out that more copies of titles translated into English that used "Aerith" have been sold than the two games that incorrectly used "Aeris" — and all have been sold in the last four years, which is certainly more recent than 1997. "Aerith" has had more English exposure than "Aeris", so is the more recognizable, especially with all English video game publications using that spelling. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 14:30, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Really, the spellings "Aeris" and "Lockheart" are only used <i>at all</i> in media pertaining to the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII.—<a href="../../../u/r/u/User%7EUrutapu_0994.html" title="User:Urutapu">ウルタプ</a> 14:45, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Well, that's why I'm confused. "Aeris" isn't used at all in any of the Compilation material. Like at all. Ever. Not even in any of the English stuff. For that matter, I don't think "Lockheart" is either. These romanizations were only used in materials put out by third parties years ago. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 12:56, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I can somewhat see Bladestorm's point, after reading that above response. Basically the question is original name vs. US name. For US name the criteria seems to be subjective. We have Aeris as the official name in the game she was from and the highest source of canon on her, Aerith in the spin-off movie. I don't think FF Tactics OR Kingdom Hearts should be cited for either case, as both are AU's of the character and not canon. Tho in the case of judging FFT on it's own, the debate is the same. If we go by official US name, then she was named Aeris. I don't have access to a Japanese copy of the game, but I'd bet money that the characters used in her name are exactly the same as those used in FF7 and that she's meant to have the same name (in which case if consensus is to use original names, a case could be made for Aerith there too.</dd>
<dd>Oh, and on the DBZ names, the consensus on those articles hasn't been strictly manga. Example- we Use Majin Buu, not Djinn Boo. We use Pui Pui, not Pocus. We use Vegetto, not Vegerot. The general consensus has been to go with official romanizations of the original names. To address Piccoro, that's the lack of "l" that we should all be familiar with. However his name is officially Piccolo (he and all his henchmen in his first saga are named after musical instruments.) That's why Furiza comes out Freeza (I don't feel like going into the phonetics, but I basically just wrote the same thing twice, also pun on Freezer, and "ie" doesn't make a long "e" in either language and is essentially a dub typo). We use Coola (Kura, pun on word Cooler) instead of Cooler. You get the idea. In all cases the dub name (and viz manga name if applicable) are mentioned as well, but we generally use originals. There are some exceptions, like Hercule being so wide spread amongst English fans and being used in both the US manga and anime that it's used out of familiarity.</dd>
<dd>To bring this back home, if the naming here became familiarity , I don't think Kingdom Hearts should supercede FF7. Two mini-cameos in a what-if game series, So then it would basically be FF7 vs Advent Children. I don't even think they say her name in AC, but it is Aerith in the credits.<a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a>
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't make sense to look to what is or isn't <i>FFVII</i> canon to decide this. That's taking an in-universe perspective to analyze an inherently out-of-universe matter. While the character isn't the same person in terms of story, it's the same character in terms of design and name. We couldn't even call it a cameo if it wasn't the same character on some level.</dd>

<dd>Going by familiarity, we've got four titles that have been released in English markets with the use of "Aerith", all in the last few years, as opposed to two titles released 9 years ago that incorrectly used "Aeris". Furthermore, those four titles using "Aerith" have sold more English copies combined than the other two titles, meaning "Aerith" has had more exposure <i>and</i> is more recent. There's also more titles coming that will be using "Aerith". Added to that the fact that video game publications, strategy guides for the games involved, etc. use "Aerith" and it's undeniable which of the two is most familiar. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyu_Kaze_5759.html" title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 13:04, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you wanted to really stop the argument you could simply put her name as Aerith/Aeris Gainsborough. Or simply add a line after Aerith Gainsborough that stated "Aeris and Aerith can be used interchangeably". I am an enormous supporter of using the character names given in games to describe the character -in that game-. Frankly anyone who wishes otherwise has some sort of alternate purpose behind doing so. If someone bought Final Fantasy 7 today and came to this article they would (correctly) tell someone it was wrong. The quotes have been altered to use the word Aerith (which they obviously didin't have), and the plot summary for a game with a character called Aeris describes the actions of a nonexistent character named Aerith. The fact is people that this is an encyclopedia, and you have to treat it as one. Your feelings about ethnocentricity, or creative control, or japanese culture don't enter in to it. This is an Encyclopedia. And if however you feel about any subject causes you to distribute incorrect information then you are doing wikipedia a disservice. The Character should be refer to by the title she was given game by game. In Final Fantasy and Tactics she was called Aeris, so we will call her Aeris. In any other game she was called Aerith, so we will call her Aerith. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.117.246.184_538d.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.117.246.184">63.117.246.184</a> (<a href="../../../6/3/2E/User_talk%7E63.117.246.184.html" title="User talk:63.117.246.184">talk</a>) 08:54, 10 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>You know, I think the confusion stemmed from the Reminisence of Final Fantasy VII, which used the song during the ending scene (where World Crisis plays during the actual game). Nevertheless, End Credits and Aerith's Theme are two totally different songs, so am I confused about something? Because that's the only song that plays during the credits of the movie. In fact, I think that's the song that you can play on Tifa's piano in the game, is it not? Chibi Gohan 23:00, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Never mind that. I managed to listen to the song and found that a portion of the song is indeed played during the ending credits. I thought the above quote was implying that the entire theme was played during the credits (like how most movies have an assortment of songs during their credits instead of one).

<p>Yes, the Final Fantasy Tactics section needs to be seriously re-written, because the flower girl in question was not Aeris, but merely a flower girl who looks like Aeris. There is no place in the game where the flower girl is named Aeris, her name is simply Flower Girl. There is no debate between whether it's properly 'Aeris' or 'Aerith' here, as she was called neither in the game. She was a wholly different person who simply resembled Aeris.

<dl>
<dd>Whether or not it's a coincidence, we don't know. However, considering that Final Fantasy Tactics was released a little after FFVII came out and Square-Enix didn't have to worry about extremely rabid fans, I think it's safe to assume it's Aerith the way Aerith was in the KH series. It's not the same Aerith in FFVII, but it's still Aerith — just in an alternative universe. —<b><a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirlen_c835.html" title="User:Mirlen"><font color="coral">Mir</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirlen_289b.html" title="User talk:Mirlen"><font color="darkorange"><span style="cursor:help">l</span></font></a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirlen_EA_ae3a.html" title="User:Mirlen/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirlen_289b.html" title="User talk:Mirlen"><font color="darkorange"><span style="cursor:help">n</span></font></a></b> 21:54, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You're referring to Protofox's revert, correct? That question is best to be directed to the user himself, and I see no reason to attack Aerith's article which contains perfectly legimitate information because someone made an edit you didn't like an another article. If you have comments regarding information in Tifa's article, please address it there and keep this article out of it. However, I will assume good faith according to Wikipedia's policy and refrain from further comments (unless necessary) on that subject.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's important to note that characteristics doesn't have to be limited to a character's personality. (The only reason why the characteristics section is limited to her personality is because no one has taken the liberty to add other qualities of Aerith in, or perhaps somebody has not seen the need to, since that particular information is dispersed throughout the article.) According to the <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/characteristic" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/characteristic" rel="nofollow">Merriam-Webster's Dictionary</a>, a characteristic can be "a distinguishing trait, quality, or property." This means that a characteristic can also apply to the character's design, appearances, etc., which brings me to my next point.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If a character's personality is "fairly obvious" and therefore not worthy of mention, then wouldn't the same idea apply to a character's design, as that is a part of a character's <b>characteristics</b>.

Even a reader who has no idea of FFVII would be able to tell that she has, to quote an excerpt of the sentence you inserted, "black hair, red eyes, and (of course) large breasts" just by looking at Tifa's image placed in the infobox.</dd>

<dd>Aerith's personality may be obvious to those who've played the game; however, this article isn't for gamers who are familiar with the game. Wikipedia is a <i>general interest</i> encyclopedia.

<p>"I know this is kind of a silly question, but how do you pronounce Aerith? If you know please write it under my question."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Aerith is pronounced the same way you pronounce Aeris - "Air-iss".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Aerith is pronounced as you see it, as something of a fusion of the words "air" and "with" (albeit without the "w-"). The Japanese pronunciation has an "s" sound at the end due to their language lacking a character for a "-th" sound (similar to their lack of "v" being replaced by "b"). Given that her name, when written in Japanese, is written with a character set used for words of non-Japanese origin, the "-th" is implied to be the most correct pronunciation. (T.J.

<p>I remember reading this sometime in the game that the people that Sephiroth kills with his sword stay dead...forever. I'm not sure if this is accurate... I also read on some walkthrough that the way you react to certain characters during the game give them relationship points and determine what happens in parts of the game, such as the gold saucer event where Cloud and someone(who is determined by the points) go to the play. Another part of the game is where Aeris gets killed. If you do the reactions correctly during the first portion of the game, where you care more about Aeris more than Tifa, supposedly Tifa was to jump in front of Aeris right before she is supposed to die so Tifa gets killed instead. I also don't know if this is accurate. The game just takes so long to play and I am just to lazy to find out myself. Hopefully, someone will come to my rescue. Ippy 21:04, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm confused as to why there's such a distinct and adamant position about the spelling "Aerith." I don't know where you people learned Japanese from, but "th" does NOT exist in Japanese. The spelling of her name was supposed to be "Aeris" because she was supposed to be the "HEIRESS" of the Earth. Now, if you're going to argue that "Aerith" is pronounced the same way as "Aeris," that's an entirely moot point and it is better to spell it "Aeris" because romanticization of a lot of names can be changed around. In any case, I'd like a citation if you honestly believe that "Aerith" is the proper spelling.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.57.197.163 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.57.197.163_db2f.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.57.197.163">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>"Aerith" is the correct spelling and its pronunciation under English (and many other languages') mechanics is the most correct pronunciation. Most, if not all, <i>Final Fantasy</i> main characters not only have names derived from non-Japanese sources, but are all spelled in Latin/Roman characters (I say this due to names like "Cait Sith", which is spelled in Scottish Gaelic). If official Square Enix sites aren't enough proof, all <i>FF</i> instruction manuals have the characters' names in Latin/Roman characters with their Japanese spellings (usually in the for-foreign-words katakana) underneath. Since the katakana replacement for "th" sounds at the end of words is "-su", that is where Aerith's "alternate" name originates (despite it appearing in Latin/Roman characters in the Japanese-riddled "developer's room", accessable via a game hacking device).

<dd>I agree that the characters name should be written as Aeris in the articles derived from games where she was referred to as Aeris. Proper japanese translation or not, Aeris was how the characters name was written in the Final Fantasy 7 game that our country recieved, and as such any article discussing the character, plot importance, or actions taken within that game should use the title given to her -in that game-. It would take a simple preface at the top of the Aerith Gainsborough article stating that "Aerith, is alternatively spelled Aeris" and then the character would be referred to as she was properly titled game by game. There wouldn't be anyone coming to the article and getting confused because they aren't in on the current japan-hype, the "quotes" from the game wouldn't have to be incorrectly altered to contain a name they didn't have, and there wouldn't be anymore incorrect changes to the article from people who simply believe it incorrect. All in all it is the simplest solution to a rather far reaching problem.

<dd>Once Crisis Core is released in the US, UK and other English speaking countries, if Aeris' (I <b>refuse</b> to call her Aerith) name is said with an S as opposed to a TH, then I believe the wiki article should be changed accordingly. Although as I'm sure others noticed, her name is never mentioned in Advent Children, most likely because Square can't decide what it really should be. Nevertheless, if in Crisis Core it is pronounced with TH instead of S, then I stand corrected and will cease my argument. - Adzma 08:54, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By all technicalities, the truest official names are Cloud, Sephiroth, and Aerith. Furthermore, some other official names are Frioniel (Firion), Leonhart (Leon), Gilbert (Edward), Cain (Kain), Tella (Tellah), Tina (Terra), Lock (Locke), Mash (Sabin), Cayenne (Cyan), Stragus (Strago), and Lockhart (Lockheart). However, all but the last of that string were changed for character spacing reasons, except for Terra and Sabin, which were 'cosmetic'. Because of <i>FINAL FANTASY</i>'s primarily non-Japanese name sources, character names are most typically written in Latin/Roman-charactered languages (I say this for names like Rosa and Cait Sith, which are Spanish/Italian and Scottish Gaelix, respectively), with moonspeak variants seen in-game (typically in the for-non-native-words katakana system) conjoined. This is why you always hear Aerith's name said with the "s" noise over there rather than as truely intended. One might say that that's still only 'their' official naming, but with the release of <i>Advent Children</i>, "Lockheart" and "Aeris" have been ordained for ruin, to put it dramatically. I still insist, though, that since the only official English quote sources we have (the PS1 and PC versions) refer to her as "Aeris", the quotes taken from said games should credit the character by that default. Once (and we all know it's gonna come eventually) we get an English re-release, we can then replace the current quotes with the updated ones, replace the 'olde name' for good. T.J.

Seeing as the newer installments of the compilation almost never actually mention Aerith's name, I guess it's not too necessary to retcon and "Aeris" is already so well-established over here… (and you know that site's all the way back from FFVII's NA release?

<dd>I have never played the other games - so you are saying she is called Aerith in KH, and other FF7 extensions, and only referred to as "Aeris" in FF7 itself? Why then is the intro "is a female protagonist of the role playing game Final Fantasy VII"? The intro makes it seem as though Aeris' character's main role is in FF7, and not KH or other games... this would strike me as reason for either changing the intro, or using Aeris rather than Aerith. Also someone gave 'proof' that her name was Aerith by showing an advert/poster of her name spelt Aerith. I fail to see how this is adequate in choosing a name, seeing as how for every "aerith" advert there is also an "aeris" advert (as well as on the official website) Regardless of whether they have updated it or not, the spelling on the software company's website is "Aeris". However, if in the majority of other games she is referred to as "aerith" I will concede as long as the introduction is necessarily changed. <a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDashboardy_1d5c.html" title="User:Dashboardy">Dashboardy</a> 04:50, 5 February 2007 (UTC) Dashboardy

<dd>Maybe we should just make a note somewhere on the page about her name being different in certain installments? It doesn't seem like that big a deal to me--it's obviously Aerith because Aerith has now been used twice or three times as many as Aeris, and more recently. Aeris is relevant to FFVII the game. Anything else is Aerith, or at least from what I've seen. Make a note of it, and leave it 'Aerith' or 'Aeris' in the respective places. At least that's my opinion.

<p>I know that the accepted official name of the character as a whole is "Aerith", but when using quotes taken from a specific version of the game (in this case, presumably the North American PC version), shouldn't we use the default names given in said version?

<p>The above is the correct name of the short story included with FF7:AC. Note that "who" is NOT capitalized. This is significant because the Feb 7 edit of the article to capitalize all instances of "who" broke links in other articles, notably the one on the main Final Fantasy 7 page. I'd revert the changes myself and also upload a picture of the story's "logo", but new members cannot edit this article. Just thought I'd note the problem here so someone with access privileges can make the change. Xeno8 15:29, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh. Despite it prbably staying as this, I've had trouble in the "Weird Al" pages when it comes to his tracks names, which all (save "eBay") have capitalized first letters of all words therein. According to the "rules" of Wikipedia, artistic license be damned in light of capitalizing that "who". T.J. Fuller, Jr. 08:58, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I read Vol 2 of the KH Manga, and it shows that Leon hates her lemonade because she puts salt in it (Leon quote: "I'd drink it..If only Areith would stop putting salt in it."</p>

<p>"People are aware in FFVII English localisations Aerith's name is Aeris but it is policy on the English Wikipedia to use the official name, and Aeris was merely the official English name."</p>
<p>I'm wondering why the following articles don't follow the mentioned policy:</p>
<ul>

<p>Could it be due to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions" rel="nofollow">Naming conventions</a>?

TO CLEAR THIS UP (This is for other editors who are misusing that quote, as well): Aeris was the FIRST official English name. It has been <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retconned</a> in later media (including Advent Children, and so on) as Aerith. Aerith is the official name now. Yes, many people will only know the Aeris name, but Wikipedia should be accurate, and the precise name is Aerith now. Any more questions? <a href="../../../n/i/q/User%7ENique1287_dbc7.html" title="User:Nique1287">Nique</a> <small><a href="../../../n/i/q/User_talk%7ENique1287_b03c.html" title="User talk:Nique1287">talk</a></small> 12:39, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That doesn't clear things up as much as you think. Aerith is the official spelling <i>for new works</i>. This may include the general 'ff7 universe' that they've been extending. However, within the context of the original FF7, 'Aeris' is the one and only official english spelling for the name. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 13:57, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not really. The one and only official name is now Aerith. Yes, the original game itself still says, and will always say (since you can't go into the discs and edit it), Aeris, but that doesn't mean it's correct. <a href="../../../n/i/q/User%7ENique1287_dbc7.html" title="User:Nique1287">Nique</a> <small><a href="../../../n/i/q/User_talk%7ENique1287_b03c.html" title="User talk:Nique1287">talk</a></small> 18:09, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Show me where in Advent Children is the name "Aerith" mentioned, and I doubt Kingdom Hearts is considered <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>. I also don't think that using an unreleased/untranslated game as a source counts as proof of "Aerith" being the original name. <small>Unregistered (76.21.27.63) (talk) 09:15, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Actually, if you got your hands on the English boxed set, the script included lists <b>Aerith</b>, not Aeris. The name may not be mentioned in the movie specifically, but it was changed. Anyone else with the boxed set can confirm this, as well. Also, Kingdom Hearts may not be canon to the storyline, but the names are. All recent media released have listed Aerith, not Aeris, which means that Aerith is now her official name. <a href="../../../n/i/q/User%7ENique1287_dbc7.html" title="User:Nique1287">Nique</a> <small><a href="../../../n/i/q/User_talk%7ENique1287_b03c.html" title="User talk:Nique1287">talk</a></small> 14:03, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Additionally, the English voice actor and the credits (both English and Japanese) for Advent Children say "Aerith."
