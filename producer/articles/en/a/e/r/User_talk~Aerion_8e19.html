<p>Before making edits to pages like Ohio Wesleyan please make edits on the talk page. Thanks.</p>
<p>Highly selective is not POV. This is a fact. Consult Barron's, Fiske and Pope's guides. Okay? Then, it becomes a fact.</p>
<p>-Ranamim</p>
<p>Asbestos is a user with a long history of editing or personal jealosy for Ohio Wesleyan's pages. Therefore, he makes edits that are more or less trivial. He has never made any constructive and meaningul edit to Ohio Wesleyan pages. I do not regret any remarks that I've made about his because him and Jmabel and simply stupid. I rarely allow myself to qualify people in this despite the fact that I am a PhD student in an Ivy institution but these two simply have no respect for formal logic. They must have been raised in a bard on educated in a poor manner. However, asbestos does make edits that I have to revert back.</p>
<p>Highly selective is not POV. In the context of schools. No matter how you look at it, it is a fact, not a statement to attract attention. Nothing to argue here if you have 100 references to support a claim which is a fact.</p>
<p>--Ranamim</p>
<p>If you want me to stop posting on your page, then stop making edits that make no sense or at in this case when you are unfamiliar with Asbestos history. Thanks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, come on. I saw an edit that appeared to be POV. I saw in the history that somebody agreed with me. I changed it. I was trying to be helpful. You, in the meantime, are making personal attacks on people, which tends to make you lose credibility in my book. <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerion_926e.html" title="User:Aerion">Aerion</a> 02:38, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The personal attack is not an attack. It is outrage at the logic of someone who consistently complains about should be trivialities. Shouldn't that be a reason enough to lose credibility in someone? In addition, this guy Asbestos simply can not argue his case. If you are not outraged at someone's inability to argue a case with solid logic and yet obstinate about making changes, how would you react??</p>
<p>-Ranamim</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would react much the same way I am reacting to you, as in my eye you are exactly what you have described: someone with "inability to argue a case with solid logic and yet obstinate about making changes." Please be willing to compromise - I haven't seen you do anything yet except insult those who disagree with you. <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerion_926e.html" title="User:Aerion">Aerion</a> 04:48, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, because it does NOT make sense. I concede in cases when I am wrong but the cases with Asbestos and Jmabel over Wesleyan and now over this triviality are not only stupid but pretty deliberate if you ask me. Asbestos does not delete comments (as a matter of fact why don't you do it?) like "making it one of the most selective colleges in the US" on the page of his own alma mater, CT's Wesleyan. Yet, he feels comfortable making edits to Ohio Wesleyan's page? Why? What's the difference? Are we arguing over which college deserves it more? Well, that's debatable and then a reference to a publication that settles should do. If it is about the fact that it is POV, then there is absolutely no difference or is there?</p>
<p>As for your comment about me arguing my cases...what purpose do you think 3 posts in one day on your profile, this page and Asbestos page serve? An exercise in writing? Hardly. If you can not follow the logic of the paragraph about, that's a different issue, but it shouldn't be anything new that I am saying...just repeatiing it over and over again and Asbestos just ignores it or simply doesn't get it. So, yes, when it reaches a limit, I don't hesitate to use the right adjective to describe people who "simply doesn't get it".</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Sorry, but my comment you edited from the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a> entry was fact, not POV. During her match against Jennings, Nancy initially appeared to be no threat to him; in fact, she lagged behind him considerably until he stumbled on the two <i>Daily Double</i> questions and the gap between them narrowed as a result of his errors, not her intelligence. Additionally, if Nancy was anywhere near as good a player as Jennings, she wouldn't have won only one game. Clearly, she wasn't as skilled as he was, a fact, not POV, viewed by millions over the course of two evenings. <a href="../../../s/f/t/User%7ESFTVLGUY2_becf.html" title="User:SFTVLGUY2">TOM</a> 19:15, Dec 2, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey, I watched the episodes, and I agree with you, but it's still biased. With only two data points, we can't say for sure whether or not she was more skilled than Ken. That she lost doesn't "prove" that she is less skilled. Let's say "suggested." In addition, the phrases "finishing in last place" and "a win of $2.00" don't go very well together. <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerion_926e.html" title="User:Aerion">Aerion</a> 19:31, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, you can't deny that she played a pretty solid game, slowly building up her score. I believe she got 10 questions right and 1 wrong, although maybe that semi-guess on the last question of "No Soup For You!" shouldn't really count. <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerion_926e.html" title="User:Aerion">Aerion</a> 19:41, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ignore comments about me and my logic. I want you to answer this...I skimmed the garbage which consituted 2/3 of your message about me. Am I not discussing the point at hand in the paragraph above?</p>
<p>I notice you keep going to other pages deleting words with the same problems. Doesn't suprise me.</p>

<p>First, allow me to thank you for your lovely lecture about the issues. I must say I got more than enough of that when I was earning my various degrees in political science (I happen to presently hold a master's in that subject).</p>
<p>As far as the "not very bright" comment, I was not referring to the gentleman's intelligence. If you had bothered to read the entire text, you'd see that I was referring to a comment made by someone else regarding Fossett's "bright future in politics." My point was that, based on his performance, his future wasn't bright; I can't speak to the man's mental faculties.</p>
<p>In the future, I'd appreciate it if you'd mind your own business, at least as far as I'm concerned. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 02:32, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings, Aerion!<br />
In the VFD on Peter Fossett you somewhat supported my position to preserve the article, which was on a candidate for Congress in Ohio. Several of the candidates whose articles were deleted I put on a special "minor candidates" page, which is now up for deletion as well. I wonder if you would offer your comments there.
