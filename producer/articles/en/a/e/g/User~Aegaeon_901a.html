	    <p>Very little information has been disclosed about Aegaeon's birth or parentage. It is known that, as an infant, the spirits of 50 dreadlords, who had haunted the village of Aegaeon, was sealed within Aegaeon's body by the leading Shaman of Durotar, Ryal.</p>
<p>The villagers of Durotar harbored a fierce hatred for the young child, since he bore the spirit of the demons who decimated their once peaceful village, in spite of Ryal's wish that Aegaeon be seen as a hero who contained the demon. He was shunned by his fellow villagers and their children, his classmates, leaving Aegaeon a confused and lonely child.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Aegaeon was befriended by his compassionate warlock instructor, an undead named Bllair. Though Bllair's own parents perished at the hands of the dreadlords, Bllair didn't blame Aegaeon for their deaths. Instead, Bllair accepted Aegaeon and empathized with the boy's desire to be accepted, since he too once had the same desire. He may have been the first person to believe in Aegaeon, and has made a lasting impact on Aegaeon himself. It is through Bllair's presence as Aegaeon 's only family figure that Aegaeon learns to overcome his sadness.</p>
<p>Before graduating from the Warlock Academy, Aegaeon was craving for acknowledgement. He would play pranks all around the village in an attempt to be recognized by its inhabitants. This included, but was not limited to, painting graffiti on the monument depicting the first four Warchief of the Horde. He would also tell everyone who doubted him that he would one day become decked out in tier 3. As he tells Bllair(and pretty much everyone else), he wishes to become decked out in tier 3 in order to be recognized by those around him. Even after graduating, Aegaeon is still determined to be recognized, and becomes the "Number One Loudest, Unpredictable, Hyperactive Knuckleheaded Warlock" of Durotar, as described by Bllair.</p>
<p>Aegaeon 's exuberant personality and fiery desire for self-improvement strongly impacts the lives of those around him. At beginning of his warlockian traning, Aegaeon befriends Gixet, the grandson of the Warchief, and it is through his brief tutelage that Gixet learns that the path to success is through plenty of hard work. Despite his headstrong nature, Aegaeon is a clever prankster who overcomes his opponents through sheer willpower and, at times, dumb luck (though as Bllair himself states, luck is very important).</p>
<p>Aegaeon has a great sense of humor, albeit somewhat perverted in some cases, and is usually all smiles and laughs around (though, at times, he smiles to hide whatever's bothering him so no one worries about him; those who are closest to him see right through it). Outside his world, he's just an ordinary kid with a laid-back attitude.</p>
<p>As the host of the dreadlordian spirits, both Aegaeon's body and mind (occasionally) are influenced by it. Physically, Aegaeon has some of the dreadlord's characteristics, such as a douche-like personality. He also has increased stamina and healing ability, which allows him to recover from most injuries within a day. Mentally, Aegaeon remains largely unaffected, save for a few demonlistic traits that slip through, such as his tendency to leap between trees on all fours. Since the dreadlords was sealed inside Aegaeon since birth, it is unclear just what parts of his personality it has had an effect on; however, it could explain Aegaeon's devilish side for pulling pranks to gain attention, as well as his stubbornness to never back down from a challenge. These traits become more pronounced as he draws upon the dreadlords mana reserves.</p>
<p>Aegaeon's normal mana level is considered high for a warlock of his level, partially because of the dreadlords. Even without directly drawing upon it, a small amount of the drealord's mana is always mixed with his own. His body instinctively rejects the bulk of it due to the damage it would cause. As such, he is naturally suited to spells that use a large amount of chakra, such as his signature technique: pop a healthstone, potion and bandage while fighting in a duel. While most warlocks are only capable of creating a healthstone, due to the spell's hazard of equally dividing the user's mana among the healthstones, Aegaeon is able to create upwards of one thousand while maintaining a decent supply of mana.</p>
