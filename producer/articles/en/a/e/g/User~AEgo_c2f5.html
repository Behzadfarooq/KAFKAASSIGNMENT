<p><i>"To be GOVERNED is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so. To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every transaction noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished. It is, under pretext of public utility, and in the name of the general interest, to be place[d] under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and to crown all, mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonored. That is government; that is its justice; that is its morality."-</i> <b>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</b></p>

<p><i>"A tablet of the good hangs over every people. Behold, it is the tablet of their overcomings; behold, it is the voice of their will to power...Verily, men gave themselves all their good and evil. Verily, they did not take it, they did not find it, nor did it come to them as a voice from heaven. Only man placed values in things to preserve himself—he alone created a meaning for things, a human meaning. Therefore he calls himself "man," which means: the esteemer. To esteem is to create: hear this, you creators! Esteeming itself is of all esteemed things the most estimable treasure. Through esteeming alone is there value: and without esteeming, the nut of existence would be hollow...Change of values—there is a change of creators. Whoever must be a creator always annihilates..."</i>- <b>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche</b></p>

How come anarchists approach anarchism from a dogmatic idealism? 'Anarchism has nothing to do with chaos and nihilism which is usually asociated with it.' Let's think about that for a minute shall we? The World, Universe, and Nature are all in a state of flux, a chaotic continuity; change.</p>
<p><br />
We , civilized men, except Order as the norm as if it were of divine inspiration; a gift from God, the lord almighty above. But this preception is based on a lie passed off as truth for way too long by those who it benifits most; the slave-masters and financial superiors of the day. Anarchism is up for interpretation. Anarchism: the underminding of the State(Police), Government(Military), Civilization(Slavery), and Mankind for the advancement of the individual to the opposition of herd collectivism; any diabolical action which leads to the endeavor(s) of an existential superlative; egoistic imperative.</p>
<p>Egaltarianism much like Social Darwinism come from Darwin's struggle for existence theory. Yet most anarchists work from such a basis that equality is paramount in order for anarchism to succeed. There is nothing furthest from the truth. Life isn't equal nor gives the impression of such nonsense. So what is an anarchist, who doesn't agree with status quo of excepted inculcation of anarchist dictrine to do? Thievery, Deception, Obduracy, Manipulation, and Intellectual Catharsis for a reclaiming of Honor and Glory, not an anachronism for subjectificaton, but a realization of an anti- morality-virtue-guilt-sin acknowdgement of how man truly is. Instead of embrassing what is convenient to only fit in and not alienate those for whom we might derive advantages from ay any given opportunity. Attack all those with power, so long as you, who will never be in a position of influence outside the homestead, never having your greedy, covetous finger on The Button. Do this for personal gain and immortality.</p>
<p>Within this frame work; a new understanding of Anarchism. What is good and bad?</p>
<p><br />
GOOD: Strength; Quality; underminding all those who present an obstacle to all your goals. Exercising your dark side, not exorsice. The ability to master fear; from pain to suffurage, the individual transforms and hardens the mind into Iron.</p>
<p>BAD: Weakness; Quanity; The going along with the herd; worker bee mentality. Sacrificing of one's self for the betterment of the group-tribe-state-nation. To play the master/slave game of civilization</p>

When you think about magick. Wicce/a, Aleister Crowley, and Anton S. LaVey come to mind. Magick has nothing to do with the manipulation of others in their sleep or calling on fairies and or demons. That is silly bullshit derived from weird fiction and horror movies. Magick is a mental catharsis for all that ails you. An exercise is role playing out your problems within the psychodrama of the act itself. A healthier way of approaching the mind and body. Life is tragic, conflict, sexuality, and fleeting moments of happiness. Magick allows for the exercising of these truths in a safe enviroment of your own choosing; Intellectual Catharsis Chamber.</p>
<p>Picking from north, south, east, and west. choosing which direction to face, placing a sigil of your own design,from 18 <i>to 36</i> inches in hieght to weight on the wall before you. Below create an altar, shaped like a trapezoid of a decent size, cover with any sheet of any color you wish.Place two candles black(creation) and white(destruction) on either side odf the altar, place nine candles of your favorite color around the room. With a human skull(fake or real doesn't matter)in the middle and a dagger in front. Choose the incense and music for the mood and atmosphere you need for any paticular ritual that is appropiate(Silence is required before and after every ritual).All rituals must be preformed skyclad(nude). Rituals are personal and secretive. The ritual must not be exposed to eyes that are not of the conjurer; him or herself.</p>
<p>Anarcho-Magick is about release and freedom. Not the supernatural and the superficial persutes of the lonely, cowardly, wanna bes, and idiots. You can study the mechanics of different rituals and the basic background of magick by reading: The Golden Bough by Sir <b>James George Frazer</b>, <b>H.P.Lovecraft</b>, <b>R.E.Howard</b>, <b>Clark Ashton Smith</b> and many other weird fiction writers from the early twentith century.</p>

<p>"I teach you the overman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?" - <b>Zarathustra</b></p>
<p><br />
To live alone doesn't mean that loneliness is all one requires. Most people need a little human contact now and again. To subject one's self to loneliness is a transedental mentality for the evolution from Man to Overman. Mind is all there is. Reality/progress is a corruption; a sickness from living with too much comfort, conforming from coercion. Illusion is in all actuality the only true understanding of our existence. No yesterday, tomorrow, only today with all that comes from our existential dystopia. Our bodies, property, religions, philosophies, friends, families, and pets are not concrete. Meaning nothing lasts forever and shouldn't. Oganisms need diversity. Stagnation is death from boredom, this births nihilism as a symptom, not dyspepsia. Only of choice men can and shall pursue such an endeavor.</p>
<p>Its easy to read Nietzsche, Stirner, and others. Debate and come up with your ouwn idea of the Übermensch. To live it is much harder and demands an Iron Will. Even though you maybe limited by free choice because of proletarian financing. Combinding the Anarchism and Anarcho-Magick laid out, will challenge the human spirit! The Overman shall become the meaning of the Earth! Quality, not quanity. Indulge yourself in all endeavors from warfare to social engineering. As long as you desroy all you touch, then recreate with selfish intentions. Compassion, Self-Denial, and Self- Sacrifice are to be exorcised from the ennui they produce.</p>
<p><i>That which is Man and can forever strive. And with great years, even Ego may survive.</i>- <b>Fox Murchadh</b></p>
