<p><b>Naturopathy</b>) is a philosophy and practice within [[alternative medicine]] that seeks to improve [[health]] and restore health of the [[Holism|whole person]] chiefly by assisting the body's innate capacity to recover from [[illness]] and [[injury]]. Naturopathic practice may include a broad array of different modalities, including [[manual therapy]], [[homeopathy]], [[hydrotherapy]], [[herbalism]], [[acupuncture]], [[psychotherapy|counselling]], [[environmental medicine]], [[aromatherapy]], [[whole foods|wholefoods]], and so on. Practitioners have a [[holistic health|holistic]] approach to patient care.</p>
<p>The naturopathic movement has its origins in the United States,{{fact}} where there are two types of practitioner: licensed naturopathic physicians practising [[naturopathic medicine]], and traditional naturopaths. Before origination of the term "naturopathy", this medical system was used in European clinics and spas as part of mainstream medicine.{{fact}} Today naturopathy is practiced in many countries around the world in one form or another, where it is subject to different standards of regulation and levels of acceptance.</p>
<p>Naturopaths are not licensed to use invasive [[surgery]], or prescribe synthetic [[medication|drugs]], but some may use "natural" remedies, i.e. relatively unprocessed or whole medications herbs and foods. Some naturopaths are trained to use diagnostic tests such as [[imaging]] and [[blood tests]] before deciding upon the full course of treatment. Where clinically indicated, naturopaths may refer out to medical practitioners for prescription medications and surgery.</p>
<p>The mainstream scientific community claims that it has found little evidence for the effectiveness of most naturopathic modalities, and the concept of [[Holistic Health|holistic medicine]] itself is widely disputed. [[Alternative medicine]] is often treated warily, as when a treatment is proven to be effective, it is usually integrated into mainstream medicine. Naturopathy is thereby sometimes dismissed as ineffective by those who see it as an alternative therapy rather than a medical system.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/e/User%7EApers0n_Naturopathy_a658.html" title="Edit section: History of naturopathy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History of naturopathy</span></h2>
<p>{{see|Naturopathic medicine#History of naturopathic medicine}} {{sources}} The term naturopathy was coined in the [[United States of America|US]] before 1900, by John Scheel,{{fact}} and used by [[Benedict Lust]].{{fact}} Lust had been schooled in [[hydrotherapy]] and other natural health practices in [[Germany]] by Father [[Sebastian Kneipp]],{{fact}} who sent Lust to the [[United States]] to bring them Kneipp's methods. In 1905, Lust founded the [[American School of Naturopathy]] in [[New York]], the first naturopathic college in the United States.</p>
<p>Naturopathic medicine went into decline, along with most other natural health professions, after the 1930s, with the discovery of penicillin and advent of synthetic drugs such as [[antibiotics]] and [[corticosteroids]]. In the post-war era, Lust's death, conflict between various schools of natural medicine ([[homeopathy]], [[eclectics]], [[physio-medicalism]], [[herbalism]], naturopathy, etc.), the rise of medical technology, and consolidation of political power in conventional medicine were all contributing factors. In 1910, when the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] published the [[Flexner Report]] which criticized many aspects of medical education in various institutions (natural and conventional), it was mostly seen as an attack on low-quality natural medicine education. It caused many such programs to shut down and contributed to the popularity of conventional medicine.</p>
<p>Naturopathic medicine never completely ceased to exist, however, as there were always a few states in which licensing laws existed—though at one point there were virtually no schools. One of the most visible steps towards the profession's modern renewal was the opening in 1956 of the [[National College of Naturopathic Medicine]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. This was the first of the modern naturopathic medical schools offering four-year naturopathic medical training with the intention of integrating mainstream science and naturopathic principles and practice.</p>

<p>Naturopathy has another stream that started in [[India]] in the 1900s. It was popularized by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. He adopted and popularized this system because it was cheap and adaptable to the Indian soil. The system grew in popularity towards the close of 1900s, and today there are two streams of naturopaths in India. The first are graduates of All India Naturopathy Council and are awarded DNYS (Diploma in Naturopathy and Yogic Sciences) after 3 years of guided study and internship. The other are university graduates who are awarded BNYS (Bachelor of Naturopathy and Yogic Sciences). BNYS is a four and half year course with one year [[internship]]. BNYS course is offered by Government Gandhi Nature Cure College, Hyderabad, India, affiliated to NTR University of Health Sciences.</p>
<p>Naturopathy is very popular in India, and there are numerous naturopathy hospitals in the country. There are also many doctors trained in the Western system of medicine who have acquired naturopathy degrees so as to integrate the insights gained into their system of practice.</p>
<p>The Indian stream of naturopathy differs from the Western stream in many ways, particularly in their emphasis of strict [[vegetarian]]ism and [[yoga]].</p>

<p>There are two groups in the United States calling themselves "naturopaths" who have recently been engaged in legal battles. The term when originally coined by [[John Scheel]], and popularized by Dr. [[Benedict Lust]] was to apply to those receiving an education in the basic medical sciences with an emphasis on natural therapies:</p>

<p>{{main|Naturopathic medicine#Naturopathic physicians|Naturopathic medicine}} Naturopathic physicians in the United States are independent providers with training in conventional medical sciences, diagnosis and treatment, and natural therapeutics with licenses or registration granted by an individual state Naturopathic Board of Medical Examiners. They graduate from four-year nationally accredited naturopathic medical [[graduate school]]s. Naturopathic physicians training with respect to [[modality|modalities]] is different, with a focus on [[nutrition]], [[botanical medicine]], [[homeopathy]], [[hydrotherapy]], [[physical manipulation]], [[pharmacology]], and [[minor surgery]]. Some naturopathic physicians have additional training in the following: [[natural childbirth]], [[acupuncture]], and [[Chinese medicine]]. These subspecialties often involve additional years of study. Naturopathic physicians are required to attend continuing education yearly in order to maintain and renew their license.</p>

<p><i>Vis medicatrix naturae</i>, or the healing power of nature, is the central tenet of Traditional Naturopathy. [[Bacteria]] and [[virus]]es, which are always present, seldom cause problems in a healthy body. According to naturopathic practice, disease occurs when [[toxin]]s that have accumulated internally – often due to incorrect lifestyle, a poor diet, and improper care of the body - weaken a person. While conventional medical treatments may rid the body of [[symptom]]s, these treatments alone do not bring about true healing. Rather than trying to attack specific symptoms and diseases, Traditional Naturopathy offers a [[holistic]] approach to the individual that supports the body in finding its way back to [[homeostasis]].</p>
<p>Traditional Naturopathy is not a medical practice. While prescribing drugs and [[pharmaceutical]]s, performing surgery, and other invasive procedures clearly have their place in the hands of properly trained medical doctors, these practices are outside the scope of Traditional Naturopathy and are at odds with its fundamental principles. Instead Traditional Naturopaths focus on [[education|educating]] clients to lead healthier lives and on the use of naturopathic [[Modality|modalities]] such as [[light]], [[water]], [[herb]]s, [[Healthy eating|healthy foods]], and [[exercise]] to [[cleanse]] and strengthen the body and support its natural healing process.</p>
<p>Traditional Naturopaths receive training from correspondence schools, or they receive their training from other practitioners. None of the schools that award degrees to Traditional Naturopaths are accredited by the US Department of Education.</p>

<p>The healing power of nature (<i>vis medicatrix naturae</i>), has two aspects: first that the [[body]] has the ability to [[heal]] itself and it is the naturopathic doctor's role to facilitate this natural process, and second that [[nature]] heals. Following this principle includes getting enough [[sleep]], [[Exercise|exercising]], feeding the body nutritional [[food]] and, if needed, additional earth food, such as [[herb]]s, or [[algae]], which is a living [[organism]]. It is asserted, yet strongly refuted by critics, that plants can gently move the body into health without side effects posed by some synthetic chemicals in modern [[pharmaceutical]]s.</p>

<p>The underlying root causes of disease must be removed for complete healing to take place (<i>tolle causam</i>). These root causes can exist at many levels: [[physical]], [[mental]], [[emotion]]al, and [[spiritual]]. It is the naturopathic doctor's ostensible role to identify this root cause, in addition to alleviate suffering by treating symptoms.</p>

<p>The process of healing includes the manifestations of [[symptom]]s, so that any therapy that interferes with this natural healing process by masking symptoms is considered suppressive and should be avoided (<i>primum non nocere</i>). The natural [[life force]] of the individual should be supported to facilitate healing.</p>

<p>A core tenet of naturopathy is the belief that health must go beyond treatment of immediate [[symptom]]s (as with [[medicine]]), and instead treat the entire person's well being. That means treating the entire [[body]], as well as the [[spirit]]/[[soul]] and [[mind]]. This approach is usually called the wholistic or [[holistic]] method.</p>

<p>It is the role of the naturopath to [[educate]] an individual in their practices and encourage that individual to "take responsibility for their own health" (<i>docere</i>). This cooperative relationship between doctor and patient is essential to healing.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of the naturopathic physician is [[prevention]]. The emphasis is on building [[health]], not fighting illness. This is done by fostering healthy [[lifestyle]]s, healthy [[belief]]s, and healthy [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s.</p>

<p>In some countries naturopathy is unregulated and the term "naturopath" is not clearly defined. This may lead to difficulty in ensuring that a practitioner is trained to a particular standard or has adequate liability insurance.</p>

<p>There is currently no state [[licensure]] in [[Australia]], rather the industry is self regulated. There is no protection of title, meaning that technically anyone can practise as a naturopath. The only way to obtain [[insurance]] for professional [[indemnity]] or public [[Liability insurance|liability]] is by joining a [[Professional body|professional association]], which can only be achieved having completed an [[School accreditation|accredited]] course and gaining [[professional certification]].</p>
<p>It is generally thought that with registration, a minimum four-year degree with a minimum 400 hours of supervised clinic practice will be required for practice. Currently only two institutions fulfil these requirements, the <a href="http://www.acnm.edu.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.acnm.edu.au/" rel="nofollow">Australian College of Natural Medicine</a> and [[Southern Cross University]].</p>
<p>Professional naturopathic associations in Australia include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Australian Natural Therapists Association (ANTA)</li>
<li>Australian Traditional-Medicine Society (ATMS), which has the largest membership base in the industry</li>
<li>National Herbalists Association of Australia (NHAA)</li>
<li>Australian Naturopathic Practitioners Association (ANPA)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is currently debate in the industry over whether [[Licensure|compulsory registration]] should be introduced for naturopaths, as with [[physiotherapy]], [[osteopathy]] and [[chiropractic]]. ATMS is opposed on the grounds that naturopathic treatment is potentially dangerous, and that registration would therefore instigate a significant rise in [[insurance premium]]s. NHAA is pro-registration on the grounds that [[Herbalism|herbalists]] and naturopaths will never be taken seriously by the medical profession while unregistered. ANPA is also pro-registration, arguing that only registration of the profession will advance naturopathy as an integral part of healthcare in Australia.</p>

There is no government sponsored regulation of the profession, the largest body, <a href="http://www.naturopathy.org.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.naturopathy.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">The General Council &amp; Register of Naturopaths</a> recognises three courses in the UK, two being taught at osteopathic schools: the <a href="http://www.bcom.ac.uk/courses/nd/" class="external text" title="http://www.bcom.ac.uk/courses/nd/" rel="nofollow">British College of Osteopathic Medicine</a>; The <a href="http://www.collegeofosteopaths.ac.uk/naturopathy.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.collegeofosteopaths.ac.uk/naturopathy.htm" rel="nofollow">College of Osteopaths Educational Trust</a>; and one at the [[University of Westminster]] School of Integrated Health under the auspices of the B.Sc Health Science (Naturopathy) course.</p>
<p>Members of this register will either have completed a three or four year full time [[Academic degree|degree]] level course or possibly be a [[Health profession|healthcare professional]] (Medical Doctor, Osteopath, Chiropractor, Nurse) who has completed a two year post-graduate Naturopathic Diploma, the N.D. As the naturopathic profession has developed along different lines in the UK, naturopaths do not perform minor surgery or have prescribing rights.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/e/User%7EApers0n_Naturopathy_a658.html" title="Edit section: Scope of practice">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scope of practice</span></h2>
<p>In the United States both [[Naturopathy#Naturopathic physicians|naturopathic physicians]] and [[Naturopathy#Traditional naturopaths|traditional naturopaths]] use the degree designation of N.D. (doctor of naturopathic medicine), leading to considerable confusion about the [[scope of practice]], education and training of a naturopathic practitioner (in the United Kingdom, N.D. stands for Diploma in Naturopathy). There is great contention between the two [[Political faction|factions]], as their [[political agenda]]s are in opposition to each other: Naturopathic physicians, whose national professional organization is the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, strive to recover [[licensure]] in all 50 states, whereas traditional naturopaths, whose professional organization is the American Naturopathic Medical Association, oppose licensure and often block licensing attempts. [[Negotiation]] is currently in progress between naturopathic physicians and traditional naturopaths to come to a resolution to this problem and agree to use different degree titles and designations, but so far this has not been a successful endeavour.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/e/User%7EApers0n_Naturopathy_a658.html" title="Edit section: Science and naturopathy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Science and naturopathy</span></h2>
<p>There is widespread support for the application of an [[evidence based medicine]] framework to assess health outcomes and that systematic reviews with strict protocols are essential. Organisations such as the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] and [[Bandolier (journal)|Bandolier]] publish such reviews.</p>
<p>There are reports of [[evidence based medicine]] trials published for naturopathy.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some modalities used in naturopathy are widely regarded as [[pseudoscience]]. [[Medical doctor]]s often cite the large differences between naturopathic practitioners and the lack of scientific documentation of the safety and efficacy of their practices in order to justify limiting naturopathic scope. Advocates claim that naturopathic practitioners find it difficult to obtain financing for research due to the lack of prior research in many areas. Proponents state that this is slowly changing as naturopathic physicians develop research programs to help build up a foundation for evidence based treatment.</p>
<p>Conventional medicine is required to undergo rigorous testing; [[drug trial]]s often last for a decade. A criticism of [[Alternative medicine|alternative therapies]] is that they are not subject to detailed safety assessment. Retrospective analysis of various herbal agents have found many to be of little therapeutic value and others to be harmful. This can be tied to the fact that 'natural' does not necessarily correspond to being beneficial or even benign. Also of concern is the ambiguity of the word "natural" and poor agreement as to its meaning.</p>
<p>While the above addresses a primary challenge to the validation process for "natural" remedies, perhaps of greater concern amongst critics is the lack of regulation of manufacturer claims in advertising. Common labeling practices suggest that herbal extracts are devoid of "drugs" or "chemicals". Claims of this type are patently false as every component of any plant extract is a chemical by definition. Likewise, claims as to the relative absence of [[toxicity]] in herbal extracts, when compared to conventional [[pharmaceutical]] preparations, are tainted by incongruent regulations for reporting of side effects. The manufacturers of conventional pharmaceutical agents are legally bound to record and report any perceived negative experiences during large scale clinical trials, though there may be no actual link between the tested drug and the perceived side effect. To wit, it is often the case that drugs are labelled with side effects such as [[headache]], [[constipation]], [[diarrhea]], or sleep disturbance. These "side effects" are required to be listed even if they are found with no more regularity than they are in a placebo control group or within the general populace for that matter. Conversely, herbal manufacturers are not required to carry out such clinical studies nor to report any known adverse effects, even if said effects have been directly linked to ingestion of the herbal preparation in question. While these advertising techniques do not negate the potential for some beneficial uses of various herbal agents, and they do not necessarily reflect upon the validity of naturopathic medicine as a field of study, critics suggest that they do serve to beguile the public through the employment of nothing more than legally permissible [[semantics]] and selective reporting.</p>
<p>Naturopathic modalities may be controversial (e.g. [[homeopathy]]), or have proven effectiveness only for very specific conditions (e.g. [[acupuncture]], [[aromatherapy]]) Some naturopaths may use these modalities as [[Panacea (medicine)|panaceas]] or to improve the patient's quality of life.</p>
