<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape_Escape_fbf5.html" title="Edit section: Gameplay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gameplay</span></h2>
<p><i>Ape Escape</i> was the first PlayStation game to fully require the use of both control sticks to play (one needed to purchase a <a href="../../../d/u/a/DualShock_b53b.html" title="DualShock">DualShock</a> controller to play this game, as the original PlayStation controller would not work). The right stick is used in many different ways, such as aiming and swinging weapons. You can have four items equipped at once, on the X, Square, Circle and Triangle face buttons. Unlike some platformers, <i>Ape Escape</i> uses the R buttons to jump.</p>

<p>At the very beginning of the game, Spike is hurled into a level set in the dinosaur age. After completing this level, where Spike learns the basics of the two primary gadgets and catches a handful of monkeys, he is transported to the Time Station, the hub of the game. There are four sections in the station:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Warp Screen: Players choose the level to play from here.</li>
<li>Load/Save Screen: Players can save their progress or load a separate game from here. They can also access the Monkey Book, which records all the monkeys that players have captured.</li>
<li>Training Room: Here, players can access previously completed training levels for each specific gadget that they have obtained.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/i/n/Minigame.html" title="Minigame">Minigame</a> Room: Players can play minigames they have unlocked by collecting <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specter_%28Ape_Escape%29_b377.html" title="Specter (Ape Escape)">Specter</a> coins here (see Minigames section).</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape_Escape_fbf5.html" title="Edit section: Gadgets">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gadgets</span></h2>
<p><i>Ape Escape</i> has several gadgets, which each have their own unique function. Spike's primary gadgets are the Stun Club and the Time Net, which are often used to subdue and catch apes, respectively. Throughout the game, Spike will acquire more gadgets that will be useful to him in the next world, and are often needed to get some of the apes in earlier levels. When a new gadget is obtained, players are dropped into a training level, where the basics of controlling the gadget are learned and practised. These levels can be revisited in the Training Room (see above). A complete list of all the gadgets follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time Net — The most important gadget; used to catch monkeys.</li>
<li>Stun Club — Used to hit monkeys and enemies with a regular mêlée attack.</li>
<li>Water Net — Used to catch monkeys swimming in water. It is automatically switched to when Spike dives into water, and does not need to be assigned to a button; no other gadget can be used underwater.</li>
<li>Monkey Radar — Locates monkeys in the level. When the signal makes a high-pitched noise and turns red, a monkey is nearby. You can use this to see its name and other statistics (see Monkeys section).</li>
<li>Sling Back Shooter (Sling Shot) — Used to hit monkeys, enemies and buttons that are out of range. Spike can shoot normal, explosive, or guided bullets.</li>
<li>Super Hoop (Dash Hoop) — Spike must spin this around his waist to achieve a supercharged burst of speed. It is used to hit particularly fast enemies and monkeys, and to solve puzzles.</li>
<li>Sky Flyer (Propeller) — Enables Spike to rise up into the air and reach high-up places, or glide across large canyons. Continuously rotating it will keep Spike up longer, but he will eventually float back down to the ground.</li>
<li>RC Car — Spike can direct this through small gaps to subdue monkeys and press buttons in a location out of accessibility. It constantly regenerates if it is accidentally destroyed.</li>
<li>Magic Punch — Only found after defeating <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specter_%28Ape_Escape%29_b377.html" title="Specter (Ape Escape)">Specter</a>, this can be used as a much stronger melee attack, as opposed to the Stun Club. It can break strong boxes and walls that the Stun Club cannot.</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
<p>Each monkey in <i>Ape Escape</i> has a unique personality, with a name and description, seen as a "Data File". Players can view this on "Monkey Cam", a feature of the Monkey Radar gadget that is used in-game by pressing the L2 button when pointing the radar towards a monkey. After the monkey is caught, its Data File can be read in a log book, called the Monkey Book, accessed from the main hub of the game. These names often hold many humorous jokes and pop culture references. For example, a monkey named <a href="../../../k/u/b/Kubrick.html" title="Kubrick">Kubrick</a> is described as one who "enjoys <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrillers.html" title="Thrillers">thrillers</a>". Each monkey also has three fields of skill: Speed, Attack and Alertness, all of which are ranked out of five. This combines to a level of difficulty, which is also denoted on the File.</p>
<p>An amusing yet useful feature of the monkeys is that their pants can tell the player the main traits of their personality by use of a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_code.html" title="Color code">color code</a>. For example, a monkey with red pants would be a strong attacker. Players can use this to employ the best strategy to use in order to catch the monkey. The complete code is shown here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yellow — Average monkey. It usually attacks with its fist, but sometimes fiddles around with a laser gun.</li>
<li>Red — Strong attacker, so avoid close combat. Besides using its fists, it carries weapons and is an excellent shot.</li>
<li>Blue — Incredibly fast runner.</li>
<li>White — Same as yellow, but is very attentive and difficult to sneak up on.</li>
<li>Green — Sharp vision; Can spot Spike from a long distance and shoot homing missiles.</li>
<li>Black — Extremely dangerous; wields a gun and is very hostile.</li>
<li>Light Blue — Gentle and very sensitive. It can stalk and attack Spike if it is hurt too much.</li>
</ul>
<p>In accordance with the storyline, each monkey wears a Peak Point Helmet that boosts its intelligence. The flashing light on top of the headgear actually tells the player the current mood of the monkey. A blue light means that it is calm, a yellow light means that it has heard something and is on alert, and red means that it has spotted Spike and has become aggressive.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape_Escape_fbf5.html" title="Edit section: Bosses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bosses</span></h2>
<p>Most bosses within levels can be attacked using a vulnerability point. For robots and machines, this is usually symbolized as a visible green hexagon on the front of the boss. This light can only be attacked after a cycle of attacks from the boss and is only functional for a few seconds each time. Other enemies (e.g. Knights) can only be attacked when they are recharging, or they must be struck from behind.</p>

<p>Some monkeys can avoid being captured by either using their environments or by protecting themselves within objects. However, through the game, there are some other "creatures" that can be found wandering around, requiring a couple of attacks to reveal energy chips, cookies, bullets or sometimes a life. There are also some of these creatures that are stronger than others and can be categorised as minor bosses.</p>
