<p>Moved from article:</p>
<p>Since the concept includes some quite different animals, most of the information should be on the individual pages. But perhaps some common information could go here. Perhaps something about conservation issues? (Most ape species are rare or <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endangered_species.html" title="Endangered species">endangered</a>.)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>What about the new mystery ape that has recently been photographed, captured and had its mitochondrial DNA analyzed? Seems to be a third species of chimp; a few people have suggested it may be descended from a weird Gorilla-chimp hybrid. It seems to be a previously unknown species of chimp. This topic should be discussed in our articles on <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">Ape</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chimpanzee.html" title="Chimpanzee">Chimpanzee</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptozoology.html" title="Cryptozoology">Cryptozoology</a>.

<p>I have had a go at the Ape page. It was a bit of a muddle. The real problem is that the concept of "ape" has drifted over the centuries, from any tailless nonhuman primate to its current meaning of a member of one of two particular families. However even now primate taxonomy is even more of a mess than most orders, so it is hard to get consistent terminology, and authorities do not agree on what the names of those families should be, or whether they should be in a superfamily. I've gone for a version that seems simple to grasp. There did seem to me to be one error in the article as I found it, though: I don't think there's any serious usage of "ape" that doesn't include the hylobatids.</p>

<dd>That depends on if you are asking when humans genetically became apes (which would be we've always been apes), or when it was first postulated that the other ape species and humans were descended from a common extinct ape ancestor (which would be about when <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> wrote Origin of the Species), or when it became a more common understanding than just a scientific one. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> 18:24, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>more of angry sarcasm, sorry. i suppose what i meant was when was it that humans ceased being in a clade analogous respective to apes as apes were to monkeys, for that is how i remember it being said.

<dd>When you are speaking of apes here you cannot redefine the English word ape to include man. It is always "the great apes and man." You can study clades all you want and you can make Hominidae, Homininae, etc., mean whatever the scientific evidence warrants at the moment. Ape however is not and never was a scientific classification or a scientific word and the Hom- group of words doea not mean "ape" or "great", it means "man." There is no justification at all for calling Hominidae "great apes" and this would be a serious breach of the English language, especially as we are going to talk about apes and true apes. And just what are we, the truest of the true apes, faithful to our apish nature? No, I understand why the Wikipedia author who used ape to mean us did so, but I would point out that it is an ordinary English word, not a scientific word, and we cannot use it to mean us without a serious contortion of all the rest of philosophy, and who is Wikipedia to do that? Who are palaeoanthropologists to do that? But I do not think they are. I think this is strictly Wikipedia so we better get rid of the idea. We can say it without implying men are apes. They may be Hominidae along with the apes but they are not apes. Is there anything more to be said on the subject? So, I have changed a few words (only a few) in the leads of three articles to remove man from being an ape. In general however I understand and sympathize with cladistics and the desire to keep up to date. I don't see any apes trying to keep up to date. Seriously, even if you conclude (as seems to be the case) there is no scientific justification for breaking out man from the great apes, when you use "man" and "great apes" you are not being scientific. Science adopted the Greek and Latin vocabulary to avoid such conflicts as this. We cannot render scientific language into ordinary language. It does not compute. If you want science then you have to learn the language of science. Meanwhile, we need to keep out vernacular English so that we can communicate. I am not an ape, you are not an ape, he, she and it are not apes, we are not apes, etc. I could claim that the author is calling me names on Wikipedia; to wit, "great ape." (joke). By now you must surely see what I mean and agree.<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotteville_e5b2.html" title="User:Botteville">Dave</a> 01:42, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Although the superfamily of apes has always included humans, in its taxonomical definition, a more specific connotation of the word "ape" has found its way into the vernacular. This common usage of the word excludes humans when referring to apes." Ummm, no! Ape is vernacular English word in use for more than 400 years ( Shakespeare used it ), which does not include humans. Can anyone cite a scientific definition of the word, including humans, which is older than the common usage. I don't think so.

<p>I think "Legal status" and "Historical terminology" should be placed next to or within "Cultural aspects". I think that the "News" section should be removed - it's not news any more. I think that "Biology", "Classification and evolution" and "History of hominoid taxonomy" should be grouped together similarly to the cultural sections. However, I'm not sure the best way to go about all of this. I also like the "History of hominoid taxonomy" as a bridge between the biological and the cultural. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 11:20, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Admit it: no one, but no one, uses the term "great apes" in conversation to mean humans. Well, maybe a few odd people in the anthropology community. But the term "great apes" MEANS "large, non-human primates". That's what it was invented for. That anthropologists may have taken the term and redefined it for their own use is completely irrelevant.

<dd>Calling humans "apes" doesn't "improve individual knowledge", it merely ambituates terminology. You folks really need to set aside your religious fervor for a moment and acknowledge that, among 99.9% of the population, "ape" does not now, never has, and never will refer to humans. I'm amazed that there appears to be no one editing this topic who has the capacity to see that this is a matter of definition.

<p>Marskell (and Schmidt, and Uther), why are you being so anal-retentively proscriptive in your definition? This is not a personal attack on your man-ape religion. It is a fact of word usage. A "lion" is not a "tiger" and a "mouse" is not a "rat", regardless of how closely the two species might be related. A "human" is not an "ape" in any normal definition of the word. Throw as big a tantrum as you like, but kicking and screaming doesn't change the fact of how the word is used among English speakers. Why must you proselytize your own religion?</p>
<p>If you want to argue that a human <i>should</i> be considered an ape, that's another thing. It might even be worthwhile bringing up your argument in the article. But <b>that's not how the word is used</b>, so it's not how the article should describe it. An ape is an <i>animal</i>, which is to say, <i>not human</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So you are saying that humans are not animals? Nice argument. For if we aren't animals, then we surely can't be apes. Yes, we are animals. We are mamamals. We are primates. We are apes.

<dd>Humans are apes, and I think this person arguing otherwise is the one with religious problems keeping them from seeing the truth. Why is everyone so resistant to the idea that humans are part of the natural world? Also, comparing a technical definition in anthropology to a technical definition in Scientology is a huge fallacy, since anthropology is actually a scientific discipline, whereas Scientology is a cultish religious group. In other words, anthropologists are experts regarding humans and apes, but Scientologists are not experts regarding "power" (except as they define it, which has no bearing outside of their group). Common understandings of scientific ideas and concepts are often very different from the realities, but you don't see anyone trying to say we should only have articles on the layperson's interpretations of things, which would be ridiculous for an encyclopedia. Anyways, some taxonimists actually label chimps (and possibly other great apes) under the genus <i>Homo</i>, which makes them HUMANS! <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 07:12, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>reply to 131.107.0.80: When you explore the universe, one of the things that can happen is discovery of new ways to understand familiar objects and processes. An example from outside of biology is recognition that a single force, gravity, can account both for falling objects on Earth and the Earth-Moon orbital system. Prior to this realization, people assumed that there had to be two different accounts for<br />
(1) how an apple falls off a tree<br />
and for<br />
(2) what holds the Moon in its place in the sky.<br />
Realization that one rule of gravitation accounts for both, changed the way people could think about the solar system.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. Yet we still maintain separate terms for "Moon" and "apple", despite their inherent sameness.
<dl>
<dd>This misses the point. The point is, we do not have both "apple force" and "Moon force", all we have is gravity that applies to both apples and the Moon. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 15:13, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comparative anatomists such as Charles Darwin were able to recognize the relatedness of humans and other apes. The <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">Ape</a> article describes the process by which study of apes led to the full realization of our position in the ape <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clade.html" title="Clade">clade</a>. By detailed study of the molecular components of apes (mainly proteins and the DNA sequences of chromosomes), the data allow us to firmly conclude that humans fit nicely within the ape clade and that we are closest to chimps. Cultural biases that tend to make people ignore the similarities between humans and other apes can now be recognized and passed over in favor of recognition of our actual place in the tree of life.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would guess that any careful scientist would never be so brash as to proclaim that we have found "our actual place in the tree of life". Be that as it may, this is not a religious argument about whether or not humans are related to chimpanzees, which you seem to want to make it. This is a matter of definition.
<dl>
<dd>Apply this attitude to gravity. You could try to define "apple force" as being distinct from "Moon force". Your definition would not make it true that there are two different forces. We have to let the evidence decide the matter, not tradition or anything else. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 15:17, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would not object to a short section in the <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">Ape</a> article that described the fact that many people still attempt to promote use the term "ape" so as to exclude its applicability to humans.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here, you betray your inability to write from a NPOV. You wrongly assume that anyone who wishes to define the term in context of its actual usage must be "attempt[ing] to promote [exclusive] use [of] the term 'ape'". Of course, this is absurd, somewhat like saying that "many people still attempt to promote use of the term 'dolphin' so as to exclude its applicability to blue whales". Well, duh. Blue whales AREN'T dolphins, any more than humans are apes.
<dl>
<dd>The point is, word meanings do change. Concepts evolve. At first, people had the idea that there is a force that applies to falling objects on Earth. People like Galileo performed experiments and quantitatively described the force of "(Earth) gravity". Later, Newton recognized that the orbit of the Moon could be accounted for by the same force. Previously, people had imagined that something other than "(Earth) gravity" was needed to account for the movement of the Moon. The meaning of "gravity" was changed by recognition of the universal nature of gravity. This is now celebrated as a "law". People have given up on the ancient biases that in the past led people to imagine "celestial spheres" or an ethereal force that might apply only to the celestial objects like the Moon and not apples. People just expanded their concept of gravity to include both celestial and Earthly movements. Similarly, there is now no reason to resist expanding your concept of "ape" to include humans. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 15:59, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Note: this is a matter that is decided by evidence about the nature of humans and other animals, not by tradition.

<dl>
<dd>But if you wrote that, would we get the same POV as you insist on putting forth here?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ape is and should be regarded as a word to refer to all members of Hominoidea that are not humans. If humans are apes, then there is no point whatsoever in having the word ape--we already have Hominoidea to describe that cladistic family. I don't understand where the handful of anthropologists get off taking a word that already had an understood use and then bastardizing it to become a largely useless and meaningless term. If you are going to make use of the term ape to include humans for scientific reasons, then just use Hominoidea, since you are, after all, a scientist. Elsewise this is just pointless.</p>
<p>Taxonomists made the word Hominoidea, and they can go ahead an do whatever they want with that word. But here you decided to take an existing word which meant something very different, and reassign that same word to have redundant status with a new word only useful for taxonomists and of no use whatsoever to laymen. This is absurd. Humans are humans, apes are apes, and together they are the Hominoidea superfamily. Why are scientist always trying to redefine everything? Scientists do not have the final say on the meaning of words that have been in use for centuries. No one gave any scientist that authority, and the English language does not need to obey the every whim of the scientific community. Ape is not a clade--Hominoidea is a clade. I do not doubt evolution nor the common ancestry of humans and apes, but humans are not apes. You are trying to promote an agenda--to force people into believe the relatedness of humans and apes by calling humans apes--and this is not in line with an NPOV approach. You will find few strronger advocates of evolution than myself, but this notion of deciding to arbitrarily define ape as synonymous with Hominoidea is nothing but confusing and excessive.</p>
<hr />
<p>I just wanted to note that an Answers.com search reveals that the American Heritage Dictionary and Britannica Concise Encyclopedia does not name humans in their initial definition of apes, though the Britannica uses the term nonhuman apes later in the article. Even more interestingly, the Columbia University Press Encyclopedia defines ape as "any primate of the subfamily Hominoidea, with the possible exception of humans". 71.167.118.253 18:30, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anonymous poster, I agree with your point that they are abusing the common usage of the term "ape", but constant, repetitive revisions aren't going to solve the problem. It looks like you are making changes from Microsoft, given your IP. I'm at Microsoft and would be happy to meet with you. Let me know who/where you are and we can talk.

Privately redefining "Caucasian" to include "Japanese", as if to recognize the underlying "humanness" of both groups, does not solve the problem, any more than redefining "ape" to include "human" in order to recognize the underlying genetic heritage of both solves the problem that APE DOES NOT MEAN HUMAN.</dd>

<p>Well, the anon has been blocked, but this issue still isn't resolved. Anon's point is that "Ape" has a meaning outside of the anthropological view? I think that part of the problem here is that <a href="../../../h/o/m/Hominoidea.html" title="Hominoidea">Hominoidea</a> redirects to <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">Ape</a>. As Humans are certainly of the superfamily Hominoidea, they should be mentioned as a significant part of this superfamily. Could this conflict be ameliorated by simply splitting the two concepts into separate articles? <a href="../../../h/o/m/Hominoidea.html" title="Hominoidea">Hominoidea</a> would retain the anthropological aspects of the term, while <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">Ape</a> would be about the animals commonly known as "Apes"? I am not a biologist or anything, so this is merely speaking from the perspective of an outsider admin who saw the conflict come up on his radar. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 19:16, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The thing is, humans are apes in every biological sense of those two words. What can and should be done is, as has been said, to note the misunderstanding in common usage (and I balk at calling it common usage) and move on. However, the "Historicl terminology" section already accomplishes this to some degree. I will endeavor to address this. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 20:23, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I will second Uther and repeat my above point for the third or fourth time: this is <i>not an encylcopedia of convential usage.</i> If it were, AIDS could be listed as a "gay disease" and wives could be listed as "chattle." Yes, "ape" can be described as distinguishing humans from our relatives (though again, I second Uther as to whether this is "common" usage—my kid brother knows we're apes even if my older brother doesn't (no joke)) but the seperation is not <i>what ape means.</i> <i><b>Ape means <a href="../../../h/o/m/Hominoidea.html" title="Hominoidea">Hominoidea</a>.</b></i> I mean that's it, in a verifiable <i>this is it</i> sense. Yes, you can say "I was talking with a number of so-and-sos and they only use ape to mean non-human." Well, good for you; we are not obligized to apologize to the people who don't understand <i>the rudiments</i> of taxonomy.

<p>Anon showed his hand when he started making statements such as "You folks really need to set aside your religious fervor", "your man-ape religion", "Why must you proselytize your own religion", "this is not a religious argument about whether or not humans are related to chimpanzees, which you seem to want to make it", "some quasi-religious types insist on modifying the current usage of words". People often ascribe their own motivations to other people, and this is exactly the same language as used by those who refer to Darwinism as a religion. Anon wishes to separate humans from animals, as he has said above. This is his motivation, and he is clearly not interested in the science of the issue. Anon's point that the word "Ape" is sometimes incorrectly used has now been added the article by UtherSRG, just like the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Whale.html" title="Whale">Whale</a> article mentions that some people referred to the animals as <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish.html" title="Fish">fish</a>.

<dd>You obviously have no idea what Anon's point was. Though crudely put, he made it perfectly clear: The word "ape" <b>does not mean</b> "human". It's not an incorrect usage to say that "ape" means "non-human", since it very obviously means exactly that. (Why else would calling someone a "big ape" be considered an insult?) I am very well aware of the scientific arguments stating that humans and apes are of the same general type, and that in fact that some apes (e.g. chimps) are more similar to humans than they are to other apes. If you read Anon's stuff carefully, it seems he was well aware of that, too. He simply pointed out (correctly) that the word "ape" does not now and never has meant "human".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And frankly, though I disapproved of his tantrum and his getting all of Microsoft banned, I think he's absolutely right about the religion thing. There is no other reasonable explanation for why people would simply refuse to recognize what a word actually means. (As for the specious comparison below (above), "fish" hasn't included whales in over a century, so the comparison is nonsense.) As Marskell and others seem unable (or more likely unwilling) to grasp, this is not a question of taxonomy, it's a question of linguistics. 20:56, 25 October 2005 (UTC)SB - <small>moved by <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> to prevent breaking the existing text</small>

<dd>You are making a persistent attempt to insert factually wrong information into an article. Your error has been discussed repeatedly on this page. The wikipedia article already explains in great detail why you are wrong. Under wikipedia rules, I am supposed to assume that you have good intentions. Making that assumption, I assume your argument is that since some people do not think that humans are apes, you think that wikipedia should ignore the fact that humans are apes and say that human are not apes. As has been pointed out before on this page, such an argument is not the basis upon which wikipedia articles are constructed. To resolve this dispute, I propose that you find some experts on apes who support your position. By expert, I mean someone who has done research on ape cladistics and published peer-reviewed articles on the topic. If you can find some ape experts who say that humans are not apes, then we can continue this discussion. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 19:30, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why not add a parenthetical line about common usage after this line: "the family Hominidae consisting of gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and humans, collectively known as the 'great apes'." I think the common usage point is well-taken and could be acknowledged without compromising the accuracy of the article. An example of how common this is comes from the Living Links project directed by Frans de Waal, a scientist who clearly knows that humans are apes: “Apes may have retained traits in our common ancestor that we find hard to recognize in ourselves, or that we are not used to contemplating in an evolutionary light.” The distinction in casual usage is very common and should, I think, be noted. This is in no way saying the distinction should be made throughout the article.</p>

<li><b>Support</b>, we are apes and we are also monkeys in terms of cladistics, but not in the common, public, usage of either term.

<li>I just want to clarify that I do not oppose the wording in the article that defines humans as apes. I just think that an article title of ape generates confusion since it is the less common usage of "ape" that is applied here. It is the more accurate definition and I think accuracy trumps common usage in the text of an encyclopedia article. I do also think monkey is more accurately defined as including OW monkeys, NW monkeys, apes, and humans, but I'm not going to press the point at that article. I think it's important to note that there is an agenda pushed for the use of any common names. Retention of "ape" as non-human hominoids advocates for a certain specialness of humans as a variety of ape so special it deserves a new category. Retention of monkey for non-ape simians advocates for a position of ape as a monkey so special it deserves likewise. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 19:15, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why not? Monkeys are Simiae, Anthropoidea or something like that that are not Hominoidea. Apes are Hominoidea that are not <i>Homo</i> (though not everyone thinks so).

<li>All of the monkeys are contained within the lump of simians, but there are simians that are not monkeys and there is no dispute that they are not monkeys. The monkey lump and the simian lump are not entirely the same. All of the apes are contained within Hominoidea, and there are no hominoids that are not apes, even though some people don't understand that. The ape lump and the hominoid lump are identical (not just similar but exactly the same) even though common usage sometimes (and less frequently as people are educated) makes a distinction. The fact that the expression "non-human apes" exists means that the folks using that expression understand that humans are indeed apes. We should not pander to the lowest common denominator. Our job as an encyclopedia should not be to just document common understandings. We should work to be an educational tool. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 18:20, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>While Uther has made the point that needs making, I would suggest the following: go to monkey and drum up support for inserting the caveat about clades you are arguing (if it doesn't exist already). Here, it doesn't actually support your point. Humans were (re-)classified as apes in part because it was realized that they and chimps (an ape, yes?) were more closely related to each other than to the other apes. If you want to say that "Apes are Hominoidea that are not <i>Homo</i>" you're actually saying "Ape has no logical reference point." If humans are not apes, then ape has ceased to be a meaningful term.</li>
<li>And I would add this: if we change this to Hominoid nothing will actually change except a flip around of terms... "Apes (or hominoids) are a primate superfamily including humans" versus "Hominoids (aka Apes) are a primate superfamily including humans..." Nothing is going to change the fact that humans are a part of this taxonomic group. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 21:44, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraphyletic.html" title="Paraphyletic">Paraphyletic</a> isn't the same as "meaningless", I think.

<ul>
<li>From our own page: "In most cladistics-based schools of taxonomy, the existence of paraphyletic groups in a classification is regarded as an error." Separating <i>Homo</i> from the other Apes is just such an error, and I see no reason why Wikipedia needs to perpetuate it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 14:10, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's in formal classifications. Paraphyletic groups are often used indeed. The same argument would go for "humans &amp; apes are monkeys". By the way, the Oxford English Dictionary gives the following definition for "ape": "<b>1</b> a large tailless primate of a group including the gorilla, chimpanzees, orang-utan, and gibbons. [Families Pongidae and Hylobatidae]". This evidently excludes <i>Homo sapiens</i>. <a href="../../../u/c/u/User%7EUcucha_a337.html" title="User:Ucucha">Ucucha</a> <a href="../../../u/c/u/User_talk%7EUcucha_976e.html" title="User talk:Ucucha"><small>(talk)</small></a> 20:20, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ah, but are we attempting to be scientific, common, or educational? The OED is fine for just common usage. In fact, dictionaries attempt to document common usage. Note that "d'oh" is in the OED now. An encyclopedia should try to strike a balance. We should show the scientific reality of humans being apes. We fail to do that if we allow common usage to override science. By saying that humans are not apes, we are pandering to the lowest common denominator and not working towards education. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 21:37, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was looking to see how many chromosomes various species of primates have. If you read the page on chromosomes at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome#Number_of_chromosomes_in_different_species" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome#Number_of_chromosomes_in_different_species" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome#Number_of_chromosomes_in_different_species</a> you see that it says there humans have 46 chromosomes while apes have 48. I clicked on the hyperlink to Ape to see which species they mean when they say ape, and I find this page telling me humans are counted as apes. This is internally inconsistent. You need to reconcile this page and the page on chromosomes, and looking at this page, it seems like most people agree that apes and humans are two different things. I'm not a fundamentalist opposed to evolution. Quite the contrary, I knew that humans and chimps had different numbers of chromosomes, and I was hoping to compare the number of chromosomes in closely related species to see if the difference was a reduction in the number of chromosomes in the evolution of humans or an increase in the number of chromosomes in the evolution of the ape. So why are people trying to force an agenda by calling humans a type of ape? This seems to serve no purpose whatsoever, apart from trying to antagonize the opponents of evolution. Fundamentally, this is not only in violation of NPOV guidelines, but it is unnecessarily confusing. It only makes the terminology ambiguous. We do not need to call humans apes just because the group of humans + apes = a monophyletic grouping. "Ape" does not need to be a cladistic term.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It has since been changed to gorilla. However the terminology was confusing because <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibbons.html" title="Gibbons">gibbons</a> which I think are accepted as apes even by the humans are not apes crowd don't have 48 chromosomes and indeed are variable depending on genera. So we would at the very least need to correct it to say great ape. However we might as well say non-human great ape or simply give a specific example like someone else did. Also, the same argument could be made about calling humans animals. Sure it's a lot more convient in some ways to not call humans animals, after all how often do people say someone's an animal (which is intrinsicly true but not in the way that was meant). But we do because it makes much more sense. It also avoids the confusion that a lot of people, especially religious people, but even non religious people have that humans are special (which gives rise to silly things like the claim every ape should evolve to be a human). They're not. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 20:04, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, we are Hominidae (Great Apes), and that bracket is wide enough to include homo sapiens as well as the modern apes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.7.74.130 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.7.74.130.html" title="User talk:82.7.74.130">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.7.74.130_b4fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.7.74.130">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Actually, humans are more closely related to either of the two chimp species than we are to the two species of gorilla. Chimps are more closely related to us than they are to gorillas. Humans, chimps, and gorillas are all more closely related to each other than any of those three are related to orangutans.

<dd>The problems with anon above appears to be with a misunderstanding of evolution and with the misleading term proto-apes. The so called proto-apes were apes. Humans and chimpanzee has a common ancestor however this doesn't mean humans evolved from chimpanzee. The ancestor of humans and chimpanzee was neither human or chimpanzee, it was a different ape all together (a proto ape if you want to call it that). I'm not sure whether this holds true for anon but there appears to be this common misconception that non-human apes have stopped evolving which is of course just plain silly. All apes have been evolving including humans and humans haven't necessarily evolved more then other apes, just in a different direction (just as each ape other species also evolved in a different direction). Also, although I use the term direction, it's important to remember evolution is not goal-setting and humans are not the desired outcome (again this often appears to be a problem where people think all apes or all animals 'want' to be humans) <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 19:14, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But surely there's no way they are actually deliberately creating symbollic images. That's too advanced an cognitive capability.</p>
<p>The first step is to get everyone to state their definition of art. If art must be symbolic, then it's a matter of deciding if the object created is symbolic. If art is defined as an object purposefully created for visual/tactile pleasure (a rather broad definition), then it becomes more likely that "gorilla art" is actually art. I've seen this type of debate before in the context of the question "Are video games art?" Just remember that the problem is usually one of communication.

<p>I'm so sick and tired of people on wikipedia redefining words. True DNA says that chimps are closer to humans than they are to other apes, so now we have to redefine ape to include humans. Why not just redefine humans to include chimps, it would make just as much sense, and than we could describe ourselves as non-chimp humans. Ape is a physical category not a genetic category. If you want a term that describes the broader group that only humans and apes belong to, then find or create such a word. That's how language progresses. But redefining words that have existing meanings does nothing but create confusion and destroys the English language.--Zalgebra 03:33, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand that the decision to exclude humans from the ape family was arbitrary, and that it makes more scientific sense to include them, but neologisms like "non-human ape" are not the solution. That will confuse the living hell out of anyone who reads a biology book written before the neoligism was created. Instead just accept the fact that apes are an arbitrary classification that has been debunked by modern genetics and find a new term that unifies both humans and apes into a single category. As we see on the monkey article, it's hard enough for people to agree when multiple definitions of one word actually exist.

<li>The situation is not really all that confusing. I'm not sure it is fair to say that, "to exclude humans from the ape family was arbitrary." It is probably better to say that natural human biases about how to classify humans resulted in classifications that later had to be abandoned after objective cladistic analyses were possible. "Scientific authorities" at one time went around saying that the Sun could not be very old because no chemical fuel source could last very long. Once fusion was discovered, it became clear that the old view was wrong and that a nuclear fuel could last for billions of years. I do not accept the argument that we are creating problems by recognizing in <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">this Wikipedia article</a> that it makes sense to think of humans as apes and that we <i>can</i> start using terms such as "non-human ape".

<dd>Scientists are the ones who determine what the terms "ape" and "human" mean (from a scientific perspective), therefore if scientists say humans are apes, then that is what we are taxinomically. If you are going to argue we are not apes, don't try to do it from a (quasi) scientific perspective. You have a whole lot more of a chance from a non-scientific perspective. But since wikipedia tends to be biased (rightly or wrongly) towards an academic (and in this case, scientific) world view, I doubt that would work too well either. As far as I know, there isn't any debate in the scientific community as to our classification as apes, and any one who does debate it would surely be in an extreme minority position (and therefore not really important to us). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_Wikipedian_kitchen_68b8.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/Wikipedian kitchen"><font color="green"><sup>The Wiki Kitchen!</sup></font></a> 01:16, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep, humans are apes, in the sense that on all the evidence (palaeontological, genetic, morphological, etc) we are more closely related to two of the species of ape (chimpanzee and bonobo) than they or we are to the remaining apes (gorilla, orangutan, gibbons); we therefore fit within the group, and without us it does not make sense as a group. Now, of course there are other cases of such situations where we would not put one group inside another; for example, birds may well be more closely related to some reptiles than remaining reptiles are to one another. However in such cases (a) the distinct group contains many species (in the case of birds, thousands) not just one; and (b) there has been a long period of separation (in the case of birds, perhaps 200 million). Whereas in the case of humans' separation from the rest of the apes, we are talking about a single species, and the time of separation is about 5 million years, a twinkling of the eye in evolutionary terms. I can't think of any remotely similar case where we would say that a species with such a relationship to a group was not a member of that group. <a href="../../../s/e/g/User%7ESeglea_8627.html" title="User:Seglea">seglea</a> 05:25, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ahhhhhhhhh, but where are the <i>documents</i> that show proof that scientists consider humans apes? I don't see any. And most science based websites don't include humans as apes. Please also be aware that it was the SCIENTISTS to say humans are apes, AND you forget the fact that a minority of scientists disagree. Scientists can say anything they want and people are forced to believe it. Also, seglea, you should note the fact that EVERY OTHER non-human PRIMATE has diferent qualities than humans, which should seperate humans from apes. 1. hair doesn't cover our bodies everywhere (or do you have hair everywhere?), 2. Humans can stand upright, unless they have a disability, 3. Uhhh, we're not ugly retards that knuckle walk (at least I'm not), 4.

<dd>I've never seen a scientist that debates humans are apes. I'm an anthropology major, and every anthro teacher I've had says humans are apes (that would be a total of 4). So have my textbooks. There may be a few scientists who debate it, but wikipedia policy is that extreme minority positions (and I'm sure that would be one) don't have any place on wikipedia. Unless you can show with reliable sources that a significant number of scientists disagree that we are apes, then the issue is pretty much over from a scientific stand point. As for your specific examples, 1) we <i>do</i> have hair all over our bodies, most of it is sparse, short and usually light-colored (why do you think women shave their legs? For the fun of it?). 2) All apes have a tendency towards upright posture and most (and I think all, but can't remember for sure) are capable of <i>limited</i> bipedalism. That is what seperates us from <i>other</i> apes--we are predominantly bipedal. 3) I can't judge whether you're ugly or not, I can't see you. Also, it's true that we don't knuckle walk. Neither do gibbons or siamangs, but they're still apes. Besides, we've already established that we have a different form of locomotion than other apes. 4) That's due to the difference in locomotor patterns, which is already discussed. And guess what, chimps and gorillas have shorter arm-to-leg ratios than gibbons and siamangs because they don't brachiate as much. And we brachiate less than chimps and gorillas, so ours our even shorter. 5) Also due to locomotor patterns. You're basically just repeating yourself on all these last ones. You have only identified two real differences--hair and movement. All the others relate directly to the different ways of moving. We are the only (relatively) "hairless" bipedal apes, but we're still apes. Just because there is variation between us and some of the other apes does not mean we aren't apes. We still fit the basic description. If anything are an exagerated caricature of the other apes, since we take many of the tendencies they have (increased intelligence, upright posture, less facial prognathism etc) and take them to an extreme. It's like when a cartoonist draws extra big ears on Bush--he doesn't really have ears that big, but he does have larger ears than most. We're like a cartoon of the other apes--they're not as intelligent or as upright, but they do have those a tendency for those things, and the farther you go evolutionarily, the more they are exhibited, until you get to us and get a really exagerated form of ape. Interesting side note, one of my anthro professors made the interesting observation that the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greys.html" title="Greys">grey aliens</a> seem to be even more exagerated in some of those ape tendencies (absolutely no hair, even more slender and upright, super-intelligent with really huge heads). Not to say they are apes too (or even real), it was just interesting to notice. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_Wikipedian_kitchen_68b8.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/Wikipedian kitchen"><font color="green"><sup>The Wiki Kitchen!</sup></font></a> 01:16, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>(iv) One of the earliest results of <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molecular_systematics.html" title="Molecular systematics">molecular systematics</a> was confirmation of the pattern of descent within the great apes that had been hypothesised on morphological grounds. Bailey et al, 1991 (<i>Molecular Biology and Evolution, 8</i>, 155-184), showed that genomic analysis, "supports the taxonomic grouping of all extant hominoids into family Hominidae, the division of Hominidae into subfamilies Hylobatinae (gibbons) and Homininae, the division of Homininae into tribes Pongini (orangutans) and Hominini, and the division of Hominini into subtribes Gorillina (gorillas) and Hominina (chimpanzees and humans)". This paper has been referred to (cited) over 100 times in the scientific literature since it was published. I have just looked at the titles and abstracts of a good sample of the papers that cite it and cannot find a single one that challenges its conclusion; indeed Wildman et al, 2003 (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 100, 7181-7188), go further and argue that the chimpanzee and bonobo should be included in genus <i><a href="../../../h/o/m/Homo_%28genus%29.html" title="Homo (genus)">Homo</a></i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To say "humans are not apes" is on a par with saying "humans are not animals". There is a sense - a nursery sense - in which we use "animals" to mean "non-human animals". Similarly there is a sense in which we could use "apes" to mean "non-human apes". Perhaps some people do use it that way. But nowadays scientists, by and large, don't. <a href="../../../s/e/g/User%7ESeglea_8627.html" title="User:Seglea">seglea</a> 20:22, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

¿¿To say "humans are not apes" is on a par with saying "humans are not animals"?? OK. Then, to say "ants are not wasps" is on par with saying "ants are not animals". El PaleoFreak 21:35, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do a simple search of scientific publications with the keywords "apes" and "humans" (Use scholar.google.com, for example). You'll find tons of papers in which humans are not considered "apes", and they are strictly and rigorously using the phylogenetic taxonomy. It's not "The Science" who consider that we are apes; it's some scientists and some wikipedists. El PaleoFreak 21:35, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An exercise. Identify the clade that corresponds to apes. Check to see if humans are in that clade. Hint, use the cladograms in the <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">Ape</a> article. If you still do not think that humans are apes, find a published cladogram that supports a different way to classify humans by placing humans outside of the ape clade. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 03:16, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's not a clade that corresponds to apes. That's the BIG ERROR. Not all words we use when talking about animals can be assigned to a clade. There is a clade that corresponds to humans and apes: <i>Hominoidea</i>. "Ape" is not a taxonomic term. The taxonomic term is <i>Hominoidea</i>, which means something like "humanoids". Human are not apes; apes (and us) are "humanoids". El PaleoFreak 23:09, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's the promoters of that change who should explain themselves. I've talked with some of them, and they told me that calling humans "apes" can be good at fighting creationism, and also can be good for the public understanding of evolution (I've tested this with some people and the results weren't very good: they got more confused). They agreed with me that it's a proposal, not a fact.

<dd>"If they aren't apes, what are they?" We are mammals, primates, anthropoids, hominoids, humans. What's the problem with this? "Saying that humans aren't apes is like saying that sparrows aren't birds" - No; it's like saying that ants aren't wasps (see above). Sparrows are birds, of course, but humans aren't apes. "Its categorically and logically absurd" - You haven't shown why. And read our arguments, please.

<p>Hominoidea IS the ape family, much like Plantalia is the plant family. And much as William Shatner is a TV actor and a thespian, humans are hominids and apes. Hominidae is a family under apes, and homindae includes a chain leading directly to humans. Humans are Eukaryota, Animalia,Eumetazoa, Bilateria, Deuterostomia, Chordate,Craniata, Vertebrata, Gnathostomata,Teleostomi, Tetrapoda, Amniota, Synapsida, Mammalia,Eutheria, Euarchontoglires,Euarchonta, Primates, Haplorrhini,Simiiformes, Catarrhini, Hominoidea,Hominidae,Homininae, Hominini, Hominina, Homo, Homo sapiens and Homo sapiens sapiens.

<p><i>Hominoidea</i> is the ape family and the human family, much like the <i>Hymenoptera</i> clade is the wasp clade and the ants and bees clade&#160;:o) There are lots of papers where humans are not considered apes.

<p>Most of these articles are edited and retouched for public consumption. Humans and apes is a term much like the similar term humans and animals. Although they are the same thing, they are not referred to due to public unfamiliarity with humans being called apes or animals. Its hyperbole for familiarities sake. For another example, on the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Grievous_6859.html" title="General Grievous">General Grievous</a> page, it refers to him by his best known name, and not by his real name, Qymaen Jai Sheelal. However, it explains early on his real name in the article itself. Humans are one of the great <b>apes</b>, not seperate from other apes. There is no logical reason, other than anthropocentrist delusions of grandeur or religious fundamentalism to not accept that humans are apes. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Patrick_198a.html" title="User:Lord Patrick">Lord Patrick</a> 01:51, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's easy to see biases and stupid "-isms" in the others' heads instead of discussing their arguments, isn't it?

<p>Alright then. What about the fact that the only major difference between humans and other apes is size, fur, bipedality, and sapience. Wasps are highly different, socially and anatomically, from bees. Both humans and chimpanzees, orangutans, lemurs, bonobos etc are group animals, that collaborate in structured hierachy based societies that are often gender segregated. Both are omnivorous, and capable of organized warfare between groups. Both have two five fingered hands and two five toed feet. Humans are apes. Why is it so hard for you to accept this? <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Patrick_198a.html" title="User:Lord Patrick">Lord Patrick</a> 01:55, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>¿"Size, fur, bipedality, and sapience"? I count four differences, not "one major difference"&#160;:-) (I'd remove "size" and add some other things instead). The number and the importance of the differences between humans and apes (or between wasps and bees and ants) would bring us hours of interesting discussions. The fact is, the term "ape" doesn't include "human" except for *some* scientists and *some* people, and they have failed at giving us a good rational or scientific supporting argument. Why is it so hard for me to accept your claims? Because you continue repeating it dogmatically: "humans are apes. Humans are apes. Humans are apes. You have to accept this. You have to accept this". That's not convincing, sorry. El PaleoFreak --213.60.21.111 16:07, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You seem to be missing the points I was making. I was simply giving my point of view which is that it's the vast majority of scientists. I am not asking you to believe me but I am saying if you want me (or anyone else) to believe you you'll need some evidence to convince me. As a biologist myself, I find it hard to believe that it isn't the vast majority but again, I'm not trying to prove this to anyone. I'm simply expressing a POV which is contrary to what you have stated (and you were the first person to try and quantify how many scientists believe humans are apes). My second point which you also appeared to have missed is that there is a big difference between a scientist failing to distinguish between non-human apes and apes in a paper (or whatever) and a scientist who believes humans are not apes. The only way you can know whether or not a scientist believes humans are not apes is by asking them. Finally IMHO you suggestion is more radical. Since there is no strong evidence either way, whichever suggestion is more radical is irrelevant. However as the first person to make the claim and as the person who is trying to convince others to believe you, it is up to you to provide evidence <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 13:57, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You shouldn't offer any evidence to convince me, you are simply giving your point of view, but I should, on the contrary, give evidence to convince you. That's superiority!&#160;;-) A person wrote (see above) that "Science" says humans are apes. That was the claim I'm replying. Evidence should be given to prove THAT claim. I'm not triying to "quantify" anything. I can find a lot of actual science examples where humans are not considered apes (I think what scientists "believe" is not relevant: "The Science" is not about polls; it's about scientific publications). I can also find examples of the other side. I don't know what percentage of "The Science" states that humans are apes, but I have provide a way to see there's not agreement or consensus at the scientific community on this particular issue. And this is a "jargon" issue, not a philogeny or taxonomy issue. In other words, it's not a very "scientific" issue. El PaleoFreak --213.60.21.111 19:06, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This has nothing to do with superiority. It has to do with the fact you are trying to convince me of your POV. I am not trying to convince you of my POV. I simply mentioned what I believe to illustrate why I don't believe you. If you can't offer any evidence for what you believe, then there is no reason for me to believe you. I do have reasons for what I believe, specifically because of my experiences and interactions. As I've mentioned I am a biologist. Therefore, it would take good evidence for you to convince me otherwise. Again, I'm not trying to convince you of my believe, so whether or not you believe me is irrelevant and this has nothing to do with 'superiority'. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the original statement. Whether or not the statement you were replying to has any evidence is irrelevant (as I'm not debating that issue here). You made a statement and I'm challenging you to prove it. If you are unable to prove it, or offer any evidence then just say so. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 15:39, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Scientists believe all sort of things and the only way you can know what they believe is by asking them. I hate to repeat myself but as I've said time and time again, <b>THERE IS A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SCIENTIST FAILING TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN NON-HUMAN APES AND APES AND A SCIENTIST WHO BELIEVS HUMANS ARE NOT APES</b>. Sorry for the bold caps but since I've said this 3 times, drastic measures were called for. So far, all you've tolds us is that scientists sometimes fail to differentiate between non-human apes and apes. This doesn't prove scientists don't believe humans are apes or that the paper was intended to claim humans are not apes. Unless you can quote a specific statement in a paper where it was said "humans are not apes" then your evidence is meaningless. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 15:39, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, I am not arguing about the original sentence. As I stated above, it's completely irrelevant. You seem to believe it is only a small proportion of scientists who believe humans are apes. I believe it is the vast majority. Neither of use are offering any evidence of our claims. I asked you to provide evidence but you are unwilling or unable. If you don't want to, you should have just said so in the first place rather then getting into a heated argument over nothing. This was and is the main issue that I'm discussing here. I think I've made that clear from the start but you appear to have misunderstood me either on purpose or by accident.

<dd>I think you've made your point, Lord Patrick. There's no need to keep repeating the same argument - remember that this is a discussion page and not a forum. It's both fully clear that there are vast differences between humans and other apes, and that humans are biologically apes. The issue has been resolved as far as the article goes, and any further discussion here is little more than turning Wikipedia into a soap box.

<dd>ElPaleo-Why are we animals? There is just as much reason to say we're not animals as we're not apes. Neither are scientific terms per se and if we're in your apparent opinion, particularly different from other apes then we're also particularly different from other animals... So why not have humans as distinct from animals and apes? BTW, your argument about paper titles also applies here. If you do a search, you will find A LOT of papers where scientists talk about humans and animals. Of course, the same issue which I keep bringing up applies here. It doesn't in any way show that the writers of said papers are saying that humans are not animals or that they are trying to show humans are not animals in the paper <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 16:09, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think so. The argument "if we are animals, then we are apes" is a fallacy. A similar one can be formulated this way: "If we are animals, then we are lemurs". Or "if apes are animals, then apes are humans". You are right about those papers about humans and animals. I'm a bit surprised&#160;:o) What can I say? Humans have been classified as animals (<a href="../../../a/n/i/Animalia.html" title="Animalia">Animalia</a>) since the origins of Taxonomy. This doesn't apply for "apes", a non taxonomic term but a common term that never meant humans. El PaleoFreak--213.60.21.111 11:33, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, you seem to have completely missed my point (and also came up with a silly argument). I wasn't saying if we are animals, we are apes. I was asking you why you believe we are animals. Animals and apes are not taxomonic terms per se. <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animalia.html" title="Animalia">Animalia</a> is but animals and <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animalia.html" title="Animalia">Animalia</a> ARE NOT the same word. Therefore, the question remains what does the word 'animals' mean? To you, it mean's <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animalia.html" title="Animalia">Animalia</a>. However to Voortle it does not. This is just a valid argument as your argument that apes does not mean <a href="../../../h/o/m/Hominoidea.html" title="Hominoidea">Hominoidea</a>. If apes doesn't mean <a href="../../../h/o/m/Hominoidea.html" title="Hominoidea">Hominoidea</a> then waht does it mean? To you, it means non-<i>Homo sapiens</i> <a href="../../../h/o/m/Hominoidea.html" title="Hominoidea">Hominoidea</a>. Similarly, to Voortle animals means non-<i>Homo sapiens</i> <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animalia.html" title="Animalia">Animalia</a>. In both your views, humans are unique among other <a href="../../../h/o/m/Hominoidea.html" title="Hominoidea">Hominoidea</a>. In Voortle's view, humans are unique amongst <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animalia.html" title="Animalia">Animalia</a>. Now obviously you don't have to believe both. However both are equally 'valid' arguments and come from the same basic idea. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:24, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

We are animals, and birds are dinosaurs. But <a href="../../../h/o/m/Hominoidea.html" title="Hominoidea">Hominoidea</a> doesn't mean "apes". <a href="../../../h/o/m/Hominoidea.html" title="Hominoidea">Hominoidea</a> means something like "humanoids".

<dd>As for the papers. I was not surprised at all. Indeed it was what I expected. As I've stated, this has nothing to do with said scientists believing or trying to suggest humans are not animals. Indeed if you were to suggest that to the authors of the paper they'd probably think you were an idiot. The reality is the words apes and animals are English words not taxonomic terms. As such, they are often used in certain contexts to mean different things. It's much simpler to talk about humans and animals rather then humans and non-human animals. Similarly, it's easier to talk about humans and apes rather then humans and non-human apes. The meaning is understood and it's usually not a problem. Scientific journals are only really read by scientists and rarely are scientists going to think the title is suggesting humans are not apes or humans are not animals. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:24, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agaim, you have failed to provide an explain as to why that has to be so. Animals could mean animalia, it could not mean animalia. Both are English words. Similarly ape could mean hominoidea, it could mean something else. This of course has nothing to do with the specific point I was making here. The specific point I was making is that scientists use the word animals to exclude humans in some contexts and they also use the word apes to exclude humans in some contexts. Neither means the scientists believes humans aren't animals. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 20:42, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you don't want to provide such evidence, that's up to you. Please don't get sidetracked here or bring up other issues. These are not issues I want to discuss here.

<p>I'm seeking some consensus here. It seems to me that one of the reasons we keep getting in to arguments is because an apparent believe by some that scientists are trying to change the English language. I don't believe this is the case. To the vast majority of scientists, in a scientific sense ape means Hominoidea and animal means <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animalia.html" title="Animalia">Animalia</a>. There is no other sensible definition since we are not unique, despite what some people like to believe. However I also think most scientists don't have a problem with the fact that both these are English words and so are used to mean different things in different contexts.</p>
<p>Specifically, ape and animal are used to mean non-human Hominoidea and non-human <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animalia.html" title="Animalia">Animalia</a>. We are human and so there are a lot of reasons why we often want to refer to these groups excluding humans. Especially in titles and the like it's simpler but the meaning is usually understood. Even on wikipedia, we have a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_apes.html" title="List of apes">list of apes</a>. In the article, we point our humans are apes but excluded, however I don't think anyone is likely to propose the list be renamed to list of non-human apes. These words are also used within context to convey certain meanings. For example, if you say "person A is an animal in bed" few scientists are going to come out and say "well person A is an animal, duh!" (and when they do, it would usually be in an attempt to be funny). Or if you say "person B is behaving like an ape" few scientist are going to come out and say "well person B is an ape, duh!".</p>
<p>The problem arises when people start saying humans are not animals/apes. To most scientists, this is just plain silly since as I've stated, there is no scientific reason to say were not. These ideas smack of misguided superiority notions and/or religious fundamentalism opposed to key scientific concepts such as evolution. When it comes to wikipedia, we are an encyclopaedia not a dictionary. While there are probably merits to point out the words ape and animal are used to mean Hominoidea and Animalia excluding humans in a dictionary, there is no reason to do so in an encylopaedia.</p>
<p>I don't think this is going to settle ElPaleo or Voortle concerns but does this help to address the concerns of others who keep wanting us to say humans are not apes</p>

<p>I will use your logic to prove dogs aren't canids; Dogs are unique. They are domesticated, have less fur, are very varied in appearance, size, and personality, and are widely considered to be great companions. Therefore, dogs are not canids.

<p>One that should be removed. "ape" never refers to humans. "ape" refers to hominoids that are not human. When someone calls someone a "ape", it's an insult.

<dd>Nonsense. Nigger is a bigoted and racist term used by people with no scientific qualification to comment on black people. Ape is a biological term used by scientists and biologists to refer more easily to "Hominoidea". When we are using ape in this article, we are using it in the scientific sense, not the derogatory sense. Saying humans aren't apes or humans aren't animals is as silly as saying fish aren't meat. A common yet completely unscientific position. It is 99% of the time motivated by either egoism, religious fundamentalism, or both.</dd>

<dd>Ape is a term used by <b>some</b> scientists to biasely refer to "Hominoidea". Other scientists simply say "Hominoids" when they refer to <i>Hominoidea</i>. Easy, unambiguous and not biased. They also use the word "apes" to refer to... the apes (four handed, speachless furry hominoids: Orang-outans, gorillas, chimps). This wiki article is hiding the second use.--91.117.8.46 14:19, 28 January 2007 (UTC) El PaleoFreak</dd>

<dd>Suppose some scientists were to group certain people (including black people) under a group which they called "niggers" and then claimed that black people were technically niggers and that they were using the word in a scientific sense rather than a derogatory sense. I'm pretty sure their would be plenty of arguments from people that that was a personal attack. It's the same with scientists using "ape" to refer to humans. It's a personal attack. Grouping people or certain groups of people under a derogatory term is a personal attack. Since scientists have the word "hominoid", why not use the to group humans with the chimpanzees etc. rather than using the derogatory term "ape" which is no less bad than grouping certain humans using the derogatory term "nigger". <a href="../../../v/o/o/User%7EVoortle_783b.html" title="User:Voortle">Voortle</a> 03:17, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, your definition of personal attack is skewed. A personal attack is, according to Roget's New Millenium Thesaurus, "attack someone's reputation" or "attempt to defame another".

<dd>They aren't the same word. But in the scientific context, ape means hominoidea. Just as similarly as animal means animalia. So we are both apes and animals. Some may find this offensive. If you don't want to consider yourself an ape, that's up to you. Also, I should point out that most scientists think that biologically/genetically, race is a meaningless concept. So it's rather unlikely biologists will decide to call anyone a nigger (this isn't the only flaw in your suggestion but it's a key one) <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 20:56, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>(I've modified this comment of mine after doing some more editing on the article)</p>
<p>I have removed the following section from the "Cultural aspects..." section. It isn't about cultural aspects in the sense of the rest of material in that section, and it is well below the quality standards of Wikipedia (and of most of the rest of this article). I will add some quick notes on scientific work on ape cognition to replace it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Humans and the other apes share many similarities, including the ability to properly use tools and imitate others. Recent studies at <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale.html" title="Yale">Yale</a> test some of these similarities. A professor and his/her students gave a challenge to baby humans and baby chimps. Both groups were shown a way that might solve this challenge. However, neither group knew that the solution they were shown was incorrect. Both times the baby humans tried to complete the challenge, they imitated what they were shown and failed at the attempt. The chimpanzee babies also failed their first attempt, as they too mimicked what they were shown. However, on their second attempt, they created a novel solution, and thus completed the challenge. The professor interpreted this as meaning that baby chimps learn from experience, while baby humans just imitate what they are shown. This gave scientists key information in understanding the cultural aspects of ape life and evolutionary similarities between humans and apes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There have also been recent breakthroughs in evidence of ape culture that go beyond what was explained above. This was further explored by scientists at the convention in St. Louis.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Instead, I have added some very brief notes outlining some main findings on behaviour and evolution. It obviously could be greatly expanded, but most of what might go in it is probably better placed on other pages (for example, the social behaviour has so little coherence that it is much better placed with the individual species or groups). Cognition has more uniformity, but could become enormous; perhaps we should have a page on "Ape cognition". This whole section could do with a lot more referencing, though the links to other pages will lead to references - I don't have time to do it at the moment.</p>

<p>The furor over humans as apes basically derives from the unaccustomed use of the term ape to mean human. Now, it can only be unaccustomed for one of two reasons, either it is something new, or it was invented for this article only. If some palaeoanthropologists want to call us apes and Wikipedia wants to report that fact then let us have the citations on BOTH sides of the issue. Without those citations this track is either wrong or is original research and in either case does not belong on Wikipedia. We have had plenty of discussion, so much so someone has seen fit to warn us. I think we are over the discussion phase and some of you do also, one way or the other. Now it is time to settle this properly. There is no point at all in taking a vote. It is NOT up to us to decide the question, only to report what palaeoanthropologists are doing. And beware, stop drawing your own conclusions from what they are saying in scientific language. What I want to see is, some palaeoanthropologist of repute who classifies man as a great ape explicitly: "the hominidae are great apes", "man is a great ape.". Nothing less will do. And then I want to see some statement that other palaeoanthropologists do NOT use this terminology. Find me a scientist who translates Hominidae or Homininae as "Great Ape." In blunt terms, put up or shut up. Now, others have already put citation requests in here, as this is the next logical step. Well, if that is not enough, we can escalate to accuracy and original research tags and pop this into the lap of the administrators. As this is a major educational issue, to promulgate an encyclopedia to impressionable youngsters calling us great apes, and to put it on a CD, I think we owe it to ourselves as public to be sure of what we are talking about, don't you? What also might happen is, Wikipedia will lose whatever credibility in this field it had and the article will slide into chaos, like so many others.<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotteville_e5b2.html" title="User:Botteville">Dave</a> 02:19, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Uther. You seem to keep deleting whatever I do. I see also you are on the committee for this and also you have a barnstar. And I must say there is a lot about the artcle that is right. That does not mean you are always right. Here is what I think the article needs and what I propose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split it into ape and Hominoidea. The two are not identical and people want to know what Hominoidea are without being told they are apes.</li>
<li>Stop calling humans great apes. That is contrary to the English language. Look it up in any dictionary.</li>
<li>Remove "Cultural Aspects of non-human apeas" as being unsupported opinion and original work.</li>
</ul>
<p>I appreciate the "Changes in taxonomy over time" with the nice tree diagrams and that Homo and Pan come out to be Hominins. Sounds reasonable. That does not make humans great apes any more than it make great apes humans. An ape will never be a human in the English language and Wikipedia's attempts to make them so are original research.</p>
<p>There is one more issue. You keep deleting my requests for citations with the simple note "ridiculous." By what authority do you do that? And quit calling me "ridiculous." I appreciate that in order to get a good article someone has to take charge of it. I wouldn't want you to get frustrated and quit. So, I will just leave this up to your conscience. But, here is a question for you to ponder: are you insisting on the ape=human equation to shock the public or to inform them? I'm leaving this article now as I have other things to do, but I'll be checking back to see what it looks like later. After all, we do have a public.

<dd>That's like saying you can't end a sentence with a preposition. It's ridiculous. Words are defined by how they're used and nothing more than that. "nonhuman ape" is a term up of which Wikipedia should not put.

<dd>That comparison is not quite accurate. The preposition rule is relatively arbitrary. However, while <i>ape</i> tends to be reserved for nonhumans in lay usage, it has a relatively strict meaning in biology. In general, biological groupings tend to follow <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clade.html" title="Clade">clades</a> (not all are, though the trend is towards increasing use). That is, a group should consist of an organism and <i>all</i> of its descendants; a portion should not be excluded (this would be <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraphyly.html" title="Paraphyly">paraphyly</a>. From a biological standpoint, there are several good reasons to consider all descendants within the grouping, and that's why <i>ape</i> is usually used to refer to the entire superfamily; excluding one genus (or one species!) from the superfamily doesn't make a whole lot of biological sense. The article should certainly reflect, though, that common usage differs from the biological usage (as it does for many things). Finally, I would suggest that when you keep reusing the (possibly) Churchill quotation, it loses its effectiveness. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 19:52, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
