<dd>Eh you can pretty much do what you want with your talk page... it's just a personal preference. Generally people just let 50+ messages pile up then archive it, but there's no actual rule saying you have to do that. You're doing a great job with the Super Bowl XL article by the way. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 21:51, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>As an FYI, there's no real need to repeat yourself in multiple places saying pretty much the same thing under every Keep vote; it just clutters the discussion, and people can (and do) read the rationale at the top of the discussion.

<p>Hi, there. I recently added a bunch of Adriana Trigiani links to <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Stone_Gap%2C_Virginia_3fad.html" title="Big Stone Gap, Virginia">Big Stone Gap, Virginia</a>. I noticed that you also added a couple of links about the Jones brothers.</p>
<p>In retrospect, both the links I added for Trigiani and the links you added about the Jones brothers would probably make more sense in the articles for the respective individuals rather than the Big Stone Gap article. Do you agree with me on this? --<a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakeel_bd6a.html" title="User:Takeel">Takeel</a> 00:41, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sure there are such links already in the Jones brothers' articles. You can remove the links from the Big Stone Gap article if you think they don't really belong there, just thought they might add some context. I can see your point, though. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 00:43, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You'd be surprised! There was no section on either brother's page for external links until just minutes ago. I added one to each of their articles and moved the links from the Big Stone Gap page into those sections. Thanks for working on the Big Stone Gap article and, by proxy, its related articles. I've been doing some work on them lately, but I've been somewhat hesistant about it since these articles don't seem to gather a lot of attention. This results in a lower level of community review, which usually means that errors slip in undetected. --<a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakeel_bd6a.html" title="User:Takeel">Takeel</a> 00:58, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought I ought to write here rather than on the SB XL page, since I think our disagreements about that page in specific are largely settled. I think we disagree about whether I actually used any more words than necessary in the article (I readily concede to using more on talk pages, since we needn't to be encyclopedic here); I believe that the two principle sentences with which you had issue needed to be enlarged in order that the grammar should be correct, with which contention I don't think you're in accord. My edits, specifically, of the officiating section certainly seemed to lengthen the section, but not, I think, because they involved the insertion of repetitious words but because they involved the addition of new info (the King article, to which my link was bad). All that said, I think each of us has made clear his thoughts on the matter and that, further, the article is now in good shape. Although I undertook a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_XL&amp;diff=36602053&amp;oldid=36587554" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_XL&amp;diff=36602053&amp;oldid=36587554" rel="nofollow">major edit</a> of the article prior to the game, I didn't touch it during February (Winter Olympics, after all) but see that you contributed greatly and well to the article, and, in view of all of your contributions and the genuinely congenial tone you take on the SB XL talk page, I believe most sincerely that your critiques of my additions have been wholly constructive, and I thank you for that. If you were to look at my history, you would likely find (I say immodestly) that I have been a good editor, and I have surely found that about you as well. I look forward to our continued Wikiparticipation. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:14, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, please take this as friendly advice. I noticed on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bizu-Bizu_8cf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bizu-Bizu">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bizu-Bizu</a> that you are saying that you don't see how your recent behaviour on the AfDs violates <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Frankly, I have to say that what you've been doing is, IMHO, pretty much the canonical example of a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation and I would expect a lot of other editors will see it the same way. If you don't see it that way, that's fine, but I'm just letting you know that that is how it's going to be perceived by the community. If you'd like to discuss this further, I'm willing and I could explain things in more detail to you. Long story short, this sort of activity is going to do a lot more towards annoying your fellow editors and thus indirectly hurting your cause if you're trying to get these articles deleted.

<ul>
<li>Look, I have no problem keeping an open mind about things. I've only been editing since January, so I welcome constructive criticism. What I mind is you not explaining why you believe this, which really makes it difficult for me to help you and the other editors out. You seem to be approaching this with a "You know why you did this" attitude. What I'm trying to communicate to you is "No, I don't." <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 02:54, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>FWIW, I don't think the massive PRODding to have been done in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith</a> or even to have been <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disruption to make a point</a>. It often happens at AfD that, toward the proposition of "keep", one adduces the existence of another article about a subject of similar notability or verifiability (for an elucidation, see, inter al., <a href="../../../p/k/m/WP%7EPKMN_4859.html" title="WP:PKMN">the Pokemon test</a>); our typical posture is to say that, since the other article has existed for some time and has not been challenged at AfD, we ought to keep the article about which the debate is ongoing. This seems, really, to be a case of one's choosing the road of least resistance, which, where one has a deeply- and sincerely-held belief that a consensus will develop toward the deletion of most of the articles, proves deleterious to the encyclopedia. Certainly, were one to nominate the sundry drinking games for deletion (prior to PRODding), were he/she to PROD articles absent any possibility for a consensus toward deletion, or were he/she to PROD many articles having been upset at the AfDing of an article he/she thinks ought to be kept, one could impute bad faith or infer disruptive purpose. Here, it seems simply to be a case of one's having a sincere (and well-reasoned) belief that, if one article is to be deleted, many others ought to be, and that, since the former article ought to be deleted, he/she ought, at least, to start a discussion with respect to the latter. As I recently noted at the <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Kevin_Smith_4243.html" title="Le Kevin Smith">Le Kevin Smith</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Le_Kevin_Smith_dc45.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Le Kevin Smith">AfD</a>, I considered nominating en masse for deletion the bios of otherwise non-notable football players that were created upon the drafting of the players; such nomination would not have been done to prove a point and would, instead, have been intended to address with celerity a large-scale problem. Whether other editors will perceive <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violations is a wholly different question; whether they should is, IMHO, well-settled. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:29, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OK, I think I've figured out why Deville would suggest this is a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. It was probably due to the fact that I added all those prods, probably should have just tagged them AfD to begin with. Still, I'm pissed off that some editors apparently love to jump to the conclusion that things are done in bad faith and rip on whoever made them. Shame on them. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 03:58, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi, I don't think that there was anything really wrong with the mass prodding and bringing the multiple entries for deletion at the same time, at least in the sense that I don't think that you were acting in bad faith, or trying to make a point there. But, then, later, comments like <i>Well, if we delete this, we're going to have to go hog-wild deleting the articles linked in "Drinking game." There's a rather long list of them and each have their own articles.</i> do very much seem like you're trying to make the point of "Well, if you all won't agree with deleting the ones I want deleted, then noone should delete any of the articles like this", or, that's how it comes across. Getting an article you think is bad kept because it's like another article you thought should have been deleted <i>is</i> making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.

<li>Yeah I suppose I can see how it would come off that way. Still, the way I was arguing the point in the deletion debate should have shown that I was sincere about it. In any event I'm done with the matter. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 17:55, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the record -- as if anyone's keeping one, but anyway -- I would just like to state that I think Aplomado's edits regarding these drinking games were done in good faith and without any intention of disrupting Wikipedia, never mind disrupting it to make a point. I can see why someone might disagree with his edits, sure, but accusing him of violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is just silly. He was going after articles he felt vere unsourced, unverifiable and non-notable. I don't see a problem with that. Using AfD rather than PROD would probably have been a good move, yeah, but that's not the same thing as doing a bunch of bad faith edits. Not even close. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 04:35, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>You've been going around claiming that "gamers" are introducing a lot of crufty articles into Wikipedia. While I'm sure that is true, it is only fair to also mention that those of us who are active in this area have gone to some lengths to discourage this kind of work. Take a look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_and_video_games_662f.html#Scope_of_information" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games">Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games#Scope of information</a>. Anyway I'm a gamer and I encourage your efforts to counter cruft. Just try not to generalise all gaming contributors into one category, since there's a lot of excellent contributors in this subject area.

<p>Hi there. I've added the "{{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}" template to the article List of prank flash animations, suggesting that it be deleted according to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">proposed deletion</a> process. All contributions are appreciated, but I don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and I've explained why in the article (see also <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a>).

<p>deletion of this page has occurred before, and has simply led to the main prank flash article becoming a spam magnet. therefore its better to leave this page up. <a href="../../../z/z/z/User%7EZzzzz_e5d0.html" title="User:Zzzzz">Zzzzz</a> 01:01, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just a brief note to compliment you on the exceptional work you're doing at this AfD; in view of the many sound arguments posited in favor of deletion and paucity of reasoning behind many of the keeps, I can't imagine that it'll be closed as anything other than <i>delete</i>, but a <i>no consensus</i> is always possible, after which we'll head to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">DRV</a>, I imagine. Notwithstanding our past differences (specifically vis-à-vis grammar and syntax in the SB XL art), and setting aside initial inferences that I made apropos of you (which inferences were wholly wrong, I now see), I should say that I'm glad to see your increased participation at AfD; tensions are often heated there, and it's great to find editors who are able to reason well, cogently and succinctly articulate their views (hmm, maybe I could learn something about that...), and who stay <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">calm</a>.

<p>yes i mean it. you proposed an article for deletion steph mekwuye and you included that the name <i>mekwuye</i> does not have anything to do with this person. do people have to prove to you that they own their own sur name? or you are just bored? it is inappropriate to write things you have no idea of and has no iota of truth about whatsoever. next time, please be sure to keep your mouth shut! when you have no information.Stillwaters111 18:54, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Just wanted to make things clear to you since you are not in Fort Wayne and probably don't know the history of this blog. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.246.144.226 (<a href="../../../2/0/6/User_talk%7E206.246.144.226.html" title="User talk:206.246.144.226">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.246.144.226_1670.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.246.144.226">contribs</a>).</small></p>
