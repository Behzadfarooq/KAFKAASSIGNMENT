<li>1) Your version violates the NPOV pillar.</li>
<li>2) As a professional journalist or writer, you already know that you should present both sides of a controversy in equal depth, and for Wikipedia, you should not insert subtle value judgments and bias into your articles.</li>
<li>3) As a Christian, you need to realize that your version is potentially damaging to those who still have a stake in the college's reputation. You have highlighted many negatives about the school, but you have not highlighted many positives. You should not use the PHC Wikipedia entry to upbraid your brothers and sisters in Christ. Please find another vehicle for your grievances.</li>
<li>4) I removed some sections that were not balanced but left many others. If you do not have an axe to grind, then please help me to get this back in balance.</li>

<dd>I agree that the article needs more balance, but your edits make it less balanced, not more. Please also note that I did not write the material that you deleted; the reason I reverted it is because you removed it without justifying the removal. Don't be so eager to judge people. I won't revert again so as to avoid an edit war, but quite frankly I'd be very surprised to see any of the other editors allow this new version to stay as is.</dd>
<dd>BTW, since I see you are new to Wikipedia, I would recommend using talk pages liberally whenever you make extensive edits. It's common courtesy to other editors and it keeps edit wars from developing. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><strong class="selflink">talk</strong></sup> 03:49, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as Michael Gubbins is concerned, if it is deleted, what can I do? I think <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Solaire_759d.html" title="The Solaire">The Solaire</a></i> merits inclusion on Wikipedia due to its uniqueness.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Well, if you can find some information that is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> that demonstrates that Mr. Gubbins meets the guidelines of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, you could probably recreate the article and add that information. If you disagree with the current proposal for deletion, go ahead and remove the notice. It'll probably end up on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a> where the editors will debate its merits. So go ahead and just add the information that you think makes Mr. Gubbins notable.</dd>
<dd>The same principle applies to Solaire, which I think should be fine for now since there's some interesting information at the top of the article. It's important to make the point why the article's subject is notable, that's what the editors look at. Don't include stuff like contact information or anything that would make it look like an advertisement.</dd>
<dd>Good luck, and keep asking any questions you've got. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><strong class="selflink">talk</strong></sup> 05:08, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Aplomado</p>
<p>I want to add an external link to the page about Fanny Brice, namely www.brice.nl (site is in English)</p>
<p>But since this website is owned by my father, and I am the so-called webmaster (I designed it, and by the by, a redesign is coming up in a couple of weeks) I am confused as to if this would be in conflict with personal benefits, so to speak. (I don't know how to express this in English, since my native language is Dutch).</p>
<p>Could you please tell me if it's OK for me to link to our website?</p>
<p>Thanks, Gnorn (aka Martijn)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, unfortunately it probably would be a violation of guidelines for you to post it. See: <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#Links_to_normally_avoid" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links#Links_to_normally_avoid</a>, item #3. But, as that page says, "<i>If it is relevant and informative, mention it on the talk page and let other — neutral — Wikipedia editors decide whether to add the link.</i>" So feel free to bring it up on the article's discussion page and maybe another editor will see fit to add it.

<li>Hi Apomaldi,</li>
</ul>
<p>while doing this edit on <a href="../../../e/b/e/Ebele_Okoye_4d25.html" title="Ebele Okoye">Ebele Okoye</a>, I got information from her website which stated that she trained under a particular well known name in Animation (also featured on Wikipeida). My question is, am I allowed in the edit to mention the people that she trained on. Actually i came across a beautifully written curriculum Vitae on one of her websites which mentioned her early ambitions before she eventualy got into animation and i was wondering if i could write her edit in the same style but of course not with EVERY info...just the necessary ones. You might want to have a look at the said CV at her site www.twenty-five-one.com under <i>the artist</i> Thanks and hoping to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Not to make a fuss, but I am a woman and would like to be referred to as "she" in future. There is a bit of a history behind this request-- otherwise I would just let it pass. Thanks for your attention. Jean Mercer</p>
<p>Also,I don't understand what is appropriate to put into the Attachment Therapy talk that's now going on. I don't see any references to physical restraint discussed under related topics, but people keep saying they are there. This section is surely not to be devoted to wrangling, is it? can you give some direction? Jean Mercer</p>
<hr />
<p>Users DPeterson and JonesRD are treating the AfD page like a talk page -- adding comments to other people's comments, raising extraneous issues, etc. It seems almost like vandalism to me. Is this appropriate behavior on an AfD page? What can be done about it if it isn't? Larry Sarner 23:39, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Other users comments should not be edited, that's vandalism. If they've done such a thing, warn them on their talk page and provide a link to the edit in question. If they do it again, add another warning, regardless of what they say. Eventually, you may have to ask an administrator to ban this person. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><strong class="selflink">talk</strong></sup> 01:28, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have not edited anyone elses comments. However, sarner and/or mercer have done so. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson">DPeterson</a> 01:39, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've edited my own comments, no one else's. I would like to bring up the issue of commercial interests and their disclosure. The authors of Attachment Therapy On Trial, the book apparently being referred to by various people, have realized about $100 apiece from sales over the three years the book has been out, a sum considerably less than preparation of the manuscript cost.We have lectured on this topic without fee and have made some financial sacrifices to bring Attachment Therapy to the attention of the public. To be complete in my disclosure, I once received a plane ticket to go to California to give a talk, but got sick and had to cancel. As has frequently been pointed out, my colleagues and I perform no clinical services and therefore cannot benefit from advertising. On the other hand, Dr. Becker-Weidman, whose work has been mentioned frequently in this discussion, owns a clinic and advertises on the internet; he is paid by families and presumably by insurance carrtiers for work done there. I believe that this form of commercial interest, as well as book royalties, needs to be disclosed for appropriate transparency. Jean Mercer 14:51, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It does not matter the amount of money involved, but the fact of a financial interest among mercer, sarner, and sarner's wife, rosa is the salient issue. In addition, mercer and sarner are leaders of the group ACT, which is another set of ties and financial interests as the ACT (Advocates for Children in Therapy) website shows (<a href="http://www.childrenintherapy.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.childrenintherapy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.childrenintherapy.org/</a>). <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson">DPeterson</a> 14:58, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it matters that we've actually lost money, not gained it, in attempting to publicize an issue that is important but little understood by the public. ACT is, of course, incorporated not for profit, and no one associated with it has ever been paid for work. I note that the previous user does not respond to my statement about fees for clinical services. I'm not saying that people should not comment or "vote", but that interests and connections should be disclosed fully and transparently. I believe I have disclosed mine completely, but would be happy to answer any relevant questions. I hope to see others join me in transparency, and would suggest that Wiki may want to make disclosure a rule where it applies, as professional journals often do. But perhaps the best approach to the Attachment Therapy page would be to create two views, each with the signatures and identifications of author(s), and acknowledge that feelings run high and compromise is difficult or impossible? Identification of authors is certainly a feature of a number of print encyclopedias and would possibly add to Wiki credibility (which I've just seen discussed on a history of science listserv, and it could use polishing).

<p>There is a long running dispute on the <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowlby.html" title="Bowlby">Bowlby</a> page about an item in the Also See section. There is a mediator and advocate involved. I think the discussion has gotten well out of hand. Is there any way you can intervene to end this or suggest what I can to or where I can go to put an end to this? The ones putting up the fight are sarner and mercer, both advocates of ACT, a fringe group devloted to fighting anything related to "attachment therapy," what ever that is. I would really appreciate your help, as would others. The advocates proposal has six or seven in favor of his idea and only sarner and, as of tody, mercer opposed.

<dd>Well I'll see if there's anything I can do, but I know little about attachment theory and I don't have any background in medicine, so it might all be over my head. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><strong class="selflink">talk</strong></sup> 02:35, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>DPeterson, who apparently has a commercial interest in attachment therapy, neglected to tell you that there is already a mediator involved in the Bowlby page (at my request) and that DPeterson's side has employed an advocate (who DPeterson occasionally passes off as an administrator). For my part, I would welcome anyone's participation who has a commitment to Wiki policy, but I would caution anyone inclined to become involved to read the Talk page thoroughly before choosing to get in the middle. Larry Sarner 09:11, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The statement that I have a commercial interest in attachment therapy (whatever that is) is false and untrue. This is one reason why we need some directive administrative intervention; the continued false allegations, off-point arguments, and rigid stance against compromise, collaboration, or consensus. Being a leader of the fringe group ACT, and representing their view and agenda may be part of the problem. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson">DPeterson</a> 13:54, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The appearances of cupidity are pretty strong, and detailed elsewhere. Indeed, this started as a dispute over Mr Becker-Weidman creating the Bowlby page as advertising for his practice. The above reveals another pathology of this group's form of argumentation -- hijacking venues (pages) for personal attacks. Look at what they did to <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrisvegas_c8ec.html" title="User talk:Brisvegas">Brisvegas's page</a>, the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-05-21_John_Bowlby_69ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-05-21 John Bowlby">mediation <i>request</i> page</a>, and now the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Attachment_Therapy_b048.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Attachment Therapy">AfD page</a> (!) and this one. Every innocent bystander is supposed to get their message: ACT is a fringe group of zealots who have no business being editors on Wiki. It'll be interesting to see how far and long real Wikipedians let them get away with it, especially with them now treading so close to admin home by attacking an AfD page. Larry Sarner 15:44, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It would be most helpful to this dialogue if Sarner refrained from being provocative and disrespectful. My readng of material is the Becker-Weidman is Dr. Becker-Weidman and not Mr. Since this has been previously pointed out to Larry Sarner, his continued use of the Mr and not Dr is disrespectful. He should be admonished to stop and to try to conduct the discussion in a civil manner. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamDavidson_1ba9.html" title="User:SamDavidson">SamDavidson</a> 17:10, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>See what I mean? This nonsense will go on ad infinitum if you let it. Larry Sarner 18:19, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The request to act civilly was ignored...He avoided the primary issue, which is in itself disrespectful and provocative. As the other post says, "'<b>He should be admonished to stop and to try to conduct the discussion in a civil manner.'</b>" <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson">DPeterson</a> 19:11, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>See what I mean? Round and round this'll go. Just watch. Larry Sarner 19:16, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>See, when an issue is "on-target," or true, he raises "red-herrings" to avoid having to address the real and substantive issue; in this case his disresepct of a contributor. Let's see if he can address this directly or continues to evade it as he has for a long time now. Just watch. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson">DPeterson</a> 14:17, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So, it's a "red herring" to question why you bother innocent people on their talk pages with your disputes on relevant talk pages? And that's not the "real and substantive issue" <i>here</i>? Larry Sarner 18:25, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aplomado-- can you answer a question, please? Way back in your involvement in all these "attachment" issues, I believe you said there was some sort of Wiki committee that helped to deal with medical articles. I don't remember what you said and can't find it. Could you repeat the information? Thanks. Jean Mercer 12:34, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One comment is: "What was it Becker-Weidman was talking about versus what the U.S. Senate is talking about? If it were me, and I had written a past article saying I use "attachment therapy", and the Senate later makes these statements" Alleging that Dr. Becker-Weidman's material is the same as that addressed by the Senate (rebirthing) despite clarifications in previous posts is one example <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson">DPeterson</a> 12:48, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As is clear from the links I provided, both Becker-Weidman's materials and the Senate resolution refer at some point to "attachment therapy." (The Senate resolution, in addition to "rebirthing," refers to "other forms of attachment therapy.") My question was simply what each meant when they used these terms. I certainly didn't mean to be provocative. I just want to understand what everyone is talking about when they say "attachment therapy" or "Attachment Therapy." 69.170.233.237 12:58, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This contributor's question appears to have been answered. However, as other editors have, I question this contributor's real identity. The reference to the other contributor as "Becker-Weidman" is disrespectful since the user name is Dr. Becker-Weidman. This is very similiar to another's pattern and style that created difficulties on the Bowlby page, the Bowlby Talk page and the Barrett article.

<p>Golly, you people must not have any children if you think that's the way it works. However, Aplomado, I came on here to ask a general Wiki question. This is about NPOV. Are there articles where this concept is recognized as being inapplicable? For example, would someone writing about Theresienstadt have to refrain from any suggestion that perhaps it wasn't altogether a good thing? And if it is the case that there are exceptions to NPOV, who makes that decision? Thank you--Jean Mercer 14:30, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There aren't any exceptions that I'm aware of. Naturally NPOV is tough to achieve in some situations, but it is achievable. If there is something that is denounced by 99.9% of the people in the world, then it is acceptable to treat it as bunk without concerns about NPOV. For example, the idea that the earth is spherical and not flat is an example of something that doesn't need to represent "both sides" because it doesn't really have an opposing side. There isn't a "pro-Theresienstadt" camp that I'm aware of, so that article probably doesn't have to worry too much about NPOV.</dd>
<dd>However, any issue that has two sides must present both sides (using reliable sources, of course) in the article, or it's POV.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> may provide some more guidance for you.

<dl>
<dd>Well, as an adoptive parent conned by attachment therapy, I like the article. Something needs to be done to stop the spead of these attachment therapist claiming 100% success. I had the horrifing experience of dragging my family though a group pretty much using the re-birthing process. I came to find out the Douglas Gosney, they guy that taught the person who kill that girl, was part of the group we went to. Do any of these groups ever have success? Even the Dr. Art guy. All I see ever helping these kids tends to be the meds. they get put on.</dd>

<dd>Something in the blurb really should address the fact that there are many cons out there taking advantage of very desperate parents trying to help their adoptive kids.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>PLEASE DON"T DELETE THE Attachment therapy article... I wished I'd had it to read before what all we went through. We went to this guy Bryan Post in Oklahoma who claims 100% success. Our city even pays for adoptive families to go their. All therapy consists of is parents being held down on air mats to do that deep breathing stuff. It was very hurtful to our family. This was since 2002. Just as the ACT says, even Bryan Post does not have the actual PhD he claims to from a real college. These programs are all over the country. It really is a big scam. Lots of kids are getting hurt.</dd>

<p>I was wondering, instead of having a section called Mass Transit incident, why not have it redirect to Eric Kulas. The article is about him, so it should be under his name. All appropriate links would redirect there. <a href="../../../k/y/r/User%7EKyros_a387.html" title="User:Kyros">Kyros</a> 02:57, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Kulas is only notable because of this incident. I think more people are curious about the incident itself rather than Erich Kulas, so I think the incident itself is still the primary focus of the article. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><strong class="selflink">talk</strong></sup> 04:06, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have reviewed your argument and still find it unsatisfactory. Your involvement in a minor town election just isn't notable enough to warrant an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><strong class="selflink">talk</strong></sup> 19:18, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
