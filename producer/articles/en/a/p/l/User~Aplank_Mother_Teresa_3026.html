She was awarded the <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Peace_Prize_60fc.html" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>. But Teresa also became the subject of sustained attacks from some writers, who accused her of misappropriation of funds and exploiting the poor for her own self-promotion. Partly in response to these attacks, she was beatified by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_II_390d.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> in October <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplank_Mother_Teresa_3026.html" title="Edit section: Early Life and work">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Life and work</span></h2>
<p>Many of the detail's of Teresa's early life is unknown. She recounted that she felt a vocation to help the poor from the age of 12, and decided to train for missionary work in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. At 18 she left Skopje and joined the <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sisters_of_Loreto_ed91.html" title="Sisters of Loreto">Sisters of Loreto</a>, an Irish community of nuns with a mission in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>. She chose the Loreto sisters because of their vocation to provide education for girls. After a few months' training at the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> she was sent to <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darjeeling.html" title="Darjeeling">Darjeeling</a> in India as a novice sister. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>, she made her first vows there, choosing the name Teresa in honour of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Teresa_of_Avila_5a58.html" title="Teresa of Avila">Teresa of Avila</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therese_of_Lisieux_371f.html" title="Therese of Lisieux">Therese of Lisieux</a>. She took her final vows in May <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, acquiring the title <b>Mother Teresa</b>.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> Mother Teresa taught at St Mary's High School in Calcutta, becoming its principal in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, but, she later said, the poverty all around her left a deep impression on her mind. In September <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, by Teresa's own account, she received a calling from <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> "to serve him among the poorest of the poor." In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> she received permission from <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_XII_dc66.html" title="Pope Pius XII">Pope Pius XII</a>, via the Archbishop of Calcutta, to leave her community and live as an independent nun. She quit the high school and, after a short course with the Medical Mission Sisters in Patna, she returned to Calcutta and found temporary lodging with the Little Sisters of the Poor. Teresa then started an open-air school for homeless children. Soon she was joined by voluntary helpers, and received financial support from church organisations and the municipal authorities.</p>
<p>In October <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a> Teresa received permission to start her own order, the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionaries_of_Charity_468f.html" title="Missionaries of Charity">Missionaries of Charity</a>, whose mission was to care for (in her own words) "the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone."</p>
<p>With the help of Indian officials she converted an abandoned <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hindu</a> temple into the Kalighat Home for the Dying, a free <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospice.html" title="Hospice">hospice</a> for the very poor. Soon after she opened another hospice, Nirmal Hriday (<i>Pure Heart</i>), a home for <a href="../../../l/e/p/Leprosy.html" title="Leprosy">lepers</a> called Shanti Nagar (<i>Town of Peace</i>), and an orphanage. The order soon began to attract both recruits and charitable donations, and by the 1960s had opened hospices, orphanges and leper houses all over India.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, by granting a Decree of Praise to the Congregation, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Paul_VI_4529.html" title="Pope Paul VI">Pope Paul VI</a> granted Mother Teresa's request to expand her order to other countries. The order's first house outside India was in <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venezuela.html" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, and others followed in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanzania.html" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, and eventually in many countries in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>, including even her native <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a>. She travelled widely and became a media figure, and this gave her the ability to intervene in international trouble spots. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> during the fighting in <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beirut.html" title="Beirut">Beirut</a>, she convinced the parties to stop fighting so she could rescue 37 sick children.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa's work inspired other Catholics to affiliate themselves to her order. The Missionaries of Charity Brothers was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, a contemplative branch of the Sisters followed in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>. Lay Catholics and non-Catholics were enrolled in the Co-Workers of Mother Teresa, the Sick and Suffering Co-Workers, and the Lay Missionaries of Charity. In answer to the requests of many priests, in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> Mother Teresa also began the Corpus Christi Movement for Priests.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> the British writer <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Muggeridge_a42d.html" title="Malcolm Muggeridge">Malcolm Muggeridge</a>, a Catholic convert, made a documentary about Teresa called <i>Something Beautiful for God</i>. This highly complimentary film, and the accompanying book, conferred celebrity status on Teresa, a status made more striking by her image of conspicuous poverty and personal modesty. From this time onwards Teresa received many awards.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> Paul VI awarded her the first <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_XXIII_ce7b.html" title="Pope John XXIII">Pope John XXIII</a> Peace Prize. Other awards bestowed upon her included a Kennedy Prize (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>), the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Schweitzer_70b0.html" title="Albert Schweitzer">Albert Schweitzer</a> International Prize (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>), the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom_4a9f.html" title="Presidential Medal of Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congressional_Medal_of_Honor_e881.html" title="Congressional Medal of Honor">Congressional Medal of Honor</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, honorary citizenship of the United States (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>), and honorary degrees from a number of universities.</p>

<p>Following Teresa's death in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_See_26a9.html" title="Holy See">Holy See</a> began the process of <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatification.html" title="Beatification">beatification</a>, the first step towards possible <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonization.html" title="Canonization">canonisation</a>, or sainthood. This process requires the documentation of a <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miracle.html" title="Miracle">miracle</a>. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, the Vatican recognised as a miracle the healing of a <a href="../../../t/u/m/Tumour.html" title="Tumour">tumour</a> in the abdomen of an Indian woman, Monica Besra, following the application of a locket containing Teresa's picture.</p>
<p>This purported miracle attracted considerable controversy. Besra's husband reportedly said that the lump in his wife's adomen was not cured by divine intervention, but by hospital treatment. According to a report in <i>Time</i> magazine, records of her treatment were removed by a member of Mother Teresa's order. The Balurghat Hospital where Besra was treated reported coming under pressure from the missionaries to acknowledge that the healing process was the result of a miracle.</p>
<p>Teresa's was formally beatified by Pope <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_II_18b2.html" title="John Paul II">John Paul II</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_19.html" title="October 19">October 19</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, with the title Blessed Teresa of Calcutta. A second authenticated miracle will be required if she is to proceed to canonisation.</p>
<p>The Pope delivered <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2003/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20031019_mother-theresa_en.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2003/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20031019_mother-theresa_en.html" rel="nofollow">a homily on Mother Teresa</a> on the occasion of her beatification. He said: "With particular emotion we remember today Mother Teresa, a great servant of the poor, of the Church and of the whole world. Her life is a testimony to the dignity and the privilege of humble service. She had chosen to be not just the least but to be the servant of the least. As a real mother to the poor, she bent down to those suffering various forms of poverty. Her greatness lies in her ability to give without counting the cost, to give 'until it hurts'. Her life was a radical living and a bold proclamation of the Gospel."</p>
