<p>Is that really correct? The original Latin term is <i>apsis,</i> plur. <i>apsides.</i> From <i>apsis</i> derives Eng. <i>apse</i> which can hardly have <i>apsis</i> as plur.</p>

<p>Further to this, I have just toned down the 'it is considered more correct to use the greek form for the body'. It's not specified who considers it correct, and as these are all scientific terms, I think it's best to go with what the scientists actually use, regardless of any linguistic concerns. Otherwise, you might as well put a note in the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">Television</a> article saying that 'proculvision' or 'teleopsis' are considered more correct. Also, I couldn't find any use in the literature of the '-cytherion' or '-areion' terms, so I moved mention of those from occasionally used to never used. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 08:43, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, as Einstein used to say. The problem with trying to find quotes in the litterature <i>through the Web</i> is that there are still huge gaps. You wouldn't be able to find the first use of -saturnium mentioned in the article because it only exists as scanned-in GIFs on the web (I stumbled across it serendipitously). A lot of the litterature of the mid-20th century has yet to be made available either. The term -cytherion, apparently, was introduced by Carl Sagan in the 1960s...But just try and prove it! Anyway, I think the article is reaching a pretty decent equilibrium point by now.</dd>

<p>Indeed, very true, but if we can't <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">cite our sources</a>, then the information is not verifiable, and I think that's very important for an encyclopaedia. I'd say anyway that the gaps in online coverage of astronomy literature are not that huge. The <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrophysics_Data_System_543e.html" title="Astrophysics Data System">Astrophysics Data System</a> contains scanned versions of a huge number of journals right back to issue 1 in most cases (<a href="http://doc.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs_doc/faq.html#far" class="external autonumber" title="http://doc.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs_doc/faq.html#far" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs_doc/journals.html#" class="external autonumber" title="http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs_doc/journals.html#" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>), and even allows you to search OCR'd text of scanned journal articles <a href="http://fulltext.adsabs.harvard.edu/fulltext_service.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://fulltext.adsabs.harvard.edu/fulltext_service.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Checking now uncovers a total of 87 refs to -saturnium including the one you chanced across <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?fulltext=perisaturnium&amp;defaultset=YES&amp;version=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?fulltext=perisaturnium&amp;defaultset=YES&amp;version=1" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, of which 8 are in the last 50 years. Still no sign of perizenes, -hermions or others though. I still question, I'm afraid, the statement that some scholars object to these combined forms. Who are these scholars? If you can show me an example of a scholar actually saying that perijove should not be used, then that is worthy of including, but seeing as perizene is <i>never</i> used, it seems odd to try and give it credence by including it here in the table with perijove. We don't do the same with other hybrid words such as television, although they do have an article about them at <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid_word.html" title="Hybrid word">hybrid words</a>. I've now commented out the forms which do not appear anywhere in the available searchable astronomical literature. If they are actually used in journal articles anywhere, then they should be included, and sources should be cited, but otherwise they're just neologisms. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 19:18, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's not clear to me what the proper pronunciation is for "aphelion", from a linguistic point of view. My copy of the American Heritage Dictionary (2nd college edition) gives the options of "a-feel-yon" and "a-feel-e-on". Indeed, almost every (perhaps every) Greek work that's come into English turns the greek letter Φ (phi) into a FFF sound.</p>
<p>However, it is the case that, rather than being a mere <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypercorrection.html" title="Hypercorrection">hypercorrection</a>, 'ap-helion' would indeed be the ancient pronounciation, if we were able to bring some ancient Greek speaker to this time and show him or her the written word. (Source: Vox Graeca, by Sidney Allen, the standard book on the prounciation of Ancient Greek) I guess I'm uncomfortable hearing it called a <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypercorrection.html" title="Hypercorrection">Hypercorrection</a>, since it does, in fact, reflect the classical pronunciation, which is being taught increasingly these days to students of Ancient Greek. (When I was studying Ancient Greek twenty-five years ago, the pronounciation we were taught was the Erasman Pronounciation, which pronounces Φ (phi) as FEE. The Modern Greek pronounciation of the letter is also FEE, and that's how I hear it pronounced when I attend a Greek Orthodox church service.)</p>
<p>The comment made in the article -- about "Greek από, from, which becomes απ before a vowel, and αφ before rough breathing)" -- is absolutely true. However, the sound change only makes sense when you understand that the ancient Greeks really did pronounce Φ (phi) as an aspirated P sound, like the P that starts the English word "pin", where we release a puff of air, a sort of soft H, after the P. Try it yourself, then compare with the way you say the P in "stop", where you don't release the puff of air. Again, this change makes sense only if you understand that "apo helion", by the ancient sound transformation rules, naturally turns into ap' helion, which turns into "aphelion". And the only way that change is natural is if it's pronounced in the classical way. So go figure.</p>

<p>I'm sure that many books stating that the correct pronunciation of <i>aphelion</i> is <i>ap-helion</i> can be found. However, the Greek word suggest the exact opposite. The classical Greek word for <i>sun</i> is ἥλιος (hēlios). The preceding preposition is ἀπό (apo). When this is prefixed to another word that begins with a vowel it looses its final ο, and if that word begins with the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritus_asper.html" title="Spiritus asper">spiritus asper</a>, the π is aspirated into φ. Thus the compound word is ἀφήλιον (aphēlion), not ἀπήλιον (apēlion). If you feel that the <i>ph</i> in <i>photograph</i>, <i>pheromone</i> and <i>physics</i> should be pronounced with an /f/, then the same holds true for <i>aphelion</i>. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 01:31, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Presumably your typical classical Greek would have a lot more trouble with the <i>meaning</i> of the word than with its pronunciation.&#160;:-) How would a modern Greek pronounce it? Anyway, whatever its roots, it's an <i>English</i> word, and not bound by its ancestry.</dd>

<p>I was redirected to this page from the term 'pericenter', as used in article S2_(star), but the page does not contain the word, let alone the definition. --128.9.216.23 17:36, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are thre any useful mnemonics to help remember which one (peri- or ap-) refers to the closest point and which refers to the far point? I can never remember without checking this page. <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigmaEpsilon_6fff.html" title="User:SigmaEpsilon">SigmaEpsilon</a> → <a href="../../../s/i/g/User_talk%7ESigmaEpsilon_657c.html" title="User talk:SigmaEpsilon">ΣΕ</a> 05:14, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Use the word "away" (as in away from the earth) to remember aphelion. Russ</p>

<p>I wanted to find out what a perihelion is, but this article is completely incomprehensible. Could there be a friendlier explanation? I dont think it's really that complicated. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 194.80.49.125 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_194.80.49.125_6507.html" title="Special:Contributions/194.80.49.125">contribs</a>) 15:43, 9 August 2006.</small></p>

<dd>I'm sorry that you find the article difficult. Please explain what could be done to make it more accessible/relevant. A perihelion is a point in space at which an object (usually in orbit around the sun) is closest to the sun. The Earth's perihelion is the moment when it is closest to the sun. THe furthest point from the sun is called the <i>aphelion</i>. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 14:58, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Obviously the perihelion of the Earth varies a few days correponding to a few degrees or some thousend seconds of arc every year. That's much more than the relativistic advance of 43“ per century – not year – as predicted by <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> for the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet.html" title="Planet">planet</a> <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28Planet%29_c527.html" title="Mercury (Planet)">Mercury</a>. 84.169.216.201 09:38, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As clearly seen form the table of data, the advance of perihelion is fluctuating by some days (one day is about 3,600“) from year to year. There is not a continuous advance every year or century. Therefore, it just nonsense to say Earth or <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28Planet%29_c527.html" title="Mercury (Planet)">Mercury</a> have a certain advance of perihelion per century caused by some effect due to <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a>, since the fluctuations every year are larger than this effect in one century. 84.59.54.27 18:21, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
