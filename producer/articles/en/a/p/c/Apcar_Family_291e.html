	    <p>For more than a century the <b>Apcar Family</b> was prominent in commerce and industry in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>.</p>
<p>Aratoon Apcar (born <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Julfa_41ef.html" title="New Julfa">New Julfa</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a> 1779 died <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> 16 May 1863) was the founder of Apcar &amp; Co in 1809 and Senior Member until his death, 54 years later. He came to India in 1795, first to <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> and then to Kolkata in 1830. He endowed the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Apostolic_Church_5de4.html" title="Armenian Apostolic Church">Armenian Apostolic Church</a> of St Mary at New Julfa, and established the Armenian Patriotic School there. He had four sons, Seth, Thomas, Apcar and Alexander, all of whom were involved in the family business. Seth Apcar (born Mumbai 12 May 1819 died <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> March 1885) was the first Armenian <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheriff_of_Kolkata_dbcf.html" title="Sheriff of Kolkata">Sheriff of Kolkata</a>. He was awarded the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Lion_and_the_Sun_94bd.html" title="Order of the Lion and the Sun">Order of the Lion and the Sun</a> by the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shah_of_Iran_82cd.html" title="Shah of Iran">Shah of Iran</a>, which was presented to him by the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor-General_cfae.html" title="Governor-General">Governor-General</a> of India. As a London resident in the 1870s, he was Honorary President of an Armenian committee set up to increase British awarneness of the plight of Armenians during the decline of the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Alexander Apcar (born Mumbai 4 November 1824 died Kolkata 12 November 1895) was the Consul for Siam (Thailand) in Kolkata until his death. Alexander’s son was Apcar Alexander Apcar (see below).</p>
<p>Arratoon Apcar's younger brother, Gregory Apcar (born <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Julfa_41ef.html" title="New Julfa">New Julfa</a> 1795 died Mumbai 23 June 1847) came to India in 1808. He was noted for his charitable work, particularly to the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Apostolic_Church_5de4.html" title="Armenian Apostolic Church">Armenian Apostolic Church</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_College_%28Kolkata%29_8fd8.html" title="Armenian College (Kolkata)">Armenian College</a>. On 6 January 1827 he married Catchkathoon Sarkies in Mumbai. Their son Aratoon Gregory Apcar was born 4 November 1827 and died on 1 February 1916. His son, John Gregory Apcar (born 1848? died 1922?), known as "Father John", was elected a member of the Bengal Legislative Council at the 1912-13 <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengal.html" title="Bengal">Bengal</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_election.html" title="General election">general election</a> as one of two representatives for the <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata_Municipal_Corporation_33bf.html" title="Kolkata Municipal Corporation">Calcutta Corporation</a>.

Both were benefactors of that school. Described in 1936 by Harrow's Governors as "an endowment which has never been equalled in the School's history" and "a shining example of love and care for Harrow", Gregory Apcar left the School an estate valued at around £320,000, which increased the value of the School's property and Trusts by almost two-thirds.</p>

<p>Apcar &amp; Co acted as general business agents and insurance brokers and controlled the Apcar Line.</p>
<p>The Apcar Line ran a fleet of five vessels from Kolkata carrying Chinese <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coolies.html" title="Coolies">coolies</a> and cargo, largely to and from <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amoy.html" title="Amoy">Amoy</a> (Xiamen), with connections to <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirates.html" title="Pirates">Pirates</a> were active, and well into the twentieth century, the ships had to be armed and sandbagged against attacks.</p>
<p>Apcar &amp; Co also entered the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">coal</a> business. In 1862 coal seams were discovered near <a href="../../../r/a/n/Raniganj.html" title="Raniganj">Raniganj</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/a/Asansol.html" title="Asansol">Asansol</a>. Apcar &amp; Co purchased an extensive stretch of land and started a mine at Lachipur (4 miles from Asansol). They also opened coal mines at Charanpur, <a href="../../../f/a/r/Faridpur%2C_India_e3e4.html" title="Faridpur, India">Faridpur</a> and Borachuck. A large number of Armenians either owned collieries or worked in various capacities in the coalfields. Seeing the rapid development of the coalfields, European firms purchased large areas from Apcar &amp; Co on a royalty basis and started to mine the coal. As a result Asansol became a large and developed mining district.</p>
<p>On 27 February 1912 Apcar &amp; Co, ships, workshops and mines, were sold to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_India_Steam_Navigation_Company_7646.html" title="British India Steam Navigation Company">British India Steam Navigation Company</a> for Rs 800,000 and absorbed by BISN. Sailings from Kolkata to Japan were still advertised as being conducted by the Apcar Line into the 1950s. The coal mines were managed by Mackinnon, Mackenzie &amp; Co until 1951.</p>
