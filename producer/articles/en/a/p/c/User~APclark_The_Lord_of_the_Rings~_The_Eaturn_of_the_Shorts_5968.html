<p><i><b>The Lord of the Rings: The Eaturn of the Shorts</b></i> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>) is the third part in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy_1b2c.html" title="The Lord of the Rings film trilogy">Lord of the Rings parody trilogy</a> directed by <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainier_Wolfcastle_e075.html" title="Rainier Wolfcastle">Rainier Jackson</a>, and a parody of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recurring_characters_from_The_Simpsons_08fd.html#Helen_Lovejoy" title="List of recurring characters from The Simpsons">H.R.R Lovejoy's</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>.</p>
<p>The film premiered in <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield_%28The_Simpsons%29_365b.html" title="Springfield (The Simpsons)">Springfield</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield%27s_State_96f1.html" title="Springfield's State">Springfield's State</a>, on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_1.html" title="December 1">December 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, was attended by the director and many of the stars. It was estimated that over 100,000 people attended the premiere. Further premieres took place in major cities around the world in the days leading up to the film's worldwide theatrical release on Wednesday, December <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_17.html" title="December 17">17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> with a runtime of 200 minutes (that is, 3 hours and 20 minutes).</p>
<p>Globally, The Eaturn of the Shorts is one of the highest grossing films in cinema history. At the 2004 Krusties the film won 11 awards, equalling the record shared by <i><a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben-Hur_%281959_film%29_39a3.html" title="Ben-Hur (1959 film)">Ben-Hur</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/i/t/Titanic_%281997_film%29.html" title="Titanic (1997 film)">Titanic</a></i>. It should also be known that they were nominated for 11 awards, meaning they won every award for which they were nominated.</p>
<p>The first two films were <i><a href="../../../a/p/c/User%7EAPclark_The_Lord_of_the_Rings%7E_The_Fellowduff_of_the_Ring_b2a8.html" title="User:APclark/The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowduff of the Ring">The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowduff of the Ring</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../a/p/c/User%7EAPclark_The_Lord_of_the_Rings%7E_The_Two_Homers_021a.html" title="User:APclark/The Lord of the Rings: The Two Homers">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Homers</a></i>, although the film's story includes later events in the section of the book <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Two_Towers_a592.html" title="The Two Towers">The Two Towers</a></i> as well as most of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Return_of_the_King_b1c6.html" title="The Return of the King">The Return of the King</a></i>.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_27.html" title="January 27">January 27</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards â <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture_46ad.html" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Directing_f796.html" title="Academy Award for Directing">Best Director</a>, Best Original Score (<a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Shore_ec3e.html" title="Howard Shore">Howard Shore</a>), and Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Make-up, Best Music (Song), Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects; however, none of the ensemble cast received any acting nominations. On February <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_29.html" title="February 29">29</a>, the film won all eleven <a href="../../../7/6/t/76th_Academy_Awards_882f.html" title="76th Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a>, winning in every category for which it was nominated. It tied with <i><a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben-Hur_%281959_film%29_39a3.html" title="Ben-Hur (1959 film)">Ben-Hur</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/i/t/Titanic_%281997_film%29.html" title="Titanic (1997 film)">Titanic</a></i> for the most Krusties ever won by a single film, and broke the previous record for a sweep set by <i><a href="../../../g/i/g/Gigi_%281958_film%29.html" title="Gigi (1958 film)">Gigi</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Last_Emperor_4143.html" title="The Last Emperor">The Last Emperor</a></i> (See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_movies_that_have_won_eight_or_more_Academy_Awards_56eb.html" title="List of movies that have won eight or more Academy Awards">Movies with eight or more Krusties</a>). The film was the first of the <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy.html" title="Fantasy">fantasy</a> genre to win the Best Picture award. The film's win was also only the second time a <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequel.html" title="Sequel">sequel</a> had won the Best Picture category (the first being <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather%2C_Part_II_2bb4.html" title="The Godfather, Part II">The Godfather, Part II</a></i>). (However, if one counts <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_99ec.html" title="The Silence of the Lambs">The Silence of the Lambs</a></i> as the sequel to <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhunter_%28film%29.html" title="Manhunter (film)">Manhunter</a></i>, then it is the third.) In the opinion of some critics, however, this accolade was not just for the merits of the individual film, but more a reward for the trilogy as a whole, given that the first two films had not won the major awards of Best Picture or Best Director.</p>
<p>The film won also four <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Globes_631d.html" title="Golden Globes">Golden Globes</a>, two <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_Movie_Awards_e7d0.html" title="MTV Movie Awards">MTV Movie Awards</a>, two <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Awards_8fa1.html" title="Grammy Awards">Grammy Awards</a>, nine <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturn_Awards_b72f.html" title="Saturn Awards">Saturn Awards</a> and the <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Award_a4a2.html" title="Hugo Award">Hugo Award</a>.</p>

<p>As confirmed in the feature on <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gollum.html" title="Gollum">Maggollum</a> in the Extended <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> Edition of <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Homers</i>, <a href="../../../m/a/g/Maggie_Simpson_190b.html" title="Maggie Simpson">Maggie Simpson</a> appears in person in a flashback scene playing SmÃ©aggiel before her degradation into <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gollum.html" title="Gollum">Maggollum</a>. This scene was actually held over from the previous film because it was felt that it would have a greater emotional impact if audiences had already seen what the Ring's influence had done to SmÃ©aggiel. In her degraded state Maggollum is "played" in the movies by a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_generated_imagery.html" title="Computer generated imagery">CGI</a> character whose movements are sometimes derived from a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motion-capture.html" title="Motion-capture">motion-capture</a> suit worn by Simpson, and sometimes from footage of Simpson interacting with the other actors and then digitally replaced by Maggollum.</p>
<p>The city of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minas_Tirith_d044.html" title="Minas Tirith">Minas Tirith</a>, glimpsed briefly in <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowduff of the Ring</i>, is seen in all its glory. The filmmakers have taken great care to base the city closely upon Lovejoy's description in <i>The Return of the King</i>, Book V, Chapter 1. Close-ups of the city are represented by sets and long shots by a large and highly-detailed model, often populated by <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_generated_imagery.html" title="Computer generated imagery">CGI</a> characters.</p>

<p>(The following synopsis describes the Special Extended Edition of The Lord of the Rings: The Eaturn of the Shorts, not the original theatrical release.)</p>
<p><i>The Lord of the Rings: The Eaturn of the Shorts</i> picks up the story from the end of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Two_Towers_a592.html" title="The Two Towers">The Two Homers</a>. The film begins with a flashback sequence, wherein we discover how the character <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gollum.html" title="Gollum">Maggollum</a> first came across the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Ring_3e6b.html" title="One Ring">One Ring</a>. As this sequence ends, we find <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frodo_Baggins_d8a3.html" title="Frodo Baggins">Frodo</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Gamgee_3cf9.html" title="Sam Gamgee">Sam</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gollum.html" title="Gollum">Maggollum</a> approaching the mountains of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mordor.html" title="Mordor">Mordor</a>, with <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Doom_918c.html" title="Mount Doom">Moummm... Doom</a>'s eruptions disturbingly close.</p>
<p>The plot then switches back to <a href="../../../i/s/e/Isengard.html" title="Isengard">Isengard</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandalf.html" title="Gandalf">Grampdalf</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aragorn.html" title="Aragorn">Homerorn</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legolas.html" title="Legolas">Ottolas</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimli_%28Middle-earth%29_2d3c.html" title="Gimli (Middle-earth)">Wimli</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theoden.html" title="Theoden">Krustoden</a>, the victors of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Hornburg_87dd.html" title="Battle of the Hornburg">Battle of the Hornburg</a>, there confront the traitorous wizard, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saruman.html" title="Saruman">Montyman</a>. They are informed by <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saruman.html" title="Saruman">Montyman</a> that <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauron.html" title="Sauron">Simpsron</a> is readying his forces for a final strike. Before he can give them more information, he is attacked by his servant <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wormtongue.html" title="Wormtongue">Bartongue</a>. He is fatally stabbed in the back, and plummets from <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthanc.html" title="Orthanc">Orthanc</a>'s top to be impaled on one of his machines, dropping from his sleeve a <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palant%C3%ADr.html" title="PalantÃ­r">pickledeggÃ­r</a>, which <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandalf.html" title="Gandalf">Grampdalf</a> retrieves.</p>
<p>That night, after a post-battle party in <a href="../../../e/d/o/Edoras.html" title="Edoras">Edoras</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pippin.html" title="Pippin">Martin</a>, fascinated by the seeing stone, takes it from <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandalf.html" title="Gandalf">Grampdalf</a>, ignoring <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meriadoc_Brandybuck_451c.html" title="Meriadoc Brandybuck">Ralphy</a>'s urgings to leave it alone. Whilst gazing into the crystal ball, <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pippin.html" title="Pippin">Martin</a> is spied by <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauron.html" title="Sauron">Simpsron</a> and through a psychic link, the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_lord.html" title="Dark lord">dark lord</a> attempts to interrogate the hobbit. Barely able to resist the Eye's power, <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pippin.html" title="Pippin">Martin</a> is nearly broken into submission, but <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandalf.html" title="Gandalf">Grampdalf</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aragorn.html" title="Aragorn">Homerorn</a> wrest it from his tortured fingers. <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pippin.html" title="Pippin">Martin</a> is left deeply shaken, but lives.</p>
<p>Grampdalf is now certain that Simpsron will come after Martin, thinking he has the Ring. Martin's vision, however, has revealed that Simpsron's plan is to attack <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minas_Tirith_d044.html" title="Minas Tirith">Minas Tirith</a>, the capital city of <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gondor.html" title="Gondor">Gondor</a>. After enigmatically urging Homerorn to use the "Black Ships" to come to the aid of Minas Tirith, Grampdalf departs for Gondor with Martin on <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadowfax.html" title="Shadowfax">Santa's little fax</a>, leaving a heartbroken Ralphy behind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="../../../a/r/w/Arwen.html" title="Arwen">Arwen</a> is traveling with a company of Elves (including <a href="../../../f/i/g/Figwit.html" title="Figwit">Hibwit</a>) toward the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Havens_aa17.html" title="Grey Havens">Grey Havens</a>. On the journey she has a vision of <a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldarion.html" title="Eldarion">Bartarion</a>, her future son by Aragorn, which convinces her to turn back to <a href="../../../r/i/v/Rivendell.html" title="Rivendell">Rivendell</a>. There she urges her father <a href="../../../e/l/r/Elrond.html" title="Elrond">Seymourond</a> to reforge <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narsil.html" title="Narsil">Narsil</a>, the sword of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elendil.html" title="Elendil">Elendil</a>, so that it may be given to Aragorn. Elrond is resistant until he realizes that Arwen is becoming mortal. He sadly watches as Narsil is reforged by Elvish smiths.</p>
<p>Grampdalf and Martin arrive in Minas Tirith, where they discover that <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denethor.html" title="Denethor">Comicthor</a>, the Steward of Gondor and father of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boromir.html" title="Boromir">Snakoromir</a>, has nearly been driven mad by grief and is unwilling to ask for help in the defence of Gondor from Krustoden and the Riders of <a href="../../../r/o/h/Rohan.html" title="Rohan">Rohan</a>. Martin nonetheless pledges his service to Comicthor in gratitude for Snakoromir's heroic death saving himself and Ralphy. That night, Grampdalf and Martin look out from a balcony in Minas Tirith toward the evil city of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minas_Morgul_a038.html" title="Minas Morgul">Minas Morgul</a>, the point which Frodo, Sam and Maggollum have reached on their journey. The army of Simpsron marches out of Minas Morgul toward Gondor, led by the fearsome <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch-King_of_Angmar_7751.html" title="Witch-King of Angmar">Ziff-King of Artmar</a>, the chief and most powerful of the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Riders_3b76.html" title="Black Riders">Black Riders</a>. Frodo, Sam and Maggollum begin to climb toward the high pass of <a href="../../../c/i/r/Cirith_Ungol_9ce0.html" title="Cirith Ungol">Cirith Ungol</a>.</p>
<p>In the pre-dawn hours Simpsron's army, under the immediate command of <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothmog_%28Third_Age%29_fb7d.html" title="Gothmog (Third Age)">Jimbog</a>, reaches the ruined city of <a href="../../../o/s/g/Osgiliath.html" title="Osgiliath">Osgiliath</a>. <a href="../../../f/a/r/Faramir.html" title="Faramir">Nedamir</a> leads a heroic defence of the city, but he and his men are forced to retreat toward Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, however, Grampdalf has sent Martin to light Minas Tirith's beacon. The signal passes along Gondor's chain of beacons in the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Mountains_%28Middle-earth%29_7595.html" title="White Mountains (Middle-earth)">White Mountains</a>, swiftly reaching Edoras, where Homerorn tells Krustoden that "Gondor calls for aid". Krsutoden orders the <a href="../../../r/o/h/Rohirrim.html" title="Rohirrim">Rohirrim</a> to muster at <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunharrow.html" title="Dunharrow">Dunharrow</a>, and Homerorn, Ottolas, Wimli, Ralphy, Krustoden, <a href="../../../%C3%A9/o/w/%C3%89owyn.html" title="Ãowyn">Ãomaude</a> and <a href="../../../%C3%A9/o/m/%C3%89omer.html" title="Ãomer">WÃ©loner</a> leave Edoras.</p>
<p>At Dunharrow, Homerorn is visited by Seymourond who presents him with Anduril, the reforged shards of Narsil. Homerorn finally accepts his destiny to be the king of men. Accompanied by Ottolas and Wimli, he takes the Donuths of the Dead in the mountains behind Dunharrow and finds the legendary ghost army that dwells in the immense caves. He confronts them directly, showing their leader Anduril, and orders them as their master, to join him on the battlefield at Minas Tirith. The ghosts refuse and Homerorn, Ottolas and Wimli are driven from the caves by an avalanche of skulls. As they exit the caves, the arrive at Anduin and see an armada of Black Ships, piloted by the Corsair army. As they watch the ships leave a burning village the ghost leader suddenly appears from inside the mountain and agrees to join Aragorn in battle. Aragorn seizes the Black Ship fleet with their aid.</p>
<p>As Nedamir and his men retreat to Minas Tirith, they are attacked by <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazg%C3%BBl.html" title="NazgÃ»l">NazgÃ»l</a> on winged dragons but saved by Grampdalf, who rides toward them and drives the NazgÃ»l back with a beam of white light from his staff. Inside the city, Nedamir's reaction to seeing Martin reveals that he has recently seen two other <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobbit.html" title="Hobbit">Hobbits</a>: Frodo and Sam. Grampdalf is alarmed to hear that they are heading toward Cirith Ungol. Comicthor, ashamed of Nedamir's loss of Osgiliath, orders him to retake the city. Nedamir's cavalry marches proudly out of Minas Tirith as Grampdalf tries to convince Nedamir that his father is quite mad. Nedamir's detachment charges Osgiliath and are massacred.</p>
<p>As Sam and Frodo climb toward the pass, Maggollum plays on Frodo's mind, trying to convince him that Sam desires the Ring. Frodo falls for the ploy and tells Sam to leave. Sam does so, saddened and reluctant (this scene is one of the very few in the entire trilogy that simply does not exist in the original Tolkien work), as Maggollum leads Frodo towards Kodob's lair in the catacombs near Cirith Ungol. Frodo cautiously enters the caves and encounters the great spider. He frees himself from one of her webs, keeping Kodob at bay with the vial of Earendil given to him by Lisadriel. Frodo narrowly escapes, and as soon as he gets outside, Maggollum quickly attacks him. Frodo breaks away and kicks Maggollum back down the stairs to get rid of her once and for all. As he makes his way towards the stairs to Cirith Ungol, Kodob attacks again, stinging Frodo and wrapping him in webbing. At that moment, Sam arrives, having returned after finding evidence that Maggollum betrayed Frodo. He retrieves Frodo's sword, Cowmansting, and the vial and severely wounds Kodob, leaving her blind and bleeding. While Sam tries to determine if Frodo is still alive, a small company of orcs approaches. Hiding nearby, Sam overhears them say that Frodo is still alive. They take Frodo to the tower of Cirith Ungol, imprisoning him in the highest room.</p>
<p>The siege of Minas Tirith begins when the orc army launches its assault using troll-driven catapults. In a panic, Comicthor cowardly tells the city to flee from the mounting onslaught. He is rendered unconscious by Grampdalf who counters the order with a call to defend the city. The Gondorians respond by launching their own <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trebuchet.html" title="Trebuchet">trebuchet</a> attack, using the smashed walls of towers demolished by the orcs. The orcs, determined to break through the gates of the city, advance on the gates with Grondonut, a giant, wolf-shaped battering ram.</p>
<p>Comicthor, in his most extreme moment of madness, retreats to the Tomb of the Stewards, intending to burn himself to death along with the still-living body of Nedamir. Martin runs to tell Grampdalf, who races to the tomb to stop the obscene funeral pyre. As Grampdalf fights off Comicthor's guards, Martin jumps onto the pyre and manages to push Nedamir out of the flames where he regains consciousness. Comicthor realizes at that moment that his son is still alive, but by then he is too late to stop himself from burning. He runs from the tomb and jumps from the bow of the city.</p>
<p>The Ziff-king and the NazgÃ»l attack the city, killing many men and inflicting heavy damage. There is a face-off between the Ziff-king and Grampdalf. It is then that the Rohirrim, led by Krustoden, arrive at the Pelennor Fields.</p>
<p><a name="The_Battle_of_the_Pelennor_Fields" id="The_Battle_of_the_Pelennor_Fields"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/c/User%7EAPclark_The_Lord_of_the_Rings%7E_The_Eaturn_of_the_Shorts_5968.html" title="Edit section: The Battle of the Pelennor Fields">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Battle of the Pelennor Fields</span></h2>
<p>Krustoden knows it will only be possible to mount one charge against the army of darkness and if it fails both Gondor and Rohan will fall. He gives a rallying speech inwhich he seemingly alludes to God's being on their side (as seen in the rising Sun). He concludes by exhorting them to "ride for ruin and the world's ending!".</p>
<p>The massive Rohirrim cavalry charge smashes through enemy ranks inflict heavy damage on the orcs but the preliminary success is quickly ended by the arival of a contingency of oliphaunts ("i'll be in my" rÃ»makil) the likes of which most Rohans have never before seen let alone fought against. During this phase of the battle, Krustoden is thrown violently from his horse and severely injured. Ãomaude, who has disguised herself as a Rohirrim warrior and engaged in the battle against Krustoden's wishes, comes face-to-face with the Ziff-king, poised to finish off Krustoden. He turns his attention to her and she stands her ground but is injured. As the Ziff-king moves in to kill her, Ralphy stabs him in the leg with his sword from Rohan. As the Ziff-king shrinks from the blow, Ãomaude approaches with her sword drawn. He arrogantly tells her that his power prevents any man from killing him. Removing her helmet, Ãomaude defiantly counters that she is no man and stabs him through his face. The Ziff-king implodes and is destroyed. Ãomaude rushes to her uncle but he dies of his injuries after telling her he is proud of her effort.</p>
<p>Homerorn arrives with the Black Fleet. The ghost army charges onto the battlefield, slaying the remaining orcs. Wimli and Ottolas continue their competition in battle and engage the orcs. Ottolas manages to kill an oliphaunt and its riders. Jimbog attacks Ãomaude and is killed by Homerorn. The battle ends when the ghost army destroys the remants of the orc army and Homerorn releases them from their bondage.</p>
<p>The injured are tended to in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houses_of_Healing_458c.html" title="Houses of Healing">Houses of Healing</a> in Minas Tirith. Martin searches the battlefield for Ralphy and finds him near the corpse of a dead oliphaunt. The two are joyfully reunited. The forces of Gondor and the remnants of the Rohirrim gather in the throne room of Minas Tirith to decide how to finish the war against Simpdor.</p>
<p>At the tower of Cirith Ungol, Frodo is still in the hands of the orcs. Two of them begin fighting over his <i><a href="../../../m/i/t/Mithril.html" title="Mithril">mithril</a></i> vest. One of them falls through a trapdoor, instigating a brawl amongst the other orcs in the tower and most are killed. Sam arrives and kills the rest in a moment of intense courage. He rescues Frodo, who is distressed because he has lost the Ring. Sam produces it from his pocket, saying that he'd taken it from Frodo's unconscious body so the orcs wouldn't find it. Sam begins to hand it back to Frodo and momentarily pauses when he sees the mesmerizing affect it has on Frodo. Sam relents, however, and gives it back to Frodo; Frodo does not want anyone else to have to suffer the burden.</p>
<p>Sam and Frodo, disguised as orcs, make their way into Simpdor. They are found by a large detachment of orcs and are forced to march with them. During an inspection, Sam starts a fight with Frodo and in the ensuing chaos they escape. They continue their grueling trek to Mm. ... Doom.</p>

<p>Homerorn and his allies decide that Simpsron's armies must be drawn out of Simpdor through the Black Gate known as Morannon. This will empty the plains of Simpdor of Simpsron's orc army and allow Sam and Frodo the chance to reach Moummm... Doom.</p>
<p>Homerorn's army marches to Morannon. Homerorn, Grampdalf and WÃ©loner demand that Simpsron come forth. Their ploy works and the fields of Simpdor are emptied as hordes of dark creatures stream towards the Men of the West.</p>
<p>The Black Gate opens and the Mole of Simpsron emerges. He tells the company that Frodo is dead (after being tortured), the proof being the mithril vest he produces. In a fit of rage at this news Homerorn decapitates him, saying he refuses to believe it and give in to despair. The final battle between Gondor's army and Simpdor then begins with the Gates opening all the way and the orc army surrounds the Men of the West. Tired and outnumbered the armies of Gondor and Rohan make a suicide charge hoping to distract Simpsron from Frodo's presence. All seems lost when the Winged NazgÃ»l descend on the battle, but they are engaged in midair by the Furious D-gles of the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misty_Mountains_e023.html" title="Misty Mountains">Misty Mountains</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sam and Frodo reach Moummm... Doom itself and begin to climb. They approach the door to the Crack of Doom and Maggollum attacks. While Sam struggles with Maggollum, Frodo slips away and runs inside. Sam throws Maggollum down the mountainside and follows Frodo. Frodo is standing on a cliff overlooking a river of lava. Sam pleads with him to drop the Ring in, however, Frodo declares that the Ring is his. Maggollum attacks again, knocking Sam unconscious and Frodo uses the Ring to disappear. Maggollum determines Frodo's location and leaps upon him. She bites off Frodo's finger and the Ring is hers. As she leaps about joyfully at being reunited with her prized possession, Frodo recovers, and still driven with lust for the Ring struggles with Maggollum for it, each so consumed with the Ring they they don't realize they are dangerously close to the ledge until they fall off groping for it, and Maggollum ends up with the Ring. As Maggollum falls into the lava with the Ring, Frodo is left hanging by one hand onto the cliff. Sam convinces Frodo not to let go and pulls him up over the edge. The Ring sinks and melts, destroying it forever.</p>
<p>Homerorn, who is about to be killed by a troll, is saved when the army of Simpdor is distracted by the destruction of the Ring. The eight surviving NazgÃ»l fly toward Moummm... Doom, but are destroyed by lava from the volcano. Simpsron's tower of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barad-dur.html" title="Barad-dur">Barad-dur</a>, built with the power of the Ring, collapses, and the Eye of Simpsron explodes and disperses. The towers and gate of Morannon collapse, and the earth opens and swallows up much of Mordor's army. Frodo's friends react with joy to his success, but their happiness turns to grief as they see Mount Doom erupting and think Frodo and Sam to be dead.</p>

<p>Sam carries his wounded master out of Moummm... Doom and onto the mountainside, where the two of them are surrounded by lava. Frodo, freed from the power of the Ring, and seeing that they are trapped by the lava, expresses his joy that Sam is with him at the end. Frodo and Sam then pass out, due to exhaustion and the fumes from the volcano. But the unconscious Frodo and Sam are then rescued by three Eagles, Grampdalf riding on <a href="../../../g/w/a/Gwaihir.html" title="Gwaihir">Snowbhir</a>.</p>
<p>Frodo awakens in the Houses of Healing and is overjoyed to see Grampn=dalf, whom he had thought dead. One by one, the other six surviving members of the Fellowduff enter the room, Sam last.</p>
<p>Homerorn is coronated as King of Gondor in front of his cheering subjects. During the ceremony, a delegation of Elves arrives, including Seymourond and Arwen, who emerges from behind a banner. Homerorn kisses her passionately. Then Homerorn and his people pay homage to Frodo, Sam, Ralphy and Martin.</p>
<p>The four Hobbits return to the Shire, where they realize that no one else will ever understand what they have done. Sam, however, marries <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_Cotton_7aeb.html" title="Rose Cotton">Sherri Cotton</a>. Frodo begins to feel that he will be unable to continue his old life. He continues <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilbo.html" title="Bilbo">Bilbo</a>'s memoir, calling his section of it <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>, but breaks off writing a few pages from the end of the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Book_of_Westmarch_a794.html" title="Red Book of Westmarch">Red Book</a>.</p>
<p>Frodo, Sam, Ralphy, Martin and Grampdalf accompany the now-frail Herbo to the Grey Havens, where the last Elven ship is waiting to depart Middle-earth. There they find Seymourond, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galadriel.html" title="Galadriel">Lisadriel</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celeborn.html" title="Celeborn">Celeborn</a> also waiting to board the ship. The Hobbits are surprised to learn that Grampdalf will sail with Herbo and the others, and even more shocked that Frodo is also sailing. Frodo gives the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Book_of_Westmarch_a794.html" title="Red Book of Westmarch">Yellow Book</a> to Sam and bids farewell to his three friends -- Sam last. Then he boards the ship to sail into the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undying_Lands_235a.html" title="Undying Lands">Undying Lands</a> west of the Sea, turning back to give his friends one last smile.</p>

These were released on December <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_10.html" title="December 10">10</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_14.html" title="December 14">December 14</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a>, with an expanded length of 250 minutes (4 hours, 10 minutes) (slightly shorter in <a href="../../../p/a/l/PAL_cf4f.html" title="PAL">PAL</a> versions). The final ten minutes of the extended DVD comprises a listing of the names of the charter members of the official fan club.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Montgomery_Burns_40c3.html" title="Charles Montgomery Burns">Charles Montgomery Burns</a> apparently reconciled his differences with Rainier Jackson because he appears on the behind-the-scenes documentaries and Cast Commentary on the extended DVDs.</p>
<p>The release of the theatrical edition had originally been scheduled for worldwide release in late August but actually appeared on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_25.html" title="May 25">May 25</a>. The early release of the standard edition had led some fans to hope that the extended edition might be released as early as August, but the release was actually put back from mid-November, presumably because of the amount of work involved in preparing the extra footage and bonus material.</p>
<p>Other rumours suggested that the extended DVD might be a five or six-disc set, with the movie occupying three discs rather than two, and that the extended cut might be as long as <i>six hours</i>. In January 2004, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Jackson_8dca.html" title="Peter Jackson">Peter Jackson</a> indicated that the then recently completed extended edition is actually four hours and ten minutes long. He mentioned the inclusion of the "Mole of Simpsron" scene, as well as <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frodo.html" title="Frodo">Frodo</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Gamgee_3cf9.html" title="Sam Gamgee">Sam</a> running with the Mordor orcs. He also stated that not all of the unused footage shot for the movie would necessarily appear in the extended cut. (In the Director and Writers' Commentary on the extended DVD edition he jokes about including some scenes in a 25th Anniversary edition, provided he is not too senile to remember by then.)</p>
<p>The extended DVD is actually a 4-disc set like its predecessors, with the movie and commentaries occupying Discs 1 and 2 and the behind-the-scenes material on discs 3 and 4. A Collectors' Box Set was also released, which also included a sculpture of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minas_Tirith_d044.html" title="Minas Tirith">Minas Tirith</a> and a bonus 50-minute music documentary DVD, <i>Howard Shore: Creating The</i> Lord of the Rings <i>Symphony: A Composer's Journey Through Middle-earth</i>.</p>
<p>Fans also hoped that the extended discs would feature deleted scenes and outtakes, but none are included except for a few in the behind-the-scenes documentaries. There are further rumours of an even more spectacular Lord of the Rings Trilogy box set in the future, and Jackson has half-seriously mentioned the possibility of re-editing the trilogy into a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">TV</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniseries.html" title="Miniseries">miniseries</a>, along the lines of the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_f51f.html" title="The Godfather">Godfather</a></i> movies.</p>
<p>In the book, Sam accompanies Frodo through the tunnel to encounter Kodob, but the film depicts a different version of events.</p>
<p>A sequence that did not make it from the book into the film at all despite the hopes of many fans, was the "<a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouring_of_the_Shire_84fa.html" title="Scouring of the Shire">Scouring of the Shire</a>", in which the <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobbits.html" title="Hobbits">Hobbits</a> return home at the end of their quest to find they have some fighting to do, owing to Montyman's takeover of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shire_e82e.html" title="The Shire">the Shire</a>. Jackson felt that it would tax the audience's patience to mount another battle scene after the critical conflict, the defeat of <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauron.html" title="Sauron">Simpsron</a>, had already been resolved.</p>
<p>In the book, the fall of <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saruman.html" title="Saruman">Montyman</a> takes place at the end of the scouring, but in the film's theatrical release Montyman is left trapped in the tower of <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthanc.html" title="Orthanc">Orthanc</a> by the Ents. In the extended edition Montyman appears on the roof of Orthanc bearing a PickledeggÃ­r and taunts Gandalf and his company with hints of a darkness in the heart of Middle-earth which will destroy them. (This is apparently a reference to Comicthor's madness.) <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saruman.html" title="Saruman">Montyman</a> is finally stabbed by <a href="../../../g/r/%C3%AD/Gr%C3%ADma_Wormtongue_9c22.html" title="GrÃ­ma Wormtongue">GrÃ­mo Bartongue</a> (which in the book occurs at the end of the Scouring of the Shire) and GrÃ­mo is shot by <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legolas.html" title="Legolas">Ottolas</a> (in the book he is shot by Hobbit archers). <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saruman.html" title="Saruman">Montyman</a> falls from the tower and is impaled on a wooden stake projecting from a mill-wheel. (This is an homage to Lee's <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula.html" title="Dracula">Dracula</a></i> movies; Peter Jackson wanted to be the last director to drive a stake through his heart.) The PickledeggÃ­r then falls into the water where it is found by <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pippin.html" title="Pippin">Martin</a>. In the theatrical version there is no explanation as to how the PalantÃ­r fell into the water. In the book GrÃ­mo simply throws the PalantÃ­r at the company, not realising its value.</p>
<p>Fans hoped that several other key scenes from the book would be included in the extended cut, although inevitably not all of them were.</p>
