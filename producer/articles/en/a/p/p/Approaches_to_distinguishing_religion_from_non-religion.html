<p>Those concerned with <b>distinguishing religion from non-religion</b> divide into two broadly defined schools of thought: function-based and form-based.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">Religion</a> as a subject generates much study and discussion in the fields of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a>, <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociology</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropology.html" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>. Specialists in these fields, as well as <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laity.html" title="Laity">ordinary people</a> — <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theism.html" title="Theism">theists</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheists</a>, and <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnostics</a> alike — often disagree about the fundamental nature of religion. Consequently, any meaningful discussion of religion should begin by answering certain "basic" questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>"What constitutes a religious belief?"</li>
<li>"What is the difference between religious and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular.html" title="Secular">secular</a> beliefs?"</li>
<li>"How do we identify religious beliefs?"</li>
<li>"Are religions individual or group activities?"</li>
<li>"What methodology shall we use to investigate these questions?"</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these and similar questions can then serve as a common ground upon which to base further discussion.</p>
<p>With the aim of making the conclusions of such discussion acceptable to people from diverse religious backgrounds, that discussion must make as few assumptions as possible. However, this article starts with the following <i>a priori</i> assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sets of beliefs exist, labelled "religious".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Observers can recognize such beliefs as "religious" and can distinguish them from non-religious beliefs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(The most controversial:) Ways exist to classify beliefs either as "religious" or as "non-religious".</li>
</ul>
<p>The last assumption generates the most controversy because two main ways of looking at the world exist, each bringing with it certain <i>a priori</i> assumptions that nobody usually recognizes as such. While studies of a particular religion made from each viewpoint may come to many of the same conclusions, the two approaches differ over (for example) what beliefs to regard as religious, and the effects of religions.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Approaches_to_distinguishing_religion_from_non-religion.html" title="Edit section: Function-based school of thought">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Function-based school of thought</span></h2>
<p>One approach, sometimes referred to as "Hebrew thought", defines "religion" as any set of beliefs that fulfills certain functions in an individual's <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_life.html" title="Personal life">life</a>, especially answering questions about <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_belief.html" title="Creation belief">our origins</a>, present <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontology.html" title="Ontology">existence</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleology.html" title="Teleology">purpose</a>, thereby forming the individual's attitudes, values, morality and actions. Consequently, adherents of this approach regard any belief-system which answers any of these questions as "religious", including such non-theistic belief systems as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular_Humanism_7ea9.html" title="Secular Humanism">secular humanism</a>, and <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">biological evolution</a>.</p>
<p>The main advantage of this approach lies in its ability to incorporate seamlessly all of the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief_system.html" title="Belief system">belief-systems</a> popularly or traditionally considered religious, including some of the <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnostic</a> forms of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. Advocates of the functional approach point out another advantage: its recognition of the fact that the phenomenon usually perceived as conflict between "religion" and "anti-religion" reduces to competition between different <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalism.html" title="Fundamentalism">fundamentalisms</a>.</p>
<p>One difficulty in applying this approach arises from the fact that many individuals (just like many groups) hold multiple belief-systems, some of which may contradict others, and some of which people <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypocrisy.html" title="Hypocrisy">feign</a>; consequently, difficulties can often arise in recognizing the effect that any particular belief system has on an individual. Another inter-related difficulty with the functional approach emerges in that it tries to evaluate what act as the inner guiding principles within an individual, his "religion" as it were, by the fruits those principles produce in his <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitude_%28psychology%29.html" title="Attitude (psychology)">attitudes</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/l/Value_%28personal_and_cultural%29.html" title="Value (personal and cultural)">values</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality.html" title="Morality">morality</a> and actions. It does not necessarily consider those beliefs and associations he admits to in public. Though a difficulty, the evaluation process can serve to distinguish true adherents to a particular religion from those who merely join the organization for reasons other than belief.</p>
<p>When studying specific religions or comparative religion, a functional study typically starts with an analysis of the teachings of the belief system, which includes an analysis of the "sacred writings" connected with the belief system if they exist. In this analysis the researcher looks for:</p>
<ul>
<li>internal consistency</li>
<li>whether the belief system answers the basic functional questions of origins, ontology and teleology</li>
<li>how well it correlates to observation</li>
<li>how it guides an individual's attitudes, values, morality and actions, even how he thinks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The research may assesses how well the religion concerned integrates with daily life: is it merely ritual that once acted upon can be forgotten as done, or is it a belief that informs every action an individual does?</p>
<p>A functional study also looks at those who claim to follow the religion: to see if they truly follow it or not, and why.</p>
<p>Questions concerning group beliefs, actions and institutions, though important, remain secondary because they result from <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">doctrine</a> and from individual response. Group beliefs may actually represent cultural norms and institutions rather than individual belief and practice, so that though they may appear to constitute a religion, they actually do not do so.</p>
<p>Some social scientists, such as <a href="../../../%C3%A9/m/i/%C3%89mile_Durkheim_ed0d.html" title="Émile Durkheim">Émile Durkheim</a>, emphasize the social aspects of functional forms of religion, seeing such aspects as a means of providing social cohesion and community. Other social scientists now define religion by its consequences not in social life but in the personal life of individuals. These authors define religion as “a combination of forms and symbolic acts which relate the individual to the ultimate conditions of his existence", (Bellah 1964: 358) or as “a system of beliefs and practices through which a group of people faces the fundamental problems of life”. (Yinger 1970: 7)</p>
<p>The fourth definition of religion in <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=religion&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" class="external text" title="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=religion&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow">Webster's Online Dictionary</a> also illustrates this form of the functional approach: it defines religion as "a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith.html" title="Faith">faith</a>".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Approaches_to_distinguishing_religion_from_non-religion.html" title="Edit section: Form-based school of thought">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Form-based school of thought</span></h2>
<p>Also called "Greek thought", the form-based method occurs most widely by far. Academia, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociologists</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropology.html" title="Anthropology">anthropologists</a> and Western philosophers use it almost universally.</p>
<p>Most people, particularly those influenced by "Western" culture, almost instinctively recognize which of their beliefs they recognize as "religious" and which as "secular". Usually unconsciously, they have already made <i>a priori</i> assumptions such as "There are beliefs that are 'religious'", "Religious beliefs are not the same as secular beliefs". Typical assumptions imparted by Western culture which aid in recognizing "religious" beliefs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A belief counts as religious if those who believe in it label it as "religious".</li>
<li>A belief counts as religious if it deals with "spiritual" matters.</li>
<li>A belief counts as religious if it results in ritual practices designed to invoke a higher reality (examples include <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prayer.html" title="Prayer">prayer</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worship.html" title="Worship">worship</a>).</li>
<li>If a belief is agnostic or atheistic and does not result in ritual practices, it counts as "secular".</li>
<li>If a belief, organization and rituals associated with them are not intended to promote a "religious" teaching, then they count as "secular". Secular political parties in secular government with their beliefs and rituals exemplify secular organizations.</li>
<li>"<a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">Scientific</a>" beliefs count as secular.</li>
</ul>
<p>When studying specific religions and comparative religions, discussions typically begin by answering questions about uncontroversial, easily verifiable facts, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>"What beliefs do different groups of people hold?"</li>
<li>"What practices do these beliefs inspire?"</li>
<li>"What institutions arise as a result of these beliefs and practices?"</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, answering these questions will create a body of data to serve as a basis for all further discourse, including the answers to the "basic" questions mentioned in the first paragraph of this section.</p>
<p>This method offers at least three advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>people who hold to agnostic and atheistic belief systems can decide for themselves whether what they believe is a religious or secular belief-system</li>
<li>it conforms to widely-held societal and academic norms, aiding in communication</li>
<li>in that it conforms to societal and academic norms, it avoids misunderstanding and conflict that can arise when using minority approaches, such as the functional approach discussed above.</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast to the functional approach, the use of Greek thought as the methodology to study religion, with its emphasis on the inherently uncontroversial statements about religion's external manifestations, its expressed statements and rituals, occasions less controversy and seems easily recognizable; therefore people with widely differing views of religion find Greek thought more readily acceptable. Consequently, most major thinkers prefer to begin by examining the easily-observable external forms of religion.</p>
<p>Webster's Online dictionary illustrates the form-based approach in its definition 1b of religion: "the service and worship of God or the supernatural."</p>

<p>The question as to how to distinguish a religion from a non-religion does not just arise in theoretical discussion. In the case of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> courts of law have considered the problem, for example in the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. Classification as a religion may give tax privileges. Some critics of Scientology portray it as a business and not as a genuine religion. See <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_controversy.html" title="Scientology controversy">Scientology controversy</a>.</p>
<p>Some commentators have described <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discordianism.html" title="Discordianism">Discordianism</a> both as an elaborate joke disguised as a religion, and as a religion disguised as an elaborate joke. Some followers of Discordianism see it as "a religion disguised as a joke disguised as a religion". <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">Episkopos</a> Aloysius Thudthwacker in an <a href="http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/faith.html" class="external text" title="http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/faith.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> has pointed out a few similarities between Christianity and Discordianism. Some Discordians have described Discordians as <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoism.html" title="Taoism">Taoists</a> with a strange sense of humor and with the inability to sit still. Readers may try their hand at classifying Discordianism, for it provides a very difficult case-study to unravel.</p>
