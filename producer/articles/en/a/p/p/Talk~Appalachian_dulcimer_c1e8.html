<p>I'd like to propose that this article be restructured, based to a certain extent the structure of the <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxophone.html" title="Saxophone">Saxophone</a> article, one musical instrument article that has reached Featured Article status. The new structure would be as follows:</p>
<p><b>History</b> (incorporating the current "Usage" and "Musicians who play" sections) -- <b>Construction</b> (incorporating current "Production" section) -- <b>Modes and tuning</b> (rewrite of current section) -- <b>Types of dulcimers</b> (new section on various types including bass, baritone, dulcimette, electric) -- <b>Technique</b> (now called Playing) -- <b>References</b> -- <b>See also</b> -- <b>External links</b></p>
<p>I'll wait a while to see if there's any feedback before I attempt any reorganization. Cheers, 3oranges 20:41, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Your suggestions on organization make sense to me. This was my first attempt at this sort of thing, I'm glad it wasn't a total failure.</p>
<p>With regard to your comments on the Modes and Tunings section, Ralph Lee Smith (no relation) writes in "Appalachian Dulcimer Traditions" (The Scarecrow Press, 2002) that dulcimers were not typically played with other instruments, so the absolute pitch of the notes was not critical, only the relationship between them. The strings were tuned so that they were at a "good tension." He says that this means they were usually tuned somewhere between a C and an E, but this was dependent on the actual length of the instrument's string span, and some Virginia dulcimers could be tuned up to F. He discusses the 1 5 5 type tunings, like CGG or DAA as being the usual case, but that other modal tunings were also used. As you mentioned, there is also a tradition of tuning all the strings to the same note, usually with the bass string an octave lower than the middle and melody strings. This is usually called "Galax" tuning after the town in Virgina where this arrangment was popular. In this arrangement, one can play tunes in either D mixolydian, with the drones being the root of the scale, or in G ionian where the drones are the fifth of the scale without having to retune. (From DDD tuning)</p>
<p>I've been a little free with the terms like "fifth" etc. In the traditional sense, these were probably perfect fifths, i.e. "beatless" fifths, and the fret pattern was likely set for just intonation. Modern instruments are usually built with an equal tempered scale, so the fifth is a couple of cents off of the perfect 2/3 ratio of frequencies.</p>

<p>Rewritten to include citations, and to cover a wider range of playing styles. This article should probably be called "Technique." Cheers, danrharper (at) aol (dot) com, 26 November 2006</p>

<p>There's a lot of confusion between a mode and a tuning on the Appalachian dulcimer. The two concepts are linked, when applied to the instrument, but they are seperate subjects. While tuned to DAD one can play in any of the standard "Church" modes. You can also do this in DAA, DAC, etc. I made some edits to the article to try to ease some of the confusion. For a more thorough discussion see the article on my website, <a href="http://www.sksmithmusic.com/virtual_classroom/modes.html" class="external free" title="http://www.sksmithmusic.com/virtual_classroom/modes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sksmithmusic.com/virtual_classroom/modes.html</a>.</p>

<p>The whole section on strings and tuning needs to be rewritten. First, the articles needs citations from folklorists or musical historians regarding the assertion that DAA is the traditional tuning -- as a counterexample, Bonnie Russell tunes her dulcimer to ddD, said to be the traditional tuning in her region of Virginia; other traditional players tune to dAD. Also, as Steven Smith points out, there is an important distinction between tuning and modes -- in addition to that distinction, a dulcimer can be built such that fret intonation is equal temperament (which does not yield perfect fifths) or some form of just intonation that will yield perfect fifths in some modes, but not in others. While this may seem like too much of a distinction, some dulcimer makers build their instruments with the frets in Ionian mode (whole number fractions of the theoretical string length), instead of spacing them according to equal temperament (using square root of 12 as the multiplier), meaning that retuning the strings or using a capo can result in some strange intervals. Also, the description of tuning and the "warbling sound" is pretty confusing -- why not just describe how to tune using harmonics? (or completely skip the description of how to tune). The description of making a home-made capo should probably be removed, unless the article also describes the far more basic tasks of how to make a pick from a turkey feather, and how to make a noter from a piece of dowel.</p>
<p>All this criticism is meant in the best possible way -- hopefully to inspire someone with deeper knowledge of the history and mechanics of the instrument takes this on (i.e., I'm not qualified to write it, I'm barely qualified enough to criticize).

<p>Well when I read the article about the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammered_dulcimer.html" title="Hammered dulcimer">Hammered dulcimer</a>, I got the idea she cannot play that but must have played this one on her outstanding performance of "Time After Time" with Patti LaBelle on VH1 Divas Live on April 04th, 2004. Can anyone confirm, was it an Appalachian one? -andy 80.129.87.119 10:41, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>she played a mountain dulcimer on strawberry fields at "come together," a televised john lennon tribute concert. -- mwbassguy</p>
