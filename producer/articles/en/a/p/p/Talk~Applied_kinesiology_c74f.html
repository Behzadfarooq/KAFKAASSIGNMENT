<p>Someone felt the civic duty to insert parts of the previous article in a heading to the article. I deleted it because the definition of AK they provided was innaccurate. (damn right I'm a proponent of applied kinesiology). kleindoc</p>
<p><br />
These former entries on Applied Kinesiology focus on a minor curiosity within AK without recognizing the main thrust of the technique and its contribution towards understanding complex biomechanical mechanisms. Crude muscle testing can indeed confirm whatever false findings the expectation of the Dr. or subject desires. The point is that careful muscle testing, with efforts to isolate the prime mover and observation to detect recruitment does give useful information about function in associated joints. kleindoc; 7/22/03.</p>

<dd><i>since the methods used are easily explained with the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo_effect.html" title="Placebo effect">placebo effect</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/g/Suggestion_%28psychology%29.html" title="Suggestion (psychology)">suggestion</a>, and the explanations offered by its practitioners radically depart from accepted scientific knowledge. In fact, some of the techniques have been used in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjuring.html" title="Conjuring">conjuring</a> tricks for many years.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>For example, suppose the patient has a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candida.html" title="Candida">Candida</a> infection, which the pratitioner believes can be healed with <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pau_d%27arco.html" title="Pau d'arco">pau d'arco</a>. The patient holds his arm horizontally while the doctor tries to push it down. Then the patient touches the infected area with the other hand and the muscle holding up the arm goes weak and the doctor easily pushes it down. He then puts some pau d'arco on his tongue and touches the infection; this time the muscle remains strong.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Such "diagnoses" serve merely to reinforce the expectations of the practitioner and the patient.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is one of those highly POV approaches to the subject. If you're going to make claims about easily explainable methods, you should at least state what methods you are trying to explain. Departure from "accepted scientific knowledge" is not a sufficient argument to make something pseudoscience.</p>
<p>The "candida" paragraph strikes me a a "straw man" type of argument. It begins with a technique that might be accepted by a minority of knesiologists, ridicules it, and uses that as a "proof" that the entire subject is pseudoscience.</p>
<p>Also what "expectations" are trying to be reinforced? <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a> 19:06 Jan 16, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>AK claims that certain substances (that the subject may be allergic to) interfere with their "bio-energy" field, or aura. When the substance is placed near them, it disrupts the aura and weakens them, when removed they are strong again. This is pure nonsense, and fits the definition of "pseudoscience" perfectly. Also, "quackery" and "magical thinking". If there are any valid studies which demonstrate the existence of this mystical energy field, let alone that it can weaken you, please provide them for reference. It's not trolling or ignorance to point out that this sort of thing cannot stand up to simple, basic scrutiny. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoatBringer_f2ea.html" title="User:StoatBringer">StoatBringer</a> 19:29, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>From the perspective of <a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibrational_psychology.html" title="Vibrational psychology">vibrational psychology</a>, AK is a valid technique for measuring the relative strength or weakness of a <a href="../../../m/e/m/Meme.html" title="Meme">thought form</a> without regard to whether it is strictly true, eg: the thought "I can stand up" may have a pronounced effect on whether a person in a wheelchair can gather the strength to stand up. -- 70.29.131.204 18:02, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So what? I don't get your logic. Are you saying that vibrational psychologists are qualified to judge AK because they are capable of inventing falsifiable hypotheses?

<dd>I'm saying that calling a whole field of research quackery is like hiding your head in the sand. Regardless of the academic rigour (or lack thereof) of the bulk of research in <i>any</i> field, it's all too easy for detractors to come up with <a href="../../../s/o/f/Soft_target.html" title="Soft target">soft targets</a> when they want to deprecate something. Would you call a researcher like <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Blackmore_3ef5.html" title="Susan Blackmore">Susan Blackmore</a> a quack? Rather than call on credentials, would it not be <i>far more useful</i> to expose which hypotheses are testable? None of the above papers look at AK from the perspectives of memetics. So, quite frankly, a null result says to me they are simply not asking the right questions. -- <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.234.56.130.html" title="User:216.234.56.130">216.234.56.130</a> 19:58, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>"calling a whole field of research quackery is like hiding your head in the sand" is cheap rhetorics. Replace AK by flat earthism or whatever, and your sentence works just as well, or rather, just as badly.</li>
<li>"Soft targets" - see JM's response below.</li>
<li>"Would you call a researcher like <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Blackmore_3ef5.html" title="Susan Blackmore">Susan Blackmore</a> a quack?" - she does memetics, but not, as far as I know, "vibrational psychology" or AK. This is an attempt at freeloading.</li>
<li>"Rather than call on credentials" - who called on credentials? Straw man.</li>
<li>"a null result says to me they are simply not asking the right questions" - yeah, right. The possibility that it does not work is the most reasonable assumption. Of course you can believe otherwise, but that's your POV. --<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_Gadling_e6d2.html" title="User:Hob Gadling">Hob Gadling</a> 11:28, August 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>So, where are the properly done studies supporting AK? Surely they exist for such an old "field of research." It is extremely simple to test the claims of AKologists. Take the claim that one can distinguish between two compounds applied to a test subject. Then repeat the test under conditions in which nobody in the room, including the subject, knows which compound has been applied (you can't compare water and maple syrup)- the AKologist cannot do better than random guessing. Find any AKologist and try it yourself. JM</p>
<dl>
<dd>True. But my argument is not to debunk the claims of such a soft target as that, but to find out what science actually could do with applied kinesiology if-only people would ask the right questions. Testing for whether a person can distinguish between water vs maple syrop is just plain wrong (and a waste of time). Testing for whether a thought form (eg: "I'm being chased by a bear", or "there's a beautiful woman watching") affects my ability to climb a rock face may well be useful. -- <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.234.56.130.html" title="User:216.234.56.130">216.234.56.130</a> 15:40, 26 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>for this it doesn't make sense to use double-blind because the <i>patient</i> must read/picture the thought form ("what is really being measured here?") and performance or mood enhancement above <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo.html" title="Placebo">placebo</a> would have to be established if this is to be a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_treatment.html" title="Medical treatment">medical treatment</a>. -- 70.29.131.204 00:52, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If there is a way to test that in a proper procedure without gaping holes - go on, test it. Then come back and write that AK failed. Or that it worked. Until then, it's pseudoscience because it makes claims it can't back up except with ridiculous, amateurish "experiments". --<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_Gadling_e6d2.html" title="User:Hob Gadling">Hob Gadling</a> 11:28, August 30, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well firstly, there are devices for accurately measuring muscle strength that do not involve pitting the researcher's will against the subject's. See (<a href="http://www.scalesgalore.com/lafayette_hand_strength_testers.htm#j00105" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scalesgalore.com/lafayette_hand_strength_testers.htm#j00105" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). Next, there could be many variables affecting strength, so small numbers of trials should not be expected to produce meaningful results. Instead, the test group should be given randomized thought forms to test, (include in this a collection of thought forms that are stratified w.r.t. the supposed helpfulness or harmfulness of their <i>vibration</i>; The book <i>power versus force</i> by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_R._Hawkins_b4f6.html" title="David R. Hawkins">David R. Hawkins</a> has a number of these) and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monte_Carlo_method_ff34.html" title="Monte Carlo method">Monte Carlo methods</a> can be applied in the case of small <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effect_size.html" title="Effect size">effect sizes</a>, to show just how significant are the results. This will likely mean using a few hundred subjects with a total of perhaps a thousand trials spread over a few weeks. Now because AK does not currently have status as a credible science, this work will be difficult to fund, and researchers will have a hard time finding journals to publish their results. But if this work <i>is</i> done, then its results <i>must</i> be reported somewhere. What else will tighten up the protocols? -- <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.234.56.130.html" title="User:216.234.56.130">216.234.56.130</a> 19:46, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a long-time Wikipedia supporter, it saddens me to see its editing sink into little more than ignorance-by-choice and namecalling.</p>
<p>Perhaps the original Wikipedia editor said it best:</p>
<p>"(Larry) Sanger's stated reason for ending his participation in Wikipedia and Nupedia as a volunteer was that he could not do justice to the task as a part-time volunteer; later he admitted that there had existed "a certain poisonous social or political atmosphere in the project" which had also accounted for his departure.</p>
<p>"In December 2004 Sanger wrote a critical article for the website Kuro5hin. While claiming "to appreciate the merits of Wikipedia fully" and to know and support "the mission and broad policy outlines of Wikipedia very well", Sanger maintained that there are <b>serious problems with the project</b>. There was, he wrote, a lack of public perception of credibility, and the project put <b>"difficult people, trolls, and their enablers" into too much prominence</b>; these problems, he maintained, were a feature of the project's "anti-elitism, or <b>lack of respect for expertise</b>." The article was the subject of much controversy in the blogosphere and led to some reaction in the news media as well."</p>
<p>This, dear reader, is __precisely__ what is going on here with the disdainful language on the part of (as Sanger has said) "trolls" for matters that they merely unknowledgable of (in this case, the paradigm-shifting and highly validated concepts of 'Applied Kinesiology'), but are in fact both quite real and readily available.</p>
<p>I regret that I must withdraw future support for Wikipedia. It clearly is an agenda-of-ignorance run amok. --66.69.219.9, 20:18, August 27, 2005</p>

<p>There's a closely-related article at <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diagnostic_kinesiology.html" title="Diagnostic kinesiology">Diagnostic kinesiology</a>, however the two articles conflict on their relationship. Much of the "DK" article seems to overlap with this AK article. If anyone is interested and knowledgeable they might visit the other article and see what can be done.

<p>We should be careful not to conflate "science" with "mainstream scientific thought". "Science" is fundamentally a method of pursuing truth and does not make inherent truth claims. It would be more accurate to say "most scientists dispute" or "... has not held up to specific scientific scrutiny" rather than simply to say "Science says that ..."</p>
<p>As written, the article is very hostile to the idea of AK, a view that not all of its readers, including the present author, are inclined to share. In light of the non-unanimity of the views presented in this article, I would urge greater levels of detail, explaining in the fullest detail possible the means by which AK has been scientifically investigated, while providing a link page that provides at least one view that is favorable toward AK. As written, and by looking through this talk page, the "scientific" view against AK has a very dogmatic and angry tone, which might reflect poorly upon this otherwise fine encyclopedia.</p>

<dd>Whoever has written this definition of applied kinesiology -- apparently an American living in Denmark, full of the expatriates common arrogance -- is unqualified to speak about it. The arm pull down test, which this writer maintains is the diagnostic test in applied kinesiology, is not an AK muscle test at all, at all. Which muscle is being tested in the arm pull down test. In AK, every muscle in the body that can be specifically isolated and tested is done so. Inhibitions of these muscles upon testing are then specifically treated so that both the patient and the doctor will know whether the treatment has "cut the mustard."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is rejecting a much more comprehensive and accurate definition of AK for this one which is mostly rancorous bile and dust in the eye of a reader who, like the author, knows very little about the art and science of manual muscle testing and AK... Scott Cuthbert 02:00, 5 March 2006</dd>

<dd>I think that Scott Cuthbert's contributions are valid. It explains to the reader what Applied Kinesiology is, what doctors who use it are doing, looking for, etc. Explaining with endless links why people don't like AK is very self-serving and doesn't give the reader a NPOV. This IMO makes the purpose of the article to be why some people hate AK.

Scott, I have no idea what you are talking about, but if you are referring to myself - an American in Denmark - then you are way off base on several points:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Authorship:</b> I have had very little to do with the content of this article. I am even the one who included the link to the ICAK, and you should be thankful for that. I happen to have a rather complete list of all AK organizations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>My knowledge of AK:</b> I know more than you are aware of, but that is irrelevant to this discussion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Your insults and tone:</b> Here at Wikipedia we are to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and refrain from <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">attacks and insults</a>. "Comment on content, not on the contributor." I don't think anyone has accused you of being a bad person or willfully violating Wikipedia policies.

</ul>
<p>We need a citation for the claim that some, mostly chiropractors, consider AK to be "an application of <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinesiology.html" title="Kinesiology">academic kinesiology</a>." Among people that don't know anything about these two subjects there can be confusion, but among scientists there is no confusion. I know that Cuthbert confuses the two, but he's an exception. There must be other examples. We need their explanation of why they confuse the two. Without a citation that sentence should be deleted as it reflects badly on chiropractors. Even though AK is a chiropractic technique, the Danish Chiropractic Association has an official policy that nearly forbids its use by chiropractors in their clinics. This is the only example to my knowledge of any chiropractic organization taking a position against a form of quackery (with the notable exception of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Association_for_Chiropractic_Medicine_842d.html" title="National Association for Chiropractic Medicine">NACM</a>. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 23:28, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do you have anything other than “STOP NOW”. Do you really know what mainstream scientists are thinking? Multiple links to an ex-psychiatrist’s websites constitute SPAM. Article on Dr. Goodheart is interesting for readers. Many professions, including MDs use Applied Kinesology. I thought this was open to the public.

<dd>I do in fact know what mainstream scientists are thinking as I talk to them every day. This, along with about a billion other areas of quackery is just what most of them think it is, nonsense. I've reverted your highly POV edits while keeping the time link to Goodheart. There do not need to be two links to the exact same thing either. Also, your labelling of anyone who counters your POV edits as "bullys" in order ti garner sympathy for your cause will fail.

<dd>Hello all. I have to say I'm impressed by the neutralness of the article. The basic assertions of AK are shown, and the light of science is shone upon it neutrally. I noticed similar styles with other articles - the TFT article is getting really clear and neutral, the NLP article also (though the pressure to remove scientific fact and view is enormous). I am doing my own research into confirmation bias in the new therapies. This is an interesting one. Thanks for the facts presented (and maintained). I'm going to do my own searches, so I may add some of my own. I got a huge amount of really good literature about pseudosciences from these controversial articles, especially the NLP article. I hope to contribute some of my own. I know a lot of believers can hardly help themselves and want to remove facts all the time. If I can help maintain facts on my weekly checks, I will.

<dd>Above I forgot to mention another case of quackery being opposed by a chiropractic organization. Since 1978 the Chiropractic Association of Saskatchewan has banned the Activator, a quack device invented by a chiropractor and used by many chiropractors <a href="http://www.canoe.ca/PedChiro/illegaldevices.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.canoe.ca/PedChiro/illegaldevices.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://www.canoe.ca/PedChiro/watchdogs.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.canoe.ca/PedChiro/watchdogs.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. This was a positive move, but it has since lifted its ban, which means that it now acts like other chiropractic organzations by failing to curtail quackery in chiropractic. <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3987/is_200307/ai_n9268273" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3987/is_200307/ai_n9268273" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-38%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=canada+chiropractic+activator+banned&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-38%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=canada+chiropractic+activator+banned&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></dd>

<dd>Will, splitting the sentences, while they flow better, still are not sourced. The first source you mentioned has nothing to do with scientists. It is a story about why an ex-psychiatrist doesn't seem to like a chap named Stoner.</dd>

<dd>As for the second part, I checked the references at the end that you suggested and couldn't find anything about "businesses, government agencies, and the public at large being duped into adopting AK as a dubious therapy." Unless I missed something, could you please show me the reference for the statements. Otherwise, according to WP policies, they should be removed.

<p>OK Will, I don't know how many different ways to tell you that the reply written by some MD is about naturopathy, not AK.

<p>This letter was written to a "Quackwatch", "Skeptic," and "CSICOP" doctor who, as you'll read below, has never treated a human skull or performed any type of cranial therapy on anyone. In fact, he is not licenced to diagnose or treat any patients. And yet, this Anatomist wrote a "Stephen Barrett/Fyslee" type smear about cranial therapy. Fyslee and his incessant attacks on Applied Kinesiology through Wikipedia are amusing...his certitude must come from the fact that he has only read one encyclopedia.

<p>Scott Cuthbert, D.C.</p>
<p>Cranial Therapeutic Care: Is There Any Evidence?: A Reply to Dr. Steven Hartman, Professor of Anatomy, University of New England</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chiroandosteo.com/content/14/1/10/comments" class="external text" title="http://www.chiroandosteo.com/content/14/1/10/comments" rel="nofollow">Quackery against Cranial Therapy</a></p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge (having now read everything that Dr. Hartman has published on cranial therapy) there is no place in Hartman’s writings where he claims that he has examined or treated a single human cranium himself and obtained results contrary to the ones Drs. Blum and Cuthbert claim in their response to him. It appears, from the available resources, that Dr. Hartman has not conducted any experiments to test the claims of cranial therapists. It appears that Dr. Hartman has, or thinks he has, the same kind of knowledge that other fundamentalists have – he knows what is possible and what is impossible, and so he does not have to investigate.</p>
<p>Dr. Hartman’s papal bulls against cranial therapy are very interesting and typical of scientific fundamentalism when enraged, in that one finds a strong, very strong suggestion that doctors who use cranial therapy are amateurish, scientifically immature, hallucinating, and knowingly misleading themselves and their patients.</p>
<p>However the evidence-based and outcomes movements now demand that a priori determinations (pro and con) about the methods of health care delivery be resisted, and that all methods be open to testing. The fact that Hartman is not a clinician nor clinical researcher yet makes insistent claims about clinical therapeutic possibilities points up one of the philosophical problems in the evidence-based movement. According to Tanenbaum [1], the danger is that it may present statistical analysis as superior rather than complementary to other forms of knowledge. The statisticians and those who pay them understandably want neat figures. However uncertainty and subjectivity are at the heart of any clinical encounter. As every clinician knows, good evidence can lead to bad practice if applied in an uncaring way or in an unappealing atmosphere. The clinician wants to know where empathy and the experience of accumulated cases and patterns of clinical responses fit into the equation. According to ‘critics’ like Hartman, 60 years of cranial therapists and thousands of patients who were satisfied with their treatment and also successfully relieved of their conditions mean nothing. Many clinicians take quiet umbrage (more quiet than I am showing in this letter) at the randomized clinical trial as it holds all clinicians equal suggesting that the specific clinician does not matter. There are suspicions with trials that test a single technique – clinicians realize all the time that a single technique is only part of the total management package that they provide and that succeed in getting their patients well.</p>
<p>Black [2] notes that any movement which encourages self scrutiny and self analysis has to be good so long as it stops short of reducing the self confidence of clinicians. (Compare the endless polemics of Dr. Hartman and Norton against those clinicians, scientists, and clinical researchers who cannot see accurately what is directly in front of their faces and have to be corrected by Hartman and other “skeptics” far from the scene to know a priori what is and is not “possible.”)</p>
<p>“We would appreciate specific references to literature supporting this mechanism, associated diagnostic reliability, or practitioners’ ability to modify mechanistic parameters to a patient’s health advantage.” Drs. Blum and Cuthbert’s first response to Hartman included 6 highly-referenced textbooks on cranial therapy wherein at least 50 papers describing the clinical outcomes and measures of cranial treatment were given; where over 100 studies (employing radiologic, neuro-imaging, dissection, histological, ultrasonography, myoelectric and numerous mechanical devises) for measuring cranial motion were provided; another table was offered that exhaustively compiled 260 peer-reviewed papers on cranial theory and outcomes. Dr. Hartman’s certitude must be creating for him (if this term will be permitted) a scientific scotoma regarding the evidence.</p>
<p>I would like to inform Dr. Hartman that his constant refrain that “cranial rhythm based interexaminer reliability is zero” is erroneous. Even the negative studies on cranial therapy that he cites repeatedly in his papers do not show “interexaminer reliability of zero.”</p>
<p>One way researchers determine if a clinical test is consistent and repeatable over several trials is to analyze the reliability. Depending on the type of measurement that is performed, different types of reliability coefficients can be calculated. In all coefficients, the closer the value is to 1, the higher the reliability. For instance, calculating Cohen’s kappa coefficient would allow the researcher to determine how much agreement existed between the doctors palpating the cranial rhythm in a patient’s head. A value greater than .75 indicates ‘excellent’ agreement, a value between .40 and .75 indicates ‘fair to good’ agreement, and a value less than .40 indicates ‘poor’ agreement. [3] Dr. Hartman’s statement that the “interexaminer cranial palpation reliability is zero” means he hasn’t read the literature properly, and is mistaking ‘poor’ agreement for ‘zero’ agreement, whatever he thinks that might mean.</p>
<p>In clinical practice, it is often impossible to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of a clinical test. This is because sensitivity and specificity assume that the researcher or clinician already has the true answer. Sensitivity assumes that one has somehow first identified people with a true positive response, and then determines what percentage the desired test is correct in identifying these people. Likewise, specificity assumes that one has somehow first identified people with a true negative response, and then determines what percentage the diagnostic test is correct in identifying these people. However, in the clinical setting the opposite happens. First the test is performed and then the clinician asks, “Given that the test is positive, what is the probability that my patient truly has a positive response?”</p>
<p>Just suppose that cranial therapists are even partly or occasionally right. After all, even a stopped clock is right twice a day. But Dr. Hartman says, with the certitude of the Ayatollah, that cranial therapy “offers little hope that any direct clinical effect will ever be shown.”</p>
<p>It is obvious after reading Dr. Hartman’s proclamations on cranial therapy that he has a dogmatic faith that cranial movement, cranial therapy, cranial involvements in human physiology, and the entire cranial conception are impossible. But to assert this is to claim, tacitly, that Dr. Hartman already knows the full spectrum of the possible. In a century in which every decade has brought new and astonishing scientific shocks, that is a huge, brave and audacious faith indeed. It requires an almost heroic self-confidence and an equally gigantic ignorance of recent (especially osteopathic and chiropractic) intellectual history.</p>
<p>It may be unpopular for me to say so, but Dr. Hartman’s perpetual criticism of cranial therapy (especially relevant when he is not licensed to diagnose or treat patients; when he has no training in cranial therapy; and when he has no clinical experience of any kind) exhibits a learned man behaving with the bigotry of a Mississippi lynch mob, a scholar conspiring to suppress dissident opinion, a savant acting like a circus clown or hooligan.</p>
<p>The comparison of cranial therapists with blood-letters from the previous dark ages of medicine is an example of this kind. Though it may not yet make sense to Dr. Hartman that the cranium is a living, motile mechanism, I’ll remind him that what is “obvious to common sense” is not always true. I’ll remind him also that most great scientific breakthroughs were great shocks to common sense at first. Copernicus was unbelievable to those who “knew” and felt deeply that they were standing on an Earth that did not move; Darwin was equally stunning to those who knew they were not primates; Einstein was almost incomprehensible at first to those who knew that a rod has only one length which is “objective”; Sutherland seemed ridiculous to his peers who knew that no articulation above the atlas had any neurological significance—</p>
<p>And so in Dr. Hartman’s conception of chiropractic and osteopathy and manual medicine, what does a manual physician do about the central nervous system, when for many our initial education finished at the atlanto-occipital joint?</p>
<p><b>Another aspect of this letter must be cited. Dr. Hartman’s membership in “Quackwatch,” various “Skeptic” societies, and especially CSICOP (Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal) apparently has prepared him for his non-stop attacks on all the forms of Complimentary and Alternative Medicine that he dislikes. His use of the term “pseudoscience” in relationship to cranial therapy is a classic smear used in these circles to suggest, only suggest, that everyone who does not support their axioms (“scientific truths, and we know all the ones that count!”) are delusional. CSICOP’s method of “scientific investigation” generally is to wage a campaign of vilification, in the media, against any researcher whose ideas they don’t like.</b></p>
<p>I am not asserting a dogma regarding cranial therapy in contradiction to Dr. Hartman’s fundamentalist “no” to it. I am merely indicating that – when the experts cannot agree and even seem to misunderstand each other at times – a kind of biological agnosticism is not only scientifically more appropriate, and more in line with that virtue of humility which most sages and philosophers have urged, but also a matter of simple honesty with oneself. I’m still not insisting. I am only asking. Like all ignorant men I don’t know much, so I ask a lot of questions. Or to close with a quote from William Blake:</p>

<p>I propose that the term Pseudo-science be banned. It's clearly a loaded term used by a select group of people with an obvious agenda (And inferiority complex). <b>There's no need to try to villainize experimental and alternative sciences; stating in the article their status in the wider scientific community should be enough.</b></p>
<p>Nearly every article with "pseudoscience" in it has a POV tag, which I think proves it's a loaded term. The "scientists" on here with something to prove are too scared to state facts and allow people to come to their own conclusions so they need a term intended to kill credibility. I've read more than a few articles where a "pseudo-science" is obviously being directly attacked, rather than critiqued. Wiki needs to reign these self-righteous science-zealots in. 68.166.68.84 21:39, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, their needs to be research done into the world-wide acceptance of AK. As it is, the Danish article seems like it was arbitrarily placed to counter-act the legitimacy the American org gives it.</p>

<dd>in de.wikipedia (german) two VAs (mediating committees) to either ban PS as a category in wiki did happen in 2006. many users did participate in discussing the matter of constant conflict. twice no result, and no change of policy did happen. the conservative labeleing party reigns wiki. this situation of villainizing certain lemmas with a POV-term will remain a constant thorn in wiki's flesh.

<dd><i>There's no need to try to villainize experimental and alternative sciences; stating in the article their status in the wider scientific community should be enough.</i></dd>

<dd>fully agreed. NPOV is harshly not kept in a field that harbours an outlet of scientific skepticism and glorified <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debunker.html" title="Debunker">debunkers</a> throwing around 'quack'-weapon, a kind of faith based villainizing of the unwanted will continue disguised as purely 'scientific'.

<dd>smile, wiki in US and Europe alike - as it appears to me - is highly undermined by those "science-zealots". as long as this state-of-affairs doesn't change significantly no significant change in handling gross POV cases will come about. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrazia11_619c.html" title="User:Grazia11">Grazia11</a>
