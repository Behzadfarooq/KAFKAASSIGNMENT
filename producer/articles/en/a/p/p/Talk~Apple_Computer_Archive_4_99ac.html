<h2><span class="mw-headline">Notable litigation</span></h2>
<p>The summaries of the main cases Apple has been involved in are great, but I still think the section is too long. The main article should be where most of this stuff is discussed. If no one objects I'm going to remove this part of the section to try and trim down the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 1994 Apple was sued by the astronomer and science popularizer <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Sagan_68dc.html" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> for using his name as the internal code-name for the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Macintosh_7100_a1a9.html" title="Power Macintosh 7100">PowerMacintosh 7100</a>. After the suit was brought, Apple changed the codename to "BHA" for butt-head astronomer. Sagan lost the suit twice. See the Carl Sagan <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Sagan_68dc.html#Personality" title="Carl Sagan">article</a> for details.</i></dd>

<dd><i>In <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1998.html" title="July 1998">July 1998</a> <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Traya_518d.html" title="Abdul Traya">Abdul Traya</a> registered the domain name</i> appleimac.com<i>, two months after Apple announced the iMac, in an attempt to draw attention to a web-hosting business.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> After a legal dispute that lasted until <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1999.html" title="April 1999">April 1999</a>, Traya and Apple settled out of court with Apple paying legal fees and giving Traya a "token payment" in exchange for the domain name.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>In November 2000, Benjamin Cohen of <a href="http://www.cyberbritain.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.cyberbritain.co.uk" rel="nofollow">CyberBritain</a> registered the domain name "itunes.co.uk" for an MP3 search engine. Apple was granted a UK restricted (non music) trademark for "</i>iTunes<i>" on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_23.html" title="March 23">March 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, and launched its popular iTunes music store service in the UK in 2004.

An expert decided in Apple's favor in the dispute. Cohen launched a media offensive stating that the DRS was biased towards large businesses and made frequent threats of lawsuits against Nominet.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>In <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2004.html" title="November 2004">November 2004</a>, two popular <a href="../../../w/e/b/Weblog.html" title="Weblog">weblog</a> sites that feature <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_rumors_community.html" title="Mac rumors community">Apple rumors</a> publicly revealed information about an unreleased Apple product code-named "Asteroid", also known as "Project Q97". The sites, <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com" class="external text" title="http://www.appleinsider.com" rel="nofollow">"AppleInsider"</a> and <a href="http://www.powerpage.org" class="external text" title="http://www.powerpage.org" rel="nofollow">"O'Grady's PowerPage"</a>, were subpoenaed for information about their sources in the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_v._Does_d224.html" title="Apple v. Does">Apple v. Does</a> case. In <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2005.html" title="February 2005">February 2005</a> it was decided by a court official in California that the bloggers do not have the same <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shield_law.html" title="Shield law">shield law</a> protection as do journalists. In a related case, the websites went on to fight the journalistic status decision. In a separate matter, Apple filed a lawsuit against website <a href="../../../t/h/i/Think_Secret_ecb9.html" title="Think Secret">Think Secret</a> in January 2005, claiming that the site's reports about forthcoming Apple products violated trade secret law.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>In May 2005 Apple entered into a <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_action.html" title="Class action">class action</a> settlement,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> upheld on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_20.html" title="December 20">December 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> following an appeal, regarding the battery life of <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a> music players sold prior to May 2004. Eligible members of the class are entitled to extended warranties, store credit, cash compensation, or battery replacement.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Of those cases, the only one I think should be kept is the 2004 case about Asteroid... but even that case isn't really that important in the grand scheme of things. The three main ones are Apple Corps, Franklin, and Microsoft. The trademark stuff gets tedious after a while and isn't really all that important. If people want to know more about Apple's legal history they can read the separate article. <a href="../../../p/s/a/User%7EPsantora_c464.html" title="User:Psantora">Paul</a><small><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Psantora_252c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Psantora">C</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../p/s/a/User_talk%7EPsantora_c626.html" title="User talk:Psantora">T</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">+</a></sub></small> 23:05, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>IMO, The iPod class-action lawsuit is worth keeping as well, because it's an issue that impacted quite a number of actual customers, as opposed to Asteroid, which, while significant and certainly worth keeping in the main article, was mainly blogger fodder... <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warrens</a> 23:25, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Fellow_dc91.html" title="Apple Fellow">Apple Fellow</a> merge</span></h2>
<p>This merge has been proposed for some time now. If there are no objections I am going to merge that article into the corporate culture section. Something like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apple was the first company to demonstrate that suits and hierarchy were not only unnecessary to success, they might actually be a hindrance to innovation.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> As a result, Apple's corporate "counterculture" has been widely copied in the technology industry. Originally, the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like IBM more or less by default, thanks to the influence of its founders; Steve Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple was a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_500.html" title="Fortune 500">Fortune 500</a> company. By the time of the "1984" TV ad, this trait had become a key way the company differentiated itself from its competitors. Today it is almost a given that a high-tech startup cannot hope to attract top talent without a flexible, casual work environment free of dress code and rigid structure, offering plenty of opportunities for stress relief and creative play.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> is a primary example of this, providing a free and unlimited 'candy room', permitting pets in the workplace and allowing employees to arrange and play sports and games throughout the day.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives, each with his own idea of what Apple should be, some of its original character has arguably been lost, but Apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality that reliably draws talented people into its employ.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Furthering these lines, Apple Fellows were created. An Apple Fellow is a person who has been designated as such by Apple Computer in recognition of their extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_computing.html" title="Personal computing">personal computing</a>. Each Apple Fellow acts as a <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leader.html" title="Leader">leader</a> and a <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visionary.html" title="Visionary">visionary</a>, guiding the company in their particular area of expertise.

<p>This is kind of silly - I mean according to google mactel gets <i>MORE</i> hits then macintel. "Google Duel"? That's fine, but I know several developers from the last conference and it WAS a mactel - none of them AFAIK used "macintel" so this article looks really silly just mentioning macintel. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Just another star in the night</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 07:31, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Searching with a more precise tool like <a href="http://www.googleduel.com/original.php" class="external text" title="http://www.googleduel.com/original.php" rel="nofollow">GoogelDuel</a> shows that "Macintel" gets about 10 times the number of hits as "Mactel". The problem with calling it "Mactel" is that this name is used by several other companies (MACtel (cellular), MaCtel, Mactel Communications) and so forth.

<dd>Given that Apple aren't using "Macintel", either - the term is <i>explicitly</i> noted in the article as "never [having] been used seriously by Apple's PR or executives" and "mainly in use only in Apple fanatic circles" - it's not clear that its status as used by other companies is relevant to whether it's "a new catch-phrase among computer users".</dd>
<dd>As for GoogleDuel vs. raw Google, but perhaps GoogleDuel is "more precise", <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~gpeters/cgi-bin/pear/faq.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sfu.ca/~gpeters/cgi-bin/pear/faq.html" rel="nofollow">the original GoogleDuel FAQ</a>] says it "sends search requests to Google to find out the number of web pages that contain those phrases" and that it "counts how many web pages contain the search term". I haven't dived into the Google API to see exactly what the results of "[sending] search requests to Google" are, so I can see whether it, for example, manages to filter out "Mactel" the trademark of a cellular phone company from "Mactel" the slang term for an x86-base Macintosh, to determine whether it's filtering out, for example, the irrelevant Mactels. <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Harris_fa37.html" title="User:Guy Harris">Guy Harris</a> 08:13, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Speed boosts for Intel-based Macs</span></h2>
<p>In the "2006 to present - Start of the Intel Era" section the performance increases for the MacBook Pro ("a 15.4 inch laptop which … offers a 4X speed improvement"), iMac and Mac mini are based on Apple's advertising (which, in turn, is based on SPECint/SPECfp benchmarks performed by Apple). These benchmarks do not necessarily mean that the units will outperform the models they replace at the specified rate under normal operation, nor do they take into account that performance increase is diminished when running PowerPC-only applications. When I read the existing phrases they imply that the new iterations are however many times faster in all circumstances. In my opinion these segments should be revised to reflect that real-world usage and application versions may result in smaller performance gains than those implied by the benchmark results. ad85 19:09, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wackymacs -- This makes absolutely no sense to me. Although a user leaving multiple links to a single website certainly raises a red flag that they may be spam, it is not a sufficient test of the validity for including an external link. Seeking Alpha is the only site on the Internet that contains free transcripts of the conference calls held by publicly-traded companies, and specifically is the only site that houses transcripts of Apple's conference calls. In that respect, in no way is it "very similar to many other websites"; this was a link to a unique source. So the only reason to delete this link is if you think that Apple's quarterly conference calls are not a valuable reference source for readers of this entry. Given that they contain the company's own discussion of its business and contain much material that is not included in Apple's own press releases, that argument would be hard to accept. I accept that those who want to delete this link are honestly motivated to remove spam from Wikipedia. But this absolutely isn't spam. The genuine value of these transcripts is why I'm adding links to companies' conference call transcripts accross Wikipedia. If you disagree with this, please explain why you think these transcripts are not unique and valuable source of information.— DavidJackson</p>

I tried to capture a few of the ones that I think have had the biggest real impact in the world of computing.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">We need to clean up what the open source status is</span></h2>
<p>The article states, "[F]ollowing the switch to Intel chips, the source for the Intel version of the Darwin kernel has not been made available by Apple (<a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID=14663&amp;Page=1&amp;pagePos=8" class="external free" title="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID=14663&amp;Page=1&amp;pagePos=8" rel="nofollow">http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID=14663&amp;Page=1&amp;pagePos=8</a>)." But, as can be seen at <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/" class="external free" title="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/" rel="nofollow">http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/</a>, large sections of the Darwin source <i>have</i> been released, just not AppleCore (which I assume is the kernel). Compare <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.4.6.ppc/" class="external free" title="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.4.6.ppc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.4.6.ppc/</a> with <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.4.6.x86/" class="external free" title="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.4.6.x86/" rel="nofollow">http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.4.6.x86/</a> to see what has not been released. As far as I can tell, Apple has not changed the licensing of the Darwin source but just hasn't yet put up all the source code it eventually will. It would seem that the licensing has remained virtually unchanged between OS X 10.3 and 10.4 (compare <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/images/release-notes-7.0.1.txt" class="external free" title="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/images/release-notes-7.0.1.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/images/release-notes-7.0.1.txt</a> and <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/images/release-notes-7.0.1.txt" class="external free" title="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/images/release-notes-7.0.1.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/images/release-notes-7.0.1.txt</a>). Further, the "CoreOSMakefiles," which I assume somehow relate to the kernel, are available for both PPC and x86. In addition, it is really a fallacy to talk about the Intel transition when referring to Darwin. Darwin has <i><b>always</b></i> been available for the x86 architecture; there wasn't really a "transition" at all. The source for this information would ultimately be <a href="http://ezine.daemonnews.org/200602/apple.html" class="external free" title="http://ezine.daemonnews.org/200602/apple.html" rel="nofollow">http://ezine.daemonnews.org/200602/apple.html</a>.</p>
<p>In short, it is perhaps true that the x86 kernel is not available as source code (depending on whether AppleCore is in fact the kernel), but to link to an article that attempts to give an unsubstantiated <i>reason</i> for that is not good practice. We need to find a reference that is more reputable or directly related to Apple to verify this. <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenDarwin_90a6.html" title="OpenDarwin">OpenDarwin</a> is at its end, so perhaps it has some information as to why it is not going to continue (if source code has been closed that was not expected to be or something like that). We also need to be more clear about what the Darwin kernel actually is. Some have said that Darwin itself <i>is</i> the kernel, which I don't believe is correct but it is unclear to me. At the very least an explanation of the Darwin kernel should be at <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin_%28operating_system%29.html" title="Darwin (operating system)">Darwin (operating system)</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheshibboleth_b26a.html" title="User:Theshibboleth">Theshibboleth</a> 09:30, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, the kernel is <a href="../../../x/n/u/XNU_0034.html" title="XNU">XNU</a>. These things need to be wikified better. The most recent source release of XNU was for Mac OS X 10.4.3/Darwin Darwin 8.3. After that point, which was near the beginning of the Intel transition, Apple began differentiating between the Intel source and the PPC source. The first version of OS X for the x86 architecture released to developers was 10.4.2, according to <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_OS_X_v10.4_3c40.html#Tiger_x86" title="Mac OS X v10.4">Mac OS X v10.4#Tiger x86</a>.

<p>Given that Apple are announcing their plans for the next version of Mac OS X in eight days time, perhaps we should wait until then. Given that all we can say right now is (a) Apple haven't released a Darwin kernel based on the Intel version of Mac OS X (b) they haven't said why (c) here are some guesses. Hopefully in eight days time, we'll know what they're up to. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 20:59, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vertical integration criticism</span></h2>
<p>I did some research as to whether Apple does indeed practice vertical integration. I think we can safely say they do. The problem is that there is disagreement as to whether this is good or bad, with many saying it is good because it gives Apple greater control over its products. I'd say this is more a point of controversy than one of criticism.</p>

<dd>Why? They are both advertisements for a well known company. They are both composed of sequence of different spots. They both have received popular attention outside of the advertisement space.

<dd>I also think the <a href="../../../g/e/t/Get_a_Mac_3a47.html" title="Get a Mac">Get a Mac</a> article can and should stand on its own, even after the advertisements are no longer run. For a series of ads, they're incredibly popular, and they've been frequently referenced in other popular media.
