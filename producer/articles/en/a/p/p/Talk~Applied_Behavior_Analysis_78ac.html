<p><b>Applied Behavior Analysis</b></p>
<p>There is no mention in this section of studies which show ABA's significant weakness in the areas of social/emotional development, perspective taking and executive functioning. Furthermore, there is no mention of ABA's past, and how, even into the 1970s, negative reinforces which included slapping children, were used to deter "maladaptive behaviors".</p>
<p>I have a few questions in regards to the author of the text on Applied Behavior Analysis. First of all, I was pleased to see that there was at least something pertaining to this method of teaching in this encyclopedia, especially because it is not well known. What was it that made you interested in adding a piece about Applied Behavior Analysis? Do you work with this method of teaching, or with children with autism? I would be interested to know what drove you to have an interest in Applied Behavior Analysis.</p>
<p><b>Autistic Perspective</b> I'd like to see at least a mention of the movement against ABA but am too lazy to add it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What appears below is an abridged quote from my autobiography at <a href="http://www.linds.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.linds.net" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Lindsay Weekes, diagnosed as autistic in 1970.</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Some people thought to use me to connect with and cure their children. They missed the most fundamental point, or refused to entertain it if it was brought to their attention. They took refuge in "programs" such as ABA or Son Rise.</p>
<p>Because I was asked by so many people about ABA, I thought to understand it from the inside and so became a qualified ABA therapist". In the mid to late 1990s, Tim was my town's ABA pinup boy, the one who appeared in so many promotional and training videos, and I had the opportunity to work with him exclusively and extensively. I'd first met him in early intervention where he was regarded as low-functioning; he did not respond to others and had no language. It was an illusion: he was hyperlexic and at home could, and did, read aloud, although with little, if any, comprehension.</p>
<p>ABA taught him many things: to listen to people, to know the names of colours, to pick out and name members of his family.....or did it? Tim learned the names of coloured squares, but couldn't say what colour the sofa was. If he was told to stand up without any accompanying gesture, he sat still. If he was asked to name his mother when she was standing there in the flesh, he couldn't. He'd learned the names of all the squares, whether coloured or shaped or coloured and shaped, in much the same way as other boys might have named their toy soldiers. He even knew the names of the pictures. This one's called zebra, this one is Daddy and so on.</p>
<p>The fact is that Tim was quite an intelligent boy with major autism. He soon learned to get what he wanted by jumping through hoops. Correctly doing tricks made his day much easier. No-one seemed to notice, or wanted to notice, that he was relying on his prodigious memory to get by, which was why he could handle only three attributes (colour, shape and size) of any given object. No-one wanted to tell his parents that this king was naked."</p>
<hr />
<p>It's legitimate to criticize any method or therapy. However, in an encyclopedia, criticism should be supported by citation of published, peer-reviewed research or analysis. <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENesbit_c111.html" title="User:Nesbit">Nesbit</a> 20:32, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So should advocacy, where the therapy is controversial, especially on ethical grounds.--209.86.4.233 08:04, 5 February 2006 (UTC) The above comment was left by me.--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDell_Adams_a6dc.html" title="User:Dell Adams">Dell Adams</a> 08:06, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have added a paragraph in the ABA and Autism section which links it to <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethical_challenges_to_autism_treatment.html#Ethical_challenges_to_applied_behavior_analysis" title="Ethical challenges to autism treatment">Ethical_challenges_to_autism_treatment#Ethical_challenges_to_applied_behavior_analysis</a> at the very least that helps to add some neutrality by taking into account the fact that the therapy and its use for Autism treatment is disputed on ethecal grounds, I also cited <a href="http://users.1st.net/cibra/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://users.1st.net/cibra/index.htm" rel="nofollow">CIBRA</a> as the organisations web site contains links to several published articles documenting some cases which give rise to the concerns meantioned. I hope the addition is up to scratch however I did feel for the article to be neutral there has to be some reference to the debatable ethics used in parts of the feild as ethics are of significant importance to therapy. <a href="../../../m/t/t/User%7EMttJocy_afa1.html" title="User:MttJocy">MttJocy</a> 14:18, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The State of Florida, where ABA is widely used" - this statement is not supported. "ABA", or teaching based on behavior analytic principles, is used in many parts of the USA and the rest of the world. It may be more prevalent close to universities where ABA is taught.

<p>"It is also suggested that ABA and discrete trials are less effective for improving language than 'naturalized' teaching. Naturalized teaching mimics the use of language in the natural environment, focusing on manding (requesting) tacting (labeling) receptive language (physical manipulation based on commands or requests) and the other functions of language[9]."</p>
<p>There seems to be some confusions on this page. Applied Behavior Analysis may be widely used to refer specifically to teaching children with autism or other developmental disabilities, but it is a field of study, not a technique.</p>
<p>Also, the quote above regarding ABA versus naturalized teaching doesn't make sense. Manding and tacting for example, come straight out of Skinner's Verbal Behavior -- this is definitely behavior analysis.</p>
<p>Terms are confusing, but it seems that this page should be cleaned up to reflect a more technical understanding... Milktoast 08:02, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Manding and tacting are the terminology, which is from skinner, but they are used anywhere language is taught. I think the point the person is trying to get at is that ABA to teach phonemes (individual sounds/sylabyls, wow I don't know how to spell that word) is less useful than teaching whole words or functional equivalents. That's how naturalized versus old-school ABA a la skinner was explained to me. <a href="../../../w/l/u/User%7EWLU_ad34.html" title="User:WLU">WLU</a> 12:58, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
