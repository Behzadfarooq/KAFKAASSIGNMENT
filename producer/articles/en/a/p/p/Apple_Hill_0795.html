<p>In 1951, a man named Floyd Bolster had retired to a little community called <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camino.html" title="Camino">Camino</a>, located in <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Dorado_County_02ed.html" title="El Dorado County">El Dorado County</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>. When he moved there, he had purchased a ranch that had 10 acres of blooming apple trees and hoped that he could work this land and have a great life of a farmer. Six years later, Floyd Bolster died leaving everything to his son, Gene. Gene left his job in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_California_3bf5.html" title="Southern California">southern California</a> to come and work his fathers land in hopes to accomplish his father's dream.</p>
<p>In 1964, Gene Bolster, who was the local grower; Dick Bethell, the county's <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomology.html" title="Pomology">pomology</a> specialist and farm advisor; Ed Delfino, the county's agricultural commissioner; and Bob Tuck, a retired army officer, all came together to form what is known today as the [Apple Hill Growers Association]. Apple Hill might have been known today as "Pear Hill" or something to do with pears. There was an abundance of pears 36 years ago, so the farmers went to learn how to make the soil fertile for apples and due to a stroke of luck, they switched to apples and became Apple Hill.</p>

<p>The team started in mid-June 1964. They had finished preparing everything in <a href="../../../a/u/g/August.html" title="August">August</a> for the first press <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picnic.html" title="Picnic">picnic</a>. The picnic consisted of each Apple Hill family hosting a meal for some of the press members. Many of these press members became close friends. All the growers also produced 50,000 little litter bags that they had passed out at the state fair. They offered 2 pounds of free apples to anybody who brought the bags with them.</p>
<p>Apple Hill consisted of 16 original <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranches.html" title="Ranches">ranches</a>, eventually growing to 55 ranches including <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_tree.html" title="Christmas tree">Christmas tree</a> growers, and wineries, vineyards, a <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microbrewery.html" title="Microbrewery">microbrewery</a>, and a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spa.html" title="Spa">spa</a>. Apple Hill was the first ranch marketing endeavor in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_California_27a3.html" title="Northern California">northern California</a>. Its success has inspired other ranch marketing groups to do the same, and now there are lots all over the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>

<p>Apple Hill not only sells apples, but also sells ways to use them in their very own cookbook. The original cookbook was first published in 1967 and it is now in its 20th edition. The farmers from Apple Hill all decided on the favorite recipes and put them together in Apple Hills very own cookbook. One of Apple Hill's residents thought that Apple Hill should have its own sampling room to show the guests what they could do with the apples. So they opened the first little shop that they modeled how to make special desserts and ciders with them, then letting their guests sample the product.</p>

<p>You cannot find every fruit to be grown at the same time. Peaches are grown from late July to early September, Nectarines the same start, but end in August, Plums from mid June to early July, Pears are from September to October, Berries from mid June to late September, Cherries from Mid June to late June, and finally the Apples, from late august to early September. Apple Hill grows seven main types of apples; some individual ranches have other kinds. In addition, the fruit grows at all different times, so one would have to check several places to determine if they have the right apples and if they are ripe. The main seven are Gala, McIntosh, Jonathans, Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, Red Rome, and Granny Smith.</p>

<p>There are several attractions for each ranch. There can be a bake shop, cider mill, wine tasting, crafts, picnic area, lunch, u-pick, nature walks. At the bakeshops, you can purchase bakes goods, food, cider, and little souvenirs. The Cider Mill shows the cider being made and the process the apples go through to becoming cider. At the end, they often have some to sample and some to purchase. Wine tasting is for those over the age of twenty-one and who wish to sample the different types of wines and beers. They have apple cider wine, apricot beer, etc. For the children, some ranches will have a crafts table where they can carve a pumpkin, draw, or help make a tasty treat. Every countryside business should have room for picnics. Apple Hill has picnic benches everywhere for people to sit and enjoy their food in the middle of the scenic countryside. Some places serve lunch items such as corndogs, tri tip barbeque, and sandwiches. You can also pick berries and other fruits at some of the ranches. Nature walks are held on some ranches. If you ask where you can go on a walk, often they will point you in the right direction of a walk that you will never forget. Bus parking is available for buses with tour groups.</p>
