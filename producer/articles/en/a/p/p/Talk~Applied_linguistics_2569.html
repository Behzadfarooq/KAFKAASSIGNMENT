	    <p>how to analyze the bank terms? you can analyze "bank" term from context around its. However, you can find out some sentenses are ambiguity EX - "I go to the bank." There are two meaning " I go to the bank (the place can saving your money.)" and " I go to the bank." ( the place for waiting a boat) .</p>
<p><br />
This is just an example of confusion arising from an English word meaning more than one thing. There are <b>many</b> examples of this in English. For example "This is light." Does this sentence mean that you are describing <i>light</i> (as in light coming from the sun) or does it mean that something is not heavy? Normally, you would not be saying that something is <i>light</i> (as in light coming from the sun) because that is obvious. So the usual meaning of "This is light." would be that something is not heavy. The issue is even more confused when you consider that "light" can also refer to a food not having many calories. So a <i>light beer</i> (normally spelled lite in this case) is <b>not</b> a beer that is easy to carry to your table because it's <i>light</i>. Rather, it is a beer that will not have many calories so you won't <i>feel</i> heavy. There are <b>many</b> other examples of this in English.</p>

<p>The "academic" field of applied linguistics is greatly influenced by political forces. It is an important aspect that should be recognized.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think I could settle for that! I had one applied linguistics prof, Gaies, who sometimes refered to it as the "underbelly" so It's kind of an endearing word to me but "controversy" is more appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well now the "controversy" section has been deleted. It had a reference for US Information Agency agents as well. Well, like I said earlier, the "underbelly" as my applied linguistics prof Gaies called it, is a very significant aspect of this so-called academic field. An academic field that does not want to disclose its roots, is so ashamed that it is censored off of Wikipedia, is really outrageous. Of course, not all work for the USIA but a significant number do and it is their job to find international students who are friendly to US foreign policy in their respective countries. Applied linguistics programs have a very high percentage of international students enrolled. In my program about 40% were international students. Of course, the US military similarly enrolls a lot of officers into its Defense Language Institute (DLI) and one of the most influential in second language learning, the Drill and Kill Method, actually comes from DLI.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fine, keep the section, I won't keep reverting it any more. Can you at least make it sound somewhat reasonable though? As in, perhaps a bit less on the excessive stuff, a little less general and resembling a conspiracy theory if you plan on keeping it at all? And get a real log-in?<a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicaeopolis_f24c.html" title="User:Dicaeopolis">Dicaeopolis</a> 08:02, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I removed a link to appliedlinguistics.org. The domain is apparently owned by an actual linguist, but there is almost zero content on the site for the time being - simply pages of ads. Perhaps if the content is improved it is worth linking to again. [Also, this website is linked to on other linguistics pages. I'll be removing as many as I find.]Nposs 03:51, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There still are more advertisements on appliedlinguistics.org than content. This would suggest that the person who continues to externally link the site is using Wikipedia to generate traffic to create advertising revenue. (Please read: <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External_links</a> especially "Advertising and Conflicts of Interest"). For example: the links page - "There are no links right now." Other pages promise content but provide only an e-mail address. Only one page has a definition of Applied Linguistics - something which is already available here. Since there is something of a revert tug-of-war going on, I won't delete it for the moment. But the website really needs to be improved if it is going to be linked.<a href="../../../n/p/o/User%7ENposs_32e4.html" title="User:Nposs">Nposs</a> 14:32, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yay! We won the war!!!&#160;:)</p>
<p>Anyways, Joking apart, here is the thing Nposs. First of all, I will also not try to put it back any more even if you delete it again. But the thing is that this site will soon have huge content. Indeed, it did have a lot of content until recently; nowadays, it is just going through some changes. (Search Google, and you will see.) And the reason for its being on Wiki is not that it should generate traffic. But Wiki links does help with PR: Since Wiki is a high PR webpage, and since when a high PR webpage links to another webpage, that webpage's PR increases, this page's existence on Wiki helps this page a lot.</p>

<dd>Thanks for explaining. I'm sorry that you felt like I was engaging in some sort of war. From my point of view, it looked like spam - especially when it was consistently relinked without comment. I believe that you will work to improve the website. At the same time, you are walking the fine line of "conflict of interest." I think the situation would be helped by removing the high level of advertisements on the site (which gives the impression that you are linking only to generate traffic.) You could also just remove it from the wiki and re-link it when it is ready. That said, I won't remove it again. Good luck with your work.<a href="../../../n/p/o/User%7ENposs_32e4.html" title="User:Nposs">Nposs</a> 14:37, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The above comments and linking posting etc., are in no way made by anyone from appliedlinguistics.org, so their presence here is a clear violation of the site's rights. The site's administrator has said on many occasions that the site was purchased by them later from "translators." A quick Google search of the domain will show for sure that the domain was owned by translators before the recent purchase - since most of the links to the site are translation-related. And the comment above that was made on behalf of the site severely violates the site's legal rights. Linguist J 22:04, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
