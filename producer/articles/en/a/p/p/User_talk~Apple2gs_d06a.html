<p>Hi, thanks for uploading Image:Apple IIe Platinum.jpg. You specify in the image description that the image came from <a href="http://www.apple2clones.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.apple2clones.org/" rel="nofollow">Apple2clones.org</a>, but that site doesn't seem to exist. Please could you check the URL and update the image description - this will allow someone to help you determine the copyright status of the image.

<p>I'm not sure if I'm replying in the area, still somewhat new to Wikipedia, but the image came from the site www.apple2clones.com (specifically: <a href="http://www.apple2clones.com/?q=image/tid/16" class="external free" title="http://www.apple2clones.com/?q=image/tid/16" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple2clones.com/?q=image/tid/16</a>). Sorry about the typo.</p>
<p>Is there a recommend link for the proceedure on uploading images that may or may not be copyrighted, or creating new articles from the ground up? (just having added one on the "Apple IIe" this afternoon, without reading any guidelines).</p>

<li>Hi. Thanks for providing the correct link - I've noted it on the image page and added the correct copyright tag.

<p>Hi Apple2gs. All the deleted images were tagged: "<i>The editor who uploaded this work is unsure of its copyright status. An experienced editor should help the uploader determine the status of this work, and help the uploader understand the process for picking the correct license in the future.

<ul>
<li>Ah, I see. Unfortunately this is most likely going to be the fate of so many other public domain images I uploaded and intergrated into articles. What would you suggest for preventing this from reoccuring? I'm unclear on what status to label a public domain or copyrighted image (that's free to distribute). Is there a way to change the status of an image I've already uploaded?</li>
</ul>

<dd>It's only by chance that I saw your response above as it was posted here and not on my talk page...</dd>
<dd>To prevent images from being deleted again, be sure to select an appropriate public domain tag from the drop-down menu when uploading images (but only if the images actually are public domain). You can amend the status of an existing image by going to the page for that image and editing the licencing section.

<p>Hi, Apple2gs — looks like you've made a bunch of great contributions already to the Apple II series of articles.

<dd>Hi, thanks for the encouragement! And it is good to know it goes noticed, Wikipedia is pretty anonymous by nature (even if you have a registered user account) so I sometimes do wonder. Not sure if you can track my edits (probably an option right in front of my nose heh) but I guess you saw I added section for another model of the Apple II (the IIc) and still planning to add a few more. Also wrote a new introduction for the main Apple II Family page. Have to say it's addictive. Not just computer articles, but any other topics of interest and adding bits and pieces to them.&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the tip. Mind you, you mention <i>commerical</i> links, those links I added were just to the originating site of those <i>freeware</i> emulators (where the emulator itself and information pertaining to it can be found). I noticed the other emulators already listed had site linked to them so I used that as a model. In any case, I'm not disputing it, just a little unsure. Still learning about Wikipedia as you can see.&#160;:) --Apple2gs 06:03, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Apple2gs,</p>
<p>I had a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=50&amp;target=Apple2gs&amp;namespace=6" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=50&amp;target=Apple2gs&amp;namespace=6" rel="nofollow">numerous</a> Apple II images you uploaded with a {{CopyrightedFreeUse}} or other free use tag. Do you have any means to back up that claim, i.e. (written) permission from the owners of the sites you took them from? I checked out some of the sites you gave as sources, and I only saw either:</p>
<ul>
<li>no copyright statement at all, which means that we have to assume restricted use (like <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/" class="external text" title="http://oldcomputers.net/" rel="nofollow">this one</a>)</li>
<li>a generic copyright statement, i.e. "all content (c) &lt;site&gt;", which means that we have to assume restricted use (like <a href="http://www.a2central.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.a2central.com/" rel="nofollow">this one</a>)</li>
<li>actual heavy restrictions on use (like <a href="http://www.old-computers.com/corporate/faq.htm#n2" class="external text" title="http://www.old-computers.com/corporate/faq.htm#n2" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.macgeek.org/museum/appleiigsupgrade/page02.html" class="external text" title="http://www.macgeek.org/museum/appleiigsupgrade/page02.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess you either have explicit permission for using these images, in which case you will have to produce it, or are not aware that "free to use for any purpose" is not the same as "posted on a website somewhere", in which case these images will have to be removed from Wikipedia as fast as possible. In any case, I hope to hear from you soon. --<span style="font-family:monospace">&#160;<a href="../../../g/r/m/User%7EGrm_wnr_b9ae.html" title="User:Grm wnr">grm_wnr</a></span> <a href="../../../g/r/m/User_talk%7EGrm_wnr_e8bc.html" title="User talk:Grm wnr"><span style="border:1px solid;color:black;font-size:9px;padding:2px 1px 0px 1px">Esc</span></a> 01:21, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, thanks for contacting me with regards to the verification of the copyrights of the photos mentioned above.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not entirely sure I've used the correct tags as far as labeling them; to be honest, I find the system Wikipedia uses a bit confusing. I do agree it's an important matter to get resolved and hope you (or another) can work with me to get it corrected rather than immediately and indiscriminately deleting all the images from countless articles. I've put a lot of time and effort in writing several of these Apple II articles from the ground up, so it would be very discouraging, to say the least, to see most of them cut apart.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The online Apple II community is rather close knit bunch, so many of the sites these articles have been taken from have been brought to the attention of their owners (we've discussed it on Usenet's comp.sys.apple2 group, or in some cases private e-mails) and there's been no objection to the use of these photographs. If need be, I can get written permission from the maintainers of each site, assuming an e-mail will suffice (that is very time consuming and tedious, but I'd at least do it for the set of Apple II articles I've written which have so far been entirely my work--the "Apple IIe", "Apple IIc" and "Apple IIc Plus"). Who do I submit the written permission to if this step is necessary?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would hope just changing/editing the copyright status for several of the pictures I've used so they better reflect the current copyright is all that's required (again, once I better understand what labeling to use) but again, if need be, I can get written permission. Please do work with me on it before having all the photographs immediately removed (of course if any one person insists an image of theirs be removed that will need to be respected but I doubt we're going to run into this issue). Hope to hear back from you, thanks! --Apple2gs 02:43, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you get an email stating permission, forward it to permissions@wikimedia.org and note it on the image description page (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConfirmation_of_permission_ed89.html#When_permission_is_confirmed" title="Wikipedia:Confirmation of permission">Wikipedia:Confirmation_of_permission#When_permission_is_confirmed</a> for how to do it exactly). In the meantime, you should add "informal permission for these images has been given, and formal one become available shortly" to the description pages - of course, obviously you will have to follow that up with the formal permission in the near future. However, I have to note that there's often a problem with permissions: They tend to basically say "Sure, Wikipedia can use my images", but that's not enough - they really need to allow use of the image for <i>any purpose</i> (though requiring attribution is always okay, Wikipedia-only or non-commercial-only isn't). My suggestion would be to get the copyright owners to license the images as the standardized <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" class="external text" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" rel="nofollow">Creative Commons Attribution &amp; Share-Alike</a> or <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sa/2.5/" class="external text" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sa/2.5/" rel="nofollow">Creative Commons Attribution</a>, since our standard <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> really sucks for images. Even if that fails, a few of the images might be usable as <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> (but in that case, it's always better to use Apple's professional promotional pics until really free ones become available).</dd>

<dd>Oh, and <i>one more thing</i>&#160;;) - It's nice to see that you have already put some thoughts into this, I have really seen people use the reasoning "posted on website" =&gt; "free to use for any purpose". I think we might be able to save most of the images (though i'm doubtful as to whether we can save all of them as I've said above - but if we can, it'd be great of course). Can you keep me informed of what happens with the permissions? If you have any more questions, I would of course be glad to answer them. --<span style="font-family:monospace">&#160;<a href="../../../g/r/m/User%7EGrm_wnr_b9ae.html" title="User:Grm wnr">grm_wnr</a></span> <a href="../../../g/r/m/User_talk%7EGrm_wnr_e8bc.html" title="User talk:Grm wnr"><span style="border:1px solid;color:black;font-size:9px;padding:2px 1px 0px 1px">Esc</span></a> 09:37, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry for not responding sooner (had a week of crisises, unfortunately). I did manage to get some letters written and sent out on Friday, so I'm back on top of it, it's just a matter of waiting to get replies back. The good news is one has already come back today, from Bryan Villados from the Macgeek.org site--he wrote me back saying he is perfectly fine with the use of his images (within the Apple IIe article) on Wikipedia. I'll follow your instructions with regards to forwarding copies of emails with permission as they come in (and yes, your example is more or less what was written back--I'm sure that should suffice for the use in my article at least).</dd>

<dd>Some of the images actually have come from Apple's professional promotional photos (e.g. many of the Apple IIc images were taken from the old owner's guide or ads) which I either scanned myself or took from the Apple II History Site (who had them scanned several years back). Do I need to get permission for those? I know Apple actually allowed the use of those manuals to be put in the public domain complete with photos (with probably restrictions about modification) and allowed them to be turned into PDF or made web accessible. Do screen-shots/captures of software need permission to be used as well?</dd>

<dd>Hm, let's see what the permissions department makes of the eMails - note that the tag for Wikipedia-only permission ({{<a href="../../../p/e/r/Template%7EPermission_8737.html" title="Template:Permission">permission</a>}}) is a <i>speedy deletion tag</i>. So, it really depends on what those mails say, which I won't speculate on. I'm really surprised at Apple releasing their promotional images into the public domain - if that is the case, it's a big win for us, but we need some proof somewhere. This has to be documented officialy, and that documetation needs to be linked from the image description pages. On the other hand, Apple promos are, as I said, probably usable as fair use uinder most circumstances for the time being. See <a href="../../../g/r/m/User%7EGrm_wnr_Apple2gs_9692.html" title="User:Grm wnr/Apple2gs">User:grm_wnr/Apple2gs</a> for a breakdown of all your Mac images, including what needs to be done and what the face-value status at the moment (without any permissions) is.</dd>

Anything in there is completely unproblematic for us, and use of it is preferred to pretty much anything else. it.wikipedia managed to get blanket permission for images from allaboutapple.com (a lot of their images are on Commons already, but there are more). Look around there, and see if you can use some of those images. --<span style="font-family:monospace">&#160;<a href="../../../g/r/m/User%7EGrm_wnr_b9ae.html" title="User:Grm wnr">grm_wnr</a></span> <a href="../../../g/r/m/User_talk%7EGrm_wnr_e8bc.html" title="User talk:Grm wnr"><span style="border:1px solid;color:black;font-size:9px;padding:2px 1px 0px 1px">Esc</span></a> 03:52, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These images are indeed copyrighted and should be removed (I'm uncertain how to go about doing it; if there is a way I would like to know for any future issues).

<p>Hi Apple2gs! The image mentioned above has just been copied to commons. I doubt that apple computer really has released all right on the picture (this includes modification, commercial use and use without montioning source or author). If they have, please copy the permit you have received on the image talk page and forward it to wikimedia. As I learnt form the discussion you have had earlier on your talk page, you received permits for some of the picture. If you have not received a positve answer for any pictures you uploaded, the images have to be deleted (or if possible tagged as fair use). --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt314_037c.html" title="User:Matt314">Matt314</a> 16:24, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The example image you gave, "Apple IIGS.jpg" I clearly stated came from the cover of the Apple IIGS owner's manual printed in 1986. I also mentioned Apple gave permission for the entire manual, cover included, to be reproduced and distributed freely. That picture is a scan of the manual's cover. What more do I have to indicate of the source?</dd>

<dd>Quite frankly, although I respect and believe in Wikipedia's ideals about copyrights on images used, I'm finding myself very frustrated about it lately. Images that are fair use or cleared as OK from their original source (permission from a photographer or website owner) are being removed left and right. I'm particularly turned off by this "OrphanBot" that is arbitarily removing images from articles. In some cases where an image had been copyrighted and needed to be removed, I went to the trouble of personally photographing and editing my very own (i.e. the Apple IIc Plus) and yet even THAT is getting somehow scrutinized. I think the problem is the VERY unclear way of choosing the legal status of the image in question. I'm confused by it, and obviously picking the wrong labels (in some of my earlier uploads I didn't cite the source, granted, but going back and adding that doesn't seem to help).-Apple2gs 22:40, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can understand the frustration... but the problem is merely a matter of documentation. Did Apple also grant permission to modify the manual? If not, it's not free. The 'Public domain' and 'Free licenses' sections at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> should give you a good idea of what is considered free.

From the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html#User-created_images" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">image use policy</a>: "Also, user-created images may not be watermarked, distorted, have any credits in the image itself or anything else that would hamper their free use". I didn't know that until just now, but that's the policy. As for the oldcomputers.net images—how do we know that they're free? I can't see anything on the site saying that they are—so did you contact them yourself? If you did, then it's useful to have that noted in the summary. Anyway, don't worry—if the images are clearly free or fair use, there shouldn't be a problem once the source and copyright status is properly documented. --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartBrady_f558.html" title="User:StuartBrady">StuartBrady</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStuartBrady_916e.html" title="User talk:StuartBrady">Talk</a>) 00:33, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:The Apple II.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently specifies that the image can be used under a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">fair use license</a>. However, the image is currently <a href="../../../o/_/_/WP%7EO_c91c.html" title="WP:O">orphaned</a>, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">You may add it back</a> if you think that that will be useful.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other fair use media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Apple2gs_b695.html" title="Special:Contributions/Apple2gs">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images not used in any <b>articles</b> will be deleted after seven days, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<p>Hello and thank you for your contributions to Wikipedia. I noticed that you've uploaded a number of images in the <a href="../../../g/i/f/GIF_95a6.html" title="GIF">GIF</a> format. In the future, please save GIF images in the <a href="../../../p/n/g/PNG_5550.html" title="PNG">PNG</a> format before uploading (see <a href="../../../p/r/e/Wikipedia%7EPreparing_images_for_upload_4608.html" title="Wikipedia:Preparing images for upload">Wikipedia:Preparing images for upload</a>). <a href="../../../p/n/g/PNG_5550.html" title="PNG">PNG</a> images almost always have a smaller file size, which decreases the amount of time they take to load.
