<hr />
<p>Could you provide a source which says that Chamberlain was prepared to go to war over Czechoslovakia? I have here a quote from his private diary, dated 20th March 1938: "You only have to look at the map to see that nothing that France or we could possibly save Czechoslovakia from being overrun by the Germans..." Hardly the words of a war monger. It also should be noted that as late as October 1938, generals Beck and Brauchitsch feared that Germany was not ready to fight Britain and France. This fear was so profound, that Beck wrote a detailed analysis of the pending military disaster if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia. Germany was not fully ready for a war in 1938; nor was Britain.</p>

<p>1) First of all, it ignores the fact that Chamberlain ordered the massive rearmament of the UK, and backed down in Czechoslovakia because his Generals said that he did not have the armed strength to fight Hitler.</p>
<p>2) Second, its far from clear that a strong stand against Czechoslovakia would have done anything other than cause ageneral war earlier. Hitler was rearming for a war in the <strike>late-1940's</strike> late 1930s and I doubt that he would have viewed a stand against Czechoslovakia nothing other than a tactical setback.</p>
<p>Number 1 in as part of a rewrite. It is part of a page in progress; a lot more has been added and more analysis filled in. . PS - you should just <i>look</i> at the earlier version. AAAAGH!

<p>This article is essentially an non-NPOV essay advocating a more hawkish posture for the US. The entire content of the article should be removed, with only the introductory stump remaining. The rest of the text is salvageable, however, and can be placed in other articles, such as those pertaining to the war in Iraq, the Munich Pact, or the Cold War.</p>
<p>Would else would be open to dismantling the article and recycling the bulk of its content (after NPOVing) elsewhere?</p>

<p>Actually, much of the content is quite good. The section on the Iraq War needs a lot of work, but the section on Chamberlain is good. The problem is that this article, though containing a lot of good content, still has the structure of the POV rant posted by the first contributor. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a></p>
<p>Very interesting and thought provoking analysis, 172. Between John, you and I (and others; I can't check the names because wiki is going v e r y v e r y s l o w r i g h t n o w) this article is dramatically different and much better to the drivel that was here at the start. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 14:27 Apr 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have added more content to show that simple cowardice was by no means the only reason why the UK appeased Hitler (examples of successful appeasement, the Hitler vs. Stalin dilemma, US isolationism). Any thoughts? <a href="../../../g/c/a/User%7EGCarty_bf4a.html" title="User:GCarty">GCarty</a> 14:16 Dec 1, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>The "current foreign policy" section is strongly POV, lauding the views of one political party as "muscular" and "uncompromising". If you remove the POV stuff, there's no content left.</p>
<p>"1) First of all, it ignores the fact that Chamberlain ordered the massive rearmament of the UK, and backed down in Czechoslovakia because his Generals said that he did not have the armed strength to fight Hitler."</p>
<p>Appeasement in this case could be argued to have been a means of "buying time". Also, rearmament took place at a fairly sedate pace until the late 1930s (when it became increasingly obvious appeasement wasn't working), so a fairly true policy of appeasement was followed up until that point. What's your evidence that he backed down because of the generals? As far as I've read, it seems at least partially due to Chamberlain's own strong belief that discussion and compromise could solve Europe's problems, along with popular opinion being against going to war over a far away country with few real links with Britain...and many other reasons.</p>

<p>I keep wondering, "what drives us to war". Hitler, i've heard, wanted pay back, no?</p>
<p>But, didnt alexander the great just want to conquer - like, he wanted to exert himself in war, no? I know that we all can be selfish, but well, like, without punishment, would we all go towards being mean and selfish - -- like , dont we need to be shown examples of certain behaviors, in order to know they are options ... like, if we didnt see other people be sucessflu at being mean, could we find it in ourselves to create meaness?</p>

<p>Since 2003, looks like not much has been done in that department. Lots of weasel words, lots of "sources" that are themselves opinions. Looks like marshalling the facts to advance arguments. I've only scratched the surface with my little edit. I'm in the middle of two other edits, and followed a link I made of appeasement. Instead of a proper history of the word and how its meaning has evolved, I come upon this mess.</p>
<p>Maybe I can come back and help to fix it, but someone who <b>really</b> knows what <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> is should help out. Remember, NPOV does <i><b>not</b></i> mean balance. <i>Balance</i> can consist of just rebutting an opinion with another opinion. A fact isn't balanced — a fact is what it is. Try to think as an <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historian.html" title="Historian">historian</a> and let the facts lead you rather than the other way around. It's not easy, but it's the right thing to do.

<p>I agree this article is heavily POV; the entire "... contemporary U.S. foreign policy" section simply advocates the notion that "pacificism and isolationism" are appeasment without giving any evidence at all. Moreover, the majority of this section describes policy doctrine which has nothing to do with appeasment. There is already a sizeable article on the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush_doctrine.html" title="Bush doctrine">Bush doctrine</a>, and this section is totally irrelevant. My inclination is to delete the whole thing.</p>
<p>I would like the article to describe other examples of appeasment. Are there any examples of appeasment which worked, or had public support? <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvus_26a7.html" title="User:Corvus">Corvus</a> 30 June 2005 16:42 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Corvus, the entire "... contemporary U.S. foreign policy" section should just be deleted. It seems people here agree on that, but it hasn't been done yet. I'll check back in a week or so. If no one has objected then, I'll do it. - Kars, 28 July 2005</p>

<p>"...and that in the Sudeten crisis, Hitler was fully intent on going to war with Britain and France and seizing control of Czechoslovakia"</p>
<p>Is this true? I read somewhere that Hitler was certainly planning his European war, but he did not plan to start until around 43 when the German economy was strong enough and that the Polish invasion was not meant to escelate into WW2. So was he really intent on war in 38?</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Hitler was planning a European war in the early forties. 1943 was the final year in which he could act before his armaments became obsolete.</p>
<p>He was looking for a small war with Czechoslovakia in 1938 to give him the strategic strength to take Poland as part of lebensraum, his policy to achieve self-sufficiency of his Greater Germany. Chamberlain destroyed his plan as he could no longer maintain that he was peaceful and merely ending grievances. Hitler was furious at Chamberlain for denying him the rest of Czechoslovakia, blaming the "silly old fool" for ruining his plan.</p>
<p>Further evidence that Hitler was intent on war was the initiation of Operation Green after the May Crisis of Chzechoslovakia, which set a firm date when Hitler was prepared to attack Czechoslovakia and assume control of the country. The Operation outlined an invasion plan and was reliant on British and French unwillingness to stand up to him. The three weeks prior to the Munich Agreement was an elaborate sham to Hitler, who conceded that he would 'delay' any invasion to October 1st and would carry out his annexation over a ten day period.</p>
<p>Hitler, however, was not ready for a full war and his generals had plans to initiate a coup d'etat on him on the 29th September. It only required the French and British to reaffirm their protection of Czechoslovakia to have made the coup a reality. However, when it became clear that neither country would do so, the plans were abandoned.</p>

<p>I once read that of the German tanks used during the invasion of Poland and later France, a singificant amount were Pz 38(t), Czech designs manufactured by Skoda, particulary if one discounts the Germans Pzs I and II whichw ere seriosuly outdated. Makes me wonder in how far thr annexation of the Czechs aided Germany, and how the outlooks would have been for her in a war in 1938. It would be useful to have the nubmers of German war material production for late 1938 and 1939 and compare it with overall stocks of military equipment. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThestor_a815.html" title="User:Thestor">thestor</a> 16:13, 20 January 2007 (UTC) 17.13 (German winetr time) on 20th of January 2007</p>

<p>Reads like a bad A-Level or high school exam answer. The section "Origins of the concept of the Western Betrayal" is particularly juvenile in its treatment of Chamberlain's sppech to the nation (I don't mean to be overly critical, I respect that Wiki is a collaborative medium and I applaud the author for putting the effort in). Needs a fairly comprehensive rewrite however. It also in its current form seems to be VERY biased towards discussing the British role, and needs to discuss in more detail; a) the attitude of other countries, particularly France and the US; b) Mussolini, Italian appeasement, and the Abyssinian crisis etc. I am also surprised to see that the otherwise seemingly comprehensive reference list omits A.J.P Taylor, who I thought was THE definitive work in the area.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>As far as the Czecho-Slovakia/Czechoslovakia dispute going on in the article, I felt that the one instance of "Czechoslovakia" be replaced with "Czecho-Slovakia" and the sentence in parentheses after one of the instances of Czecho-Slovakia, "(Did you mean Czechoslovakia?)," very stupid, and thus</p>
<p>Please keep this page relevant to appeasement in the WWII period and not tainted by current events. Appeasement as a policy phenomenon arises from interwar European diplomacy.</p>

<p>While I can't speak for the horrors the Allied european powers went through during WWI, this article seems to defend the use of appeasement, which brought us into another world war. Direct and indirect engagement with the enemy during the Cold War brought about a much lower casualty rate.</p>

<dd>that's a very black and white way to look at it. appeasment didn't bring about world war two. it merely delayed it a year or so. the european conflict would've occurred either way, as hitler was intent on conquering france and russia...read mein kampf. japanese aggression in the pacific was totally separate from germany. if anything, british and american confrontation with japan forced japan into attacking the Allied countries. i would say that the massive nuclear arms race and MAD was more important in forestalling a war between NATO and the warsaw pact than NATO involvement in Korea or american involvement in vietnam. if little else, the western policies during the cold war are largely responsible for the problems the world faces today, such as, militant islam. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsecboy_26dd.html" title="User:Parsecboy">Parsecboy</a> 16:07, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is now a section discussing whether the United States' continued bombing and invading of countries without being checked by some world power amounts to an appeasement of the US President by the rest of the world. The analogy comparing what the US is doing in the Global War On Terror to what Hitler did at the beginning of WWII is very clear: Hitler sold the invasion of Poland to the German people as a conflict with terrorists. You can look it up. Yes, Hitler ideologically was tied to Lebensraum, but the propaganda to the German people in the run up to and invasion of Poland was sold as a conflict with terrorist acts upon German citizens in Poland and at the border.</p>
<p>There is some US Army Intelligence officer who continually deletes this addition on the main page, although it is unclear why. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Slapdotcom (<a href="../../../s/l/a/User_talk%7ESlapdotcom_f105.html" title="User talk:Slapdotcom">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Slapdotcom_94b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Slapdotcom">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>The section was repeatedly removed by myself and other editors because it is highly biased and unsourced. Hitler didn't have to "sell the war to the German people", he just did it. There was no talk of "terrorism" at the time, the pretext used was a <a href="../../../g/l/e/Gleiwitz_incident.html" title="Gleiwitz incident">faked border attack</a> and territorial disputes over the free city of Danzig/Gdansk. The current situation isn't so much appeasement as apathy by other countries or their being essentially powerless to interfere. The French and Germans disagreed with the invasion of Iraq, but it wasn't like they were going to deploy troops to Iraq to fight the Americans and British. It's a completely different situation, geopolitically. Aside form it being blatant POV, no one is appeasing the United States, therefore, it does not belong in the article. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsecboy_26dd.html" title="User:Parsecboy">Parsecboy</a> 23:00, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
