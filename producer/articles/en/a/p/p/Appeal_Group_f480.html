	    <p>The <b>Appeal group</b> was a small group of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist.html" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> <a href="../../../l/e/n/Leninist.html" title="Leninist">Leninists</a>, which broke away from the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Great_Britain_368e.html" title="Communist Party of Great Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a> (CPGB) in 1971 on the basis that the CPGB had abandoned revolutionary Marxism-Leninism and that, after many attempts, it was impossible to change it from within except by breaking the rules. The group lasted for about five or six years.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_Group_f480.html" title="Edit section: Problems with the CPGB">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Problems with the CPGB</span></h2>
<p>The roots of the Appeal Group went back to the early 1950s in <a href="../../../b/e/x/Bexley.html" title="Bexley">Bexley</a> branch of the CPGB led by Eddie Jackson, challenged the introduction the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Road_to_Socialism_dfab.html" title="British Road to Socialism">British Road to Socialism</a> and Rule 2(b) in the party’s rule book.</p>
<p>The British Road replaced the former party programme, For a Soviet Britain, and was a programme for achieving socialism in Britain through the election of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialist</a> government to Parliament without a revolution. Rule 2(b) set this aim as a rule, and outlawed any promotion of revolutionary perspectives by party members.</p>
<p>Some commentators are of the view that these rules were able to be introduced in the post-war years when there had been a big influx of new members to the CPGB on the strength of support for the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Army_ccba.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> in its role in defeating <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> fascism. But these commentators believed there was no effective Marxist Leninist education for this large new intake.</p>
<p>It was also at a time when <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_unions.html" title="Trade unions">trade unions</a> in Britain were growing in strength, wages and living standards were rising and the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> government had just introduced huge measures of state welfare. There was a widespread feeling that socialism was attainable peacefully and without the need for a revolution.</p>
<p>From its foundation the CPGB always had an element in its leadership inclined to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentarism.html" title="Parliamentarism">parliamentarism</a>, which was eclipsed during the years of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comintern.html" title="Comintern">Comintern</a> but which dominated the party once the Comintern ended. One of their first acts after the war was to close the party’s factory and workplace branches in favour of branches based on residential areas.</p>
<p>Older CPGB members who were well versed in revolutionary Marxism Leninism and who opposed these <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionist.html" title="Revisionist">revisionist</a> changes found themselves in a minority and isolated. The party’s strict democratic centralism forbade them to communicate their deep concerns about the direction the party was taking except through the district and central congresses.</p>
<p>The Bexley branch time after time submitted amendments on Rule 2(b) to these bodies but the leadership used administrative means to prevent any open discussion on this issue. On occasions the venue of the Kent district congress would be changed and the district secretary “forgot” to inform the Bexley comrades; names of nominated comrades would “accidentally” be left off <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballot.html" title="Ballot">ballot</a> papers.</p>
<p>The leadership treated Bexley delegates as enemies and suppressed critical discussion of its policies, with the notable exception of executive committee member Brian Behan, who argued for Bexley’s views to be heard and discussed.</p>
<p>In 20 years the branch was only ever allowed five minutes of open discussion time at a Party congress – and this was scheduled on a Saturday just after the lunch break when the hall was almost deserted as delegates lingered in the pub.</p>
<p>There was opposition to the leadership from the Surrey District led by Sid French, but it did not address Rule 2(b) and was consistently defeated by the leadership using underhand administrative means to suppress it.</p>

<p>Eddie Jackson despaired of changing the party from within. In 1971, the Bexley branch submitted its usual amendment to Rule 2(b) but this time Eddie and a small group of comrades backed it up with a lengthy <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polemical.html" title="Polemical">polemical</a> document, the "Appeal to Delegates" after which the group was named, and distributed it to delegates at the congress.</p>
<p>The comrades who signed the Appeal knew this would lead to their expulsion and it did. As a matter of policy, the group fought their expulsion, aiming to secure an opportunity to address a full congress on why they had issued the document but without success. The group aimed to recruit supporters inside and outside the CPGB to fight on an anti-revisionist platform. They met up to four times a week in a council flat overlooking <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlton.html" title="Charlton">Charlton</a> Athletic football ground for several years. In its first years the group grew a little but was never more than about 30 at any one time. But well over 100 people, from all around the country, joined it and left soon after or had a brief association with it. Some of these later went on to be involved with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Communist_Party_95a1.html" title="New Communist Party">New Communist Party</a> and other break-aways from the CPGB.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_Group_f480.html" title="Edit section: Appeal Group's Actions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Appeal Group's Actions</span></h2>
<p>Meetings were dominated by deep theoretical discussions, focussing at first on <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenin.html" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>’s "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back" and the dialectics of political processes. Eddie was a self-taught engineer with a keen analytical brain but also a deep distrust of middle class intellectuals, whom he blamed for the revisionism of the old party. He was also deeply disappointed that the Appeal was disowned and denounced by the Surrey district.</p>
<p>The group issued a number of pamphlets and a monthly paper, The Appeal, which ran up to five issues. Pamphlets included: "Pioneering Mistakes", "Shameful" (an attack on the Surrey District), "The Pauper Trap" (an analysis on the effects of housing benefit and other means-tested state benefits paid to low paid workers in undermining trade unionism), "Behind the Revolutionary Mask" (a critique of neo-Maoism) in which Jackson detailed the Appeal Group's split with the "Birmingham Collective" and "The Anti-Fascist manifesto".</p>
<p>Eddie wrote under the pseudonym <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wat_Tyler_c0c4.html" title="Wat Tyler">Wat Tyler</a>. All group members had pseudonyms for the benefit of written minutes so that the minutes could never be used as evidence by the CPGB leadership to expel comrades who were still inside the party.</p>
<p>The discovery of revisionism within Novosti publications had a profound and demoralising effect on the group, in particular one pamphlet "Communism and Social Democracy", which gave support to the British Road line.</p>
<p>Eddie’s increasing paranoia about infiltration and his distrust of newcomers drove away many potential supporters and the group dwindled and faded away. It achieved little except as an educational experience for its members.</p>
