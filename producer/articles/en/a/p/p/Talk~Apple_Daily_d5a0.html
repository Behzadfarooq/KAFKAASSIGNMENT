Is its name <i>The</i> Apple Daily or <i>Apple Daily</i>? If <i>the</i> is in the title then it has to be in the title here, eg <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Irish_Times_e693.html" title="The Irish Times">The Irish Times</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Independent_7fc3.html" title="Irish Independent">Irish Independent</a>. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÃ‰IREANN</a> 05:06 16 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no such word for "the" in the Chinese language. I went to their website and couldn't find an "official" English translation. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe <i>Apple Daily</i> is correct, though since it is a Chinese only publication (and Chinese does not have "articles") it's hard to be certain. However, all the English language press in Hong Kong cite it as <i>Apple Daily</i> so I think the move is a good one. (<a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for "corporate logo" concerns, the flag of a newspaper (ie. the newspaper name/logo seen on the print publication) seems a legitimate addition. One, it is not blatant advertising and 2) does provide a function since not everyone can read Chinese. So it at least shows the title in Chinese and the colorful look of the paper, which it is famous for. (<a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a>)</p>
<p>I dont believe it is a copyright violation to use a corporate logo when describing or referring to the corporation. Certainly, if a corporation complains we can remove the offending image. <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizza_Puzzle_d32e.html" title="User:Pizza Puzzle">Pizza Puzzle</a></p>

<dd>No its a trade mark infringement, under Hong Kong law. This is a registered trade mark being used without permission. It shoudl be removed, immediately.-<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Stewart_bdc2.html" title="User:David Stewart">David Stewart</a> 14:06 16 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since I'm coming from the US, perhaps you can explain the HK law to me. In the US, this would clearly fall under fair use, under Fair Use Clause of Section 107 of the amended Copyright Act of 1976. In US law, not only is this non-commercial use, but the law explicitly allows for product comparison and news reporting, even in commercial use. If CNN does a news report about Ford's quarterly earnings, they can use Ford's logo in their graphic, without Ford's permission. See <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org" class="external text" title="http://www.chillingeffects.org" rel="nofollow">EFF's Chilling Effects</a> for reasons why this is a good thing. Perhaps the HK law explanation would be good additions to <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_copyright_law_c537.html" title="Hong Kong copyright law">Hong_Kong_copyright_law</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_trademark_law_caa9.html" title="Hong Kong trademark law">Hong_Kong_trademark_law</a>.

<p>Hong Kong doesn't have jurisdiction over the wikipedia anyways. <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizza_Puzzle_d32e.html" title="User:Pizza Puzzle">Pizza Puzzle</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Really? You haven't read my article on <a href="../../../g/u/t/Gutnick_v_Dow_Jones_3e19.html" title="Gutnick v Dow Jones">Gutnick v Dow Jones</a>, then. Jurisdiction is no boundary for internet-based torts in the common law world.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is no fair use defence for trade mark infringement. Product comparison was only introduced as of 4 April 2003, and even then I would think you are not allowed ot use another trade mark in doing so, but only mention the other product by name. Copyright has a fair <i>dealing</i> exception under the Copyright Ordinance Cap 528 which is extremely limited when compared to fair use in the US - academic publications and criticism fall under it. But even if you could say that we are suing a regsitered trade mark for the purposes of academic publication, we'd still be infringing the trade mark. Wikipedia earns no profit, so it'd be damages at large - a sufficient deterrent to stop other people from doing it. And because I've now written this, if we keep them up and for example Apple Daily (a fairly litigious newspaper, represented by Deacons, one of Hong Kong's largest law firms)decides to sue, then they'd be entitle to flagrant (punitive)damages. And yes, I am a Hong Kong copyright lawyer. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Stewart_bdc2.html" title="User:David Stewart">David Stewart</a> 15:10 16 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

In this instance, no newspaper on earth unless run by imbeciles would ligitate, or be anything other than happy that they are getting coverage in a massive internationally read encyclopÃ¦dia. . Wikipedia is a non-profit organisation that it not abusing the image but is simply giving the newspaper worldwide <i>free</i> publicity of the sort that would cost tens of millions if it had to be bought, by providing an article accompanied by a logo. Any media organisation stupid enough to take offence and treaten court action would face a public relations <i>calamity</i>. Anybody in PR would tell you that their advice to the company in question would be "don't be idiots". If they made an issue of it, they would open themselves up to ridicule with <i>every</i> rival publication and probably get themselves international coverage that would do them horrendous damage. I have worked in public relations and anyone who has would tell you that the advice would be not only not to sue, but to say "thanks for the article. Here is a better image of our logo and as much factual information as you need. Anytime you need more, call me that this number. Thank you very very much for the coverage." For they would know that the coverage would increase readership from visitor readership from people who had seen the article and then saw the newspaper and had the potential to increase native readership among those who had never bothered to pick up a copy before but might just having read about it.</p>
<p>I write for a number of newspapers. One of them, when they discovered they were on wiki, were not merely happy; it was mentioned at the editorial conference, with the deputy editor informing people "we have made it into a major net encyclopÃ¦dia". When they discovered I contributed they offered access to any of their photographs, but as they could not release them under the GNU licence that offer could not be accepted.</p>
<p>The logo in this case is a clear case of <i>fair use</i> and any publishing house would be stark raving mad to take offence because of the positive benefits that could flow from the recognition, and the massive ridicule and damage that could result if they were insane enough to complain. Media companies more than almost anything else rely on their reputation in the business and unless run by absolute imbeciles would run a mile from making themselves a laughing stock in the industry by complaining about getting worldwide free coverage in one of the net's biggest encyclopÃ¦dias. In fact any newspaper group I have dealt with would <i>pay</i> and pay handsomely to get an entry into a world wide publication. Your worries, David, are groundless. And as Pizza said, if they were stupid enough to complain, the image could be pulled in an instant. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÃ‰IREANN</a> 03:49 18 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course Jtdir, in my heart I agree with you 100%&#160;:) Then again, I'm also sensitive to getting to the <i>truth</i> and learning about the implications of publishing Wikipedia on a global scale. For David, I have this: Not wanting to sound argumentative Re: Gutnick vs. Dow Jones. But, do you think the nature of the case being defamation had a crucial role in the case being pursued and ruled upon across borders, as opposed to, say, copyright or trademark? Systems derived from the English model have, to be polite, "lower" thresholds for defamation than what this American is used to. The agreed upon laws of trademark and copyright seem to have more international harmony than those of defamation. In the U.S. you must prove "intent" to do harm and "reckless disregard" for the facts. (BTW, I find the Wikipedia entries for English defamation law severely lacking, or simply missing!)
