<p>is apple pie really that american? appletrees didn't even grow in america until the europeans brought them over&#160;:S and the english were already making pies of the weirdest ingredients so how could they forgot to try apple? just a googlesearch shows that a dutch painting dated 1626 shows an apple pie. also apple pie is the most popular pie where i live and eaten alot. i always thought of the saying 'as american as apple pie' as somewhat sarcastic, so can anyone maybe explain/clarify what is so american about apple pie? --<a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.251.90.73.html" title="User:62.251.90.73">62.251.90.73</a> 14:29, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It may not be logical, in the sense that apple pie probably <i>did</i> originate somewhere else, but the phrase, "as American as apple pie" is a genuine phrase, used by genuine Americans in their speech, and there is almost never any sense of irony or sarcasm in their usage.
<ul>
<li>I imagine that by the 18th or 19th century apples were being grown all over the country, in enormous quantities. And Americans were enormous pie-eaters, consuming far more of them than their English forebears, for example. Since apples, dried or fresh, were available most of the year, it seems only natural that more apple pies were baked and consumed than any other kind. Hence the phrase.<a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 00:15, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, there has been a recipe around for decades now called "mock apple pie", in which <i>Ritz Crackers</i> are substituted for sliced apples. I wouldn't bother to make one myself, but I have been given them over the years, and you would be amazed at how much they look like, and taste like, genuine apple pies.<a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 00:15, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I reverted Chameleon's additions to the article because they were POV. Changing the picture caption to read "Apple pie presented as All-American" as opposed to "Apple pie", and adding <i>"As American as apple pie" is a common saying, which could be seen as ironic, given that apple pie is not particularly American. It may be that "American" in this context does not mean "invented in America" or suchlike, but instead "apple pie" is used as a symbol of what is folksy and wholesome, and therefore "American". This could be compared to the use of the expression "that's not Christian", which should not be taken literally but instead means "that is cruel or immoral behaviour".</i> is an attempt to introduce anti-American bias and uses <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a> such as: "which could be seen as", "It may be that", "This could be compared to" etc.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article as it stands is fine except for the incorrect implication that "As American as apple pie" is something that a non-American might say, or that apple pies, of all things, are generally regarded as having anything to do with America. Indeed the phrase most usually appears as "As American as mom and apple pie." I think we can all agree that the statement is even more puzzling in this form, unless interpreted in an ironic sense. Moms are not particularly American. Well mine isn't.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Having said that, I think Charles Matthews has hit the nail on the head. How about moving all the American stuff into a section titled "Apple pie in American culture."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think Arminius should have reverted the last-but-one version, which provided a pretty good analysis of a puzzling saying that always bemuses non-Americans: <i>"As American as apple pie" is a common saying, which could be seen as ironic, given that apple pie is not particularly American. It may be that "American" in this context does not mean "invented in America" or suchlike, but instead "apple pie" is used as a symbol of what is folksy and wholesome, and therefore "American".

<dd>It is clear that apple pie is in no way American.

<p>Mmm! <b>Dutch Apple Pie</b> is my favourite - much nicer with the addition of spice. Now of course Apple Pie is not inherently American, and that needs to be emphasised.

<p>Hey, why the US flag? Haven't you ever heard the phrase "As Australian as apple pie"? Seriously, what is the reason for turning an article on as world-wide a food as apple pie into gung-ho jingoism? The page points out that the apple pie existed for centuries before America did - in one line - and the rest of the article is about American recipes. Either present a less biased point of view - NOW - or allow every other country that makes apple pie to write as much on their apple pie recipes. As to the <i>phrase</i> "As American as Apple pie"" indicating how american it is, the phrase is <i>as American as mom and apple pie</i>. Are you going to bias the "Mother" page in the same way? Oh, and the idea of 'The apple pie in American culture' is a good one, it would allow the article to remain unbiased while allowing some recognition of the apple pie's importance as a symbol of the U.S.</p>

<li>present a proper history of the dish from Chaucer (and earlier if known) to the modern day;</li>
<li>present an consideration of the dish in different nations, including a discussion of its metaphorical power in modern America. (But look up Dutch apple dishes);</li>

<dd>I wont unprotect it again, but I don't feel it should be protected, so if another admin wants to unprotect it then go ahead as far as I am concerned. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(Tart, knees hot)</a> 13:30, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>But please, do not present that jingo American picture so prominently with a text as if it were neutral. Can somebody please find a more neutral pic? Thanks <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 14:29, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't exactly support it yet. The caption should be something like "Apple pie with baseball equipments and an American flag" or it is still going too far into the jingo stuff. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevth_904e.html" title="User:Revth">Revth</a> 14:43, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like the American apple pie picture, but I think it's better used to illustrate the American culture section. Trying to pass it off as "An apple pie" and the like seem a bit jingoistic to me. As someone has pointed out, the picture was originally on some jingoistic website and its name gives away its extreme cultural bias. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinority_Report_ada1.html" title="User:Minority Report">Minority Report</a> 15:02, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>As a UK user, I think that if the picture is in the "Apple Pie in American Culture" section, and is described as such, there is no problem. I think that the picture serves to highlight how the dessert is viewed in America, in the same way that roast beef and Yorkshire puddings are viewed as the archetypal dish of the UK.<a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 19:19, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
