<p>This article is really funny, and I enjoyed reading it immensely. However, I don't think it gives the phrase a fair shake. When used properly, it really is a good analogy. The point is not that apples and oranges are completely dissimilar. Apples to apples implies comparing one apple with another apple of the same variety; with no fundamental differences, only particular differences are being compared; hence, you can find one apple in the pile to be simply better than another. Apples to oranges is for individual things that do have a lot of similarities, but that have some fundamental differences that prevent such a simple comparison. Like you could say comparing a blog and nytimes.com is comparing apples and oranges. They can be compared; both are websites, both may report on current events, etc. But because they have fundamental differences, it makes direct comparison less relevant than comparing, say, one blog to another or nytimes.com to washingtonpost.com. You can compare blogs (in general) to newpaper websites (in general); you can't say NYT is a worse blog than X (because it doesn't hyper-link to it's sources).</p>
<p>So when used properly, "apples to oranges" doesn't mean items are incomparable; it means they are instances of different classes of objects and so cannot be evaluated in precisely the same terms.</p>
<p>The use of plural in the phrase is what makes it confusing. When used properly, it means you can't evaluate the quality of a given orange (this is a good orange, this is a bad orange) by comparing it to an apple. A good orange is a bad apple, and vice versa.--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 09:29, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure about the legitimacy of deriving such conclusions from etymologies - take the word "sinister", for example - but who I am to stand in the way of a good article?

<p>I added the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The equivalent Danish idiom, "What is highest, the Round Tower or a thunderclap?", depending on "highest" (<i>højest</i>) meaning both "tallest" and "loudest" in Danish, compares dissimilar properties of dissimilar items.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Wikipedia is not a dictionnary, so we should not have similar idioms from lots of languages here. However, in connection with Volokh's criticism, I think the Danish one is relevant. I don't know whether I should include the full idiom in Danish, but here it is (if someone else wants to include it):</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hvad er højest, Rundetårn eller et tordenskrald?</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I don't suppose it would be literally correct to translate that idiom as "Which has more <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volume_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Volume (disambiguation)">volume</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/n/Rundet%C3%A5rn.html" title="Rundetårn">Rundetårn</a> or a thunderclap?", would it?

<dd>Thanks for the pun - but alas, you're right, it would not be a correct translation. Applied to a physical object, "højest" refers to height, not to volume.

<p>Hi -- I've re-removed the "Criticisms of criticisms" section, because it is entirely <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Maybe it makes valid points, but it cites no source to substantiate that these points have been made. I realize that some people think the "criticisms" are right. My personal opinion is that they are a bit over the top and don't really do much to clarify the meaning of the phrase and are kind of silly.</p>
<p>This is precisely why we have the "no original research" rule, so that we don't get into battles over this sort of thing. If the criticisms are valid, then someone must have made them somewhere other than wikipedia. So go out and find/cite them!</p>
<p>"No original research" is one of the five pillars and is very important when we work on much more hot-button issues where it is an important way to defuse flamewars on, e.g., political topics.</p>

<dd>See the problem with that is that if you hew too cautiously to the "no orginal research" line you'll be compelled to delete the introductory ¶ as well. Heck, you'll be compelled to delete most articles' introductory paragraphs! We don't need a citation to tell us that the sky is blue; we don't need a citation to tell us that shoe polish is polish used for shoes. We trust editors, in writing intro ¶s, to use their personal knowledge. The "no original research" rule, although just as important as you say it is, isn't always black and white.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But even apart from that, I feel that it is irresponsible for you to delete that section from the article. It's a question of the lesser of two evils. With that paragraph gone, the article ACTIVELY PROMOTES FALSEHOOD, which is not the goal of an encyclopedia. If you think there should be a citation then we can look for one (you can help too); but in the meanwhile the article shouldn't be in a dangerous and unencyclopedic state. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 17:37, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Doops -- the introduction does not make any points that are not made in sources later in the article. Meanwhile, the section that I removed makes points that are to be found nowhere else (AFAIK) in the sources, and that actively contradict them. This is explicitly a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, which states that "An edit counts as original research if it proposes ideas or arguments. That is: ... it introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source, which purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position."</p>
<p>Saying that the "sky is blue" is not OR in this sense, since I very much doubt it is ever being said to refute another theory; in general, I am not a nutcase about <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, which is a separate issue. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> just means that wikipedia doesn't "get involved" in debates -- it only reports on them.</p>
<p>I'll keep an eye out for sources. Meanwhile, since you seem to be strongly in favor of including this section, I encourage you to do so as well. As I've said, I think the section is actually silly and wrong, which is why I'm being a bit hardline about NOR here. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 17:45, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I'm confused. What do you think is silly and wrong? The criticisms or the critique of the criticisms?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>At any rate, I don't view the "criticisms critiqued" § as making an argument. I view it as presenting a fact. ("The idiom might not mean this; it might mean that.") Actually, I think if you're fair you'll give me credit for how exceptionally delicately-worded it was; I bent over backwards to make sure that no claim was being made by the article. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 18:12, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, I'm not very happy with it myself. But at any rate I wasn't asking you about it; I was asking about my earlier "criticisms critiqued" section. And I really would like to know what you think is silly and wrong. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 18:32, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sure. The original section claimed, among other things, that the criticisms were based on a "misunderstanding" of the idiom. I think this is incorrect. Volokh, and others, are certaintly entirely aware of what the idiom means and how to use it correctly; they are simply having a little tongue-in-cheek fun with words. It's important to remember that it is, indeed, an idiom -- i.e., its literal meaning is not the question. Idioms may have begun at some point by asserting a literal fact, but by the time they are in fact idioms, those things are lost in the mists of time.</p>
<p>The section claimed to know the "true" literal meaning of the idiom (and I believe the asserted "true" meaning is incorrect -- what it originally arose from is probably some weird historical quirk and a matter for etymologists), and it claimed that knowing this true meaning allowed one to better understand the idiom and "reject" criticisms of it (which is silly -- nobody is seriously saying that using the idiom as a shorthand for describing someone as comparing incomparables is wrong.) <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 18:55, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Two things. 1) Here was my paragraph's text:
<dl>
<dd><i>Note that both criticisms, as outlined above, attack the suggestion that apples and oranges are, as classes, incomparable. However, these may be seen to be straw man arguments based on a misunderstanding of the idiom. If the idiom is understood as to suggest that particular apples and oranges are incomparable — that is to say, that it is impossible to compare this apple to that orange insofar as there are different standards of quality in apples and oranges — then the objections fall away. To make this clearer, the original idiom could be rephrased as "comparing an apple to an orange." Although it is certainly possible to compare an individual apple to an individual orange on a personal and visceral level, an attempt to put the preference into words will tend to rest on a combination of comparisons of the fruits as classes (I prefer this apple to that orange; but to be honest, I usually do) and comparisons of the individual fruits against their respective ideals (I usually like apples and oranges equally; but this apple is juicy as apples go while that orange is dry as oranges go; so given today's choice I choose the apple).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I just want to point out that it did not "claim...that the criticisms were based on a misunderstnading"; it <i>suggested</i> that that they might be. It did not "claim to know the 'true' literal meaning"; it pointed out that Volokh et al. were assuming one literal meaning and offered the <i>possibility</i> of another. In short, it went out of its way to be encyclopedic and neutral.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) But, yes, on a personal level, and here on the talk page, I can say: both Volokh and the scientific "studies" are based on a misinterpretation and a misrepresentation of the phrase. It's like arguing that the common idiom "woe is me" is grammatically incorrect; and that it should be "woe is I." It might be a fun way to show off your knowledge of the predicate nominative; but it's ultimately meaningless. The predicate nominative is just a red herring.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Consider how we <i>use</i> the "comparing apples with oranges" idiom. We use it when somebody tries to compare two things from different categories, to point out that he/she is making an invalid comparison. We don't use it when somebody tries to compare two categories. If somebody says "I prefer fancy restaurants to diners" we don't invoke it; but if somebody eating at a diner complains that his mayonnaise came from a jar ("at Henri's it's made from scratch!") we do. So why not apply the phrase to itself the same way we apply it to the world around it? That is to say, the phrase has two possible interpretations. One makes sense, the other doesn't. Which shall we assume? (It OBVIOUSLY doesn't make sense; the scientists jokingly used their advanced equipment to prove how similar apples and oranges are but you and I know that it's a lot simpler than that -- both are round; both are sweet; both grow on trees; etc. A child could do it.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now you argue that I can't possibly know the true meaning of the idiom. I happen to disagree (I mean, we all know what the true meaning of "my kingdom for a horse" is, just by common sense); but for the sake of argument I'll pretend to agree for a sec. I don't know the true meaning, OK. <i>Neither do you.</i> And given two possible interpretations, it is uncharitable arguing to pick and choose the weaker one and argue against it. Neither Volokh nor the scientists trouble to note that they've just invested time and effort into disproving something which might actually not need disproving. This is a straw man argument; and especially unfair insofar as the phrase is not here to defend itself. If they overlooked the other interpretation (in my view the correct one), then they were being lazy. If they didn't overlook it but still failed to mention it, then they were being less than frank. Either way they should be ashamed of themselves.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Now obviously I wouldn't dream of putting any of this into an actual article. But maybe if I can convince you of my point of view (or at least its reasonableness) you'll help figure out a way to improve the article. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a></dd>

<p>Definitely high amounts of caution are important in dealing with etymology, there are so many pitfalls and in the absence of a source, it's bad to speculate. Saying that an etymology X is "possible" in the absence of sources is thus a dangerous thing to do; it may, in fact, be impossible given the prior development of the phrase. "Suggesting" argument X is, for the purposes of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, the same as arguing X.</p>
<p>Again, you miss the important point that this is an <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiom.html" title="Idiom">idiom</a> -- i.e., the literal meaning has no bearing on the actual meaning. "Bringing coals to Newcastle" is unaffected by the strong possbility that Newcastle is no longer a net exporter of coal.</p>
<p>Droops, I think you are kind of flipping out over something rather silly. All of the "criticisms" here are <i>jokes</i>! The joke is that they are doing a laborious analysis of the literal meaning of an idiom! It's like someone making a video documentary on homemade mayo to demonstrate that at no point is there any "scratching". I don't think there's any need for Volokh or whoever to feel "ashamed", except for possiblity beating a rather annoyingly dead horse.</p>

<dd>Although both the Volokh and scientific studies are humorous, I'm not convinced that either one is "joking" in a sense that would satisfy me. Volokh and his commentators appear to legitimately prefer replacement of the idiom with an alternative. The scientists are, more in line with your description above, satirizing mallet-to-mosquito overkill; but I think they would believe (as you do) that "the idiom is stupid; but that's OK because it's just an idiom." (I contend, however, that the idiom isn't stupid.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Although you're right that it's unfair to expect idioms to make literal sense all the time, I think that Volokh and the scientists are much more guilty of failing to see this distinction than I am.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the "suggesting is the same as arguing" point, I guess here's my question -- at what point does plucking a relatively obscure blogger from the ether and giving him two full paragraphs in a short article qualify as arguing? Because I persist in my belief that the article, even with my short little disclaimer, will tend to influence readers towards a position that is arguably a misconception.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Am I taking a humorous issue too seriously? Yeah, probably. But this is an encyclopedia, not a humor magazine. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 20:21, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My guess is that Volokh does find the idiom kind of annoying and doesn't want to use it. In any case, contending that the idiom isn't "stupid" is definitely a matter of opinion, and thus needs to be sourced. It's really impossible to get a self-evident (i.e., <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> exempt) argument for or against it going. If you want to point out that the criticisms are doubly silly because idioms don't depend on their literal meaning, go ahead (I just assumed it was implicit.) <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 20:37, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I'm on the horns of a dilemma, aren't I? I <i>do</i> think that the alternative interpretation is self-evident (and therefore NOR-exempt); but if I argue that too strongly you'll ask why something so obvious needs to be explained at length. And I <i>do</i> think that many people are mindless sheep and won't spot the flaw for themselves (given only a brief and cryptic disclaimer) and will come away from the present article with a misconception; but if I argue that too strongly you'll say that that proves my interpretation is non-self-evident. I happen to believe both things. What can be done?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>[And, by the way, I'm gloomily afraid that we won't find any sources to express my interpretation. See, it's a commonsense one and the only reason why somebody would espouse it is <i>in response</i> to criticisms like the scientists' or Volokh's -- but the former is unlikely to inspire responses (for fear of being found a humorless spoilsport) and the latter's "comments" field didn't yield any quotable responses. (There were two good comments espressing and/or using my view, but neither one of them is very quotable.)] <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 20:57, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't realize this would be such a big deal. I believe I have fixed the situation. The note at the top of the criticism section was misleading, since the scientific study by the <i>Annals of Improbable Research</i> compared particular fruits. The argument that the idiom should apply to individual fruits is now sourced, though poorly, and relates only to Volokh's criticism, which is as I think it should be. Does this fix anything? <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarry491_9990.html" title="User:Harry491">Dave</a> <a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarry491_73d9.html" title="User talk:Harry491">(talk)</a> 22:05, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my view, it has made the situation worse, insofar as the disclaimer is now even more miniscule and apt-to-be-overlooked. Furthermore, the "scientific" studies are now completely unchallenged. However, I have thought of a much simpler way of expressing the flaws in both objections and I marvel at my own blindness for not noticing it sooner; I'll add it now. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 22:23, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article states: ‘In British English, the phrase <i>chalk and cheese</i> means the same thing as <i>apples and oranges</i>.’ This is not true, as far as I am aware (as a native speaker of British English). We don’t often actually use the expression ‘apples and oranges’ as such – but we do use expressions such as: ‘that’s like comparing apples with oranges’ (to stress that one should compare like with like). To say that two things are ‘like chalk and cheese’ or ‘as different as chalk and cheese’, on the other hand, is to say that they are fundamentally opposite, having little or nothing in common. As far as I’m aware, there is no overlap between the contexts in which the two phrases would be used.</p>

<p>A minor point: the Latin "pomum" is sometimes translated as "apple", but it actually refers to any fruit. The word for the apple specifically is "malum" (although this, too, can refer to some other fruits).</p>

<dd><i>In <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, a common question is "En qué se parecen el amor y elojo del hacha?" which translates into "What do love and axe eye have in common?" and emphasizes dissimilarity between two subjects.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In the translation, what does "axe eye" mean? Is it the whole in an axe head where the shaft passes through, or what? Does it need clarification? Should it be "an axe eye", perhaps "the eye of an axe head"?
