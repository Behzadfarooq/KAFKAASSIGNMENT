<p>An appanage was a concession of a fief by the sovereign to his younger sons, while the eldest son became king on the death of his father. Appanages were considered as part of the inheritance transmitted to the puisne (french <i>puisn√©</i>, 'later born') sons; the word <i>Juveigneur</i> (from the Latin comparartive <i>Iuvenior</i>, 'younger [brother]'; in Brittany's customary law only the youngest brother) was specifically used for the royal princes holding an <i>apanage</i>. These lands could not be sold, neither hypothetically nor as a dowry, and returned to the royal domain on the extinction of the princely line. Daughters were excluded from the system: a false interpretation of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salic_law.html" title="Salic law">salic law</a> generally prohibited daughters from inheriting land and also from acceding to the throne.</p>
<p>The appanage system was used to gild the pill of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primogeniture.html" title="Primogeniture">primogeniture</a> to avoid civil war among throne contenders or the division of the kingdom among princes of royal blood. It was used in this way in <a href="../../../8/4/3/843.html" title="843">843</a>, by the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Verdun_ab95.html" title="Treaty of Verdun">Treaty of Verdun</a>, when <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_the_Pious_e7e4.html" title="Louis the Pious">Louis the Pious</a> divided his empire between his sons <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lothair_I_0d81.html" title="Lothair I">Lothair</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_the_German_58fd.html" title="Louis the German">Louis the German</a>. This division was a source of antagonism between <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, less so in France, since the treaty was imposed on Lothair by Louis.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Capet_2fc3.html" title="Hugh Capet">Hugh Capet</a> was elected King of France on the death of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_V_of_France_9492.html" title="Louis V of France">Louis V</a> in <a href="../../../9/8/7/987.html" title="987">987</a>. The royal line of France from <a href="../../../9/8/7/987.html" title="987">987</a> to <a href="../../../1/3/2/1328.html" title="1328">1328</a> broke entirely away from the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merovingian.html" title="Merovingian">Merovingian</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolingian.html" title="Carolingian">Carolingian</a> custom of dividing the kingdom among all the sons. The eldest son alone became King and received the royal domain except for the appanages. Most of the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capetian_dynasty.html" title="Capetian dynasty">Capetians</a> endeavored to add to the royal domain by the incorporation of additional fiefs, large or small, and thus gradually obtained the direct lordship over almost all of France.</p>
<p>King <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_V_of_France_649f.html" title="Charles V of France">Charles V</a> tried to remove the appanage system, but in vain. Provinces conceded in appanage tended to become <i>de facto</i> independent and the authority of the king was recognized there reluctantly. Theoretically appanages could be reincorporated into the royal domain but only if the last lord had no male heirs. Kings tried as much as possible to rid themselves of the most powerful appanages: for example, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_I_of_France_1152.html" title="Francis I of France">Francis I</a> confiscated the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Bourbon_86fa.html" title="Duke of Bourbon">Bourbonnais</a>, the last appanage of any importance then, after the treason in 1523 of his commander in chief, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_III%2C_Duke_of_Bourbon_32de.html" title="Charles III, Duke of Bourbon">Charles III, Duke of Bourbon</a>, the 'constable of Bourbon' (died 1527 in the service of <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Charles_V_039a.html" title="Emperor Charles V">Emperor Charles V</a>).</p>
<p>The first article of the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edict_of_Moulins_9139.html" title="Edict of Moulins">Edict of Moulins</a> (1566) declared that the royal domain (defined in the second article as all the land controlled by the crown for more than ten years) could not be alienated, except in two cases: by interlocking, in the case of financial emergency, with a perpetual option to repurchase the land; and to form an appanage, which must return to the crown in its original state on the extinction of the male line. The <i>apanagist</i> (incumbent) therefore could not separate himself from his appanage in any way.</p>
<ul>
<li>After <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_V_of_France_649f.html" title="Charles V of France">Charles V of France</a>, a clear distinction had to be made between titles given as names to children in France, and true appanages. At their birth the French princes received a title independent of an appanage. Thus, the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Anjou_fbfd.html" title="Duke of Anjou">Duke of Anjou</a>, son of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XIV_of_France_d0a6.html" title="Louis XIV of France">Louis XIV</a>, never possessed Anjou and never received any revenue from this province. The king waited until the prince had reached adulthood and was about to marry before endowing him with an appanage. The goal of the appanage was to provide him with a sufficient income to maintain his noble rank. The fief given in appanage could be the same as the title given to the prince, but this was not necessarily the case. Only seven appanages were given from <a href="../../../1/5/1/1515.html" title="1515">1515</a> to <a href="../../../1/7/8/1789.html" title="1789">1789</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Appanages were abolished in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1792.html" title="1792">1792</a> before the proclamation of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Republic_0361.html" title="First Republic">Republic</a>. The youngest princes from then on were to receive a grant of money but no territory.</li>
<li>Appanages were reestablished under the first French empire by <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_I_of_France_e789.html" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> and confirmed by the Bourbon restoration-king <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XVIII_of_France_e25a.html" title="Louis XVIII of France">Louis XVIII</a>. The last of the appanges, the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans_fee0.html" title="Duke of Orl√©ans">Orl√©anais</a>, was reincorporated to the French crown when the Duke of Orleans, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis-Philippe_of_France_8d0f.html" title="Louis-Philippe of France">Louis-Philippe</a>, became king of the French in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1830.html" title="1830">1830</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The word <i>apanage</i> is still used in French figuratively, in a non-historic sense: ‚Äúto have appanage over something‚Äù is used, often in an ironic and negative sense, to claim exclusive possession over something. For example, ‚Äúcows have appanage over <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prion.html" title="Prion">prions</a>.‚Äù</li>

<li>Most unusual, the mother of the Maharaja of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travancore.html" title="Travancore">Travancore</a> (a matrilinear Hindu dynasty) and her sister received the principality of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attingal.html" title="Attingal">Attingal</a> in joint appanage, being styled the Senior and Junior <i>Rani</i> (the female form of Raja or Rana) of Attingal, respectively; their husbands, known as Koil Tampurans, came from one of four or five princely houses who were closely related to the Royal House of Travancore</li>
