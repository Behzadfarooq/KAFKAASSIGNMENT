This, combined with a very tight-lipped corporate policy about future products, has fostered this interest in the company's every move.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_rumors_community.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The industry of Macintosh speculation, known as "Mac Rumors," began with a regular column in the now defunct <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacWEEK_9d49.html" title="MacWEEK">MacWEEK magazine</a> called <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_the_Knife_12cf.html" title="Mac the Knife">"Mac the Knife"</a> and written under a <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudonym.html" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</a>. This column would often cover topics such as upcoming hardware releases from Apple, as well as new software products and incremental updates with new features. It was written by the MacWeek staff and was sometimes used by companies as an early form of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Viral_marketing.html" title="Viral marketing">viral marketing</a> to generate buzz around products before they were ready for release. For instance, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macromedia.html" title="Macromedia">Macromedia</a> would tout new features in the upgrade to its drawing program when buzz was building for an imminent release of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adobe_Illustrator_1b83.html" title="Adobe Illustrator">Adobe Illustrator</a>.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The popularity of Mac the Knife's column, combined with the Internet's publishing model, made a low-cost business model viable for others, and early on MacOSRumors became the "it" source for Macintosh rumors, especially as MacWeek was thrown into turmoil by the decline of Apple's fortunes in the mid 90's.</p>

<p>Run originally by a man named Ryan Meader, MacOSRumors was a popular source for Apple rumors and news. MacOSRumors originally collected content from message boards and <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">usenet</a> posts but later developed contacts inside Apple<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.

More recently, some readers felt that the quality of updates had deteriorated significantly, pointing to evidence that reports are more likely to be fabricated than from any actual source. MacOSRumors has been widely discounted and ignored by the Mac rumors community, even though they continue to provide updates on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>AppleInsider, originally named "Reality", first appeared as an offshoot of Macintosh News Network (MacNN). For many years, however, the site was dormant, without updates. Only in recent years has AppleInsider returned to activity and some notoriety by being named in recent suits by <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computer_f26c.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a>. In the late 1990s Apple successfully sued a John Doe from the AppleInsider's boards with the username "Worker Bee" for revealing information on what would eventually become the Apple Pro Mouse. It was a rare case of Apple following through on threats of a suit. The case was settled out of court.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 2000, MacRumors.com appeared as an aggregator of Mac-related rumors and reports around the Mac web. By consolidating reports and cross-referencing claims, Mac Rumors attempts to keep track of the rumor community. MacRumors now has over 100,000 members and over 3,000,000 forum posts. In addition to providing rumors, news, and an active forum, MacRumors also serves as one of the most prominent sites for broadcasting live coverage of Apple announcements via MacRumorsLive.com.</p>

<p>This French site used to report rumors, although they stopped for multiple reasons (<a href="http://www.macbidouille.com/news/2003-09-09/#6571" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.macbidouille.com/news/2003-09-09/#6571" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).

Otherwise, Macbidouille (french for "Mac Hacks") is one of the best sites of information for French Macusers. It offers daily <a href="http://www.macbidouille.com" class="external text" title="http://www.macbidouille.com" rel="nofollow">news</a>, articles and <a href="http://forum.macbidouille.com/index.php?act=idx" class="external text" title="http://forum.macbidouille.com/index.php?act=idx" rel="nofollow">forums</a>, which are amongst the largest ones devoted to French-speaking Mac users. If rumors and announces made part of its fame, most of its articles give technical (testing, fixing and customizing) or commercial information – and sometimes harsh criticisms against Apple's policy.

The site, was recently<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> renamed MacScoop (September 2006), with MacosXrumors remaining online as a more Mac OS X-centric view of the content.

<p>Apple's official stance on the Mac rumor scene has been one of disapproval.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Cease and desist orders were not uncommon when rumor sites were able to accurately report product images or documents. Historically, however, Apple has primarily pursued the leakers of information rather than the rumor sites themselves. Apple's most recent suit against Think Secret, however, is targeting whether these sites have the right to knowingly publish this protected information.</p>
