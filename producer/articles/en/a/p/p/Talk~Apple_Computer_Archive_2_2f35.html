The following is a partial list of products it used as revealed during the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> Expo, with each product followed by its applications, according to D. Rally, who at that time was Apple's senior IT director (as cited in Fried, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>). It should be noted that such information could change constantly, and judging from Apple's past information-disclosure practices (Fried, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>), it is possible that a similar public revelation will never occur again.</p>

<p>Isn’t the above statement to much POV? I type this on a Powerbook, but its stability, reliability, security and ease of use is still a POV, not a fact.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Apple logo myth?</span></h2>
<p>I have heard someone talking about the apple logo (the apple with a bite out of it) being based on the great mathemetician, code breaker and pioneer in computing, Alan Turing, commiting suicide by poisoning and apple and then eating it. Is this true? Any comments greatly appreciated.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, you are free to associate the logo with it in your mind, but I'm not certain <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Janoff_ec11.html" title="Rob Janoff">Rob Janoff</a> (who designed it) would even have heard of Turing. A lot of works are open to a wide range of interpretations that their creators didn't even intend, and I think this is the case with Apple's logo. I have read that Janoff took the bite out of the apple so that it wouldn't be mistaken for a tomato. That may be all there is to it. —<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadRafe_fc96.html" title="User:RadRafe">RadRafe</a></dd>

<dd>Before I saw the original logotype with Newton in it I also thought that this was a bizarre homage to Turing. The fact is, Turing has a lot more to do with computers than Newton, and in particular the missing bite, which would be the one Turing took out of it to poison himself right before dying, fits so much better with Turing than with Newton. (Turing's apple is also real, as opposed to Newton's.) All in all I think it is a much better explanation than the real one.&#160;:-) Just the fact apparently many people have had this theory independently makes it interesting. <a href="../../../k/r/o/User%7EKronocide_9a30.html" title="User:Kronocide">Kronocide</a> 15:49, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>The Alan Turing story is fascinating, but I'm afraid it is just a legend. I didn't know anything about Alan Turing and his contribution to computer science or his gayness or his suicide. There are some interesting coincidences, however, in that I am a gay man but my design pre-dated the rainbow flag, which has become one of the international gay symbols. The colors in the logo were designed to give the logo a more fun and approachable image plus it represented the color capabilities of the Apple 2 computer which at the time far exceeded the other home/hobby computers out there.</i></dd>

<dd>True, Opteron was only for the servers, and even in that, it was not the first 64-bit chip. And, even if Opterons were for personal machines, G5 was shipped <i>before</i> Opteron (Although the Opteron name was announced <i>first</i>). <b>SO</b>, G5 is the first ever 64-bit processsor on a personal machine, not Opteron.

<dd>I would prefer that they use <a href="../../../i/a/-/IA-64_e36e.html" title="IA-64">IA-64</a> instead of x86. x86 is outdated and no longer has any room for extension. Itanium is flexible enough to be used not only in workstations and servers, but for mobiles as well (Itanium 2's low power variants are getting better). Intel will benefit because of the design win from Apple, and Apple will benefit by getting a superior design that can be produced in huge quantities. With Itanium, Apple will dominate both the desktop and server markets in price/performance. Also, they avoid the x86 and CISC world, and go beyond their old RISC chips. C'mon, Apple, please use <a href="../../../i/a/-/IA-64_e36e.html" title="IA-64">IA-64</a> instead! <a href="../../../e/p/i/EPIC_d0aa.html" title="EPIC">EPIC</a> beats <a href="../../../c/i/s/CISC_d907.html" title="CISC">CISC</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/s/RISC_0a73.html" title="RISC">RISC</a>. Think different! Think in the long term! Otherwise, Apple will change again in 2015!

<dd>If Apple used the IA-64, they might have a hard time with overhead, just like with the G4 fiassco we had in the late ninties... the Itanium is not a high yeild processor, and it is a very pricey chip to put in mainstream equipment, but I agree that the Itanium is a very powerful, very flexible platform to use. If the bugs can be worked out, by all means, I'm sure that Apple will migrate to that chip. Besides, Apple said nothing about using the Pentium line exclusively, and I haven't seen much release as to if they are going to use the Pentium at all, but it is the most likely the course that Apple will take. I have read several reports that Apple will NOT use the Prescott [late Pentium 4] architecture found in the aluminum development boxes that are currently being distributed (thank goodness), they will be using a new line of "beefcaked" Pentium M based chips [yes, the Pentium M, Intel's Centrino processor], including the dual core chips [Pentium D] are currently in the development pipeline. Coupled with HyperThreading, dual core chips would have a total of 4 logical processors, that is if Intel allows Apple to put 2 processors in their machines. Anyway, if Apple is going to use the newer souped up "M", then this expains why Steve was talking about performance per watt, as the Pentium M is <i>extremely</i> effecient in that respect, unlike the incredilby hot running, inefficient Prescott, that can run even hotter thatn a G5. Futhermore, Intel has announced that they will migrate all of their chips [sans the Celeron] to a 64 bit achitecture, so there is little reason to worry that Apple will back themselfs into a corner. But for saftey's sake, I really hope they don't. Peace folks. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolFox_13d1.html" title="User:CoolFox">CoolFox</a> 18:39, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I split out the Litigation into its own section, leaving everything that had been in "Apple as a Corporation" intact.

<p>I feel that the two domain-squatting cases are beneath notice for encyclopedic content. Apple has sued or been sued thousands of times, and these two cybersquatting cases don't affect consumers, didn't set precedents, and didn't materially affect the operations or reputation of the firm.

<p>JUST because a company has a different name does not sever it from Apple. FileMaker is an umbilical of Apple, just as Claris was. For clarification: Apple MADE Claris, Apple controls them; the company makes the decisions for them. The ONLY reason a seperate name exists is to enhance brand recognition. For all intents and purpose, just as MacWrite and Hypercard were still considered Apple products, so is Filemaker. This is why, when *Apple* dissolved Claris, Apple *retained all the rights to Filemaker*, and Apple *created* FileMaker corp to clarify its position in that market. For more information, one is free to consult the Wiki regarding it. But, in conclusion, to say that Filemaker, just like all the previous Claris products, isn't an Apple creation is just absurd. Next thing you know, we'll hear someone say that Hypercard wasn't an Apple product either... - Doom127</p>

I think Apple Computer is in the top 50 when it comes to articles on corporations. That said, the article has weaknesses.

<li>There should not be too many lists within an article. Also, the reader will want to know what exactly relates these companies to Apple.

<p>The Criticism section includes a lot of opinions expressed in passive voice and/or without specific cites: "Apple was criticized for ... Others criticize the company by suggesting ... Some even regard the company as ... Jobs is cited for criticism ... Apple was also criticized for". Most of these criticism are common knowledge in the computer industry, but the section could use some refs to substantiate and demonstrate notability. --<a href="../../../m/u/c/User%7EMuchness_6152.html" title="User:Muchness">Muchness</a> 18:28, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This subsection was removed for being un-encyclopedic and specious:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><b>Diversity</b><br /></i> Many lawsuits have been filed against Apple Computer for its treatment of racial minorities as well as its hiring (and termination) practices against Blacks, Middle Easterners, South Asians, and East Asians. In one of the largest racial discrimination lawsuits in its history, Apple was sued for discriminating against African-Americans for $40 million<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. In 2000, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Jackson_14cf.html" title="Jesse Jackson">Jesse Jackson</a> singled out Apple as a "negative example" of racial tolerance due to its failure to appoint African Americans or Latinos to the board. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Apple has still not made such an appointment, claiming that they instead appoint individuals to their board of directors based on qualification instead of ethnicity. On October 25th, 2005, Apple saluted the late <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosa_Parks_bff2.html" title="Rosa Parks">Rosa Parks</a>, heroine of the civil rights movement in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">USA</a>, with a tribute on its website. The company had used Parks' image in its 1997 "<a href="../../../t/h/i/Think_Different_e6ef.html" title="Think Different">Think Different</a>" campaign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One African-American employee filed a lawsuit in 2001 (as noted above), and a lesbian fired from her job filed one in May 2005. That doesn't qualify as "many lawsuits." Both dealt with particular managers' behaviors, not some sort of corporate culture. Both were handled by the same lawyer, Waukeen Q. McCoy, who specializes in squeezing money out of companies; both were for exactly the same amount ($40 million), and make the exact same claim ("One of the largest discrimination lawsuits!) Both appear to have never gone to trial. Ironically, Apple is rated <a href="http://www.businessreform.com/article.php?articleID=11076&amp;ofid=2" class="external text" title="http://www.businessreform.com/article.php?articleID=11076&amp;ofid=2" rel="nofollow">#6 of the top ten "gay friendly" companies</a> by Business Reform Magazine. And the claim that the company somehow discriminates against "Blacks, Middle Easterners, South Asians, and East Asians" is rather laughable when one considers that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Jobs_f8a1.html" title="Steve Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>' biological father is Syrian. —<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 23:46, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, for the first time I've actually read the article all the way through. Two things I note. First, the criticisms section needs attribution; "many people say" is not exactly sourceable or verifiable. Second, the style is very choppy, with lots of short disconnected sentences, perhaps the consequence of years of tweaking. If people are agreeable, I could make a pass and make things flow a bit more, at the risk of making longer and more complicated sentences. Since there is a separate history article, I imagine the history here could be pruned down further. The space freed up could then be used for some corporate culture and philosophy (easier to verify than one might think; for instance, the liberal lean of company mgmt is supported by board presence/visibility of Al Gore and overwhelming tilt of political contributions to Dems). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 02:57, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article contains too much unverifiable opinion. Someone please correct it.</p>

<dd>The above unsigned comment appears to have been made by <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathStatWoman_4206.html" title="User:MathStatWoman">user:MathStatWoman</a> after a series of reverts. Please see the discussion on <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathStatWoman_923e.html" title="User talk:MathStatWoman">her talk page</a>. The thing is, reporting an opinion is not POV, as stating that opinion would be. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> allows for this. I agree some sources would help, but in some cases it's hard to find a definitive source - some opinions are widely held and there are mentions all over the web - others are based on things people have said at various times - how can you verify that though? As a Mac developer I've been to many Apple dev seminars and training courses, I talk to a lot of Mac guys that work for Apple - they say things, over time you get a feel for certain opinions... you know those opinions are out there, and widely held, but they are just a sort of folklore. That doesn't mean they are any less valid. Aren't you an Apple guy Stan? So you probably know they are true...&#160;;-) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 12:14, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a little unfair, but I'm getting a bit fed up with the silly edit war that has been enjoined by <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathStatWoman_4206.html" title="User:MathStatWoman">user:MathStatWoman</a>. Here's her attempt at "removing subjectivity and adding fact". Check the history - it's a scream!</p>

<p>This article seems to be rather opinionated. Not neutral, i.e. not following NPOV. Needs some tweaking as Stan Shebs stated above. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeveloperFrom1983_827e.html" title="User:DeveloperFrom1983">DeveloperFrom1983</a> 12:40, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some free advice. Stick to <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathStatWoman_4206.html" title="User:MathStatWoman">one user name</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet.html" title="Sockpuppet">sockpuppets</a> are generally viewed with deep suspicion. Logging out and making edits "anonymously" also doesn't usually work. As you can see, creating another ID and using it to try and lend weight to a particular argument is also tranparently obvious. Admins can see who you are you know! You're new and haven't worked this out yet, it's OK. Also, mistakes are OK too, but do try and get a feel for what wikipedia is and is not, and what POV really means. Reporting POV is not itself POV. Edit wars are futile and waste a lot of time and effort, and ultimately, can't be won by anybody - consensus will always prevail. If you plan to make a contribution, and I hope you will, your credibility will be much enhanced if you stick to your original login, and defend yourself with integrity. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 12:53, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>DeveloperFrom1983, what is your reasoning behind the change to the way Apple's stock is referenced in the first sentence? (<a href="../../../n/a/s/NASDAQ_7dfd.html" title="NASDAQ">NASDAQ</a>: <a href="http://quotes.nasdaq.com/asp/SummaryQuote.asp?symbol=AAPL&amp;selected=AAPL" class="external text" title="http://quotes.nasdaq.com/asp/SummaryQuote.asp?symbol=AAPL&amp;selected=AAPL" rel="nofollow">AAPL</a> vs. AAPL(NASDAQ))... Additionally, it seems to me that the latter is unnecessary and a superfluous article. <a href="../../../p/s/a/User%7EPsantora_c464.html" title="User:Psantora">Paul</a><small><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Psantora_252c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Psantora">C</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../p/s/a/User_talk%7EPsantora_c626.html" title="User talk:Psantora">T</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">+</a></sub></small> 21:44, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Use the first one; it's a template and that means it's standardized. I'm not opposed to moving this down to a "sales" sub section (another "corporate affairs" section?) if anyone bothers to get enough data to justify the section.--<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHereToHelp_1de7.html" title="User:HereToHelp">HereToHelp</a> (<a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHereToHelp_c207.html" title="User talk:HereToHelp">talk</a>) 21:49, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the other hand, that text is pretty poor, so if it's included in any form, it will need significant clean-up. Personally I feel that if the stock value is of interest to a reader, they can very quickly look it up on a much more appropriate, and dynamic, source than this. This text doesn't even mention any dates - if you go back far enough you can find much bigger than 6x gains.. and 'hextupled'? ...is that a real word? Also, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_split.html" title="Stock split">stock splits</a> are nothing unusual, explaining at length what one is here is redundant. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 23:32, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
