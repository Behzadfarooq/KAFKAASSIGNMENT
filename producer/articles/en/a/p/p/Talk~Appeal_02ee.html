<p>Many stubby articles out there could do well to me merged into this one. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMneumisi_37b3.html" title="User:Mneumisi">Manney</a> 23:48, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't like the merger idea. <b><a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal.html" title="Appeal">Appeal</a></b> is a very common, stand-alone term. I just went looking for it and found it. It is not easy to see how the article it is supposed to be merged with is identical or so closely related that the merger should proceed. I think it's a very bad idea. If it works, don't fix it. <a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAhering%40cogeco.ca_4a0b.html" title="User:Ahering@cogeco.ca">Achim</a> 02:16, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The sentence "In cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact, an appellate court will apply an abuse of discretion standard of review" seems to be a sweeping generalization. Is there a particular source for this statement? I was under the impression (although I could be wrong) that the determination of the correct standard of review in an appellate case is a complex body of law. Until this point is clarified, I have decided to add a {{citations missing}} flag. 69.140.157.138 03:30, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, that is right in a way. Findings of fact, whether made by a judge or jury, are subject to abuse of discretion review. There is a complex body of law on the subject, but that really basic. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMneumisi_37b3.html" title="User:Mneumisi">Manney</a> 00:02, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are right that that proper standard of review is a complex matter. In fact, in most cases, judicial decisions on factual determinations relating to the merits are reviewed under the "clearly erroneous" standard.</p>
<p>Hence the very problem. Courts will state that they are using the abuse of discretion standard to review legal conclusions, even though it is essentially de novo because it is an abuse of dicretion to reach an incorrect legal conclusion. The only think you can say safely is that appellate courts must generally defer to factual findings by the lower courts, and are not required to defer to legal conclusions of lower courts. (As always, there are exceptions) As far as trying to delimit the standards of review for all cases, that is pretty much impossible.</p>
<p>PS, you should get yourself an account. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMneumisi_37b3.html" title="User:Mneumisi">Mneumisi</a> 18:20, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hmmm... I don't like the merger idea. I think that the general term needs a separate entry which should also discuss (without getting into too much detail) the concept itself as well as types of appeals (e.g. by leave / by right). A link to appellate court or similar could come off of this page. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobit_78ef.html" title="User:Tobit">Tobit</a></p>
<p>I agree. I just wanted to here from the original proponent. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 16:06, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bad idea. Appellate courts are an important and distinct part of jurisprudence in most court systems in the world and the name deserves its own page.</p>

<p>Looks wrong from my POV. First it uses the phrase "judicially cognizable" and I have absolutely no idea what it means (and I am a lawyer), so perhaps it could either be enlarged or explained. What would a non judicially cognizable judgment look like? Does the phrase add anything? Second, it assumes that one can only appeal final decisions, not so in my jurisdiction, so that needs to be changed to make it NPOV. Third, it would appear to encompass review, which is most certainly not an appeal (here anyway). Are reviews and appeals merged into the same notion in the US? <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 20:21, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>== In France, it is possible to appeal (<i>appel</i>) both on questions of law and facts. In addition, you may make a final appeal on questions of law, known as <i>cassation</i>. I understand that in some, perhaps all common law jurisdictions, appeals on questions of fact are not possible, only appeals on questions of law. Is that correct? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 18:43, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No its not true here (England and Wales). It all depends. Its always possible to ask an appeal court to look at facts about a hearing below if there is an allegation of bias -- or if the court is reviewing its own decision. Eg, was the judge drunk/asleep? Other than that, there are no general rules about appeals, they are all particular statutory rules since appeals are not a common law notion. Most of our rules at lower tiers of the court system either permit appeals on facts, or complete re-hearings in certain circumstances. At higher levels it becomes much harder to do that. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 20:59, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>No.</b> The term is used in primary cases, without regard to appeal, the baic criminal law, at least in Canada, will use the term instead of accused or synonomous with it. The person making a call to the police is called the Complainant, and the person cited by the police in a warrant or in a criminal inestigatioon, or in court when charged, as a respondent. Merger would loose this meaning. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikerussell_7470.html" title="User:Mikerussell">Mikerussell</a> 19:07, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the following is specific to certain countries (for instance, it's not true in France) and should be moved to the relevant national sections or articles:</p>
<p>"<i>Generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not. The appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court's findings of fact (such as whether a defendant committed a particular act), unless clearly erroneous, and so will focus on the court's application of the law to those facts (such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue).</i>"</p>
<p>Generally speaking, general statements should be avoided in topics which differ from one country to another (everything related to law or social sciences). I just removed from <a href="../../../../fr/a/p/p/Appel.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Appel">fr:Appel</a> a sentence which contained the opposite bias.</p>

<p>The current definition of Respondent is incomplete for non-US legal practice.</p>
<p>By way of example, the two parties to a divorce in the United Kingdom are the Petitioner and the Respondent. In the case of alleged adultery, the Petitioner can name the party with whom their spouse is alleged to have committed adultery. They become the co-respondent in the divorce.</p>
<p>As a result of this kind thing, simply merging Respondent (amongst other terms) into a general Appeal bucket will confuse rather than assist. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Nigelx (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nigelx_2fb7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nigelx">contribs</a>) 09:48, 10 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
