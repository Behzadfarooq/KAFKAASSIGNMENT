<p>The original AppleLink, which went online in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, was a service available only to Apple employees and dealers. Apple's consumer <a href="../../../t/o/l/Toll-free_telephone_number.html" title="Toll-free telephone number">800 number</a> in fact touted this fact, promoting your <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dealer.html" title="Dealer">dealer</a> as the place to turn for help because of his access to AppleLink. In the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> the service was also opened up to <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_developer.html" title="Software developer">software developers</a>, who could use it both as an <a href="../../../e/n/d/End-user.html" title="End-user">end-user</a> support system, as well as a conduit to Apple development for questions and suggestions.</p>
<p>AppleLink used client software written in <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pascal_programming_language.html" title="Pascal programming language">Pascal</a> under contract to Apple by Pete Burnight/Central Coast Software. The program extended the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desktop_metaphor.html" title="Desktop metaphor">desktop metaphor</a> of the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macintosh_Finder_c8bb.html" title="Macintosh Finder">Macintosh Finder</a> to encompass the areas on the remote <a href="../../../s/e/r/Server.html" title="Server">server</a> site. These were displayed as <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folders.html" title="Folders">folders</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/l/Files.html" title="Files">files</a> just as local folders and files were. In addition, there was a set of public <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulletin_boards.html" title="Bulletin boards">bulletin boards</a>, and the ability to use <a href="../../../e/m/a/Email.html" title="Email">email</a> via the service — although initially only between AppleLink users. <a href="../../../f/i/l/File_transfer.html" title="File transfer">File transfer</a> for drivers and system software was another important role, and for this Apple created the AppleLink Package format to combine and compress the two <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resource_fork.html" title="Resource fork">forks</a> of a Macintosh file into one for storage and sending. Apple also developed their Communications Control Language (CCL) for AppleLink, a language still used in a very similar form for today's Macintosh <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modem.html" title="Modem">modem</a> scripts.</p>
<p>The "<a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_end.html" title="Back end">back end</a>" of the AppleLink system was hosted on <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Electric_4bb6.html" title="General Electric">General Electric</a>'s Information Services (GEIS) (division) <b>Mark III</b> time-sharing <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainframe_computer.html" title="Mainframe computer">mainframes</a> and world-wide communications <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_networking.html" title="Computer networking">network</a>. AppleLink translated the user's <a href="../../../g/u/i/GUI_1e30.html" title="GUI">GUI</a> actions into a transaction protocol that was sent into a server program running on the mainframe. The connection used a proprietary error free <a href="../../../s/l/i/Sliding_window.html" title="Sliding window">sliding window</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protocol_%28computing%29.html" title="Protocol (computing)">protocol</a> called EF3. Later versions upgraded this protocol to GEIS' <a href="../../../e/f/x/EFX_35a1.html" title="EFX">EFX</a>. GEIS charged fairly substantial charges, both to Apple for maintaining the service at about <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">$</a>30 million a year, rebilled by Apple to the end-users for connection fees of about $15 an hour during business hours. For some years prior to the discontinuation of the system, GEIS maintained a number of employees on the campus of Apple's <a href="../../../c/u/p/Cupertino%2C_California_5b42.html" title="Cupertino, California">Cupertino, California</a> headquarters, co-located with the Apple On-Line Services organization. Repeated attempts to negotiate a lower cost failed, and Apple management chafed at paying for a service that had no obviously measurable income.</p>
<p>Eventually Apple approached <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Case_eb6a.html" title="Steve Case">Steve Case</a> of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_Computer_Services_b5c1.html" title="Quantum Computer Services">Quantum Computer Services</a>, who ran a somewhat similar system for users of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_64.html" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a>. They reached an agreement in which Apple and Quantum would develop a new system known as <b>AppleLink Personal Edition</b>, which would be intended for end-users until all existing AppleLink content could be moved over and the system proved itself stable enough for support services as well. Apple users were generally disappointed that the new service did not give them access to the "real" AppleLink, and eventually the service was shut down after a short period of time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, interested in selling the system to other customers, GEIS developed both <a href="../../../d/o/s/DOS_a58e.html" title="DOS">DOS</a> and eventually <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows.html" title="Windows">Windows</a>-based versions of the client software and sold the system as "DealerTalk" starting in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, aiming at the Apple model of manufacturers using the system to communicate with their dealers. All the systems, including the AppleLink community, were united behind the scenes as part of GEIS' world-wide <b>Quik-Comm</b> E-mail service and could exchange mail with each other and all GEIS mail customers, using addresses like MICHAEL@APPLELINK or JOHNDOE@GEIS. This was later expanded to include Internet mail addresses. Eventually, the GEIS products were renamed <b>BusinessTalk</b> and after a complete system rewrite and creation of their own Macintosh client program (never incorporated into AppleLink), again renamed <b>BusinessTalk System 2000</b> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>. During this time the system, with the Windows client, also became the foundation for Microsoft's first on-line service for developers, the <b>Microsoft Partner Network (MSPN)</b>.</p>

<p>On August 28th, 1991, AppleLink, running on a <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macintosh_Portable_007b.html" title="Macintosh Portable">Macintosh Portable</a> was used to send the first e-mail from space, aboard the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Shuttle_Atlantis_0a51.html" title="Space Shuttle Atlantis">Space Shuttle Atlantis</a>, mission <a href="../../../s/t/s/STS-43_4fb4.html" title="STS-43">STS-43</a>.

<p>to Marcia Ivins, a shuttle communicator at <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnson_Space_Center_a769.html" title="Johnson Space Center">Johnson Space Center</a>. The AppleLink software was configured with a special Macintosh Communications ToolBox Connection Tool that interfaced to <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a>'s communication system which allowed the Shuttle to call up GEIS' network from space. The Shuttle's e-mail address was secret, but exposed to GEIS' e-mail network as any other AppleLink address. To avoid a deluge of incoming mail resulting from the publicity of the event, Apple set up a number of obvious "<a href="../../../h/o/n/Honeypot.html" title="Honeypot">honeypot</a>" addresses not really used by the Shuttle crew, such as STS43@APPLELINK. Most of the well-wishers' e-mail went there, rather than to the real Atlantis address. <a name="Demise" id="Demise"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/AppleLink_ec89.html" title="Edit section: Demise">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Demise</span></h2>
<p>Quantum retained rights to the AppleLink Personal Edition software, and released a version for both the Mac and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> machines in 1989, calling the new service <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_Online_d3b0.html" title="America Online">America Online</a> as Apple owned the AppleLink name. In 1991 the service had grown substantially, and the company was renamed as America Online Inc. Interestingly, the original AOL Macintosh software still retained within it vestiges of its GEIS/AppleLink heritage. It was not lost on GEIS engineers that it included a version of their proprietary EF3 protocol which was never Apple's intellectual property to share with Quantum. It was handed over anyway as part of the Macintosh source code, thanks to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sculley_f0ab.html" title="John Sculley">John Sculley</a>, Apple's CEO at the time. Although no legal action was ever pursued, this further soured the technical relationship between GEIS and Apple in the final years of AppleLink, especially since by then AOL was competing with GEIS own consumer service, <a href="../../../g/e/n/GEnie_e7c7.html" title="GEnie">GEnie</a>. As a result, when GEIS developed the improved EFX and upgraded AppleLink, it never released source-code to Apple, supplying only a copyrighted code-resource for the protocol.</p>
<p>Apple, encouraged by AOL's success and still wanting to turn the cost of AppleLink into a profit center, decided to re-enter the market. After a months-long <a href="../../../r/e/q/Request_for_Proposal_eb66.html" title="Request for Proposal">RFP</a> process that included GEIS as an unsuccessful bidder, Apple approached AOL at the end of 1992 to host a private-label system known as <a href="../../../e/w/o/EWorld_17b8.html" title="EWorld">eWorld</a>. By this time AOL had grown to be both much larger than GEIS, so all AppleLink content was to be moved over as well, allowing the GEIS service to be shut down. The eWorld software was basically a version of the original AOL software with custom graphics, giving it a distinctive look. The system was ready for launch in mid-1994.</p>
<p>However by this point the rapid rise of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> was generally killing off all smaller <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_service.html" title="Online service">online services</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulletin_board_system.html" title="Bulletin board system">BBSes</a>, and online systems were generally seen as antiquated. Apple was never able to turn a profit on eWorld, and shut it down after a little over a year of operation, before it was able to supplant AppleLink. Subsequently Apple moved all of its services and replaced all of the AppleLink content with websites, such as <a href="http://www.apple.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">apple.com</a>. The AppleLink service was finally shut down at the end of March 1997.</p>
<p>AppleLink's server machines (not the GEIS mainframes) were named for various famous musical composers: <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_van_Beethoven_69c9.html" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Copland_c134.html" title="Aaron Copland">Copland</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">Lennon</a>, etc.</p>
