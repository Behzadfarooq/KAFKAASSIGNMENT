<p>Appleby has identified five Pillars of Strength upon which to concentrate: Community Spirited, Technologically Innovative, Academically Vital, Globally Inquisitive, and Actively Engaged. Appleby students and faculty use technology in virtually every aspect of student life (currently IBM X41 Tablets and SMART Boards). Appleby was the 2nd school in North America to fully utilize laptops and other technology in every angle of the school, after <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Country_Day_School_43e7.html" title="Cincinnati Country Day School">Cincinnati Country Day School</a>. Each boarding room and classroom is equipped with internet ports and power outlets. A large portion of the assignments are done on the computer and subsequently emailed to the teacher.</p>
<p><a name="Campus" id="Campus"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Appleby_College_41d9.html" title="Edit section: Campus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Campus</span></h2>
<p>The school has spacious grounds with a main classroom building, dining hall, arena, five playing fields (one football size), three tennis courts, three squash courts, a gynmasium, a 20m swimming pool, four boarding houses and the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> John Bell Memorial Chapel, designed in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Abbey_ded8.html" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster</a> style.

As well, the south boundary of the campus runs along the shores of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Ontario_d812.html" title="Lake Ontario">Lake Ontario</a>, and a creek runs through the west side of campus, bordered by playing fields and the Appleby College forest.</p>

<p><a name="Boarding" id="Boarding"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Appleby_College_41d9.html" title="Edit section: Boarding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Boarding</span></h2>
<p>As well as being a day school, boarding is offered from Grades 9 though 12 and there are numerous international students from over 20 countries attending Appleby. When the school first opened in 1911, boarding was mandatory. Over time as the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Toronto_Area_aadf.html" title="Greater Toronto Area">Greater Toronto Area</a> grew, Appleby became less of a "school in the country" as originally envisioned by John Guest, and more of a mixed day and boarding school in the suburbs. Fewer than half of students now board. However, in keeping with a tradition that has been maintained since 1911, all students in their "Senior Two" (Grade 12) are required to go into residence. Approximately 240 students are currently in residence, the majority of whom are in Senior Two.</p>
<p>There are four houses in which Appleby's boarding students reside, and with which the day students are affiliated: Baillie House; Walker House; Colley House; and Powell's House. Baillie House is a girls' residence and named after a prominent family that has attended and supported Appleby for several generations. Walker House was one of three boys' residences before co-education and is now a girls' residence, and is named for the school's original benefactor, <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byron_Edmund_Walker_1275.html" title="Byron Edmund Walker">Sir Byron Edmund Walker</a>. Colley and Powell's are boys' residences and are named for former Appleby Masters. T.B. Colley taught at Appleby for 35 years and was housemaster of School House, which was re-named in his honour in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>. Vernon Powell received the Military Cross and was killed in action during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>.</p>
<p>Students are assigned affiliation with a boarding house in the third term of Middle Two (grade 8) or prior to entry into Upper One (grade 9). Membership of the houses can be distinguished by house ties, which depict the house colours and are worn by students as an optional substitute for the school tie. Each house is represented by an animal that is displayed prominently by a large mural in each of the houses. Baillie House is represented by a tiger, Colley House by a bulldog, Powell's House by a lion, and Walker House is represented by a grizzly bear.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Appleby_College_41d9.html" title="Edit section: Sports">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sports</span></h2>
<p>In addition to co-curricular activities and Northward Bound, each Appleby student is required to participate in the school's athletic program. Grade nines and tens (Upper Ones and Twos) must have three full terms of sport, and grade elevens and twelves (Senior Ones and Twos) must have two (the other term must be spent doing community service or engaging in a full-time arts activity).</p>
<p>Interscholastic competition is offered in soccer, field hockey, swimming, basketball, hockey, tennis and rugby, among others. Ironically, two of the longest standing and formerly most prominent Appleby team sports are no longer offered. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">Cricket</a> was played since the school opened, and was discontinued in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>. There was a movement within the student body to re-instate cricket as an instructional sport in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> year. <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_e188.html" title="Canadian Football">Football</a> was also played since early in the school's history, and was discontinued in 2005. Appleby's greatest period of success in football was during the 1960s when the first team achieved a string of almost unbroken winning seasons. The best seasons were <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> when the team went undefeated in inter-scholstic play. The success of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> team, in particular, who defeated not only Appleby's Old Boys in an exhibition game, but each of the first teams of the "Little Big Four" schools, <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Canada_College_6480.html" title="Upper Canada College">Upper Canada College</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Andrew%27s_College_%28Aurora%2C_Ontario%29_952e.html" title="St. Andrew's College (Aurora, Ontario)">St. Andrew's College</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridley_College_65bf.html" title="Ridley College">Ridley College</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_College_School_824d.html" title="Trinity College School">Trinity College School</a>, led to Appleby joining the <a href="../../../c/i/s/CISAA_1fe9.html" title="CISAA">CISAA</a>, where all of Appleby's different sports teams have competed since.</p>
<p>David Smith coached the first football team from <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. He was himself a former Appleby student and taught English and coached football at Appleby for a total of 34 years, retiring as a teacher in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>. Mr. Smith died in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
<p>Appleby's first football team achieved its next and last undefeated season in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, under the coaching of alumnus Dave Singer. This was the school's only CISAA championship for first team football. The school had also fielded strong teams in the early 1980s, when former CFL star <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Fairholm_d948.html" title="Jeff Fairholm">Jeff Fairholm</a> played.</p>
<p>With the switch to a four-year high school program in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, Appleby struggled to field competitive football teams, eventually withdrawing from CISAA competition, and then discontinuing football altogether.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">Soccer</a> remains a popular fall sport for boys and girls. The boys first soccer team has also enjoyed considerable success in CISAA competition, winning consecutive CISAA championships in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> under coach Colin Revill. Under the coaching of Tosh MacFarlane Appleby again won the CISAA championship in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> and then three straight championships between <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>.</p>
<p>Appleby enjoyed tremendous success in <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming.html" title="Swimming">swimming</a> in the 1970s winning 4 out of a possible 5 CISAA first team championships between <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> under coach and long time Appleby geography teacher John Berriman. The swim team was also extremely successful more recently winning the CISAA co-ed championships each year between <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, as well as <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, under coach Sheila Kuyper and Brooke Millman.</p>
<p>During the late 1970s Appleby also won a number of championships for first team <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squash_%28sport%29.html" title="Squash (sport)">squash</a>, coached by the late Ned Larsen, Appleby's fourth headmaster.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">Rugby</a> has been a prominent spring sport since the early 1970s, and continues to be popular for both boys and girls. The school's period of greatest success for rugby was under the coaching of former physics teacher Jim Washington, who coached the first rugby team from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, achieving a winning record every season during that period. The years between <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> were particularly dominant, with the first team going undefeated almost every year and winning 11 out of 13 CISAA championships. More recently, the first boy's team won the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> Canadian Association of Independent Schools tournament held at <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop%27s_College_School_1f65.html" title="Bishop's College School">Bishop's College School</a> in Lennoxville Quebec.</p>
