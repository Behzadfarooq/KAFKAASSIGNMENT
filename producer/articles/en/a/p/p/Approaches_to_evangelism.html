<p>Open-air preaching is an approach to evangelism characterized by speaking in public places out in the open, generally to crowds of people at a time, using a message, sermon, or speech which spreads the gospel.</p>
<p>One of the earliest open-air preachers of Christianity, according to the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospels.html" title="Gospels">Gospels</a>, was <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a>, who's first specifically recorded sermon was the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>,<sup id="_ref-Spurgeon_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spurgeon" title="">[1]</a></sup> which took place on a mountainside in the open air.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> In the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">Gospel of Luke</a> 6:17-49, it was recorded that Jesus also gave an open-air sermon known as the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Plain_b484.html" title="Sermon on the Plain">Sermon on the Plain</a>. <sup id="_ref-Spurgeon_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spurgeon" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Jesus's death, many of his <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostles.html" title="Apostles">Apostles</a> and followers open-air preached the Gospel in the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_in_Jerusalem_e1a8.html" title="Temple in Jerusalem">Temple of Jerusalem</a> or in other open spaces. <sup id="_ref-Spurgeon_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spurgeon" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the time period where the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> took place, open-air preaching was often employed by <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestants.html" title="Protestants">Protestants</a> who could not always preach inside churches, which were mostly <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a>. Open-air preaching in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> continued during the rise of <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puritanism.html" title="Puritanism">Puritanism</a>, and later several famous evangelists such as the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodists.html" title="Methodists">Methodists</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Whitfield_d902.html" title="George Whitfield">George Whitfield</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wesley_f66e.html" title="John Wesley">John Wesley</a> preached open-air sermons in England, and later in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>.<sup id="_ref-Spurgeon_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spurgeon" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the time period of the late 1800's and early to mid 1900's many famous open-air preachers in the United States began to preach, such as <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Sunday_7377.html" title="Billy Sunday">Billy Sunday</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Graham_526a.html" title="Billy Graham">Billy Graham</a>. Graham in particular used a combination of open-air preaching and the recent advent of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Televangelism.html" title="Televangelism">televangelism</a> to broadcast his sermons, which often took place in large venues such as stadiums, to large portions of the world and millions of Americans.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Supporters of this approach note that both <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> and many of the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> prophets often preached about <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> in public places.<sup id="_ref-Spurgeon_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spurgeon" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Spurgeon_4e47.html" title="Charles Spurgeon">Charles Spurgeon</a>, the famous open-air Baptist preacher of England, believed that open-air preaching was instrumental in getting people to hear the Gospel who might otherwise never hear it,<sup id="_ref-Spurgeon_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spurgeon" title="">[1]</a></sup> and many open-air preachers today believe that it reaches many more people at once than other approaches to evanglism do.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> Charles Spurgeon recommends several things for open-air preachers, such as never trying to speak into the wind, trying to speak away from the wind so one's voice will carry farther, (sometimes up to half a mile by Spurgeon's account) keeping sermons concise instead of overly verbose and complicated, use illustrations and anecdotes to keep the crowd interested, and to not speak at the very top of your voice so you don't wear yourself out too quickly.<sup id="_ref-Spurgeon_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spurgeon" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Trickle-down Evangelism is an approach to evangelism primarily concerned with converting high ranking members of a society, so that their influence can serve to help spread Christianity throughout the society in question. It was practiced especially often during the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_ages.html" title="Middle ages">Middle ages</a>.</p>
<p>Trickle-down Evangelism was practiced throughout China multiple times during the Middle ages, with examples such as converted or sympathetic officials helping the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuits.html" title="Jesuits">Jesuits</a> or other parts of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> church spread,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup> or the expedition of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marco_Polo_5cb9.html" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a> resulting in the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongol.html" title="Mongol">Mongol</a> ruler of China <a href="../../../k/u/b/Kublai_Khan_ab79.html" title="Kublai Khan">Kublai Khan</a> inviting the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> to send "teachers of science and religion" to China.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Trickle-down Evangelism was also applied many times in European areas, such as the northern <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> area, as the church tried to send missionaries into the area.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Door to Door preaching is an approach to evangelism where a Christian will go from household to household in a certain area to evangelize to residents, often in conjunction with passing out <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_tracts.html" title="Gospel tracts">gospel tracts</a>.</p>
<p>Groups such as the <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup> and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormons.html" title="Mormons">Mormons</a> are famous for spreading their message by direct preaching to the public at their homes, which Jehovah's Witnesses in particular believe to be obligatory, Though other groups often do it as well in a more limited capacity.</p>

<p>Many churches regularly have a <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">gospel</a> message preached in a sermon. Often, this will include an <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar_call.html" title="Altar call">altar call</a> where people are invited to come forward and "accept Christ". The use of altar calls is somewhat controversial, while it is practiced by many <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelical.html" title="Evangelical">Evangelical</a> churches, some <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvanist.html" title="Calvanist">Calvanists</a> object to it in the grounds it creates false conversions.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>An apparent weakness of this approach to evangelism is that there is no opportunity for the speaker to prove that their faith is authentic and that they practice what they preach.</p>

<p><a href="../../../l/i/f/Lifestyle_evangelism.html" title="Lifestyle evangelism">Lifestyle evangelism</a> is an approach to evangelism characterized by someone demonstrating their faith by their actions in the hope that people around them will be impressed with how God affects that person's life, and become a Christian. Supporters often cite <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:16&amp;version=31" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:16&amp;version=31" rel="nofollow">Matthew 5:16</a> as a proof verse.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[12]</a></sup> Supporters also often point out that Jesus drew people to God by showing them kindness and performing good deeds, while detractors sometimes note that people may not realize one's good behavior is due to Christianity. Supporters of using primarily this method claim this is more effective than direct evangelism because of the perception that it is harder to live 'righteously' than preach a sermon. Detractors sometimes note that this approach to evangelism might not be be convincing if others don't know that the evangelist's change in lifestyle is due to being a Christian</p>

<p>Similar to lifestyle evangelism, friendship evangelism is an approach to evangelism characterized by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christians.html" title="Christians">Christians</a> developing relationships with people in order to show them kindness and talk to them about God eventually. Supporters sometimes say that <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> related to those who took an interest in him as friends. This approach can sometimes been known as "loving someone into the kingdom." Detractors note that it is sometimes a slow way to present the gospel to someone as it can take a long time to build a friendship, and may backfire if one becomes too scared of losing their friend if the gospel offends them.</p>

This sometimes takes the form of random phone calls,<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[20]</a></sup> or is done after someone contacts the evangelist to recommend people whom a person may want the evangelist to evangelize to. <a href="../../../w/a/y/Way_of_the_Master_44ec.html" title="Way of the Master">Way of the Master</a> radio hosts <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk_Cameron_9568.html" title="Kirk Cameron">Kirk Cameron</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Comfort_97d4.html" title="Ray Comfort">Ray Comfort</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Friel_39c3.html" title="Todd Friel">Todd Friel</a>, who practice this form of evangelism on their radio show, refer to it as 'phone fishing'.</p>

<p>A method employed mainly by charismatic Christians. This is where (as its practitioners believe) God speaks through a Christian to a non-believer to say something that will prompt that person to seek God. On most occasions it is something that the speaker could not have known naturally; for example, someone who is having a secret affair may be told that God knows they are doing wrong and wants them to change their ways.</p>
<p>However, some critics of this approach note that other religions appear to use a similar method to spread their faith. .</p>

<p><b>Servant evangelism</b> is a simple, straightforward approach to sharing God’s love in simple, practical ways. In 1984, founding pastor <a href="http://www.stevesjogren.com" class="external text" title="http://www.stevesjogren.com" rel="nofollow">Steve Sjogren</a> and several people from the Vineyard Community Church loaded up bags of groceries and bought Christmas trees and took them to housing projects on the north side of Cincinnati. Out of this action was born a vision to reach the city of Cincinnati and the world by <a href="http://www.servantevangelism.com" class="external text" title="http://www.servantevangelism.com" rel="nofollow">serving others with no strings attached</a>.</p>

<p>While there are individuals and churches which may employ only one method, there are others who make use of some or all of the above approaches. These churches and individuals reason that the approach(es) used must depend on the situation.</p>
