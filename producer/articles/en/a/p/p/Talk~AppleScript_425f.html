<p>"It is arguable that the main reason that the Mac remained a powerhouse in the publishing market after Quark (and other applications) were ported to Microsoft Windows, was that Mac users could automate complex workflows."

<p>Even as a confirmed Macophile, I think it's a bit much to describe AppleScript as a "programming language," especially since the same description isn't applied here to <a href="../../../j/a/v/JavaScript_6861.html" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perl.html" title="Perl">Perl</a>. - <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHephaestos_c32a.html" title="User:Hephaestos">Hephaestos</a> 04:45 Mar 1, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've moved it back to where it belongs. Some time ago, someone decided for mysterious reasons to rename all the articles about programming languages in the form "X programming language", even though the only sensible reason to use such names was as a disambiguator for things like "C" or "Pascal" whose names are not unambiguous by themselves. As you come across any that have not yet been put back, please rename them or, if there are problems with split page histories, give a shout out at the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">pump</a>. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 04:49 Mar 1, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p><strike>Um, the above discussion seems to imply that the form 'X programming language' was corrected in March of 2003, but in fact it is now August of 2004, and the article's name is 'AppleScript programming language.' I would like to correct this myself to simply 'AppleScript,' but I don't know how, (I understand about the 'move' tab, but I'm uncertain because of all the warnings about links changing).</strike> <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmN_03f2.html" title="User:AdmN">AdmN</a> 16:37, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>"In Mac OS X AppleScript is simpler for developers to implement, particularly for those applications being developed in Cocoa."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Simpler than what? Cocoa? I'm confused. If it's simpler than Cocoa, then why then does the rest of the paragraph address how versatile and good Cocoa is? (I'm going to read about what "Cocoa" is in a moment, but I know it is some kind of Mac-based Obj-C variant.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Presumably means simpler than in OS9. It's still misleading though. What it should really say is that scripting support is easier to implement in Cocoa-based applications than Carbon/Classic ones: a lot of the code for processing Apple events is built into the AppKit framework, so developers have to provide less code themselves.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>"Unlike the Mac OS where events are handled by the applications, under Cocoa, events are decoded into a "high level" command by the NSApplication object, and the messages dispatched directly to the correct object. That is, all Cocoa applications are "factored" by default; the developer doesn't write any of the event handling code (normally) and writes only the "work methods" that those events will call. Another major advantage is that Cocoa objects are presented to the outside world (other applications and even machines) in a standardized format that anyone can examine directly."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Shouldn't this be in the wiki article on Cocoa? Does writting an application in Cocoa make it easier to then write a script in AppleScript that "hooks into" that application? That is not quite clear to me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Quite possibly. 2. No, the only advantage to users is that Cocoa-based apps tend to be a bit more consistent in how they behave compared to Carbon apps since more of the underlying mechanisms are the same from app to app.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>"Under Cocoa AppleScript is much "thinner"; the script engine decodes the script, translates object names from human-readable to their internal format, and then calls those methods on the target application directly."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is "Cocoa AppleScript" the name of some kind of hybrid language, or is there a comma missing? And is this saying that when I use AppleScript to address applications written in Cocoa (as opposed to... Java or C++&#160;?) then my script will run faster? What does "thinner" mean?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Missing comma. And it's wrongly confusing AppleScript, which is a client language, with Cocoa Scripting, which is the part of AppKit that provides its scripting support. The way AppleScript works hasn't changed since OS9, and it certainly doesn't "call methods on the target application directly"; it sends Apple events to the target application just as before. What's new in OS X is the way that AEs are interpreted in Cocoa apps. Carbon developers have to write quite a bit of glue code to connect their Apple event handlers to their application's Model layer. Thanks to ObjC's highly dynamic nature, Cocoa Scripting can use advanced features like key-value coding to look up a lot of stuff automatically; all the developer has to do is annotate the application's scripting definition (dictionary) with the names of the accessor methods/attributes to use, no coding required. I assume that's what the original author was getting confused about.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I'm just starting out, and I'm sure when I hunt deeper I will find the answers to all of these questions, but it might be confusing to other neophytes. --128.237.234.9 15:37, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't feel too bad about confusing folk: a lot of the article is very ropey and some parts are just outright wrong, so addressing the problems you've found so far can only improve it even if more work is needed later. It would make sense to eventually move most/all of the discussion on how application scripting support is actually implemented to Apple event, Apple Event Object Model, Cocoa Scripting and/or Cocoa articles, and focus this article on just the AppleScript language and the general principles involved in application scripting. That'd help eliminate at least some of the current confusion by reducing the number of different topics being discussed here.--Hhas 15:57, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Talk%7EAppleScript_425f.html" title="Edit section: Article Problems">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Article Problems</span></h2>
<p>This article contains multiple errors, omissions, misconceptions, etc. It'd take some time to go through them all, so for now here's one example of the sort of fundamental inaccuracy that needs to be dealt with:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Note the similarities between the AEOM model and the considerably more recent DOM system used in XML. Both decompose a document into a hierarchy of objects, and offer the programmer a standardized iterative method to access the contents. Differences between the systems lie primarily in the user-level syntax"</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is both misleading and wrong. There are major differences between AEOM and DOM. AEOM operates at a much higher level of abstraction: DOM is a simple object-oriented API; AEOM is a <i>query-driven</i> View-Controller layer that sits above an application's object-oriented Model layer, rather like how XPath sits atop DOM. "User-level syntax" is irrelevant, since the Apple Event Manager is a programmatic API; whatever user-level syntax AppleScript, Mac::Glue, etc. want to spread on top of that is entirely up to them. (Current high-level bridges all happen to use an OO-like syntax, which is probably one of the reasons a lot of observers mistakenly think AEOM is 'just another DOM'.)</p>
<p>The following comparative example from the article reinforces this basic misunderstanding of how the AEOM works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of an <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Object (computer science)">object</a> <a href="../../../h/i/e/Hierarchy.html" title="Hierarchy">hierarchy</a> can also be expressed using nested <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prepositional_phrase.html" title="Prepositional phrase">prepositional phrases</a>:</p>
<pre>
  pixel 7 of row 3 of TIFF image "my bitmap"
</pre>
<p>which in another <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programming_language.html" title="Programming language">programming language</a> might be expressed as sequential <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subroutine.html" title="Subroutine">function calls</a>:</p>
<pre>
  getTIFF("my bitmap").getRow(3).getPixel(7);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Object specifiers (the 'pixel 7', 'row 3', etc.) are not comparable to accessor methods. On the client side, what you're doing is constructing a single, first-class query object that will eventually be packed into an Apple event and sent to the application to interpret, not invoking a bunch of accessor methods as the second code segment implies. AppleScript may use an OO-like syntax for constructing these queries, but it's completely wrong (if a very common mistake) to assume, based on appearance, that it must also follow OO rules and behaviour.</p>
<p>In another language, the above 'reference' (i.e. query) would be expressed, sans syntactic sugar, as something like:</p>
<pre>
q = Query().elementByName('TIFF image', 'my bitmap').elementByIndex('row', 3).elementByIndex('pixel', 7)
print q 
# &lt;AEBridge::Query 0x16c71b4&gt;
</pre>
<p>To actually get the referenced object/value, you'd then need to construct and send a 'get' event containing that query as its direct parameter:</p>
<pre>
q = Query().elementByName('TIFF image', 'my bitmap').elementByIndex('row', 3).elementByIndex('pixel', 7)
result = Application('My Graphics App').send('get', q)
</pre>
<p>For usability's sake, properly designed high-level bridges like to hide a lot of this pedantry beneath a more concise, easier-to-read syntax, e.g.:</p>
<pre>
q = app('My Graphics App').TIFF_images['my bitmap'].rows[3].elements[7]
result = q.get()
</pre>
<p>but underneath this surface everything is being translated to queries as before. It's a bit like how object-relational mappers provide an OO-like interface to relational databases.</p>
<p>Anyone planning to work on this article should read the following paper by two of the original Apple engineers first: <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/wcook/papers/AppleScript/AppleScript95.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/wcook/papers/AppleScript/AppleScript95.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Open Scripting Architecture: Automating, Integrating, and Customizing Applications</a> (Cook &amp; Harris, 1993; PDF). While it predates newer additions like Cocoa Scripting, it's the best explanation the underlying concepts and principles, as well as the original technologies involved, that I'm aware of. --Hhas 15:57, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
