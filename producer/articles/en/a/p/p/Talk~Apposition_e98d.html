<p>The problem is that both are different by their very nature. Merging the two would create more confusion because an appositive is a noun phrase and has nothing to do with Apposition which deals with titles and/or names only. Grammatically the two can be similar, but in cases where one uses both, it can be a nightmare when placing commas. The only way apposition should only be shown with appositives is as a warning such as "sometimes confused with." To most people, this is not a big deal, but it is grammatically important.

<p>The former witty examples illustrating <b>Appositive</b> built into an outstanding Wikipedia entry were not humorless and "encyclopedic" enough to satisfy <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurschik_570f.html" title="User:Burschik">User:Burschik</a>, who suppressed the whole and substituted the current leaden and pedestrian effort, with its "Dick and Jane" numbered examples. The former entry, in its entirety, read:</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammar.html" title="Grammar">grammar</a>, an <b>appositive</b>, <i>a useful dependent noun or phrase or full clause such as this one,</i> offers clarification or additional explanation in a condensed format. An appositive follows the word it explains, offset by commas. One 'way to identify an appositive is to ask the question: could this phrase replace the word next to it? Does this phrase make the word next to it all but unnecessary?</p>
<p>In this Wikipedia entry, the use of appositives and appositive phrases, <i>grammatical devices so handy that their overuse is tempting,</i> are identified by italics.</p>
<p>An appositive, <i>grammatically incomplete,</i> is always set off by commas, <i>a reader-friendly invention,</i> with one exception: <small>LAPIDARY INSCRIPTIONS CHISELLED INTO STONE</small>. If you do not have a chisel in your hand, you <b>must</b> set off an appositive with commas, though at the beginning or end of the sentence only one comma is required.<br /></p>
<p>As for commas, ancient Romans scarcely knew the period at the end of a sentence.</p>
<dl>
<dd><small>ADDITIONALLYTHEYRANTHEIRWORDSTOGETHERLIKETHIS<i>APRACTISENOTTOBEIMITATED</i></small></dd>

<p>Not all phrases set off by commas are appositives. Some appositives are so brief— and sometimes so inevitable— that they are <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epithet.html" title="Epithet">epithets</a>: <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, <i>the Macedonian conqueror of Persia,</i> comes to mind. But <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlemagne.html" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, <i>"Charles the Great",</i> has absorbed his epithet into his very name, much like his 9th-century contemporary <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haroun_al-Rashid_82c7.html" title="Haroun al-Rashid">Haroun al-Rashid</a>, <i>the caliph at Baghdad</i>. Arabic personal names, daunting to the Anglophone eye,* if such <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphor.html" title="Metaphor">metaphors</a> may be mixed, combine a series of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patronymic.html" title="Patronymic">patronymics</a> with an epithet or two, set "in apposition," <i>a phrase not to confuse with "opposition."</i>.</p>
<p>* a gerund phrase placed in apposition</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>I don't think the chiseling conceit was relevant or appropriate. Just say "An appositive must be set off by commas." The chiseling thing isn't a grammatical exception, so forget about it.</p>

<li>I believe that Burschik's version is preferable for Wikipedia. The previous version is clever, and humorous when you think it over, but it is not sufficiently clear for an encyclopedia. I surfed to this page and had no idea what an appositive was 5 mins ago. I read the original text first, then Burschik's version. The latter made it far clearer to me what an appositive is, in a simple, straight-forward, efficient manner. That is what an encyclopedia should do.

<p>I had an issue with one of the perspectives of the paper. I'd like to get a few opinions on this, as I'm neither a grammarian nor a linguist.</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm not sure that apposition is a literary device. It's a grammatical construct of placing two noun phrases next to one another, written with an appositive. Is it really in the same ranks with deceit and foreshadow? Further, the article <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_technique.html" title="Literary technique">literary technique</a> doesn't even mention apposition.</li>
<li>You could argue that hyperbations can use appositives, but many hyperbations dont use appositives and most appositives are not hyberbations. Are the two really that closely related?</li>
</ol>
<p>What are your opinions? - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 03:48, 21 January 2007 (UTC) (revised 06:01, 31 January 2007 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agree on both points. It's first and foremost a straightforward element of grammar. Nothing to do with specific literary style and techniques. The intro and main outline should be reworked to present it as a grammatical feature, and then at best a paragraph or section outlining its role in rhetorics/stylistics/whatever. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 06:28, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Can you do apposition without using an appositive? The intro seems to suggest so, but I can't come up with an example. I like grammar, so my biased view is that this article should be at <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appositive.html" title="Appositive">Appositive</a>; the changes you mention would be appropriate for such a move. However, the opposite action is what was done (<a href="../../../a/p/p/Appositive.html" title="Appositive">Appositive</a>-&gt;<a href="../../../a/p/p/Apposition.html" title="Apposition">Apposition</a>, according to the page history), so I'm trying to find out the motives behind that merge. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 17:33, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now that you mention it, these two sentences make no sense to me either: <i>"The placing of two nouns in apposition is called an appositive. Appositives are by far the most common form of apposition."</i> First, "the placing of" the nouns is exactly what the "apposition" itself is; on that definition "apposition" and "appositive" would seem to be exactly the same thing. And then, as you notice, an "apposition" without "appositives" doesn't really make sense - either the two terms denote the same anyway, or the second denotes an essential component of the first. I wasn't exactly familiar with a formal definition of "appositive", but the usage I looked up in Quirk et al's Comprehensive Grammar of English is: "apposition" is the grammatical construction as a whole, i.e. the relation of the noun phrases among each other; an "appositive" is a component of apposition, i.e. either of the two noun phrases that stand in apposition. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 22:43, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My sources (which I can cite if desired) do not say that an appositive is a <b>kind</b> of apposition; rather they say that the <i>appositive</i> is an integral <b>part</b> of an apposition, specifically the limiting, commenting, or explaining part (my wording), although at least one source says that both parts are <i>appositions</i>. The apposition itself is a relationship or structure containing two parts.<br />
Since the appositive is the contained part, it is properly discussed in an article on apposition (the containing structure). (By analogy <i>articles</i> may properly be discussed in a treetment on <i>noun phrases</i>, it makes less sense to me to put the analysis of noun phrases in a discussion on articles.)<br />
I agree that apposition is first and foremost a grammatical structure, although like any structure it may have rhetorical uses.

It seems to that one is the concept and the other is the implementation in grammar. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 23:21, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some sources difine <i>apposition</i> as the relation (sounds like your "concept"?) betwee two or more elements; some define it as the sequence (sounds like "structure" to me) of two or mor elements. The criteria given are: 1) the two elements be coreferential; 2) both elements have the same relationship to the rest of the sentence or containing structure; 3) either of the elements may be deleted and leave a coherant grammatical structure (if the relationship/structure is restrictive, the scope of the reference will expand or shrink; if if non-restrictive, the reference [tho not the denotation] should remain unchanged). I see no way for an apposition to lack an appositive (The idea sounds like a self-contradiction). Here is the short pair of entries from <i>A Glossary of Grammar and Linguistics</i> by Andrew MacLesh:
<ul>
<li><b>apposition</b>. Two constructions or words that are next to each other and refer to the same thing. <i><u>Our teacher, Mr. Smith,</u> is a good one.</i></li>
<li><b>appositive</b>. The second of two words or constructions in apposition is usually called the appositive. In the example above, <i>Mr. Smith</i>, is the appositive.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The entire sequence <i>Our teacher, Mr. Smith,</i> is the apposition, but the copular relationship between <i>our teacher</i> and <i>Mr. Smith</i> is also called an apposition. The main problem with MacLeish's definition is that it is very oversimplified, especially in that:
<ol>
<li>His sole example is non-restrictive. He doesn't mention the restrictive cases (such as, <i>my friend John</i>), or the differences between them.</li>
<li>The appositive, apparently, does not <b>have to be</b> the second element; relatively infrequently, it is preposed. (If the apposition is non-restricive, it is marked by a comma or tonal juncture.)</li>
<li>The two elements do not have to be strictly adjacent. Again infrequently, the appositive may be extraposed.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I receintly translated this article for the Esperanto Wikipedia, and have since slowly been correcting and ellaborating it there. In preparation I completely copied the entries on <i>apposition</i> and <i>appositive</i> from some seventeen dictionaries (mostly grammatical and linguistic) into a rft file translating them into Esperanto as I went. I have also ordered several more to do the same with them. The Esperanto article is going into much greater depth. I am finding examples from the Esperanto literature for this. (Over the last few years I have collected around 80 megabytes of Esperanto literary text as my corpus.) So far I am about half way through the restrictives, and have not really gotten into the non-restrictives yet.</dd>
<dd>The various sources are not fully concsistant; David Crystal says in <i>A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics, 4th ed.</i>, that there exist, however, many theoretical and methodological problems in the definition of the notion "apposition", because of the existance of several constructions which obey only some of the criteria, and where either semantic or syntactic problems are involved, as in titles and other designations (the number six, my friend John).</dd>
<dd>One stinker confusing the issue is that some languages (I think French is one) use a word which looks like <i>apposition</i> to mean what we refer to by <i>appositive</i>. They seem to lack a word looking like <i>appositive</i> and lack a single term for what we refer to by <i>apposition</i>. <i><a href="../../../o/r/y/User%7EOryanw_23db.html" title="User:Oryanw">O'RyanW</a></i> (<a href="../../../o/r/y/User_talk%7EOryanw_e4ac.html" title="User talk:Oryanw">☺</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Oryanw_d517.html" title="Special:Contributions/Oryanw">₪</a>) 01:52, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Excellent explanation. I appreciate it. I looked up what I could and could not find the distinction. Now, we should incorporate your points into the article, as I feel the <i>talk</i> page is more helpful than the article!&#160;:) - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 02:43, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Most sources are careful to say two elements, pointing out that they are often noun phrases, but need not be. Ralph M. Albaugh in his <i>A Dictionary of Grammar and Structure</i> gives the following non-noun-phrase examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjectival. <i>Sweet, or unsalted, butter is sold in that area.</i>; <i>An adjective modifies (clarifys, limits, explains) a noun.</i></li>
<li>Adverbial. <i>He got up early — at half past five — and went outside.</i></li>
<li>Partly clausal. <i>Morton's hobby, bulding model airplanes, kept him occupied.</i></li>

<dd>Great examples. I (or whoever) will incorporate these examples into the article, as I think they are important. Your third example uses a gerund, which is also a noun phrase, no? - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 02:45, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On second thought, does the first one count as apposition, since it incorporates a conjunction? - 02:47, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, the above three example are not mine, but Albaugh's.</dd>
<dd>Good point and questions! It certainly looks like a conjunction, and until a month ago I probably would have said <i>conjunction</i>, but note:
<ul>
<li>With the proper intonation, and replacing the word <i>or</i> with a longer pause, one gets what more clearly looks like an apposition/appositive: <i>Sweet — unsalted — butter is sold ...</i>. The word <i>or</i> seems (to me) to be functioning as a voiced parenthesis, as the meaning has not changed at all.</li>
<li>The word <i>or</i> here conjoins terms, not referents. Thus it seems (again to me) to be functioning in a somewhat <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metalinguistic.html" title="Metalinguistic">metalinguistic</a> fashion. (I just thought up this consideration, so I am not sure of its sigifigance.) (I linked "metalinguistic", but the article there is not very helpful.) In contrast, your <i>I (or whoever)</i> above cannot, I think, despite the parenthesis, be called and apposition since it presents a disjunction of referents.</li>
<li>There is a class of appositions involving strict identity or equivalance of reference in which the appositive is presented with an expression such as: <i>namely, that is, i.e., aka, otherwise known as, in other words</i>. Katie Wales iin <i>A Dictionary of Stylistics</i> says <i>"Apposition" is often explicitely markes by "connectives", such as "namely", , "that is to say", "or rather", etc, especially in registers where expliciteness and clarity are important (e.g. scientific articles, official reports). In</i> Plena Analiza Gramatiko de Esperanto <i>by Kalocsay and Waringhien it says in section 131 that the conjunction</i> or <i>is also part of this group. On reflection, I think that a strict structuralist approach would say that in this use all these are not adverbs, not prepositions, and not conjunctions, but some as yet unnamed class, which we might call, say,</i> preappositives<i>, or more specifically</i> preequivalants<i>. For some idiolects, perhaps we could add some uses of</i> I mean, you know, and like <i>to this class.&#160;;-)</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>With regard to the gerund, I agree that <i>building model airplains</i> is also a noun phrase, or at least functions as one. Furthermore, <i>Morton's hobby</i> is itself a noun phrase, which doesn't serve the purpose of the example. <i>The building <u>of</u> model airplains</i> would more clearly be a noun phrase. Less clearly noun phrases, but still functioning as such are the complement clauses in:
<ul>
<li><i>The submariners' attempt to stop the leak was doomed.&#160;:-(</i></li>
<li><i>His knowledge that cosmetics are deceptive did not prevent his arousal.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The last two are my examples; you may use them if you see fit. Albaugh also gives the following two examples of "clauses" and "phrases" used as appositives:
<ul>
<li><i>The idea that justice will triumph underlies the plot.</i></li>
<li><i>He soon forgot his "resolution" to study every night.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I have been mulling on your idea the apposition is a concept which is implemented by an appositive, and that (consequently?) the article would best be labled <i>Appositive</i>. If I now understand this correctly, you might set up the following analogy: Appositives are to appositions as adjectives and adverbs are to modification. That is a nice analogy. I had in mind something more like: Appositive are to appositions as adjectives are to noun phrases, with most appositions being a kind of complex noun phrase themselves. I suspect that neither analogy is wrong, that both are right, and that the word <i>apposition</i> has differing senses, it being just a matter of descriptive style. Note the definition at: <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=apposition" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=apposition" rel="nofollow"><i>Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary</i></a>: 1 a&#160;: a grammatical construction in which two usually adjacent nouns having the same referent stand in the same syntactical relation to the rest of a sentence (as <i>the poet</i> and <i>Burns</i> in <i>a biography of the poet Burns</i>) b&#160;: the relation of one of such a pair of nouns or noun equivalents to the other. See also SIL's <a href="http://www.sil.org/Linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnApposition.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sil.org/Linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnApposition.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>Glossary of Linguistic Terms</i></a>.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, in your favor, I have never seen the word <i>apposition</i> (nor the word <i>appositive</i>) used in a phrase structure rule. I still prefer the article name <i>appositive</i>, but I think i understand the other point of view much better now.

<p>I think that the current third and forth paragraphs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apposition often results when the verbs (particularly verbs of being) in supporting clauses are eliminated to produce shorter descriptive phrases. This makes them often function hyperbatons, or figures of disorder because they can disrupt the flow of a sentence. For example in the phrase: "My wife, a nurse by training,...," it is necessary to pause before the parenthetical modification "a nurse by training."<br />
While apposition is quite common in modern prose, it has been pointed out [2] that it is rarely used in impromptu speech, which tends to make greater use of parenthesis or subordinate clauses. In ordinary speech, the preceding example would more likely be rendered: "my wife, who is a nurse by training,...."</p>
