<p><i>While this is very true, I'd prefer to have an offical summary. Where in Nick.com are you getting that summary?</i></p>
<p>I didn't get the summary, it was already there. You can currently find it, however, but going to the source page quoted in the article, that is: <a href="http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_shows/tv_schedule2k3.jhtml?_requestid=837891" class="external free" title="http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_shows/tv_schedule2k3.jhtml?_requestid=837891" rel="nofollow">http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_shows/tv_schedule2k3.jhtml?_requestid=837891</a></p>
<p>It will come up with a schedule (and some annoying constant noise in the background). Click on "View by Week" in the upper-left corner, then click the "Next Week" tab in the upper-right corner. Scroll down until you can see "Avatar" on 8:00 ET/PT on Friday (not the 6:30 episode). Click "More Information" and then "Episode Description." And there you have it:</p>
<p><i>In this special episode, we go back in time to the moment Appa was stolen, and find out exactly what happened to him, and where's he's been all this time - and where he is now!</i></p>
<p>Sounds made up, but it's there on Nick. --<a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMAJohnson_ed61.html" title="User:DMAJohnson">DMAJohnson</a> 19:54, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow, I never knew you could view by week on the Nick.com schedule, XD. That's a really bad description, but so is the one the TV schedule's are providing now. I'll come up with a better one if it's ok with everyone, I won't have a source though other than somewhere in Nick.com. <a href="../../../d/y/l/User%7EDylan0513_8f4d.html" title="User:Dylan0513">Dylan0513</a> 20:01, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yeah, but you can only view a week in advance, unfortunantly. As for a description, I'd just wait a couple of weeks for the actual episode to air since anything you do now is going to get wiped then anyway once we've seen the whole thing. --<a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMAJohnson_ed61.html" title="User:DMAJohnson">DMAJohnson</a> 03:13, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, I have to ask. WHat happend to all the info has to be varrified? I even posted the sources. So DONT just go and delet stuff. Oh, and the info has to be accurate, not thought up off a current description. SO DONT DELET IT THIS TIME!! ~Sayasha 11:12 pm
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and also, people that post her a lot, know about the Nick.com TV schedule thing. Dont treat us like we are 3 years old, and cant surf the web on our own. ~Sayasha

<p>The link tells me Cave of Two lovers.

<dd>H2P- I didn't get it either at first but you can actually change the week at the Nick.com schedule. Wheather we want to use that summary or not is a different question. <a href="../../../d/y/l/User%7EDylan0513_8f4d.html" title="User:Dylan0513">Dylan0513</a> 12:44, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please stop removing the link to the Nick.com calender. I explain in my first comment how to view the description: You have to click the NEXT WEEK tab. Furthermore, it's not plagerism because we're not claiming it as our own. It's perfectly fair use. If you're uncomfortable with it, then just rephrase it, but <b>leave the link.</b> --<a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMAJohnson_ed61.html" title="User:DMAJohnson">DMAJohnson</a> 14:44, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You can't link to a dead location. If you have to search for the information it's not a sourceable link. I would much rather we simply rewrite our own summary and not bother with a link but provide Nick.com as our source at the bottom of the page. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 19:08, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I took out the line "* In this episode, Ty Lee reacts strangely to Azula's comment to the warriors of Kyoshi about being fangirls. This hints that she could have a thing for <a href="../../../a/a/n/Aang.html" title="Aang">Aang</a>." in the Trivia section. The reason that Ty Lee says, "Fangirls, I get it!" is because The Warriors of Kiyoshi use fans as weapons, and it took her a minute to get the joke. --Ryuko 20:17 13 October 2006</p>

<p>I rewatched the scene (frame by frame) from "The Avatar State". Now that we know what we're looking for, it's fairly obvious that the female Air Nomad Avatar briefly shown has both the tattoo and enough room to have a tattoo. As such I am killing the note that says: "<i>However, the other female airbender, seen in "The Avatar State", had a full head of hair, implying that this may not be a custom practiced by all.</i>" 202.72.187.152 09:06, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm positive that it's Hakoda. I have the episodes on iTunes and when I saw him I went back to Hakoda in Sokka's memory and the two are identical. I'm positive that this is supposed to be Hakoda's first encounter with anything to do with the Avatar.--TPR</p>
<p>YOU being positive means nothing I'm sorry to say.

<p>I'm sorry if you got offended by my choice of words. All I was doing was expressing my certainty, I was not trying to be a jerk and I apologize if that's how I came across. When you look at the two characters though, they are identical apart from their apparel. The change in clothes is to be expected though with respect to location on the world. However, if this is still not enough evidence for certainty, then I would have to agree with Aang-Kai and say that putting it into the trivia section would at least be acceptable. Again, I'm sorry if I came across as offensive.--TPR</p>

<dd>His nose definitely looks the same, his cheeks and eyebrows look different, but not significantly so. Unfortunately he looks so much like Bato. Someone should turn the constrast up on that screenshot from avatarspirit.net 202.72.187.152 16:25, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think one of the things that is adding to the difficulty in being able to completely tell is that the art style changed in season two. I don't know if anybody noticed, but their bodies come to sharper angles and their heads are drawn differnetly. Especially Sokka's. Did anybody notice that? Personally I liked the old art style better. But that's just my opinion.--<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriPredRavage_6f5a.html" title="User:TriPredRavage">TriPredRavage</a> 22:50, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"he stumbles upon an old man who he thinks is Aang" I don't think so. I think Appa thinks that the Guru is just a fully grown Airbender monk on first sight. Agree/disagree? 202.72.187.152 12:46, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd accept that. It seems to be typically that when an animal thinks some one is another person, there is a momentary flash where the animal sees the person they want to see. Appa didn't have one of those flashes, so I'd have to say that I'd agree with you.--TPR</p>

<p>I removed a note that somebody put up: "As one of the Kyoshi warriors comments that Suki was with the Avatar a few days ago this implies either after Suki left Aang's group it took they several days to reach Ba Sing Se, or Azula met Suki after the drill failed to penetrate the wall of Ba Sing Se." I removed it because there is a typo that makes the message very unclear and I disagree with it personally. I don't think it so much took the Avatar a few days to get to Ba Sing Se as it took Suki a few days to get back. (how did she get through Serpent's Pass with out a water bender?) Anyway, if anybody has any thoughts, please by all means.--TPR</p>

<dd>Suki would definitely have taken the <i>boat</i> back. I'm assuming the boat is faster than walking, but it seems fairly obvious that Azula's appearance was after The Drill. 202.72.187.152 14:58, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When exactly was Appa stolen? It has to be before Tales of Ba Sing Se, because in that episode we see the footprint of Appa's, which is made in this episode. So that would mean it is before Tales of Ba Sing Se.</p>
<p>However, it get's more confusing. Long feng has captured Appa correct. But, in City of Walls and Secrets, he is implying he already has Appa, as he commented how that if Aang was expelled fromt he city, he woukd never find Appa. Was this just an empty threat? It doesn't seem like it to me. So that would mean that Appa is captured before Tales of Ba Sing Se and City of Walls and Secrets.</p>
<p>But, more questions are raised, as we clearly see Aang sleeping in Ba Sing Se on some sort of rug or something near the end of the episode. This shows he is in Ba Sing Se. This also means that Appa was caught by Long Feng while Aang was in Ba Sing Se, but it would have to be before his meeting with Long Feng.</p>
<p>So, my question is, did Tales of Ba Sing Se take place in between City of Walls and Secrets? It seems like the only logical explanation...is this correct?</p>
<p>On a side note; Azula made an appearence in this episode, which marks her most current appearence. This would have to take place after the Drill, because we know that days did not take place between the end of Serpents Pass and the beginning of the Drill, unless the Drill took days to cover that small difference, which is unlikey, based off its speed in the episode the Drill.</p>
<p>Since Appa was with Azula at the time, that shows that Aang has been in Ba Sing Se for a few days. What could he be doing? The explanation that I found was Tales took place in between City of Walls and Secrets. So, my explanation is</p>
<p>Aang gang arrives in Ba Sing Se</p>
<p>After finding out it will take a month to find the Earth King, days pass, with Tales of Ba Sing Se occuring</p>
<p>However, before Momo's Tale, Appa arrives in the city, and is captured by Long Feng</p>
<p>Back to City of Walls and Secrets, where the rest of the episode resumes.</p>
<p>Is this correct? (<a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E11987.html" title="User:11987">11987</a> 13:13, 16 October 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dl>
<dd>Disagree. "But, in City of Walls and Secrets, he is implying he already has Appa, as he commented how that if Aang was expelled fromt he city, he woukd never find Appa. Was this just an empty threat?" Long Feng is implying that it will be difficult for Aang to find his bison if he is <i>expelled from the city</i>. There is <b>no</b> error.</dd>
<dd>Also, there can easily be a undocumented (but small) number of days between "City of Walls and Secrets" and "The Tales of Ba Sing Se". It's easiest to assume that Appa was caught either during "The Tales of Ba Sing Se" or the night before. The two epsiodes ARE in chronological order. Don't over-analyse it. 202.72.187.152 16:21, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't know who put that silly trivia point in after this dicussion, when it seems backwards. The most likely order is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aang tells Long Feng that he will tell the people of Ba Sing Se about the war</li>
<li>Long Feng threatens Aang with expulsion from the city. Aang's words have given Long Feng motive to capture Appa at this point.</li>
<li>Appa arrives after the Earth King's party (late, or early morning). Long Feng captures him.</li>
<li>The events of "The Tales of Ba Sing Se" occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, it may be trivial but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Appa%27s_Lost_Days&amp;diff=82002222&amp;oldid=81945133" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Appa%27s_Lost_Days&amp;diff=82002222&amp;oldid=81945133" rel="nofollow">Trivia point</a> says that Appa was captured one day earlier than Long Feng has motive to. 202.72.187.152 14:54, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>There are some confusion but this is what really happened. The timeline is as followed:</li>
</ul>
<p>The gang arrive at Ba Sing Se train station. Aang blows his whistle for Appa. Then Joo Dee appears and give them a tour. In effort to find Appa's whereabout, the gang asks too much questions like "where the black market?" and "how come no one knows about the war?" All this is reported by Joo Dee to Long Feng who now realizes how thoublesome the gang can be. He is afraided that Aang's position as Avatar might have a greater influence than he does. Concidentally, that night as the gang sleeps, Appa just happens to arrive. What better way to control the most powerful but to take away what he values the most? That what Long Feng did. He took Appa away. The next morning, Katara reads the paper finds out about the party. The gang go there and Long Feng spies on them. Seeing how the crowd is wooed by Aang, he decided that he should blackmail him and says if the gang persist on about the war, Aang will not be united with Appa. Then, "The Tales of Ba Sing Se" happens and the gang finds way to spend time in the city. Momo is led to the footprint. It is still there since it did not rain until the end of the episode.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.65.167.80_52df.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.65.167.80">66.65.167.80</a> (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.65.167.80.html" title="User talk:66.65.167.80">talk</a>) 14:54, October 17, 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
