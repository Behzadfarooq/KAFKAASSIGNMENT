<p>The Lisa OS provided non-preemptive multitasking. It is a common misconception that it had preemptive multitasking, but that was only avaiable on the Lisa if you ran one of the Unix ports, such as Unisoft. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrouhaha_aa50.html" title="User:Brouhaha">Brouhaha</a> 21:50, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Blakespot: How is it that you claim that it is "easily verified" that the Lisa had preemptive multitasking? The Lisa operating system documentation very definitely claims otherwise; Lisa applications have to periodically yield the CPU just as was historically the case on the Macintosh. But assuming that the application is written correctly, this is transparent to the user. This is also explicitly stated to have been a deliberate design decision in the invited paper "Architecture of the Lisa Personal Computer" by Bruce Daniels, published in Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 72 No. 3, March 1984, page 335:</p>
<pre>
   The CPU is multiplexed among the runnable processes by using a priority based nonpreemptive
   scheduling algorithm.  This nonpreemptive scheduling policy guarantees correct access to shared
   resources, such as the bit-mapped display, by interactive processes without the performance penalty
   of having to explicitly lock and unlock these resources for each access.
</pre>
<p>Since Bruce Daniels was one of the developers, I consider this to be an authoritative reference in the absence of more details on your "easily verified" claim. Are you possibly confusing "preemptive multitasking" with some other concept? I'm inclined to revert your change unless you can explain why the IEEE article and the Lisa OS documentation are wrong. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrouhaha_aa50.html" title="User:Brouhaha">Brouhaha</a> 02:17, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know the truth about how the Apple Lisa got its name. One of my uncles told me (he works for Apple.) He said that it was named after Steve Jobs' daughter, so I reworded it to make it clear that somebody around here knows the truth (while still keeping to NPOV policies.) <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Gall_cc1f.html" title="User:Scott Gall">Scott Gall</a> 10:20, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Many Apple employees (and former employees) that worked on Lisa "know the truth", yet just as many vehemently deny the story about Jobs' daughter as confirm it. It's going to take more than a single anecdotal report from one (unnamed thus unverifiable) employee to confirm it. Thus I've reverted the change unil there is something more authoritative. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrouhaha_aa50.html" title="User:Brouhaha">Brouhaha</a> 19:19, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Officially, the LISA was "Local Integrated Software Architecture". This has to be accepted since it is all that Apple are likely to officially admit. I'm troubled by "shrouded in mystery" as it is cliched and not really accurate. The truth is fairly simple: it had an official definition, obvious unofficial significance which possibly came first and option three is thrown in for humour. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisgoo_6d27.html" title="User:Mattisgoo">Mattisgoo</a> 01:42, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mattisgoo, your conclusions are correct. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.107.133.3 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.107.133.3_7570.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.107.133.3">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<hr />
<p>Where are the other LISAs buried? which landfill, and have any of them been dug up? --????</p>
<p>Reportedly somewhere in Utah. I've always thought that the story was somewhat dubious. When Apple renamed the Lisa 2/10 to be "Macintosh XL", and supplied it with the square pixel mod preinstalled and MacWorks on the hard drive, it sold quite well. They were doing this to try to clear out the inventory, and reportedly they ran out of them. If that's true, why would they have buried any?</p>
<p>Secondly, they had an existing business relationship with Sun Remarketing, which purchased and resold other Apple obsolete/overstock items. Sun Remarketing continued to sell Lisas for some time after they were discontinued, so it's not clear why Apple would have buried any Lisas rather than just selling them to Sun Remarketing.</p>
<p>It's another one of those mysteries that will probably never have a satisfactory explanation. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrouhaha_aa50.html" title="User:Brouhaha">Brouhaha</a> 20:08, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just how much did the Lisa cost Apple to build? I recently saw an interview with Woz where he talked about the majority of the cost of the machine was from RAM alone. (Don't ask me what program -- G4 Icons? History Channel's Modern Marvels: 80's Tech?) --<a href="../../../n/a/v/User%7ENavstar_757e.html" title="User:Navstar">Navstar</a> 03:57, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Theoretically there was a 512KB configuration of the Lisa, but I don't think they actually shipped any since the Lisa Office System wouldn't run on it. A 1MB Lisa contained two 512KB memory boards each of which had 64 DRAM chips (4164 64Kbit DRAM, or equivalent). Those probably cost Apple about $3 each in 1983, so that was $384 for just the RAM chips. The only other single component in a Lisa system that would have cost more than that was the <a href="../../../h/d/a/HDA_8523.html" title="HDA">HDA</a> of the external <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_ProFile_48f4.html" title="Apple ProFile">Apple ProFile</a> hard drive. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrouhaha_aa50.html" title="User:Brouhaha">Brouhaha</a> 19:49, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One of the odd things about the Lisa was that it was designed to be easy for the casual user to upgrade by adding new hardware - the back panel had a microswitch on it such that if you removed the panel while the computer was running, it would automatically shut itself down. We didn't know that and after we'd pulled the back off to add memory or something, we tried to check the machine was working OK before we put the panel back on again. The computer wouldn't run and we couldn't understand why. Thinking we'd broken it, we shipped it off to be repaired - since we'd packed it all up with the back panel re-installed, when the Apple service department got it, it booted right up and ran first time. This actually happened twice before we realised what was happening!</p>
<p>Ours was used in an office environment - running UNIX and with four users logged in over serial ports. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 03:33, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
