<ul>
<li><b>The <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communist</a> threat.</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> politicians had to worry not only about the threat posed by Hitler's Germany, but also about the threat posed by the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalinist</a> <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> â€” as the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> had not yet occurred, and given the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Army_ccba.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> having the largest armed forces in the world, they mostly regarded Stalin as the greater of the two <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> evils. The fact that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> was at the time in an extremely <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isolationism.html" title="Isolationism">isolationist</a> phase made the situation even more difficult. They feared that as Britain and France were busy fighting Germany in the West, the Soviets would invade Poland and then eastern Germany. After the "War of German Suppression", Germans and Allies alike would be at the mercy of the Soviet Union, essentially "<a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> without the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> or the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_bomb.html" title="Atomic bomb">atomic bomb</a>".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Failure to recognise the dangers of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>.</b> <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> was leader of the minority that recognised the military threat posed by a rearmed Germany. Even if a 1938 war against Germany was won, the most likely regime to replace the Nazis would be a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_dictatorship.html" title="Military dictatorship">military dictatorship</a>. Alternatively, a post-Nazi Germany could have swung leftward, forcing the Western democracies to fight a German-Soviet alliance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Mistaken presumption that Hitler was a rational actor.</b> British diplomats of the time operated under the assumption that the Nazi Party and Hitler were rational actors who would stop when their stated goals were achieved. They believed Hitler could be reasoned with and would stop his aggressive tactics and become peaceful once the unfair sections of the Treaty of Versailles were sorted out. The failure of this assumption led to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Containment.html" title="Containment">containment</a> policies by anti-Communist nations during the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. It should also be noted that, as Hitler had so far managed to achieve great success without the loss of a single German soldier, the rational act in the face of continued appeasement could well be to seek further gains.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Perceived flaws of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Versailles_58e2.html" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>.</b> The Treaty of Versailles imposed many restrictions on internal German affairs, which the Allied nations later on came to view as unfair to Germany. Many people argued that German rearmament, the <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remilitarization_of_the_Rhineland_b339.html" title="Remilitarization of the Rhineland">reoccupation of the Rhineland</a>, and the acquisition of the <a href="../../../s/a/a/Saarland.html" title="Saarland">Saarland</a> were merely examples of the Germans taking back what was rightfully theirs. They also believed that since Versailles had created the states of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> and <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia.html" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> on the basis of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-determination.html" title="Self-determination">self-determination</a>, it was unjust to deny the opportunity of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrians</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudetenland.html" title="Sudetenland">Sudetenlanders</a> to join Germany if they so wished. Because Hitler had not taken any obviously non-German territory as of 1938, a war launched by the Allies at this stage would have been a war launched merely on the basis of suspicion, in which Britain would be deeply divided. This could have been fatal if the war had gone badly for the Allies â€” as indeed happened in 1940. By 1939 Hitler had annexed the very non-German city of <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague.html" title="Prague">Prague</a> â€” meaning that self-determination could no longer be used to justify his actions. This made a decision to go to war in 1939 far easier than in 1938.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The Economic Impact of World War I.</b> The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_debt.html" title="National debt">national debt</a> of Britain increased tenfold during the war, and the increase of British government debt to foreign governments during WWI, mainly to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, led to a high interest rate being charged. The British government therefore had to try to cut back on spending, and the public would not stomach cutting back on domestic spending. The Geddes Committee of 1921â€“22 recommended that the armed forces and weapons be reduced, but this would eventually lead to a time delay when it came to rearmament during the 1930s. The price of rearming would have a crippling effect on the British government, and so the avoidance of war was a sound economic policy. Besides, one can argue that it was not until the post-war period, after the large scale centralisation of the government, that the British civil service was really capable of raising, allocating, and taxing the funds required of the large scale spending that would be necessary to rearm effectively.</li>

<p>Chamberlain's <i>Munich Agreement</i> deal (<i><a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_for_our_time.html" title="Peace for our time">peace for our time</a></i>) (i.e. the surrender of the <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudetenland.html" title="Sudetenland">Sudetenland</a> to Germany) with Hitler was internationally acclaimed and praised at home and abroad, by among others <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_XI_7042.html" title="Pope Pius XI">Pope Pius XI</a>, Ireland's <a href="../../../e/a/m/Eamon_de_Valera_90a6.html" title="Eamon de Valera">Eamon de Valera</a>, the United States administration of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt_4d26.html" title="Franklin Delano Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> and Canada's <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mackenzie_King_0f7f.html" title="Mackenzie King">Mackenzie King</a>. Chamberlain was acclaimed by many British people for avoiding another war. He was greeted by cheering crowds on the balcony of <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_d404.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, alongside King <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom_9ca6.html" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">George VI</a> and Queen <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Bowes-Lyon_de74.html" title="Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon">Elizabeth</a>, who themselves supported his policy, both having lost friends and relatives in the last war.</p>
<p>A voice condemning the Agreement came in the publication that very same day of the best-selling Penguin Special <i>Europe and the Czechs</i> by S. Grant Duff, a copy of which was delivered to each member of Parliament. As the publishers state, the volume was written at their request and was completed as late as the first week of September, and sold in the hundreds of thousands of copies.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich_Agreement_c71b.html" title="Munich Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> marked the high tide of appeasement but was also the turning point in British public opinion. Many regarded the surrender of Czechoslovakia, the only remaining democracy in central Europe, with disgust â€” especially as it had a well-armed and trained army.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Labour_Party_60e5.html" title="British Labour Party">Labour Party</a>, which until relatively recently had been condemning the Tories for their bellicosity, now attacked the appeasers as the "Men of Munich" and switched firmly into the pro-war camp.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The Czechoslovak leaders and the population believed that if Germany attacked, France would meet its treaty obligation to Czechoslovakia and attack Germany. They also believed that Britain â€” which unlike France had no treaty obligation to Czechoslovakia â€” would be drawn in, too. The <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> also had a treaty obligation to come to the aid of Czechoslovakia â€” if France did. There was no question of America acting, as far as <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Masaryk_bbdc.html" title="Jan Masaryk">Jan Masaryk</a>, the son of the first Czechoslovak President, professor <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1_Masaryk_91bb.html" title="TomÃ¡Å¡ Masaryk">TomÃ¡Å¡ Garrigue Masaryk</a>, was concerned.</p>
<p>It is when viewed against this background that the rationale and impact of Chamberlain's agreement with Hitler takes on less than desirable and laudable characteristic:</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_27.html" title="September 27">September 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, when negotiations between Hitler and Chamberlain were strained, the British Prime Minister addressed the British people <a href="http://www.historyguide.org/europe/munich.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historyguide.org/europe/munich.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. At the heart of why his critics view his policy as well-meaning but ultimately wrong <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Kosovo/Story/0,2763,209643,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Kosovo/Story/0,2763,209643,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> is this sentence from that speech: "How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas masks here because of a quarrel in a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing."</p>
<p>Just 20 years before Chamberlain addressed the British people regarding his agreement with Hitler, WWI ended in The Treaty of Versailles <a href="http://history.acusd.edu/gen/text/versaillestreaty/vercontents.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://history.acusd.edu/gen/text/versaillestreaty/vercontents.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Czechoslovakia was one of the original members of the League of Nations signatories of the Versailles treaty of peace. Part I, Articles 27â€“30, addresses the Boundaries of Germany. Part III, Political Clauses for Europe, Section VII, of that treaty addresses the Czecho-Slovak State. Yet, Chamberlain characterised the Czechs and the Germans as "people of whom we know nothing".</p>
<p>The peoples whose fate was being decided in Munich were not invited to the negotiating table. <i>O nÃ¡s bez nÃ¡s</i> (about us without us) became a phrase bitterly remembered by all Czechs and Slovaks. Neither were the peoples whose fates were being decided invited to the <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yalta_Conference_09f7.html" title="Yalta Conference">Yalta Conference</a> in 1945.</p>
<p>Hopes were expressed by Milan Ekert, Czech PES Group Observer, Member of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_integration.html" title="European integration">European integration</a> Committee in 2003: "'Without us, but about us' â€” this sentence describes the history of the <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_Republic_12a4.html" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a>, where a succession of larger powers have taken decisions about us, without us. After enlargement, however, all of this change [sic]. For the first time in our history, we can decide for ourselves. And only because of this, is it worth joining the <a href="../../../e/u/_/EU_f2e6.html" title="EU">EU</a>."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeasement_of_Hitler_7a7a.html" title="Edit section: Chamberlain and rearmament">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chamberlain and rearmament</span></h2>
<p>However, many of those that had been in government during the First World War were haunted by its effect and were determined to avoid any war in the future. Deeming all war "futile", Chamberlain himself and his ministers were also aware of the lack of military capacity at their disposal. Part of that was the result of the belief subscribed to by many governing elites in the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> that war would no longer be an option and that military budgets could be tailored accordingly. The European cycle of wars, which in the previous seventy years had produced two massive conflicts, the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franco-Prussian_War_94d8.html" title="Franco-Prussian War">Franco-Prussian War</a> of <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a> and the First World War (or <i>Great War</i> as it was then called), was thought to mark the end of old-style European conflicts. This was partly because of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the horrors of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>â€“<a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">18</a> that were thought to haunt all Europeans;</li>
<li>the disappearance of old <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militarism.html" title="Militarism">militarist</a> monarchies like the <a href="../../../h/o/h/Hohenzollern.html" title="Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a> monarchy of Prussia and Germany and the old system of secretive military alliances (the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_Entente_f747.html" title="Triple Entente">Triple Entente</a> and the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_Alliance_%281882%29_21dc.html" title="Triple Alliance (1882)">Triple Alliance</a>);</li>
<li>the apparent democratisation of Europe which it was thought would mean that war could not be waged without the will of the people, and after <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> that will would no longer be there;</li>
<li>and as a result of the financial burdens fighting the Great War and rebuilding states afterwards had imposed on individual exchequers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the apearance of the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Nations_d214.html" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> raised hope that there would now be other ways of resolving interstate disputes than military might. Because of this the old cycle of rearming for the next <i>revenge</i> conflict was thought to be broken. The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> after 1929 forced governments to cut expenditures. In such circumstances, a heavily funded military was thought neither politically possible nor financially viable. Faced with the growing political and economic instability in Europe, the rise in <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, and the increased irrelevance of the League of Nations as a means to deal with disputes, Britain engaged in one of the most massive military build-ups in modern history and instituted a peacetime draft. The rearmament budget of 1937 amounted to Â£1.5 billion.</p>
