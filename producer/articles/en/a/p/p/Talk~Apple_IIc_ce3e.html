	    <p>This entry had originally been just a <i>blank</i> (empty) page that automatically redirected you to the Apple II family. I wanted to see that change, so I did just that and changed it--writing up a entire entry on the Apple IIc computer from the ground up. Why? The Apple II line is probably the most important and historically relevant in the history of personal computers, and I've not seen that reflected on Wikipedia. For that reason, and my own personal fondness, interest, experience and knowledge of the machine, I've made it my personal goal of sorts to expand its presence here.</p>
<p>I feel each machine in the Apple II family line deserves its own entry in Wikipedia, rather than just a short blurb written as a few lines of text in the page mentioned above. It is afterall the computer that started it all, the literal grandfather of the personal computer industry we see before us today. I started with the Apple IIe last month (it being the longest lived machine in the line, and at Apple in general) and this article on the Apple IIc is now my second entry, and hopefully not the last.</p>
<p>I've tried to make this article more encyclopedic than a technical in nature. I'll shortly be adding a sprinkling of pictures relating to some the major topics mentioned in the article, making it more interesting. Like any other it's not necessarily finished or flawless, but I hope this contribution will be useful to those who are curious about the history of this model. --Mitchell Spector (--Apple2gs 06:14, 19 January 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dl>
<dd>I would like to know more about the price of the Apple IIc when it was introduced.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>At introduction, it cost US$1,295 for just the Apple IIc--this included the computer itself, an external powersupply, RF modulator, and some introductory manuals and disks. Other peripherals cost extra, although back then you could make due hooking it to your television set and have a ready to use system out of the box (a joystick for games would be the only thing missing).</dd>

<dd>I have a price list from Apple Canada dated October 1984. In Canadian dollars, the IIc was listed for CDN$1,795, a 9" monochrome IIc screen CDN$315 (with stand an additional CDN$60), carrying case CDN$60, mouse CDN$155, external IIc 5.25 $515. An "Apple IIc starter system" is listed for CDN$1,995 but doesn't specify what it includes.Apple2gs 21:48, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't understand why you removed the Bibliography section which cites THE source for understanding the Apple IIC (<i>Apple IIC Technical Reference Manual</i>)? I would think that single source, written by Apple, would be mandatory.</p>
<p>Secondarily, I think your revision of the "long book quote" which explains how to use the PEEK command in Applesoft BASIC makes it more obscure for the less technical user as to what to do. It removes clarity.</p>
<p>Will discuss this here before doing any reverts. -- <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuartermaster_2ada.html" title="User:Quartermaster">Quartermaster</a> 11:51, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I felt it draws attention away from the focus of that section, which is just to simply list the chronology of revisions. It is also a bit redundant since it restates what's below, but mainly it goes against the encyclopedic style of the article...it just breaks into these instructions for typing Applesoft commands in the middle of the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't necessarily think it's a bad idea, but the article is intended for straight backround information (historical and technical) about the Apple IIc--what it is, how it came to be, its history, etc; not act as a tutorial or FAQ on using it. Maybe we can put it that book quote at the end of the article, with a footer note near the top of the revision section saying <i>"See section below for details on determining specific IIc ROM revision"</i> or something like that. --Apple2gs 18:55, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The "intention" of an article relates to an author, and Wikipedia is not author based. Second, how is listing the means by which one determines the version of the ROM a "tutorial" or an "FAQ"? The original source (The <i>Technical Reference Manual</i>) is neither a tutorial nor an FAQ. "Tutorial" and "FAQ" are just terms you're throwing about and not logically connected to anything.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think you're taking a proprietary interest in this article, and not looking at the bigger picture of what makes a good Wikipedia entry. This is not your personal article. Thoroughness is a good thing and not a bad thing. Else I'd write something like "The Apple IIC was really cool and people liked it." Even listing the ROM versions would be suspect with such an opinion that the article is not an FAQ nor a tutorial; why list the ROM versions at all? A more thorough documentation of a subject is a good thing. One can argue about style and organization, but wholesale deletion of a documented fact (with included citation) is bad form.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, you don't even mention the deletion of the <i>Bibliography</i> with the inclusion of the <i>Apple IIC Technical Reference Manual</i> which I find totally and unambiguously warranted to include. Using it as a a source for where the directions for determining the ROM version is not only well within Wikipedia policy and philosophy, but an unambiguous good idea. I'm going to go back and add that since I can see nothing that would warrant otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm also going to work on creating a "How to determine revision version" section followed by the listing of versions section. Can't see how that would be a bad thing.</dd>

<dd>As the creator of the article, it should come as no surprise I have more interest in watching over changes and additions made here more than any other Wikipedia contributors, but never to the point I've ever considered it under my sole ownership, or where I would be blocking any and all changes. I find it offensive to be accused of that, and frankly, your tone overly harsh and bordering on insulting. I did not (and still do not) feel what you added blended in well, so I reworked it into something much more simplified and condensed. I removed the bibliography because there no longer was a direct quote from the technical reference manual, making it unnecessary. My article or not, I am just as much in my right to modify newly added text as you are, so long as it benefits and isn't detrimental in any way. I apologize if you felt I was doing otherwise but you're free to again rework it, and allow others to tweak it as well. Nothing is set in stone here, I thought that is what Wikipedia is all about--change. Hey, I wrote several pharagraphs in the opening of the main "Apple II" article only to have the entire work erased by someone who didn't agree (ditto for several other articles not even related to the Apple II), and no, I wasn't happy about it, but I certainly wasn't rude and unjustly accusing of the person who made those changes.</dd>

<dd>And speaking of changes, I'll be doing some momentarily as I see you've made an error or two within the IIc revision section. For example, you've incorrectly made the serial port timing bug inclusive and associated with the "ROM 255" firmware. FYI, IIc's manufactured after November/December 1984 not only corrected the serial port bug, but still continued to ship with the original ROM 255. You cannot automatically assume the original firmware equals a faulty serial port.</dd>

<dd>I'm opened to and welcome changes, I would love to see the article grow, that's why I put it up on Wikipedia instead of publishing it privately on a website. And I don't mind if you disagree with me, but please don't be so quick to prejudge my intensions. I hope I didn't sound too harsh in my own reply, I'd really would like to work together on the article. In retrospect I think I was a little too quick to tweak/remove your contribution, I should have re-read it a second time to let it sink in (unless of course it's a glaring error).&#160;:) --Apple2gs 04:53, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll chime in with apologies for my unintended tone (always hard in plain text). We apple lovers are a testy and protective bunch. I just walked away for a couple of weeks (vacation) and decided not to do any wiki work so things in my head could settle. All edits are looking nice, clean, and informative. The article is evolving quite nicely on all fronts, I must say. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuartermaster_2ada.html" title="User:Quartermaster">Quartermaster</a> 18:37, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay. Every photograph and scanned image used in this article has been symatically removed, apparently (and unjustly in my opinion) over the minor technicality of incorrect permission/copyright tagging choosen--not the images themselves. Most of these images have had permission cleared from their original source, or are considered fair use images that were used as promotional material by Apple Computer over 20 years ago. In the case of the Apple IIc image taken from the cover of the Apple IIc owner's guide, Apple gave permission to reproduce it and the entire manual.</p>
<p>So I ask, can someone assist in selecting the correct tags so these can stay in place? I must say I am getting extremely turned off by having piece of these articles ripped out that I spent days creating (yes, photos and their captions do make up the article) every other day by automated bots or other Wikipedia users. I put them here to grow, and to share information in regards to these orphaned machines, not see this information blocked. I do value Wikipedia's respect for copyrights, and agree with the basic principle, but people here are TOO over eager to remove images before even verifying their status.</p>
<p>If necessary, I can go through the trouble of photographing these machines from my own collection (as I've already done for the Apple IIc Plus article) but that takes several hours, sometimes days, of work. Hopefully it won't come to that, which is why I would prefer to get some assistance in choosing the correct tags for the existing images. Thanks--Apple2gs 00:08, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Copyright statuses were verified, and the images were deleted under official Wikipedia image policy by an administrator. If you want to open a dispute, please do so, but not here. The current images being used are from the Wikimedia Commons, a preferred source of images since Wikipedia is meant to be free-content only, not Copyrighted material that has had "permission" to be used. Anywho, no point in disputing this here. — <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWackymacs_1999.html" title="User:Wackymacs">Wackymacs</a> 07:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also...I actually prefer the user-made images to Apple's press material, since it fits in here more. It gives Wikipedia something unique, instead of stuff from Apple everyone has seen before. — <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWackymacs_1999.html" title="User:Wackymacs">Wackymacs</a> 07:52, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
