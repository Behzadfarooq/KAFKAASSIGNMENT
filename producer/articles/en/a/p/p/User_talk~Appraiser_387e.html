<p>In order to avoid a minor revert war, I sent an e-mail to amy@amyklobuchar.com as listed on the campaign site, asking permission to use a photo.

<dd>If you have a peep in the bottom right hand corner of the original image - you'll see a credit on the picture: <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/f/f7/20061227123846%21Stanthonyrecession.jpg" class="external free" title="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/f/f7/20061227123846%21Stanthonyrecession.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/f/f7/20061227123846%21Stanthonyrecession.jpg</a> . In answer to the second part of the question. The most general case is that it's okay to photograph and post <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> images. This image is public domain because it is the work of the US Army (and thus public domain). This is a really complicated topic - if you have specific cases I can help - but otherwise it's best to read through the copyright policy pages. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegapixie_ea09.html" title="User:Megapixie">Megapixie</a> 23:14, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now that's just wrong. The work itself is definately copyright and should not be on the commons. It could be used as fairuse in the article. Gah.

<p>I'm not too keen on the death penalty, but I wonder what would have been the better way to deal with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wayne_Gacy_2452.html" title="John Wayne Gacy">John Wayne Gacy</a>? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:57, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The primary reason I <i>generally</i> oppose the death penalty is because it's applied "capriciously and abitrarily", as some have put it. I also don't agree with the "beyond a reasonable doubt" theory. It should be "beyond <i>all</i> doubt", which would probably reduce the number of executions, or maybe redistribute them. In some ways, it's like putting someone "out of their misery" (and ours). In the case of Gacy, there was absolutely no doubt, and people grew to hate him because of his ego and defiance. He abused the legal system to postpone his execution as long as possible, and that's why there was a small army of people cheering in Joliet that night. I contrast that with a guy like Dahmer, who was in some ways a sympathetic figure. In a moment of contrition rare for serial killers, he said at the sentencing that he wished he were dead. He was eventually murdered by an inmate, so in a way he got his wish. However, maybe lifetime incarceration with hard labor and/or little or no normal human contact, basically a living hell, is a better punishment in some sense. But is that really a punishment for a narcissist like the BTK guy? 'Tis a puzzlement. But one thing I am certain of: Our continual and relatively wide usage of the death penalty does nothing to enhance our nation's image around the world, and overall I think that's more important than whether we kill the Gacy's of the world or let them rot in prison. OK, end of lecture.&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 22:29, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I asked someone once about this subject, and they said the burden of proof for the existence of God is on those who claim He (or She or It) exists. Atheists don't claim anything and don't have to prove anything. I think that defines it well. I used to be an atheist, but I gave it up. No holidays.

<li>Your views on this matter are well-written, and get to the core of what the problem is with religion, that it's often an extension of earth-bound authority. God invented humans just to have beings to worship Him? Makes no sense. I like what Stephen Jay Gould once said: Man is the only animal that worries about the future, so he invented God (or gods) to take care of the future for him. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 22:32, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Firstly I should point out that only the picture that you mentioned had the inappropriate tag which I admit to not noticing but all of the other have proper fair use tags. I passed this article because I felt that it mostly meets the <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">good article criteria</a>. However you can have the final choice on what can be done to the article. A few possible suggestions would be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the picture from the article.</li>
<li>Remove the article from the GA list.</li>
<li>Send the article for a <a href="../../../g/a/2F/WP%7EGA_R_6cc4.html" title="WP:GA/R">GA review</a></li>
<li>Or <b>Be bold</b> and fix the problems yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this helps you make a decision. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarret_c08f.html" title="User:Tarret">Tarret</a> 14:31, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You objected to the use of her picture provided by the United States Senate. I point out that it could not appear on her Senate website if she did not surrender the rights to the United States Federal Government. Therefor by transfer it becomes the property of the United States Government and as such fall under <a href="http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000105----000-notes.html" class="external text" title="http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000105----000-notes.html" rel="nofollow">Title 17, Chapter 1, sub-section 105</a>.--<a href="../../../w/o/w/User%7EWowaconia_eb5e.html" title="User:Wowaconia">Wowaconia</a> 19:04, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>First the question is who owns the rights. By transferring these rights to the US Senate she has surrendered any claims in a civil court to fiscally profit from the work. It is solely a question of who is the copyright holder not one of who originally produced the work. If Melinda Gates takes a photo of Bill, she is the copyright holder, if she gives it to Microsoft and they use it she has transferred her rights to them and if Wikipedia used it even with Melinda's permission we would get sued by the Copyright holder Microsoft. If you look at the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11</a> page you will see the shot of a cab with a light pole ontop of it, if you click on the picture it will tell you this was taken by a Marine, but he even as he took the photo he was not the copyright holder as he was doing so in his official capacities, so the issue is not who originally took the photo but who currenly owns the rights.</p>
<ul>
<li>Second, this is not the same photo that was produced by Hennepin County as she was wearing red in that photo and it was taken in an indoor studio.</li>

<p>Hi Appraiser, I suppose you asked me for an opinion due to my "redirect" vote on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Representatives_from_Minnesota_123e.html" title="List of United States Representatives from Minnesota">List of United States Representatives from Minnesota</a> AFD. While I do read a number of the US politics articles with interest I am not an active participant in the creation and editing of such articles and know pretty much zero about the standards the people who work with them strive for. At the time I voted on the AFD, I thought it was a very simple case of a duplicate article but after reviewing it I see that I probably missed some arguments opposing redirection which <i>might</i> have merit (I am <i>really</i> unsure about this so I've asked DRV to relist the article in question). I am sorry, but I don't really have any basis for voicing my opinions on the talkpage you linked to. Hope you will forgive me for that. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 16:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for putting lots of time into the ordinal congresses. I've lately been spending lots of time on them too. I'm running into some disagreements wih other contributers, however, and the process is more frustrating than what I've run across in other articles and other broad article areas.

I much prefer the <a href="../../../u/s/c/Template%7EUSCongressTerms_dab7.html" title="Template:USCongressTerms">Template:USCongressTerms</a> for the reasons you stated and would hope that template is used consistantly throughout the series.

I've changed this to fair use and added a replaceable fair use tag to the image because I doubt this claim.

<p>I met Theodore Wirth's grandson, Theodore J. Wirth, today. Here's the story: My father had a box of Theodore Wirth's annual reports to the Minneapolis Park Board from many years ago. When my father worked for the park board one winter, they were clearing out an old storage space, and they wanted to get rid of the box of reports. He asked if he could keep them, and his supervisor said, "I don't care, as long as they're out of here by 4 PM." (My father tends to do this a lot -- he'll take stuff that other people want to get rid of -- but this was one of the things of real historic value.)</p>
<p>Anyway, my father saw an article in the paper a few years ago about a group called the Minneapolis Parks Legacy Society, who is dedicated to promoting the legacy of Theodore Wirth. He contacted the group and mentioned that he had these annual reports, and that he was willing to donate them to the group. They got in touch with my dad, and this afternoon, Joan Berthiaume and Theodore J. Wirth visited my father and picked up the reports. In exchange, they gave my father a reprinted edition of a book that Theodore Wirth wrote in 1944 about his experience with the Minneapolis parks system. It was a cool gift that they gave my dad, and I read through some parts of the book. It's pretty interesting and it sheds a lot of light on Wirth's career.</p>
<p>They mentioned that they're hoping to get the Theodore Wirth Home and Administration Building opened to the public as a museum. They're also the group that got his house on the National Register in 2002. I told them that I'm an editor on Wikipedia and that I've worked on articles about National Register properties in Minnesota. Joan mentioned that a Wikipedia editor had come to the Theodore Wirth house looking for some information. I don't know if it was you or not, but it sounds like they'd be interested in helping to document Theodore Wirth's accomplishments. The book they gave my father would certainly provide a lot of information toward that goal. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 04:26, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I was very careful in the wording of my photo caption to use the indefinite article <i>a</i> before "boundary" rather than the definite article <i>the</i>, since, as you noted, the river does not always serve as the boundary between the two cities. But I thought it was interesting enough to point out in the caption that it <i>sometimes</i> serves that purpose. I won't revert there because it's not worth getting into an edit war over, but please at least re-read my original caption, and note the indefinite article <i>a</i> and my intention: to demonstrate a purpose that the subject of the article performs, that it doesn't merely "run through" the cities; it also, arguably more interestingly, serves as a boundary between the two cities over a significant area. If you can come up with a way to re-word the caption to keep that intent, please do so. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 16:09, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think too many people are going dispute Ramstad is a moderate Republican, I am more curious what makes that particular study so authoritative. Plus are we going to have every political group/cause/interest group that ranks members of congress as either being conservative or liberal pro or con to their agendas listed as well. I believe saying that he is a moderate Republican is fine. I doubt someone will come along and ask for source or citiation for that <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">Smith03</a> 02:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>"restore citation justifying the word "moderte" - it indicates where the city is on the political spectrum) " Also your logic is a bit off in sense it show where the city is on the political scale as Ramstad is elected by the whole 3rd district not just Bloomington. Also a conservative Republican is going to vote him over a Democrat. A better indication would be to look at the state house and senate. As someone who lives in Bloomington I would say that Bloomington as a whole is pretty moderate the east tend to vote Dem and the west tends to vote GOP. We are pretty purple, but then you have to keep in mind there is a difference between social and economic conservatives/liberals. I would state the east side is probably more liberal on economic issues but more conservative on social issues. The West is probably more conservative on economic and maybe more split on social, but that is my assumptions based on people I know from around town.</p>

<p>Hi. Appraiser, you are the person who taught me to give images no pixel sizes, a lesson that made a big impression so I hesitate to suggest that Minneapolis might have two bona fide exceptions, cases for which MoS provides. The default makes the recycle image so powerful the message (four languages) is lost. A slightly smaller pixel size won't hurt the Target image and will give other companies more room. Readers can click the images if they wish to see more. The two are in close proximity. If you have time could you see what you think? Also, do you think that WikiProject Cities order of sections is working out? Thanks. -<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanlesch_72ab.html" title="User:Susanlesch">Susanlesch</a> 13:32, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>It looks good now. I changed the recycling picture the other day because the photo was overlapping text on one of my monitors. I think your addition of the "break" solved the problem. The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cities_0174.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cities">Wikipedia:WikiProject Cities</a> standard sections are a good idea I think.

<p>Hey- I did a lot of congressional stuff back whenever that was. My memory is blank. It is possible it was a copyright violation. I don't who it was-but I was new to Wikipedia at the time. I just might of thought it was okay to share information from a government website. I went to that John Kline website and didn't recognize it. Sorry for the mistake if it was me. <a href="../../../r/h/e/User%7ERhelmerichs_e3c5.html" title="User:Rhelmerichs">Rhelmerichs</a> 20:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
