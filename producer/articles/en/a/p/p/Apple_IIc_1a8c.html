<p>The <b>Apple IIc</b>, the fourth model in the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_II_series_8fc6.html" title="Apple II series">Apple II series</a> of personal computers, was <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computer_f26c.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer's</a> first endeavor to produce a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portable_computer.html" title="Portable computer">portable computer</a>. The end result was a "luggable" 7½ pound notebook sized version of the Apple II which could easily be transported from place to place. The <i>"c"</i> in the name stood for <i>"compact"</i>, referring to the fact it was essentially a complete Apple II computer setup (minus display and power supply) squeezed into a small notebook sized housing. While sporting a built-in floppy drive and new rear peripheral expansion ports, it lacked the internal expansion slots and direct motherboard access of earlier Apple IIs, making it a closed system. However that was the intended direction for this model—a more appliance-like machine, ready to use out of the box, requiring no technical know how or experience to hook up and therefore attractive to first time users.</p>

<p>The Apple IIc was released in April 1984, during an Apple held event called "Apple II Forever". The new machine was proclaimed as proof of Apple's long term commitment to the Apple II series and its users, an assurance the company's older technology would not be forsaken or dropped with the recent introduction of the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Macintosh_48d6.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Macintosh</a>. While essentially an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIe_6c47.html" title="Apple IIe">Apple IIe</a> computer in a smaller case, it was not a successor, but rather a portable version to complement it. One Apple II machine would be sold for users who required the expandability of slots, and another for those wanting the simplicity of a <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plug_and_play.html" title="Plug and play">plug and play</a> machine with portability in mind.</p>
<p>The machine introduced Apple's <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow_White_design_language_1568.html" title="Snow White design language">Snow White design language</a>, notable for its elegant case styling and a sleek modern look which soon became the standard for most Apple equipment and computers, and continuing for nearly a decade after. The origin of term comes from the Apple IIc's unique pure snow white coloring, the only Apple-made computer produced in this color (other machines were typically beige or light grey). While relatively light weight and compact in design, the Apple IIc was not a true portable in design as it lacked a built-in battery and display.</p>
<p>Codenames for the machine while under development included: Lollie, ET, Yoda, Teddy, VLC, IIb, IIp.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIc_1a8c.html" title="Edit section: Overview of features">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview of features</span></h2>
<p><b>Improving the IIe</b></p>
<p>Technically the Apple IIc was the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIe_6c47.html" title="Apple IIe">Apple IIe</a> computer in a smaller case, retaining the same set of features. Building on the design, it did manage to offer a few minor improvements without affecting compatibility for the most part. It utilized the CMOS based <a href="../../../6/5/c/65C02_04d3.html" title="65C02">65C02</a> microprocessor (instead of a plain 6502) which added 27 new processor instructions and drew less power (but hampered compatibility with a very small number of programs that used <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal_opcode.html" title="Illegal opcode">illegal opcodes</a> of the 6502 processor, which were removed in the 65C02). The new ROM firmware allowed <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applesoft_BASIC_7576.html" title="Applesoft BASIC">Applesoft BASIC</a> to recognize lowercase characters, work better with an 80 columns display and fixed several bugs from the IIe ROM. In terms of video, the text display added 32 unique character symbols called "Mousetext" which, when placed side by side, could display simplistic looking icons, windows and menus to recreate a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphical_user_interface.html" title="Graphical user interface">graphical user interface</a> completely out of text, similar in concept to IBM <a href="../../../a/n/s/ANSI_d403.html" title="ANSI">ANSI</a>. A year later the Apple IIe would benefit from these improvements in the form of a four chip upgrade called the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIe_6c47.html#The_Enhanced_IIe" title="Apple IIe">Enhanced IIe</a>.</p>
<p><b>Built-in cards and ports</b></p>
<p>The equivalent of five slot cards were built-in and integrated into the Apple IIc motherboard. These included: An Extended 80 Column Card, two Apple <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_II_serial_cards_b1dc.html" title="Apple II serial cards">Super Serial Cards</a>, a Mouse Card, and a floppy drive controller card. This meant the Apple IIc had 128 KiB <a href="../../../r/a/m/RAM_e536.html" title="RAM">RAM</a>, 80 column text and Double-Hi-Resolution graphics built-in and available right out of the box, unlike its older sibling the Apple IIe. It also meant less of a need for slots as the most popular peripheral add-on cards were already built-in, ready for devices to be plugged into the rear ports of the machine. The built-in cards were mapped to phantom slots so software from slot-based Apple II models would know where to find them (i.e. mouse to virtual slot 4, serial cards to slot 1 and 2, floppy to slot 6, and so on). Of interest is the entire Apple Disk II Card, used for controlling floppy drives, had been shrunk down into a single chip called the "IWM" which stood for Integrated Wozniak Machine.</p>
<p>In the rear of the machine were its expansion ports, mostly for providing access to its built-in cards. The standard <a href="../../../d/e/-/DE-9_connector_7af7.html" title="DE-9 connector">DE-9</a> joystick connector doubled as a mouse interface, compatible with the same mice used by the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Lisa_f49d.html" title="Apple Lisa">Lisa</a> and early <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Macintosh_48d6.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computers. Two serial ports were provided primarily to support a printer and modem, a floppy port connector supported a single external 5.25 drive (and later "intelligent" devices such as 3.5 drives and hardisks). A Video Expansion port provided rudimentary signals for add-on adapters but alone could not directly generate a video signal (Apple produced a LCD display and an RF-modulator for this port; the latter shipped with early IIc's). A port connector tied into an internal 12 volt power converter for attaching batteries; this is where the infamous external powersupply (dubbed "brick on a leash" by users) that was included plugged in. The same composite video port found on earlier Apple II models remained present, however gone were the cassette ports and internal DIP-16 game port.</p>
<p><b>Built-in accessories and keyboard</b></p>
<p>The Apple IIc had a built-in 5.25" floppy drive (140 kB) along the right side of the case—the first Apple II model to include such a feature. Along the left side of the case was a dial to control the volume of the internal speaker, along with a 1/8" monaural audio jack for headphones or an external speaker. A fold out carrying handle doubled as a way to prop up back end of the machine to angle the keyboard for typing, if desired.</p>
<p>The keyboard layout mirrored that of the Apple IIe, however the 'Reset' key had been moved above the 'ESC' key. Two toggle switches were also located in the same area: an "80/40" column switch for (specially written) software to detect which text video mode to start up in, and a "Keyboard" switch to select between <a href="../../../q/w/e/QWERTY_c398.html" title="QWERTY">QWERTY</a> and <a href="../../../d/v/o/DVORAK_fca5.html" title="DVORAK">DVORAK</a> layout - or between US and national layout on non-American machines. The keyboard itself was built-in to the front half of the case, much like a notebook computer, and had a rubber mat placed beneath the keycaps which acted as a liquid spill guard.</p>

<p>The Apple IIc was in production between April 1984 until August 1988, and during this time accrued some minor changes. These modifications included three new updates of the original ROM, two motherboard variants (including a hardware bug fix for one), and a slight cosmetic change to the external appearance of the machine. These versions, as well as a method for determining which firmware resides in a particular machine, are detailed below.</p>
<p><a name="Original_IIc_.28ROM_version_.27255.27.29" id="Original_IIc_.28ROM_version_.27255.27.29"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIc_1a8c.html" title="Edit section: Original IIc (ROM version '255')">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Original IIc (ROM version '255')</span></h3>
<p>The initial ROM, installed in machines produced during the first year and a half of production, was 16 KiB in size. The only device which could be connected to the disk port was (one) external 5.25 floppy drive; software could be booted from this external drive by typing the command "PR#7". The serial port did not mask incoming linefeed characters or support the XON/XOFF protocol, unlike all later firmware revisions to come. There was no self-test diagnostic present in this ROM, holding down the solid-Apple key during cold boot merely cycled unusual patterns on screen which served no useful purpose or indication of the machine's health.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIc_1a8c.html" title="Edit section: Serial port timing fix">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Serial port timing fix</span></h3>
<p>The original Apple IIc motherboard (manufactured between April and November 1984) derived the timing for its two serial ports through a 74LS161 <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transistor-transistor_logic.html" title="Transistor-transistor logic">TTL</a> logic chip. It was later found that this method's timing was 3% slower than the minimum requirement specified and caused certain modems and printers, which operated at 1200 bits per second (<a href="../../../b/a/u/Baud.html" title="Baud">baud</a>) or faster, to function improperly. Slower serial devices operating at 300 baud or less were unaffected. The solution was to replace the TTL chip with an oscillator during manufacture. Apple would swap affected motherboards for users who could prove they had an incompatible serial device (e.g., 1200 baud modem).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIc_1a8c.html" title="Edit section: UniDisk 3.5 support (ROM version '0')">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">UniDisk 3.5 support (ROM version '0')</span></h3>
<p>This update, introduced November <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, came in the form of an upgrade to the ROM firmware which doubled in size from 16 KiB to 32 KiB. The new ROM supported "intelligent" devices such as Apple's UniDisk 3.5 (800 kB) floppy drive, in addition to an external 5.25 floppy drive. A new self-test diagnostic was provided for testing built-in <a href="../../../r/a/m/RAM_e536.html" title="RAM">RAM</a> and other signs of logic faults. The Mini-Assembler, absent since the days of the Apple II Plus, made a return, and new Monitor "Step" and "Trace" commands were added as well. The upgraded ROM added rudimentary support for an external AppleTalk networking device which was yet to be developed. When attempting to boot virtual slot 7, users would encounter the message "APPLETALK OFFLINE". The IIc however had no built-in networking capabilities, and no external device was ever released. The upgrade consisted of a single chip swap (and a trivial motherboard modification), which Apple provided free only to persons who purchased a UniDisk 3.5 drive. A small sticker with an icon of a 3½" floppy diskette was placed next to the existing 5¼" diskette icon above the floppy drive port indicating the machine had been upgraded.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIc_1a8c.html" title="Edit section: Memory Expansion IIc (ROM version '3')">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Memory Expansion IIc (ROM version '3')</span></h3>
<p>Introduced in September 1986 simultaneously with the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIgs_5105.html" title="Apple IIgs">Apple II<small>GS</small></a>, this model introduced a new motherboard, new keyboard and new color scheme. The original Apple IIc had no expansion options and required third party cards to perform various hardware tricks. This could be done by removing the CPU and MMU chips and squeezing a special board into these sockets, which then used bank switching to expand memory (<a href="../../../r/a/m/RAM_e536.html" title="RAM">RAM</a>). This was similar to the function of the auxiliary slot in the original Apple IIe. The new motherboard added a 34-pin socket for plugging in memory cards directly, which allowed for the addressing of up to 1 <a href="../../../m/e/b/Mebibyte.html" title="Mebibyte">mebibyte</a> of memory using Slinky-type memory cards. The onboard chip count was reduced from sixteen memory chips (64K×1) to four (64K×4). The new firmware removed the code for the cancelled AppleTalk networking device and replaced it with support for memory cards. Bumping out the non-supported AppleTalk functionality, memory now lived in virtual slot 4, and mouse support moved to slot 7. The new keyboard no longer had the rubber anti-spill mat and offered generally more tactile and responsive keys that felt more "clicky". At the same time the color of the keyboard, floppy drive latch and power supply cords changed from beige to light grey, which matched the new Platinum color scheme of the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIgs_5105.html" title="Apple IIgs">Apple II<small>GS</small></a>. The case however remained snow white. Owners of the previous IIc model were entitled to a free motherboard upgrade if they purchased one of Apple's IIc memory expansion boards (they did not receive the new keyboard or the cosmetic changes).</p>

<p>In January 1988 a new ROM firmware update was issued to address bugs in the new memory expandable IIc. Changes included better detection of installed RAM chips, correction of a problem when using the serial modem port in terminal-mode, and a bug fix for keyboard buffering. The ROM upgrade was available free of charge only to owners of the memory expansion IIc. This was the final change to the Apple IIc until superseded by the <b><a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIc_Plus_8e80.html" title="Apple IIc Plus">Apple IIc Plus</a></b> (identified as ROM version '5').</p>

<p>According to the <i>Apple IIC Technical Reference Manual</i> (New York&#160;: Addison-Wesley, 1987, pp. xxiii-xxv / <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-201-17752-8</a>) one can determine which version of ROM is installed in a specific Apple IIc by running the Applesoft BASIC programming language, and typing in the command:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>PRINT PEEK (64447)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This will return a value indicating which ROM revision is contained in a specific Apple IIc.</p>
<ul>
<li>if PRINT PEEK (64447) returns 255, this is the original IIC (ROM revision '255').</li>
<li>if PRINT PEEK (64447) returns 0, this is the IIC with UniDisk 3.5 inch drive support (ROM revision '0').</li>
<li>if PRINT PEEK (64447) returns 3, this is the IIC with memory expansion support (ROM revision '3').</li>
<li>if PRINT PEEK (64447) returns 4, this is the IIC with a modified/fixed version of memory expansion support (ROM revision '4').</li>
<li>if PRINT PEEK (64447) returns 5, this is the <b><a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIc_Plus_8e80.html" title="Apple IIc Plus">Apple IIc Plus</a></b>, an entirely different machine (ROM revision '5').</li>

<p>Like the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIe_6c47.html" title="Apple IIe">Apple IIe</a> before it, the Apple IIc keyboard differed depending on what region of the world it was sold in. Sometimes the differences were very minor, such as extra local language characters and symbols printed on certain keycaps (e.g. French accented characters on Canadian IIc such as "á", "é", "ç", etc, or the British Pound "£" symbol on the UK IIc) while other times the layout and shape of keys greatly differed (e.g. European IIc). In order to access the local character set, the "Keyboard" switch above the keyboard (used for switching between QWERTY and DVORAK layouts on US models; a feature not available in international IIc's) was depressed, which would instantly switch text video from the US character set to the local set. In some countries these localized IIc's also supported 50 Hz PAL video and the different 220/240 volt power of that region by means of a different external power supply—this was a very simple change, since the IIc had an internal 12 volt power converter. The international versions replaced any English wording printed on the case (specifically the "keyboard" toggle switch, "Power" and "Disk Use" drive activity labels) with graphical icon symbols that could be universally understood.</p>

Apple IIc <i>Flat Panel Display</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the time of the Apple IIc's release, Apple announced an optional black and white (1-bit) <a href="../../../l/c/d/LCD_d48d.html" title="LCD">LCD</a> screen designed specifically for the machine called the <i>Apple Flat Panel Display</i>. While it was welcomed as a means of making the IIc more portable, it did not integrate well as a portable solution, not attaching in a secure or permanent manner and not able to fold-over face down. Instead, it sat atop the machine (temporarily wedging its support stand inside the top vertical grooves of the case) and connected via ribbon cable to a somewhat bulky rear port connector. Its main shortcoming was that it suffered from a very poor contrast and no backlighting, making it very difficult to view. The display itself had an odd aspect ratio as well, making graphics look vertically squashed. A third party company would later introduced a work-alike LCD screen called the <i>C-Vue</i>, which looked and functioned very much like Apple's product, albeit with a reportedly slight improvement in viewability. Even so, it too suffered from an overall poor visibility, as like the Apple display had no backlight or illumination and overall a very low contrast, making both products nearly impossible to use without a strong external light source. Consequently both sold poorly and had a very short market life span, making these displays fairly uncommon (and as a result, extremely rare today).</p>
<p>Third parties also offered external <a href="../../../r/e/c/Rechargeable_battery.html" title="Rechargeable battery">rechargeable battery</a> units for the Apple IIc (e.g. <i>Prairie Pack</i>) with up to 8 hours per charge or longer. Although they aided in making the machine more of a true portable, they were nonetheless bulky and heavy, and added more pieces that would have to be carried. Adapter cables were sold as well that allowed the Apple IIc to plug into and power off of an automobile's DC power cigarette lighter.</p>
<p>To help transport the Apple IIc and its accessory pieces around, Apple sold a nylon carrying case with shoulder strap that had a compartment for the computer, its external powersupply and cables. It had enough room to squeeze in one of the above mentioned LCD display units inside. The case was grey in color with a stitched on Apple logo in the upper left corner.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIc_1a8c.html" title="Edit section: Expansion capabilities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expansion capabilities</span></h3>
<p>While the Apple IIc had many built-in features to offer, many users wanted to extend the machine's capabilities beyond what Apple provided. It proved difficult since the IIc was a closed system that initially was designed with no expansion capabilities, however many companies figured out ingenious ways of squeezing enhancements inside the tiny case. Real-time clocks, memory expansion and coprocessor were popular, and some companies even managed to combine all three into a single add-on board. Typically, in order to add these options, key chips on the motherboard were pulled, moved onto the expansion board offering the new features, and the board was then placed into the empty sockets. While sometimes a tight squeeze, this trickery worked quite well, and most importantly of all offered users a way to expand memory—something Apple did not themselves support until the Memory Expansion IIc model was introduced.</p>
<p>Some companies devised a method for squeezing in an entire CPU accelerator product, by means of placing all the specialized circuitry (i.e. <a href="../../../c/a/c/Cache.html" title="Cache">cache</a> and logic) into one tall chip that outright replaced the 40-pin 65C02 microprocessor, speeding up the machine from 4–10 MHz. Notable examples are the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_II_accelerators_6513.html" title="Apple II accelerators">Zip Chip and Rocket Chip</a>.</p>
<p>Although the IIc lacked a SCSI or IDE interface, external hard drives were produced that connected through the floppy SmartPort (e.g. <i>ProApp</i>, <i>Chinook</i>, <i>C-Drive</i>) providing true mass storage. However they were relatively slow due to the nature of how data was transferred through this interface, designed primarily for floppy drives. Even add-on speech and music synthesis products were made available, by means of external devices that plugged into the IIc's serial ports. Two such popular devices were the <i>Mockingboard-D</i> and <i>Echo IIc</i>.</p>

<p>For those wishing to use the Apple IIc as a standard desktop machine, Apple sold an optional small 9" monochrome CRT display with a stand and a 14" color composite monitor. A mouse was another popular add-on, especially since it required no interface card and simply plugged directly into back of the machine (MousePaint, a clone of the popular MacPaint, shipped with the IIc's mouse). An external 5.25 floppy drive, matching the style of the IIc, was also made available. Later 3.5 floppy storage became an option with the "intelligent" UniDisk 3.5 which contained its own miniature computer inside (CPU, RAM, firmware) to overcome the issue of using a high-speed floppy drive on a 1 MHz machine.</p>
