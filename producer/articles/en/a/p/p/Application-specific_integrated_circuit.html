<p>An <b>application-specific integrated circuit</b> (ASIC) is an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrated_circuit.html" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuit</a> (IC) customised for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use. For example, a chip designed solely to run a <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_phone.html" title="Cell phone">cell phone</a> is an ASIC. In contrast, the <a href="../../../7/4/0/7400_series.html" title="7400 series">7400 series</a> and <a href="../../../4/0/0/4000_series.html" title="4000 series">4000 series</a> integrated circuits are logic building blocks that can be wired together to perform many different applications. Intermediate between ASICs and standard products are <i><a href="../../../a/p/p/Application_specific_standard_product.html" title="Application specific standard product">application specific standard products</a> (ASSPs)</i>.</p>
<p>As feature sizes have shrunk and design tools improved over the years, the maximum complexity (and hence functionality) possible in an ASIC has grown from 5,000 <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic_gate.html" title="Logic gate">gates</a> to over 100 million. Modern ASICs often include entire 32-bit <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microprocessor.html" title="Microprocessor">processors</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory.html" title="Memory">memory</a> blocks including <a href="../../../r/e/a/Read-only_memory.html" title="Read-only memory">ROM</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/m/RAM_e536.html" title="RAM">RAM</a>, <a href="../../../e/e/p/EEPROM_32b6.html" title="EEPROM">EEPROM</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flash_memory.html" title="Flash memory">Flash</a> and other large building blocks. Such an ASIC is often termed a SoC (<a href="../../../s/y/s/System-on-a-chip.html" title="System-on-a-chip">System-on-a-chip</a>). Designers of digital ASICs use a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardware_description_language.html" title="Hardware description language">hardware description language</a> (HDL), such as <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verilog.html" title="Verilog">Verilog</a> or <a href="../../../v/h/d/VHDL_01eb.html" title="VHDL">VHDL</a>, to describe the functionality of ASICs.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/i/e/Field-programmable_gate_array.html" title="Field-programmable gate array">Field-programmable gate arrays</a> (FPGA) are the modern day equivalent of 7400 series logic and a breadboard, containing programmable logic blocks and programmable interconnects that allow the same FPGA to be used in many different applications. For smaller designs and/or lower production volumes, FPGA's may be more cost effective than an ASIC design. The <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-recurring_engineering.html" title="Non-recurring engineering">Non-recurring engineering</a> cost (the cost to setup the factory to produce a particular ASIC) can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>The general term application specific integrated circuit includes FPGAs, but most designers use ASIC only for non field programmable devices (e.g. standard cell or sea of gates) and differ between ASIC and FPGAs</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Application-specific_integrated_circuit.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The initial ASICs used gate array technology. <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferranti.html" title="Ferranti">Ferranti</a> produced perhaps the first gate-array, the ULA (<a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncommitted_Logic_Array_6a50.html" title="Uncommitted Logic Array">Uncommitted Logic Array</a>), around 1980. Customization occurred by varying the metal interconnect mask. ULAs had complexities of up to a few thousand gates. Later versions became more generalized, with different base dies customised by both metal and polysilicon layers. Some base dies include RAM elements.</p>
<p><a name="Standard_cell_design" id="Standard_cell_design"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Application-specific_integrated_circuit.html" title="Edit section: Standard cell design">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Standard cell design</span></h2>
<p>In the mid 1980s a designer would choose an ASIC manufacturer and implement their design using the design tools available from the manufacturer. While third party design tools were available, there was not an effective link from the third party design tools to the layout and actual semiconductor process performance characteristics of the various ASIC manufacturers. Most designers ended up using factory specific tools to complete the implementation of their designs. A solution to this problem that also yielded a much higher density device was the implementation of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_cell.html" title="Standard cell">Standard Cells</a>. Every ASIC manufacturer could create functional blocks with known electrical characteristics, such as propagation delay, capacitance and inductance, that could also be represented in third party tools. Standard Cell design is the utilization of these functional blocks to achieve very high gate density and good electrical performance. Standard cell design fits between Gate Array and Full Custom design in terms of both its NRE (Non-Recurring Engineering) and recurring component cost.</p>
<p>By the late 1980s, logic synthesis tools, such as <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design_Compiler_a35e.html" title="Design Compiler">Design Compiler</a>, became available. Such tools could compile HDL descriptions into a gate-level netlist. This enabled a style of design called standard-cell design. Standard-cell <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrated_Circuit_e8c5.html" title="Integrated Circuit">Integrated Circuits</a> (ICs) are designed in the following conceptual stages, although these stages overlap significantly in practice.</p>
<p>These steps, implemented with a level of skill common in the industry, almost always produce a final device that correctly implements the original design, unless flaws are later introduced by the physical fabrication process.</p>
<ol>
<li>A team of design engineers starts with a non-formal understanding of the required functions for a new ASIC, usually derived from <a href="../../../r/e/q/Requirements_analysis.html" title="Requirements analysis">Requirements analysis</a>.</li>
<li>The design team constructs a description of an ASIC to achieve these goals using an HDL. This process is analogous to writing a computer program in a high-level language. This is usually called the RTL (<a href="../../../r/e/g/Register_transfer_level.html" title="Register transfer level">Register transfer level</a>) design.</li>
<li>Suitability for purpose is verified by <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simulation.html" title="Simulation">simulation</a>. A virtual system created in software, using a tool such as <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtutech.html" title="Virtutech">Virtutech's</a> <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simics.html" title="Simics">Simics</a>, can simulate the performance of ASICs at speeds up to billions of simulated instructions per second.</li>
<li>A logic synthesis tool, such as <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design_Compiler_a35e.html" title="Design Compiler">Design Compiler</a>, transforms the RTL design into a large collection of lower-level constructs called standard cells. These constructs are taken from a standard-cell library consisting of pre-characterized collections of gates (such as 2 input nor, 2 input nand, inverters, etc.). The standard cells are typically specific to the planned manufacturer of the ASIC. The resulting collection of standard cells, plus the needed electrical connections between them, is called a gate-level netlist.</li>
<li>The gate-level netlist is next processed by a placement tool which places the standard cells onto a region representing the final ASIC. It attempts to find a placement of the standard cells, subject to a variety of specified constraints. Sometimes advanced techniques such as <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simulated_annealing.html" title="Simulated annealing">simulated annealing</a> are used to optimise placement.</li>
<li>The routing tool takes the physical placement of the standard cells and uses the netlist to create the electrical connections between them. Since the search space is large, this process will produce a “sufficient” rather than “globally-optimal” solution. The output is a set of <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photomask.html" title="Photomask">photomasks</a> enabling a <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabrication_%28semiconductor%29.html" title="Fabrication (semiconductor)">Semiconductor Fabrication</a> to produce physical ICs.</li>
<li>Close estimates of final delays, parasitic resistances and capacitances, and power consumptions can then be made. In the case of a digital circuit, this will then be further mapped into delay information. These estimates are used in a final round of testing. This testing demonstrates that the device will function correctly over all extremes of the process, voltage and temperature. When this testing is complete the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photomask.html" title="Photomask">photomask</a> information is released for chip fabrication.</li>
</ol>
<p>These design steps (or flow) are also common to standard product design. <b>The significant difference is that Standard Cell design uses the manufacturer's cell libraries that have been used in potentially hundreds of other design implementations and therefore are of much lower risk than full custom design. Standard Cells produce a design density that is cost effective, and they can also integrate IP cores and SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) effectively, unlike Gate-Arrays.</b></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Application-specific_integrated_circuit.html" title="Edit section: Gate array design">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gate array design</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../g/a/t/Gate_array.html" title="Gate array">Gate Array</a> design is a manufacturing method in which the diffused layers, i.e. transistors and other active devices, are predefined and wafers containing such devices are held in stock prior to metallization, in other words, unconnected. The physical design process then defines the interconnections of the final device. For most ASIC manufacturers, this consists of from two to as many as five metal layers, each metal layer running perpendicular to the one below it. Non-recurring engineering costs are much lower as photo-lithographic masks are required only for the metal layers, and production cycles are much shorter as metallization is a comparatively quick process. <b>It is also important to the designer that minimal propagation delays can be achieved in ASICs versus the <a href="../../../f/p/g/FPGA_a1b5.html" title="FPGA">FPGA</a> solutions available in the marketplace.</b> Gate Array ASICs are always a compromise as mapping a given design onto what a manufacturer held as a stock wafer never gives 100% utilization. Often difficulties in routing the interconnect require migration onto a larger array device with consequent increase in the piece part price. These difficulties are often a result of the layout software used to develop the interconnect.</p>
<p>Pure, logic only Gate Array Design is rarely implemented by circuit designers today, replaced almost entirely by field programmable devices, such as <a href="../../../f/p/g/FPGA_a1b5.html" title="FPGA">FPGAs</a> (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), which can be programmed by the user and thus offer minimal tooling charges (<a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-recurring_engineering.html" title="Non-recurring engineering">Non-recurring engineering</a> (NRE)), marginally increased piece part cost and comparable performance. Today Gate Arrays are evolving into <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structured_ASIC_93fc.html" title="Structured ASIC">Structured ASICs</a> that consist of a large <a href="../../../i/p/_/IP_core_de84.html" title="IP core">IP core</a> like a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Processor.html" title="Processor">processor</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_signal_processing.html" title="Digital signal processing">DSP</a> unit, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peripheral.html" title="Peripheral">peripherals</a>, standard <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_bus.html" title="Computer bus">interfaces</a>, integrated memories <a href="../../../s/t/a/Static_random_access_memory.html" title="Static random access memory">SRAM</a>, and a block of reconfigurable uncommited logic. This shift is largely because ASIC devices are capable of integrating such large blocks of system functionality and "system on a chip" requires far more than just logic blocks.</p>
<p>The term "Gate Array" is almost synonymous and interchangeable with the term "Semi-Custom". Which term you would use depends on who you are; if you are a process engineer, more likely than not you would use "Semi-Custom" whereas if you are a logic (or gate level) designer, "Gate-Array" would probably be your term of choice.</p>
<p><a name="Full-custom_design" id="Full-custom_design"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Application-specific_integrated_circuit.html" title="Edit section: Full-custom design">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Full-custom design</span></h2>
<p>By contrast, Full-Custom ASIC Design defines all the photo lithographic layers of the device. Full Custom Design is used for both ASIC design and for Standard Product design.</p>
<p>The benefits of Full-Custom Design usually include <b>reduced area (and therefore recurring component cost), performance improvements and also the ability to integrate (include) analog components and other pre-designed (and thus fully verified) components such as microprocessor cores that form a System-On-Chip.</b> <b>The disadvantages of Full-Custom can include increased manufacturing and design time, increased non-recurring engineering costs, more complexity in the Computer Aided Design (CAD) system and a much higher skill requirement on the part of the design team.</b> However for digital only designs, "standard-cell" cell libraries together with modern CAD systems can offer considerable performance/cost benefits with low risk. Automated layout tools are quick and easy to use and also offer the possibility to "hand-tweak" or manually optimise any performance limiting aspect of the design.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Application-specific_integrated_circuit.html" title="Edit section: Structured/platform design">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Structured/platform design</span></h2>
<p>Structured (also referred to as Platform) ASIC Design is an ambiguous expression, with different meanings in different contexts. This is a relatively new term in the industry, which is why there is some variation in its definition. However, the basic premise of a Structured/Platform ASIC is that both manufacturing cycle time and design cycle time are reduced compared to cell-based ASIC by virtue of <b>there being pre-defined metal layers (thus reducing manufacturing time) and pre-characterization of what is on the silicon (thus reducing design cycle time).</b> One definition states that <i>In a "structured ASIC" design, the logic mask-layers of a device are predefined by the ASIC vendor (or in some cases by a third party). Design differentiation and customization is achieved by creating custom metal layers that create custom connections between predefined lower-layer logic elements. "Structured ASIC" technology is seen as bridging the gap between field-programmable gate arrays and "standard-cell" ASIC designs. Because only a small number of chip layers must be custom-produced, "structured ASIC" designs have much smaller non-recurring expenditures (NRE) than "standard-cell" or "full-custom" chips, which require that a full mask set be produced for every design.</i> This is effectively the same definition as a Gate Array.</p>
<p>What makes a Structured/Platform ASIC different from a gate array is that in a gate array the predefined metal layers serve to make manufacturing turnaround faster. In a Structured/Platform ASIC the predefined metallization is primarily to reduce cost of the mask sets and is also used to make the design cycle time significantly shorter as well. For example, in a cell-based or gate-array design the user often must design power, clock, and test structures themselves; these are predefined in most Structured/Platform ASICs and therefore can save time and expense for the designer compared to gate-array. Likewise, the design tools used for Structured/Platform ASIC can be substantially lower cost and easier (faster) to use than cell-based tools, because the tools do not have to perform all the functions that cell-based tools do. In some cases, the Structured/Platform ASIC vendor requires that customized tools for their device (for example, custom physical synthesis) be used, also allowing for the design to be brought into manufacturing more quickly. ChipX, Inc. and eAsic are examples of vendors offering this kind of Structured ASIC.</p>
<p>One other important aspect about Structured/Platform ASIC is that it allows IP that is common to certain applications or industry segments to be "built in", rather than "designed in". By building the IP directly into the architecture the designer can again save both time and money compared to designing IP into a cell-based ASIC.</p>
<p>The best advice is to read carefully how the vendor defines its particular Structured or Platform ASIC, as there are significant differences between vendors offering these devices.</p>
<p>The Altera technique of producing a structured cell ASIC where the cells are the same design as the FPGA, but the programmable routing is replaced with fixed wire interconnect is called HardCopy.<sup id="_ref-EW_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EW" title="">[1]</a></sup> These devices then do not need re-programming and cannot be re-programmed as an FPGA.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Cell Libraries of logical primitives are usually provided by the device manufacturer as part of the service. Although they will incur no additional cost, their release will be covered by the terms of a <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non_disclosure_agreement.html" title="Non disclosure agreement">non disclosure agreement</a> (NDA) and they will be regarded as intellectual property by the manufacturer. Usually their physical design will be pre-defined as so they could be termed hard macros.</p>
<p>But what most engineers understand as "<a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellectual_property.html" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a>" are <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core.html" title="Semiconductor intellectual property core">IP cores</a>, designs purchased from a third party as sub-components of a larger ASIC. They may be provided as an HDL description (often termed a soft macro), or as a fully routed design that could be printed directly onto an ASIC’s mask (often termed a hard macro). Many organizations now sell such pre-designed IP, and larger organizations may have an entire department or division to produce such IP for the rest of the organization. For example, one can purchase CPUs, ethernet, USB or telephone interfaces. Indeed, the wide range of functions now available is a significant factor in the phenomenal increase in electronics in the late <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> and early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a>; as intellectual property takes a lot of time and investment to create, its re-use and further development cuts product cycle times dramatically and creates better products.</p>
<p>Soft Macros are often process independent; i.e., they can be fabricated on a wide range of manufacturing processes and indeed different manufacturers.</p>
<p>Hard Macros are process limited and usually further design effort must be invested to migrate (port) to a different process or manufacturer.</p>

<p>Some manufacturers offer Multi-Project Wafers (MPW) as a method of obtaing low cost prototypes. Often called shuttles, these MPW, containing several designs, run at regular, scheduled intervals on a "cut and go" basis, usually with very little liability on the part of the manufacturer. The contract involves the assembly and packaging of a handful of devices. The service usually involves the supply of a physical design data base i.e. masking information or Pattern Generation (PG) tape. The manufacturer is often referred to as a "silicon foundry" due to the low involvement it has in the process.
