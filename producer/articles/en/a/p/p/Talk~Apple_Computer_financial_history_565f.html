<p>I wanted to add a sentence or two to the main article on Apple Computer Corp, but a senior editor would not allow it, and told me that I was annoying people by contributing. So I took this route. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeveloperFrom1983_827e.html" title="User:DeveloperFrom1983">DeveloperFrom1983</a> 03:39, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Trivial information about a stock split? And a sentence about what they were peddling in 1983? As a "retired professor of computer science" I would think you'd have more to contribute than crowing about how much money you made on your inestments. I can almost understand that editor's sentiments. <a href="../../../e/w/l/User%7EEwlyahoocom_d1b9.html" title="User:Ewlyahoocom">Ewlyahoocom</a> 21:51, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did not make money from Apple Stock. It takes money to make money, and I do not have money. But the stock split that already occurred is important business information. There were people, unfortunately for me, not I, who hextupled their investment. But the stock split is not trivial information. It is important information in an article about the company. Why are so many Wikipedian editors so uncivil and so contentious? I am not "crowing about how much money" I "made" on my "investments", since that is not the case. Why are you so uncivil and so unkind to others? Does it satisfy you in some way that you can do on the internet yet not in person? I thought Wikipedia was better than this. This is like those chat rooms that I avoid. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeveloperFrom1983_827e.html" title="User:DeveloperFrom1983">DeveloperFrom1983</a> 06:59, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Imagine if you would for a moment that you're back in your office and one of your fresh grad students comes in. He announces, not asks, what direction his research is going to take. How would you have responded? Perhaps at first you might even be amused and try to guide him with a gentle hand. You check to see what's he's published and find nothing. Now imagine that he ignores you and continues on. How would you have responded then?

<p>About the hypothetical graduate student</p>
<p>I would think that he or she was innovative and clever. I would have nurtured his or her enthusiasm and never used uncivil language, insults or name-calling. In fact, this has occurred more than once in real life, not just in the world of the internet when we do not meet face to face. If the person had an idea with which I disagreed, I would still keep an open mind and a civil tongue.

<p>No. The Apple Computer article is already long enough, and this article has a clear subject. There are no guidelines saying stock symbols cannot be talked about. I don't think the company article should be cluttered with the financial/stock information that is in this article. I am trying to expand this article to a decent size (15k+ hopefully). — <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWackymacs_1999.html" title="User:Wackymacs">Wackymacs</a> 16:55, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In that case, why not put one for X_(stock symbol), C_(stock symbol), GOOGL, DB_(stock_symbol, <a href="../../../r/h/a/RHAT_3dce.html" title="RHAT">RHAT</a>, <a href="../../../c/s/c/CSCO_85fd.html" title="CSCO">CSCO</a>, and a slew of other ones? To me it doesn't seem the proper way to do it. If this topic is about the Apple financial information (as it seems), then it belongs within the Apple topic. If that article is long enough already, then create a section called Apple Finances or somesuch. Just my 0.02USD. -<a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User:^demon">^demon</a> 21:38, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is this article's purpose? Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, this is not the place to publish stock price analysis. I support merging into <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computer_f26c.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a> the few parts of this article that won't become obsolete in the near future. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 04:12, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fine then. Nobody agrees with me. I say we rename this Apple Computer Finances as a sister article of <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computer_f26c.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a> and then in the main article use summary style with a new ==Finances and stock== section using the {{mainarticle}} template. — <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWackymacs_1999.html" title="User:Wackymacs">Wackymacs</a> 07:13, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with the move or with the merge. This article shouldn't be just about the stock symbol, it could be about Apple's financial history.
