<p>I have started the page on <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apparent_weight.html" title="Apparent weight">apparent weight</a> in order help solve some of the ambiguities I have seen with my students (that is rather common in many textbooks) on what a scale or balance really measures. One think is sure: a spring does not measure the weight of a body itself but another force that also acts on the body that is often referred to as the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apparent_weight.html" title="Apparent weight">apparent weight</a>. The difference between these two notions appears explicitely when the weighing scale used does not indicate the value for the weight that would be expected. The apparent weight is therefore not the weight. When a body is at rest in the vicinity of the Earth surface, there are at least 2 forces that acts upon this body. One is the weight, the force exerted on the body due to its own mass and Earth mass, and another one exerted, in most conditions by the surface on which the body is laying. This other force, often called the normal force (as it is perpendicular in most conditions to the surface, itself often horizontal) is sometimes wrongly called the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reaction_force.html" title="Reaction force">reaction force</a> to the weight. The values of these 2 forces are the same, in certain conditions only, when the acceleration is zero, that is rather common, leading to the confusion that should not appear in the definition of the apparent weight.</p>
<p>Indeed, let us consider a body of mass 'm' that lays on a horizontal surface near the sruface of the Earth. The forces that are exerted on this body are&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>its weight, <span class="texhtml"><i>W</i><sub><i>m</i></sub></span> that is the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitational_force.html" title="Gravitational force">force of gravity</a>, which value is given by</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>a force exerted by the surface on the body, that exists otherwise the body would fall through the surface.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Newton law tells us that the total force exerted on the body,</p>

<p>The article is totally confusing to me. I do not find apparent weight a useful concept. To me the total "supporting reaction force" is the weight whether this is from the floor, buoyant fluids, or a spring scale. Accelerating frames do indeed change weight not just "apparent weight". --<a href="../../../o/p/2E/User%7EOp._Deo_0aaf.html" title="User:Op. Deo">Op. Deo</a> 07:52, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you define weight as the scale reading it changes, but if you define weight as the force of gravity on a body, then that is not at all changing in each frame. In order to have a consistent terminology then, weight is defined as the latter, and so we need the concept of <i>apparent weight</i> to express how much we feel we weigh/what a scale reads in order to distinguish them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The fundamental problem is that every physics student knows enough to know that weight is caused by gravity, but the everyday usage is that weight == scale reading, leading to the wrong impression that scales should read the same in in accelerating frames because they "measure mass." The whole thing is just another example of how physics has devoloped a precise definition for something and students of physics necessarily have some difficulties as they readjust their lexicon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree though that the current article is lacking and could benefit from some examples. --<a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurascudder_7cfd.html" title="User:Laurascudder">Laura Scudder</a> | <a href="../../../l/a/u/User_talk%7ELaurascudder_bd8d.html" title="User talk:Laurascudder">Talk</a> 15:10, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the comment. I happend by this page and the concept of apparent weight surprised me. As you say it is a student problem. It is one which I have not thought about since my early teens.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>In Newtonian physics we work with mass, the gravitational field and the resulting force, and the force required to produce acceleration. I dont think there is a precise single definition of weight. It would be of course just a name for one of the forces relevant in a typical problem. I dont think that I have never found giving one of the forces the name weight to be particularly useful, except if I was using the word weight in its traditional everyday sense. That is in a description of the mass of something that was required only to be of low precision rather than for use in a physics equation. ( I dont use weight in my normal repertoire of equations)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here is an example - I might say one apparatus is heavier than second, and I might describe the processes of determining their mass as weighing them with scales of some type (either force meters - or mass balances). But I would be doing this because I was doing some everyday activity such as determining what postage was due to be paid on the apparatus. If I needed the weight in order to do some engineering calculations concerning a cable to support the apparatus I would convert the result of my weighing experiment to force units, or if I wanted place my apparatus in a rocket to go to space I would use the weighing to determine the mass units.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>After looking at this page I wandered around and looked at the <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weight.html" title="Weight">weight</a> page. I was disturbed to see that section 2 "Weight as Force" brought in <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apparent_weight.html" title="Apparent weight">apparent weight</a>. I then looked at their talk page and was quite shocked at the confused approach.</dd>

</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What are these wiki articles intended to be? Articles for the general reader? Tutorial articles for science students? Rigorous scientific articles? Each question requires a different approach, which is hopelessly muddled in the present article on weight. As afar as apparent weight is concerned. I would not touch it for the geneal reader. I would just say that weight as measured by a spring balance changes. For the early student I accept that some teachers might want to use the concept of apparent weight. But for the physicist and particular engineers such as space engineers then we dont really use weight at all in our equations.</dd>

<dd>I am a novice at Wiki, and came here very recently to contribute some history that was missing. I was disturbed to find that the place seems infested with fellow scientists and IT people (perhaps not surprising of course). I have aready done a few edits on science topics which I felt were very incomplete and I have nore some science articles which are crying out for me to write. However, I am seriously doubting whether I should jump with my opinions into the article about weight and apparent weight. <a href="../../../o/p/2E/User%7EOp._Deo_0aaf.html" title="User:Op. Deo">Op.

<li>Added example, clarified some terms. I'm having issues with formatting the equations and could use some help, so I'm going to add a cleanup tag to the talk page. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuTheSheep_0149.html" title="User:StuTheSheep">StuTheSheep</a> 14:14, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I found this page very useful in understanding "g force" and how the human sensation of increased or decreased "apparent" weight (or weighlessness for that matter) relates to the body undergoing acceleration. Thank you for a very concise explanation, and the example. Well done. A satisfied reader.</p>
<p>Hey shouldn't m/s<sup>2</sup> be expressed as m/s<sup>-2</sup>? or does it mean the same thing?</p>
