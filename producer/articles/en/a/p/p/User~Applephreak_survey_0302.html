	    <p>This is a survey about the Apple II. I'm trying to get a feeling for why people bought these computers. I've heard varying reasons (visicalc being one of them). Your participation is greatly appreciated&#160;:)</p>
<p>This is how to do it. First click on "edit this page". Next select and copy the survey questions below. Paste the questions at the place that says "paste here". Then add your answers to the survey. Leave the original questions in place so the next person can repeat the process. That's it!</p>
<p>All questions are optional, don't feel obligated to answer the "how old were you" or "did you copy software" questions. Even partial responses are valuable.</p>
<p>Again, thanks!</p>

<dd>When I was an undergrad (1979) I worked on a project which used a fully tricked out original Apple II (max memory, accelerator, extra floppy drive, hard drive, and a Mockingboard voice card so it could talk). With all slots filled, it ran so hot that we always had to keep the cover off and have a couple of room fans blow right down on the hardware. Someone had written some software so that when it used the modem to dial a campus mini-computer (a Dec PDP-10) it would recite the phone numbers in a robotic voice, and then tell you if it was successful or not in plain English (robot inflected). Since connections were "iffy" it would keep trying and we could do other work until it told us it had a good connection. We'd show this off to visiting researchers who thought it was pretty cool (for that time); however, the voice board was slightly warped and when the machine got too hot it could slightly unseat from its slot and start garbling its messages. With all the high tech stuff on display (high tech for late 70's) it was still kind of cool to just smack the Apple II when it started garbling, which would reseat the voice card and all would be well. You had to be there, I guess!</dd>

<dd>I remember sometimes taking out the 80 column card (slot 3?) so <i>Wizardry</i>'s text would display properly. Some kind of weird incompatability made the text "double" with the 80 column card, lliikkee tthhiiss. It was still playable, but I prefered the 40 column text, as it was intended to be.</dd>

<dd>I remember my jaw dropping the first time I played <i>Bard's Tale</i> seeing incredible animation I never thought possible on an Apple II. I remember spending hours creating my bizarre pinball creations with <i>PCS</i>. I remember being envied by my friends who didn't have an Apple II. I remember spending hours with friends creating "the best" <i>Lode Runner</i> levels.</dd>

<dd>Though it was laughably underpowered by today's standard, and even paled in comparison to some contemporary systems like the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_64.html" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a>, it was the system that launched my interest in computers and started me on my current career path. I remember staying up way past midnight some nights playing <i>Wizardry</i>, <i>Bard's Tale</i> or <i>SunDog</i>, just to see what would happen next. I really envied the guys who were able to make those games for a living (and some of them became really wealthy doing it, but that was just a fringe benefit).

<dd>Yes, and Yes.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I had a //gs, followed by a Mac LC II, then two mac clones (a Power Computing and a Starmax). I then jumped ship as this was Apple's Dark Days. Today I still own PC's at home, but the product I develop ships on both Mac and Win so I use Mac a ton also, and have a company-owned Mac laptop that comes home with me every night.</dd>

<p>1. What was the first apple II model you bought? (e.g. Apple I, Apple II+, Apple IIgs)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, a //gs. However, I used my Dad's II+, //e, and //c. (We had the //c only briefly.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. What year did you get it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>1991 for the //gs. The others were purchased in the mid-80s starting in about 1983.</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. Did you have any add-ons, like extra memory?</p>
<dl>
<dd>For the //GS only</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Transwarp CPU</li>
<li>SCSI</li>
<li>50~ meg hard drive</li>
<li>5.25 and 3.5" drives</li>
<li>Imagewriter II</li>
<li>2 megs of ram (I think I have the amount right)</li>
</ul>
<p>4. How much, roughly, did it cost?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Been to long for me to remember.</dd>
</dl>
<p>5. How old were you when you bought it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>22</dd>
</dl>
<p>6. Which country did you live in when you bought it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>USA</dd>
</dl>
<p>7. What led you to buy the apple over potential alternatives?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Appleworks, Applesoft, other word processors</dd>
</dl>
<p>8. Why did you buy it? If your parents bought it, what did they <i>plan on</i> doing with it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The first computers were mainly purchased to give me something to do term papers on in High School. My handwriting was lousy and slow. Typing them up was faster with fewer errors and resulted in readable text.</dd>
</dl>
<p>9. What did you <i>end up</i> doing with it? (mine ended up being used mostly for games)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Initially, the Apple word processor for the II+ couldn't do lower case and so I only played games on it. Then one day I spotted the Applesoft manual and considered it interesting. I made that a career. The later computers expanded on that.</dd>
</dl>
<p>10. What software did you use? Any favorite games?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Appleworks and Applesoft. Beagle Bros AW products.</dd>
<dd>Games: Lode Runner</dd>
</dl>
<p>11. Did you buy all the software you used, or was any of it copied? (I think we're past the statute of limitations on this)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not aware of any illegal copies.</dd>
</dl>
<p>12. Did you write programs on the apple? Did you ever use "PEEK" or "POKE"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wrote plenty of Applesoft programs. I did use both Peek and Poke from time to time as my skill improved. They were the only way to access the extended memory graphics systems. Unfortunately, //gs graphics from Applesoft were a mess.</dd>

<p>1. What was the first apple II model you bought? (e.g. Apple I, Apple II+, Apple IIgs)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apple //c</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. What year did you get it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>1984</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. Did you have any add-ons, like extra memory?</p>
<dl>
<dd>External 5 1/4" Floppy Drive</dd>
</dl>
<p>4. How much, roughly, did it cost?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure, given as a graduation gift.</dd>
</dl>
<p>5. How old were you when you bought it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>17</dd>
</dl>
<p>6. Which country did you live in when you bought it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>USA</dd>
</dl>
<p>7. What led you to buy the apple over potential alternatives?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The local schools had Apple II systems exclusively, so that's what I wanted.</dd>
</dl>
<p>8. Why did you buy it? If your parents bought it, what did they <i>plan on</i> doing with it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The parents bought it so that I could write college papers. I wanted it to play <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima.html" title="Ultima">Ultima</a> and other games, as well as logging into the local <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulletin_board_system.html" title="Bulletin board system">BBS</a> scene.</dd>
</dl>
<p>9. What did you <i>end up</i> doing with it? (mine ended up being used mostly for games)</p>
<dl>
<dd>See above answer. Thankfully, it was equally good at both tasks. My //c "ended up" in my closet, but it still works as of about a year ago.</dd>
</dl>
<p>10. What software did you use? Any favorite games?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I use pfs:write for writing, then eventually Appleworks. I played all the Ultimas from <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima_III_dd8b.html" title="Ultima III">III</a> onward. The <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infocom.html" title="Infocom">Infocom</a> games were also old favorites.</dd>
</dl>
<p>11. Did you buy all the software you used, or was any of it copied? (I think we're past the statute of limitations on this)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I bought some, and I copied some. Locksmith and Copy II+ were my friends, as I was a broke student with a love of video games. If I played something a lot, I'd buy it, once I had the cash.</dd>
</dl>
<p>12. Did you write programs on the apple? Did you ever use "PEEK" or "POKE"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I used to take some of the amazing 2-line programs from <a href="../../../n/i/b/Nibble_%28magazine%29.html" title="Nibble (magazine)">Nibble</a> and turn them into interesting boot-up sequences, but I rarely, if ever, wrote anything like that on my own. Modified perhaps, but never written from scratch.</dd>
</dl>
<p>13. Did you stick with apples for later computers?</p>
<dl>
<dd>My latest apple is a <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_mini.html" title="Mac mini">Mac mini</a>, purchased just 2 months ago.</dd>
</dl>
<p>14. What is your relation to computers today? User, coder, wikipedia editor?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tester, sometime coder, daily user.</dd>
</dl>
<p>15. Any precious Apple II memories to share?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe it was The Locksmith that had a disk bit editor. My cousins and I would edit some of the text strings in various games (mostly Ultima III) to say what <b>we</b> wanted them to say. It was code vandalism at its finest, but when you're a teenager, these things seem cool.</dd>
