<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fourth paragraph under Criticism</span></h2>
<p>The paragraph starting "Apple has used industry-standard hardware technologies for many years" doesn't seem to contain any criticism, and almost just seems like a promotional paragraph. With all of the other problems and iffy NPOV with that section, should the whole section be flagged as non-NPOV? There seems to be a whole lot more effort put into defense of criticisms, in general. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeggysmeg_7532.html" title="User:Smeggysmeg">Smeggysmeg</a> 01:17, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One radical idea would be to remove everything without a reference in the whole article and make a HTML comment to look at the talk page for pointers, which is where the old content would be. I think this would encourage people to try again in this area - the writing wouldn't be as good initially but fixing writing for the crowd of this article may be easier then waiting for someone to reference stuff here.</dd>
<dd>While we are on the subject, the three references I put at the end were suggestions and may not actually back up much - so it still could be basically 90% unreferenced...</dd>
<dd>Hopefully I'll have time to nail a few of these points down anyway&#160;:\. <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a> 22:34, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Citations</span></h2>
<p>What is up with all these "citation required" and the numereous citations??? So as long as someone cites any publication, then it is all good nevermind that the people who write those articles might not be any more knowledgable than a Wiki writer? The number of citations included just for the list of Apple Fellows is ridiculous. So is requiring a citation describing the length of the crowds at the NYC and Tokyo openings; if I was there and I witnessed it, it doesn't count until someone quotes me in the NY Times? Is there some pedant demanding a citation for everything? There is almost as many citations here as there is in the Homosexuality article; and Apple Computer is a far less controversial topic ... but I guess I would need a citation for that statement too right? 66.171.76.241 04:10, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please review Wikipedia core policies to understand why citations are necessary. See <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>.

<dd>I have reviewed it and it still does not answer my concerns. Check out how citations are almost nonexistant in articles for mathematics, physics, philosophy (even Communism), and biography of famous musicians. My point is that there are so many citations and citations requirements of petty facts in the sections "User Culture" and "Criticism" that it degrades the overall quality of the article. Anyway that's all I have to say on this.66.171.76.241 03:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The general rule is that the less controversial the subject, the less need for citations. For example, pure mathematics is relatively uncontroversial (except for certain obscure cutting-edge areas). But other controversial areas, like law and business, need more citations. For example, when I first drafted the article on <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_J._Traynor_c67b.html" title="Roger J. Traynor">Roger J. Traynor</a>, I was immediately challenged on the issue of whether he was notable. I dug up some citations and no one has brought up the issue again. That is how Wikipedia works.--<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 17:15, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"The general rule is that the less controversial the subject, the less need for citations" - not if you are planning on FACing it... you generelly need every claim cited. These kind of articles are more difficult then books and such because the references are generally more numerous. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> is an article I contributed a lot to and I think is a good example of this kind of article and the referencing requirements. <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a> 22:26, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Seems like a bad solution to me, as the campaign is against the use of toxic chemicals in all Apple products, including iPods, not just Macs. Note that the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> page has a "Criticism" section, the <a href="../../../n/e/s/Nestl%C3%A9.html" title="Nestlé">Nestlé</a> page has a "Criticisms of Nestlé's business practices" section, the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> page has a "Criticism and controversy" subsection of the "History" section (and the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Google_253d.html" title="History of Google">History of Google</a> section has a more detailed "Criticism and controversy" section), and the <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_b74e.html" title="AT&amp;T">AT&amp;T</a> page has a "Privacy controversy" section, so it's not as if descriptions of criticisms of corporations are otherwise absent from the Wikipedia pages for corporations.</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, the Apple Computer page isn't simply about the history of Apple; it also has "Current products", "Corporate affairs", "Corporate culture", "User culture", and "Notable litigation" sections. <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Harris_fa37.html" title="User:Guy Harris">Guy Harris</a> 00:29, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I generally think that "criticisms" sections should be avoided, because many users take them as a dumping ground for every little "Apple sucks" thing they see. While some very notable criticisms may be worth noting (such as criticisms of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Explorer_6bc1.html" title="Internet Explorer">Internet Explorer</a>), I'm not sure that there's any reason to include that here. - <font style="color:#FF7518;background:#000;"><b>&#160;Mike&#160;</b></font><font style="color:#FF7518;background:#000;"><b>|&#160;trick or treat&#160;</b></font> 00:39, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fatal flaw of "integrated criticism" is that, given enough criticism (and counter-points) on a subject, the whole article would end up looking like the goal is to air dirty laundry, not to be precise and informative on the subject itself. Having a separate section helps maintain reader focus through the article. "Criticism" is just an aspect of a subject, anyhow, just like history, cultural impact, etc. are, and those other aspects tend to get sections, too, right? By extension, criticism articles in computing exist as a natural outcome of following <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> guidelines for when articles get lengthy... not because they're criticisms.</dd>

<p>I just viewed this page, and saw Apple's 2 previous logos instead of the computer-rendered Apple logo. Shouldn't the logo have stayed as the computer-rendered version? <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoronicles_d598.html" title="User:Moronicles">Moronicles</a> 21:37, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes - I've put that back. The infobox should have the current logo; the older logos are in a history section, where they belong. <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Harris_fa37.html" title="User:Guy Harris">Guy Harris</a> 21:43, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although not a requirement, I think that standardizing the cite tags would be a big improvement for this article. A lot of the references are of the external-link variety, whereas some ref name="foo" and cite templates would really improve the readability of the article. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 09:52, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversial claim of no viruses</span></h2>
<p>I think that the fact that apple claims to have no viruses on their computers at the current time yet there are known viruses should be added. I recently discovered after reading on apple.com that there are zero known viruses on apple computers running OS X that this is false. There are infact upwards of 44,000 according to one study. I can even provide where I read this. As well, a computer repair man in my local area has also confirmed that this IS true, and he is certified by apple. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrashedata_b2c3.html" title="User:Crashedata">Crashedata</a> 09:28, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can you provide a citation for your claim that there are functioning viruses for a patched copy of Mac OS X? While there have been a number of "scares", and there are indeed many thousands of viruses for "Classic" Mac OS, the current version of Mac OS X has no functioning viruses currently known.

<dd>There currently is no "virus" in the wild. Some have claimed that there are, but so far, those are simply malicious applications that can't really replicate on their own; each installation needs the user to provide an administrator password.

<dd>If you can provide where you read that there are "upwards of 44,000 viruses" on OS X, please do so. There might well be viruses, but that seems like a bit of a high number.

<p>Why would anyone develop a virus for a Mac? You'd hit almost no computers.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's a lot to be gained in reputation for being the "first" to hit OS X with a legitimate virus. And although it seems like a relatively small target compared to Windows, it's a target that is almost completely unprotected by virus software. A well-written virus on a Mac has a lot of potential for heavy effects. -- <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim D</a> 02:03, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
