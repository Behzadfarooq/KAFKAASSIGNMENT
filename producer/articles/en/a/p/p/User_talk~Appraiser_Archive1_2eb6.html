<p>I noticed that you've recently joined <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Minnesota_18d7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Minnesota">Wikipedia:WikiProject Minnesota</a>, and your to-do list has several articles about historic places in Minnesota. I just wanted to mention that I'm also interested in historic places in Minnesota as well, such as items on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Registered_Historic_Places_in_Minnesota_3a59.html" title="List of Registered Historic Places in Minnesota">List of Registered Historic Places in Minnesota</a>. (There's no chance I'll ever finish the list, of course.) I've also been working on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Minnesota_43cd.html" title="History of Minnesota">History of Minnesota</a> lately, trying to improve the article so it has a more comprehensive picture of the history of the state. If you're interested in helping out, feel free to contribute.</p>
<p>I also noticed that you're looking to write an article on Battle Creek Regional Park in St. Paul. I do a pretty good amount of mountain biking there, so I can probably help out with that viewpoint. I also have a number of pictures of the park during the fall, so let me know if you want any -- I can upload them at any time.</p>
<p>You probably also noticed that I updated <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndale_Park_7cb6.html" title="Lyndale Park">Lyndale Park</a> with a mention of Lyndale Farmstead Park -- mainly because people might get confused about two different parks with the same name. (Actually, I was confused first, so that's where I got the idea.) Lyndale Farmstead has the house of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Wirth_e3ec.html" title="Theodore Wirth">Theodore Wirth</a> in it, and the house is on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_4c8b.html" title="National Register of Historic Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>, so I have a couple pictures of it.</p>

<dd>I just realized I never answered your question about a category for Minnesotans with historical importance. As far as I know, there isn't such a category. For now, they can probably go into <a href="../../../h/i/s/Category%7EHistory_of_Minnesota_d7a8.html" title="Category:History of Minnesota">Category:History of Minnesota</a>; see that category for an example of what's in there now. If the number of articles about historic people starts to overwhelm the category, we can always split it. It isn't too much trouble. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 17:20, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! You're one of about a dozen wikipedians who have edited <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unity08.html" title="Unity08">Unity08</a> (which puts you in pretty rarified company&#160;:-)) and it occured to me that you might be interested in something in that vein.

<p>Hi Appraiser! Thanks for your kind note Yes, I can tell how hard you worked on that list. I pretty much googled all red links - a few were pretty bogus - most were bona fide and needed to stay for potential future articles, and a few were deleted articles listed in the deleted log. I did't touch any politicians. I did catch one misspelling that did have a corresponding article. I listed all names I deleted in the history summary so please feel free to double check me as I might have missed a misspelling. Thanks for checking and I love what you've done for that list. &#160;:) Have a great day. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECricket02_ffdd.html" title="User:Cricket02">Cricket02</a> 17:31, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it's looking damn good. A few questions. When do you use "main" vs. "seealso"? The article uses "main" for climate, geology, economy, etc. Why not for state fair? Also, should the Lake Agassiz sentence also mention the Red River? It seems to me the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_River_of_the_North_b2fd.html" title="Red River of the North">Red River of the North</a> valley was also a result of Agassiz.

<dd>It is indeed looking good. I choose see-also for the state fair becuase main looked wierd in the middle of a paragraph. Main wouldn't work on that section becuase it covers more than the state fair. I was torn on Agassiz becuase the existing sentance has great prose, so I left it. You want to try and merge them? I do actually think you pared music too much, I was going to talk to you about that. I asked some "crazy into music" friends of mine about who they thought were the main artists and you cut most of them :). I'll try and expand it back a bit tonight, but not too much. -<a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_48c1.html" title="User:Ravedave">Ravedave</a> <small><sup>(<a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_babyname_1bfa.html" title="User:Ravedave/babyname">help name my baby</a>)</sup></small> 19:52, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, the entire article is quickly approaching total cruft. Most of the cities I deleted were unmitigated suburbs of nearby large cities; in fact, I'd still say there's some shifting around to do in the article. Distance from other urban centres is just as important a factor, in fact, it would be the key factor.</p>
<p>Just to give some examples;</p>

Billings    Fargo, 607 mi

Dickinson   Bismarck, 97 mi

<p>Believe it or not, Paul Wellstone isn't an "American Progressive". Apparently that is a description of "American political figure active as a progressive (that is, advocating further government control over economic activity and expansion of direct democracy) in the Progressive Era (the 1890s to the 1910s)."

<p>Appraiser: Not too long ago, much like you are doing today, I marched through Wikipedia adding <b>Category:Fauna of Georgia (U.S. State)</b> to all sorts of animals.

Animals like the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Beaver_b6ae.html" title="American Beaver">American Beaver</a> probably exist in every state and so I guess I agreed that it was pretty crazy to put the beaver in the category for every state. If I ever get around to it, I may use a list for fauna of Georgia instead. I have tried to reserve the category for animals that are unique to Georgia or otherwise has some sort of special relationship to the state.</p>
<p>You can certainly do what you want, but I justed wanted to share my experience. You should also know that there is a community on Wikipedia that wants to do away with ‘'Fauna by State’’ completely and replace it by some sort of regional approach.--<a href="../../../t/l/m/User%7ETlmclain_4c55.html" title="User:Tlmclain">Tlmclain</a> | <a href="../../../t/l/m/User_talk%7ETlmclain_3ea7.html" title="User talk:Tlmclain">Talk</a> 23:25, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me get this straight - you want a guy from Georgia to help you with an article about Minnesota? I know we're supposed to be <b>bold</b> in editing, but isn't that a bit dangerous? ;) Seriously, I'm not sure that I could provide anything useful, but if I run into anything that I can help with, I'll give it a shot.--<a href="../../../t/l/m/User%7ETlmclain_4c55.html" title="User:Tlmclain">Tlmclain</a> | <a href="../../../t/l/m/User_talk%7ETlmclain_3ea7.html" title="User talk:Tlmclain">Talk</a> 01:57, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just looked at the Minnesota article and am quite impressed. From the Barnstar that you were awarded in November, I see that you were instrumental in moving this articel to FA status - congratulations! I have also confirmed that there is not much I can help with. I was fascinated by the fact that Minnesota has a "State photo," but noticed that it is not feature in an article or shown in the main article. You probably have seen it, but, if not, it can be found <a href="http://www.leg.state.mn.us/leg/symbols.asp#photo" class="external text" title="http://www.leg.state.mn.us/leg/symbols.asp#photo" rel="nofollow">here</a>. good luck with the rest of your clean-up. --<a href="../../../t/l/m/User%7ETlmclain_4c55.html" title="User:Tlmclain">Tlmclain</a> | <a href="../../../t/l/m/User_talk%7ETlmclain_3ea7.html" title="User talk:Tlmclain">Talk</a> 02:13, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I am no expert, it seems to me that "Grace" may already be in the public domain. The <a href="http://www.leg.state.mn.us/leg/symbols.asp#photo" class="external text" title="http://www.leg.state.mn.us/leg/symbols.asp#photo" rel="nofollow">Minnesota website</a> gives the date of the photo as 1918. <a href="../../../p/u/b/Wikipedia%7EPublic_domain_57d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Public domain">Wikipedia:Public domain</a>, a Wikipedia <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">guideline</a>, states: <i><b>In the U.S., any work published before January 1, 1923 anywhere in the world is in the public domain</b></i>. Thus, wouldn't "Grace" be in the public doman? --<a href="../../../t/l/m/User%7ETlmclain_4c55.html" title="User:Tlmclain">Tlmclain</a> | <a href="../../../t/l/m/User_talk%7ETlmclain_3ea7.html" title="User talk:Tlmclain">Talk</a> 04:06, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as the capitalization goes, I suppose I thought of it as an adjective derived from a proper noun, ie, Lesbos, the isle on which Sappho lived, the origin of the term, rather than a being originated from a political movement or other reasons. The image from Time magazine was one I retrieved from the Wikipedia data base, and as my knowledge of the specific workings of this copyright law is limited, I'll remove it pending further reasearch into its legality. I will also remove the red links. Unfortunately, most of this research was done in the library, so I don't have the books handy, and I'm not sure about how to go after the ISBN. Advice?

<p><i>I notice that you're adding {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiProject_National_Register_of_Historic_Places_b21e.html" title="Template:WikiProject National Register of Historic Places">WikiProject National Register of Historic Places</a>}} to places of histrical significance, but in some cases they are not listed on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Registered_Historic_Places_in_Minnesota_3a59.html" title="List of Registered Historic Places in Minnesota">List of Registered Historic Places in Minnesota</a>. Are you trying to follow the list, or expanding it to places that perhaps should be on the list? <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppraiser_5597.html" title="User:Appraiser">Appraiser</a> 13:44, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>I was adding the template to talk page of articles that are listed in <a href="../../../r/e/g/Category%7ERegistered_Historic_Places_in_Minnesota_78c0.html" title="Category:Registered Historic Places in Minnesota">Category:Registered Historic Places in Minnesota</a>. Presumably, everything that's in the category should be on the list as well. Some of them might not exactly match, like the state parks. For example, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Mounds_State_Park_c5f2.html" title="Blue Mounds State Park">Blue Mounds State Park</a> itself isn't on the National Register, but the WPA structures are on the National Register. Similarly, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grain_Belt_%28beer%29_56d9.html" title="Grain Belt (beer)">Grain Belt (beer)</a> isn't on the National Register, but the brewery on Broadway Street Northeast (under the name <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis_Brewing_Company_b4a8.html" title="Minneapolis Brewing Company">Minneapolis Brewing Company</a>) is on the Register. (Actually, I was debating whether the state parks and similar places should be linked to the project. That may be open to interpretation.)</p>
<p>It's also possible that there are places within the category that aren't linked on the list, since the "official" names on the list don't always match the article names in Wikipedia. I've found that a lot on the NRHP lists for the other 49 states. If you see that, feel free to fix the link on the list. I've had to do a lot of link repair like that.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, if you can think of any specific articles where I added the WikiProject template to something that doesn't look like an actual place on the National Register, feel free to ask me about it -- it's possible that I made mistakes. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 15:59, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
