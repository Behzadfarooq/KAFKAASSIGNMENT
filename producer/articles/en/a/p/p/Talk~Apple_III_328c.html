<p>It was standard form when referring to the pre-Macintosh Apple machines, intended to recall the styling of the machines' logos. "Apple II" was generally written "Apple ][" and the Apple III used slashes.</p>

<p>Apple Computer also made a 20-megabyte Profile that sold for $3,500.</p>
<p>That figures out to $175 per megabyte by yesterday’s standards! My computer today is 250 gigabyte. Lets see, 250 gigabyte at a cost of $175.00 would be about $43,750,000. I would say buying a hard drive today for a couple of hundreds bucks is a bargain. Thank god for technology.</p>
<p>I owned an Apple /// Business computer with a 20 megabyte Profile and used it over 10 years, well up into the nineties. Later I only used the machine for a couple of jobs as time went on. It sat in our spare office. I had become so accustomed to using its flagship software “Three EZ Pieces” and Apple Business Basic (ABB) that I kept on using it. It did things that the newer computers didn’t. I wrote one program that would fill out invoices. The printer would imprint through four carbon copies. Before I wrote that program we filled out our invoices on the IBM Selectric typewriter that cost $800.00. The problem with the Selectric typewriter was that when a mistake was made, it messed up 4 carbon copies and the whiteout look unprofessional. The Apple /// and ABB made office life much better. I also wrote an industrial engineering program AutoCAM with Apple Business Basic that did “cam layout” for Brown &amp; Sharpe Screw Machines in just a few minutes (saved an hour over conventional methods) and then later with Visual Basic 1.0 (on an HP) when it first came out, and now written in Visual Basic 6.0. I also wrote a payroll, and a quoting program for the Apple /// machine and used it in my company. I thought it should be mentioned that the Apple /// came with a PROFILE with a capacity of 20 mgs at a cost of $3,500. I noticed on the front page the also made a 5 meg. My cost for the Apple /// with CRT, CPU, Profile 20 meg, printer and some software was about $9,000. Available software was scarce and SLOW. We never used the accounting program because it would take forever just to switch out of receivables to payables. That was why I was motivated to learn ABB. When I got it, it sat in a corner on the floor for about 6 months because no one knew how to run it. But once I got started with Three EZ Pieces and Learning Apple Business Basic, I was hooked. I think I still have some books and software round here for that machine. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKAS_5a42.html" title="User:KAS">KAS</a> 14:01, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The ProFile hardisk came in sizes of either 5 megabytes and 10 megabytes, nothing else (e.g. Seagate ST-506 or ST-512 mechanism). If yours did have a 20 megabyte hardisk mechanism, it would have been as a user upgrade--and that I believe, would have required a custom firmware ROM for the drive written to support it too. The hardisks themselves were MFM type, and interfaced with the Lisa, Apple III and Apple II via a bi-directional parallel controller interface.</dd>

<dd>The very first 20 megabyte hardrive sold by Apple was the Apple HD20. It connected to the Macintosh through the floppy port controller and relatively slow, unlike the later SCSI based Apple HD20-SC. Which brings up an interesting point, in that the Apple III was able to use SCSI hardisks later in life by borrowing SCSI controller cards from the Apple II line (special drivers are required however).Apple2gs 20:06, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That’s strange, it was my understanding it was a 20-megabyte. Thanks for the update. I know one thing, after the accounting program was installed; I never used the program after the first few days. It took at least 5 to 10 minutes to switch payables to receivables. It was Peachtree I think, but who knows since it as slower then a snail I didn’t take notice to remember the name. It did seem like we had a lot of unused space on the drive, even after the programs were installed. It’s nice to have a person with knowledge to converse with. Have you ever used the Apple ///? The ProFile sounded like a muffled jet engine whirling around. It was made well because in the all the years it was booted everyday; it just kept on whirling around, day in and day out. I actually liked that machine and it was a boost to my self-esteem that I could run it when most of my competitors didn’t have computers. I remember IBM would come around and smooze us to buy one of their low-end computers for about $20,000 to $25,000. We’d go to their meetings and listen to their presentations, but still, in the end, the argument was they were pricing themselves out of the market. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKAS_5a42.html" title="User:KAS">KAS</a> 04:10, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those old MFM ST-5xx drives were notorious for being noisy (and slow). I've never used one, but came close to owning one when a second hand shop I came across had one in stock, along with several controller cards for the Apple III. I regret not purchasing it in retrospect, not only to make my Apple III more workable, but to have as a historic piece of computing (it was afterall, one of the first consumer available hardisks; certainly the very first one Apple ever offered). Yes, I do own an Apple III...with 256K RAM, an external Disk III and Monitor III. I even have four compatible digital color RGB monitors to use with it, but not had a chance to hook any up so far as it's not often I take my III out of storage. I picked it up about 12 years ago which was quite a find even then...they're not exactly that common as only perhaps 100,000 were made. I would be interested in finding more software for mine, it's an interesting machine.Apple2gs 19:40, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It’s great to see the love for the Apple /// still out there! My ProFile sat between the CRT and the CPU, and This will make you sick. When the company went BK in 2001, (just after 911 due to NOTHING moving with PO's for months) I didn't have anyplace for the Apple /// and I didn't want anyone to have access to the hard drive, so I destroyed the whole system and tossed it in the industrial trash. I've more then once regretted I did that. However, I think I have some of the original Textbooks and some software. And, I think I have pictures of the system in the office the way it was setup to use – ProFile in the center of the stack. I sure wished you had walked by in 2001 because I would have loved to have given my Apple /// a good home, but no one seemed interested in a dinosaur of a computer. In fact, we affectionately called it Dino in the office. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKAS_5a42.html" title="User:KAS">KAS</a> 02:19, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have a similar story. One of my friends, back in the very early 90's, found an Apple IIe with ProFile hardisk in the dumpster from a company that had either gone under or simply disposing of obsolete office equipment. He salvaged it all and brought it home...however, and I'll never understand why, destroyed the ProFile by ripping out the physical disc platter to hang on his wall like a trophy! I talked him into giving me the Apple IIe and (now rare) Apple II ProFile controller card before he destroyed those as well and still have them today. I suppose he reasoned if it was in the trash it had no value.</dd>
<dd>My Apple III was given to me free not long after that incident, someone had one in their garage and offered it to me (I'm sure I saved it from being eventually trashed). I treasure it because it's so unique and interesting a machine, and although similar in many respects to the Apple II, no more an Apple II than a Lisa is a Macintosh. If you ever feel like giving those books and software a good home, let me know.&#160;:) Apple2gs 01:35, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
