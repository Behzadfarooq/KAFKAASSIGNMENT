<p>Frankly, I think it's silly to have a disambiguation page here. People who want to link to <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computer_f26c.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a> can do that, this page should be about the fruit.

<dd>well it was me that made the disambig page and you are probably right (seemed a good idea at the time...).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Old apple"</span></h2>
<p>I'm kinda puzzled by the picture of the "Old apple". First off, it looks like a plum to me. No matter how hard I look at it. Is it really an apple? Scratching head. I can't find any reference to a cultivar named "old apple" anywhere other than mirrors. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a>{<a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">gab}</a> 00:17, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm a little puzzled by Image:Cyborglog-of-eating-old-apple-d360.jpg. Sure looks like a plum to me, no matter how hard I look at it. You're not engaging in some friendly leg-pulling, are you? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a>{<a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">gab}</a> 23:58, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The fruits that grow on the tree have a core that has many seeds. A plum has only one big seed, usually. Maybe it's a cross breed between apple and plum? Some friends of ours identified it as "old apple" (some old kind of apple), but I'd welcome any thoughts you might have on it. I also have some pictures of seeds from it. It's among other apple trees at my parents' cottage, and they estimate it might be around 80 years old or so, and seems to be from a group of apple trees planted there. It tastes like apple; it tastes quite good actually. They're about the size of a plum (i.e. very small apples). <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlogger_c41d.html" title="User:Glogger">Glogger</a> 01:31, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Might be its own thing! The fun thing about fruit (apples, citrus, plums) is that when they grow from seed, they pretty much decide on their own what they want to be, regardless of what its parents were. Plant a lemon seed, you might or might not get a lemon. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a>{<a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">gab}</a> 02:44, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm hoping I can grow another tree of this fruit (I kept seeds from one). I thought unless something's grafted onto an existing tree, it should be possible to get the same tree by planting seeds from one of the fruits.</p>

<dd>Hi Glogger - thanks for the note; I edited out the link as it was already missing (red link) when I was doing my edits on 4th October. Have you checked you got the title correct (maybe different capitalisaion Old Apple vs Old apple?)(these links will tell when I save this!). If not, then I've no idea what happened to the missing article, sorry.<br /></dd>
<dd>As to its identity, it is definitely an apple; no plum in it (plums have stones, not pips). I always was a bit dubious about its name as a formal <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultivar.html" title="Cultivar">cultivar</a> name; your extra info indicates it isn't. I can with reasonable confidence identify it as a chance seedling hybrid between an orchard apple and one of the several purple-foliage <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malus.html" title="Malus">crabapple</a> cultivars (this parent providing the red pigmentation), and so will most likely not have any formal cultivar name (unless a nurseryman has propagated and named it, which is unlikely). That leaves the question of what to do with it; as it isn't a named cultivar, it shouldn't be in the list of named cultivars, but it is an interesting pair of photos well worth keeping, I'll try and work some wording round them in the next day or two (unless you can beat me to it!).<br /></dd>
<dd>To reproduce it reliably, you'll have to graft shoots from it onto another apple rootstock. The seeds, as jpgordon says, won't breed true. - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 18:09, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<p>The apple pictured is almost without a doubt an old variety call Malus pumila "Niedzwetzkyana" or the Redvein Crabapple. It's believed to be Transcaucasian in origin and is the parent and ancestor of most red-flowered and red-fleshed crabapples. You can see pictures of the Redvein and a number of its descendants at <a href="http://www.greenmantlenursery.com/fruit/rosetta-apples.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.greenmantlenursery.com/fruit/rosetta-apples.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenmantlenursery.com/fruit/rosetta-apples.htm</a>. "Rosetta Apples" is a commercial designation only. It does look more like a plum than an apple. They make terrific red jelly.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Apple project</span></h2>
<p>I've decided to start a little project: writing entries for various of the apple cultivars. I'm not sure if they all warrant their own articles, but I guess I'll find out! --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a>{<a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">gab}</a> 00:19, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally, I think it is a bit 'over the top' to have a page for each apple cultivar. My suggestion would be to start a new page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Apple_cultivars_85a3.html" title="List of Apple cultivars">List of Apple cultivars</a> which would be an annotated list with a few lines of text about the cultivar (origin, appearance, etc), and individual pages (if for any at all) only the half-dozen or so globally most important cultivars. But given what is already at e.g. <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granny_Smith_cbc9.html" title="Granny Smith">Granny Smith</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Delicious_55b7.html" title="Red Delicious">Red Delicious</a>, I'd say even these pages could be made redirects to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Apple_cultivars_85a3.html" title="List of Apple cultivars">List of Apple cultivars</a> with their text transferred there - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 17:52, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Makes sense -- though some (like Red Delicious) are important enough to have 'em -- and lots of them actually have interesting <s>histories</s> mythologies.

<p>As we have disambiguation pages, they should do what they are intended to do. If someone types <b>Apple</b> into Wiki then they should arrive at a page with the disamb possibilities, and <i><b>NOT</b></i> directly to a fruit, or a computer, or whatever.

<li>I'm not sure I agree. <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disambiguation.html" title="Disambiguation">Disambiguation</a> isn't necessary when different readers would reasonably expect several different results from pressing the "Go" button. But everything under <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Apple (disambiguation)">Apple (disambiguation)</a> is named for the fruit; people looking for Apple Computer are entirely likely to search directly for Apple Computer; people looking for Apple Records will say "Apple Records" -- because everyone indeed knows that "Apple" itself is a fruit. (Yes, I know of the technological bias of Wikipedia readers; but even Mac users know that Apple is first and foremost a fruit.) --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a>{<a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">gab}</a> 16:14, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, Fiona Apple might not be named for the fruit, and Apples, Vaud is not named for the fruit. (Though <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apples.html" title="Apples">Apples</a> is a redirect to some not-in-my-demographic band.) All the others are indeed named after the fruit -- what else are they named after? No fruit, no Apple Computer. No fruit, no Apple Records. And so on. Sometimes disambiguation pages are not called for. <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> gets you to the city in Israel, not a page mentioning the several towns named Jerusalem, nor the Jerusalem artichoke. The fruit is the only one of the Apple things that does not need any qualifier, nor would one make any sense; Apple Records, Apple Computer, Big Apple, Apple Jeans -- all of them have obvious proper names. So as far as consistency goes -- hundreds of articles use Template:alternateuses or things redirected to it. Anyway, do what you want, of course, but I don't think it's necessary, and I don't think it's even the best thing to do. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a>{<a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">gab}</a> 23:33, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Whether or not the items at <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Apple (disambiguation)">apple (disambiguation)</a> are named after apples or not is irrelevant; what is important is that the fruit is overwhelmingly the most significant of the items, with several thousand years' use over the rest.

<p>Hi Wormrunner, I've got to disagree over the huge TOC at <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">apple</a>, it shifts all of the text completely out of view and leaves a huge area of white space. It looks absolutely awful. I don't see any need for those subheaders, either, they're superfluous - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 3 July 2005 16:56 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, allowing people to make their own choice about the TOC is the function of the "hide" link. Second, the TOC can be moved down by putting __TOC__ farther down in the article. Third, by eliminating the first heading "Botanical Origins", thus merging it with the introduction, it pushes the TOC down to a level you might like better. Fourth, perhaps some of the subheadings could be merged, though pollination by itself is quite long. Fifth, isn't changing the basic style one uses for headers a subject for discussion on the manual of style? Sixth, part of the value of sections is that it makes the process of editing and tracking edits easier.</dd>
<dd>I am quite willing to go along with majority opinion here, but I think if we are going to change the basic method of creating headers in an article, it should be part of the manual of style, or perhaps this discussion has already taken place and I missed it? -- <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWormRunner_5b32.html" title="User:WormRunner">WormRunner</a> | <a href="../../../w/o/r/User_talk%7EWormRunner_be85.html" title="User talk:WormRunner">Talk</a> 3 July 2005 17:20 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no trouble with the article as it is. However, I rearranged an image so as to reduce the blank space. However I would rather have the TOC on the left side of the page. I've tried several other possibilities, but it doesn't work. A table that would put the image at the right spot between the TOC and the taxobox would solve the problem. But the tags align = left (or center, or right) probably won't solve the problem. Dreamweaver could do the trick, but I don't think the wiki-software could handle this.

<dd>I think JoJan's pic idea is a good solution, though I think I might swap pics around a bit to (a) have a slightly larger pic in the position (prob <a href="../../../a/p/p/Image%7EAppletree_bloom_l.jpg_6d5f.html" title="Image:Appletree bloom l.jpg">Image:Appletree bloom l.jpg</a> as it's a nice pic that'll set off the fruit in the taxobox) and (b) so the <i>Malus sieversii</i> pic stays tied to the botanical section where it is relevant. Come to think of it, we (surprisingly!) don't yet have a decent description of what an apple (tree) is/looks like, so I'll add that to go with a pic at the top - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 4 July 2005 08:52 (UTC)

<dd>Problem solved (thanks to Wikipedia:Help Desk). Putting the TOC between div tags and letting it float to the left. By resizing the picture, it fits neatly between the TOC and the taxobox.

<dd>Thanks Jo; just after I typed the above (14:25 UTC), I shrank the pic from 340px to 330px, which held the pic up at the next text size up ('medium' on I.E.; I use 'smaller') on my monitor - 275px seems a bit small to me for filling the white space, but maybe my monitor is larger than many people have? - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 4 July 2005 14:46 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You should be aware that on some browsers (e.g. Safari) the picture of the apple tree in bloom appears underneath the table of contents, increasing the amount of wasted space before the article begins.

<p>Most of the pictures on this page portray the apple favorably. It is presented as tasty, healthy, and clean. This portrayal amounts to advertising for the apple industry, and should not be tolerated in here. Furthermore, the toothless, predominantly the young and elderly, cannot consume apples in their natural with-peel state, and as all but one of the apples so delectibly portrayed here have peel, this amounts to little more than gastronomical torture. This article has further problems, failing also the tests established in the <a href="../../../s/p/_/WP%7ESP_e9e9.html" title="WP:SP">species neutrality</a> guideline. A non-human reading this page might be enticed by the percieved deliciousness of the pictured apple and proceed to consume (fatally) an apple that he, she, or it would not otherwise have so consumed. Do we want this creature's demise upon our collectively edited consience? Won't anybody think of the kittens?</p>
<p>All three of these problems stem from the same <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">systematic biases</a> of the Wikipedia project. The problem is that the 'average' Wikipeidan is a teeth-posessing human apple farmer, and as such the voices of the toothless, the animals, and the non-apple farmers are drowned out by the multitudinous Wikipedial majority. Imagine yourself in the shoes (or paws) of one of these more disadvantaged fellow voyagers of spaceship earth: does this article speak to you? Free yourself of your natural biases, free yourself of the chains of your background. Do not allow these damaging and pervasive thought forms to pervade any longer. They are outmoded and you must out-mode them.</p>
<p>At this point, I think the bias of the article is great enough that we had best wipe it clean and replace it with just the bare objective non-contestable facts.

<p>I've excised the connection to the Italian town of Avella because the preponderance of the evidence is in favor of a much older origin of the name in Proto-Indo-European. (What's likely is that Avella was named for apples, not the other way around.) In any case, it doesn't make any sense -- the traditional apple climate is rather colder than is usual in southern Italy, and the original PIE root is common to most of the more northern Indo-European language families. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 06:53, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Almost all fleshy fruits bruise; when they are soft enough to eat, mechanical damage can easily break cells, rupturing vacuoles and mxing their contents with the cytoplasm. Oxidation causes the brown color: if you slice an apple, put lemon juice on one cut surface and not the other, and leave it for a few days, the antioxidants in the lemon juice will reduce the browning of the treated slice.

<ul>
<li>In some places, bobbing for apples is a traditional Halloween activity.</li>
<li>In the United States, Denmark and Sweden, an apple (polished) is a traditional gift for a teacher. This stemmed from the fact that teachers during the 16th to 18th centuries were poorly paid, so parents would compensate the teacher by providing food. As apples were a very common crop, teachers would often be given baskets of apples by students. As wages increased, the quantity of apples was toned down to a single fruit.</li>

<dd>I think the image removal has gone overboard. An anon with a total of six edits, who neither knows how to set its browser to not load images, nor how to treat fellow Wikipedians in a considerate manner (if I may be so bold as to call that anon a "Wikipedian"), suggests getting rid of unnecessary pictures. (The anon shares an ISP and some article interests with the "Apple vandal" who has spent a lot of time adding nonsense to <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">Apple</a>.) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_London_97e5.html" title="User:Professor London">Professor London</a>, with a total of twenty edits (<b>one</b> prior to the work on this article), goes through and removes many images (some of which I agree were superfluous), while leaving others that seem (to me) equally superfluous. I restore the photo of the wild ancestor of the domestic apple (I think it's quite relevant, since wild ancestors of domestic plants may or may not resemble the domesticate). Professor London removes it with little comment. I'm putting it back.</dd>

<dd>I suggest a moratorium on image removal until the editors of this page have discussed what sort of images are necessary to illustrate the article. This article, even before the removals, was not especially image-rich compared to many other long articles about cultivated plants, and although some editors tend to go overboard with the photos just because they are there, some amount of illustration seems necessary.--<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurtis_Clark_2ae7.html" title="User:Curtis Clark">Curtis Clark</a> 14:33, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Commercial orchards are primarily pollinated by honeybees provided by contract with beekeepers, with supplemental use of orchard mason bees growing slowly. Both of these species have one of the ideal characteristics of a good apple pollinator; that is that they are true to the plant species they are pollinating. A honeybee worker that has once visited an apple blossom will tend to continue to visit apple blossoms until there are no more. There would be no value in carrying apple pollen to dandelions and other blossoms, which would be a common event with many insects.</dd>
<dd>There are two reasons why other than these two species are rather rare in commercial orchards. One is that they provide little support to feed other pollinators after apple bloom, and the other is that the environment is acutely toxic to most pollinators before and after bloom due to pesticide use.</dd>
<dd>But apples can be pollinated effectively by carpenter bees and several other solitary bees species. Occasionally one will see a queen bumblebee in orchards, but bumblebees are not usually present in sufficient numbers due to seasonal cycles and pesticides. Many other insects are capable of doing some pollination; however not as efficiently as bees. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 13:52, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
