<p><i><b>Apple Computer, Inc. v.

Some critics claimed that Apple was really attempting to gain all <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellectual_property.html" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a> rights over the desktop metaphor for computer interfaces, and perhaps all GUIs, on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">personal computers</a>. Apple lost all claims in the lawsuit, except that the court ruled that the trash can icon and file folder icons from Hewlett-Packard's now-forgotten <a href="../../../n/e/w/NewWave_%28HP_software%29_6f66.html" title="NewWave (HP software)">NewWave</a> windows application were infringing. The lawsuit was filed in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> and lasted four years; the decision was affirmed on appeal in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mjohnsen/Technology/Lawsuits/appvsms.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.earthlink.net/~mjohnsen/Technology/Lawsuits/appvsms.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and the appeal to the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Supreme_Court_2553.html" title="U.S. Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> by Apple was denied.</p>
<p>Apple has previously agreed to license certain parts of its GUI to Microsoft for use in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_1.0.html" title="Windows 1.0">Windows 1.0</a>. When Microsoft made some changes in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_2.0.html" title="Windows 2.0">Windows 2.0</a>, such as overlapping windows and other more Macintosh-like GUI features, Apple filed suit, and then added additional claims to the suit when Microsoft released <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_3.0.html" title="Windows 3.0">Windows 3.0</a>.</p>
<p>Apple claimed the "<a href="../../../l/o/o/Look_and_feel.html" title="Look and feel">look and feel</a>" of the Macintosh operating system, taken as a whole, was protected by <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a>, and that each individual element of the interface (such as the existence of windows on the screen, the fact that they are rectangular, the fact that they are resizable, the fact that they overlap, and the fact that they have title bars) was not as important as all these elements taken together. After long argument, the judge insisted on an analysis of specific GUI elements that Apple claimed were infringements. Apple came up with a list of 189 GUI elements; the judge decided that 179 of these elements had been licensed to Microsoft in the Windows 1.0 agreement, and most of the remaining 10 elements were not copyrightable—either they were unoriginal to Apple, or they were <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merger_doctrine.html" title="Merger doctrine">the only possible way of expressing a particular idea</a>.</p>
<p>In a twist midway through the suit, <a href="../../../x/e/r/Xerox.html" title="Xerox">Xerox</a> filed a lawsuit against Apple, claiming Apple had infringed copyrights Xerox held on <i>its</i> GUIs. Xerox had invested in Apple and had invited the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Macintosh_48d6.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Macintosh</a> design team to view their GUI computers at the <a href="../../../p/a/r/PARC_cb0f.html" title="PARC">PARC</a> research lab; these visits had been very influential on the development of the Macintosh GUI. Xerox's lawsuit appeared to be a defensive move to ensure that if <i>Apple v. Microsoft</i> established that "look and feel" was copyrightable, then Xerox would be the primary beneficiary, rather than Apple. The Xerox case was dismissed because the three year <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_of_limitations.html" title="Statute of limitations">statute of limitations</a> had passed (i.e. Xerox waited too long to file suit.)</p>

<p><i>Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.</i> is the most complicated software copyright lawsuit to date. <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_developer.html" title="Software developer">Software developers</a> and the Macintosh user community followed it with great interest. Some observers cast Apple as the villain, saying that after failing in the marketplace, it was trying to use the courts to corner the market on an idea that was benefiting the world, and if Apple won, the precedent would limit software developers' creative freedom. Apple's critics added that even if this were legally and ethically correct behavior, Apple wasn't the inventor of the GUI or the desktop metaphor in the first place. Others said Microsoft were the bad guys, brazenly stealing from Apple's work and flouting the law, and that if Microsoft won, a precedent was set that would allow big companies to steal the core concepts from any software developer's work and get away with it.</p>
<p>As it happened, the court's approach seemed to invalidate the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyrighting</a> of a broad "look and feel" of a piece of software, though this was not decisively stated in the court's ruling. The fact that Apple and Microsoft had entered into the licensing agreement for Windows 1.0 made a large part of the case a mere contractual matter rather than a matter of copyright law — much against Apple's preference — so it was not necessary for the court to set a precedent in its ruling. It remains unclear what would have happened if Apple had acquired a <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_patent.html" title="Software patent">software patent</a> purporting to secure the "look and feel" of the Macintosh user interface as an invention, and had then pursued Microsoft and HP under patent law. Had Apple been able to win a look and feel suit, this precedent may have hindered the development of the <a href="../../../x/_/w/X_Window_System_d6dd.html" title="X Window System">X Window System</a> and other <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> GUIs.</p>
<p>In 1997, all lingering infringement questions against Microsoft regarding the Lisa and Macintosh GUI, as well as Apple's <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Canyon_Company_9c3d.html" title="San Francisco Canyon Company">"QuickTime piracy" lawsuit</a> against Microsoft, would be settled when Apple agreed to make Internet Explorer the default browser over Netscape, and Microsoft agreed to continue developing Office and other software for the Mac for the next 5 years, and purchase $150 million of non-voting Apple stock. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, Apple has resumed threats of litigation in this area. A common target has been <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stardock.html" title="Stardock">Stardock</a>, whose CEO <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Wardell_20ea.html" title="Brad Wardell">Brad Wardell</a> once joked that Apple's lawyers had him on speed-dial. Apple was not pleased when <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skin_%28computing%29.html" title="Skin (computing)">skins</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theme_%28computer%29.html" title="Theme (computer)">themes</a> for <a href="../../../w/i/n/WindowBlinds_46ee.html" title="WindowBlinds">WindowBlinds</a>, <a href="../../../i/c/o/IconPackager_f4c9.html" title="IconPackager">IconPackager</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/s/DesktopX_1c4f.html" title="DesktopX">DesktopX</a> looking similar to their <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aqua_%28GUI%29_a85d.html" title="Aqua (GUI)">Aqua GUI</a> were released in mid-2000, over six months before the release of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_OS_X_b8d4.html" title="Mac OS X">Mac OS X</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computer%2C_Inc._v._Microsoft_Corp._4691.html" title="Edit section: Other GUI borrowing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other GUI borrowing</span></h2>
<p>Apple has also copied certain innovations from other companies: tabbed dialogs on Macintosh appeared after <a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_cbf4.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> used them in <a href="../../../o/s/2F/OS_2_4b39.html" title="OS/2">OS/2</a>. Since the original settlement of the lawsuit, many features of the Macintosh and Windows GUIs have been incorporated into the windowing environments of unrelated third parties.</p>
<p>The Mac OS X dock is derived from the <a href="../../../n/e/x/NeXTSTEP_5e42.html" title="NeXTSTEP">NeXTSTEP</a> dock (Mac OS X itself originating from NeXTSTEP after Apple acquired NeXT 1996). The dock as seen in Mac OS X and NEXTSTEP is very similar to the dock that is a major design feature of <a href="../../../r/i/s/RISC_OS_7a2b.html" title="RISC OS">RISC OS</a>, which already featured its so-called iconbar as early as 1987.</p>
<p>However, the RISC OS iconbar itself is similar in appearance to the icon bar in Windows 1.0. In the original Windows implementation, icons represented minimized application windows, and each icon could be dragged into position on the tiled desktop above when it came time to re-expand them.</p>
<p>Given this history of "bars" filled with iconic representations of objects pertaining to the user's current desktop, it would be hard to make any conclusions about the actual origin of the technologies involved, which ultimately boil down to user interface designers grouping high-level controls on a common strip.</p>
