<p>The <b>Apple II<small>GS</small></b>, the fifth model inception of the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_II_7724.html" title="Apple II">Apple II</a>, was the most powerful member of the Apple II series of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microcomputer.html" title="Microcomputer">personal computers</a> made by <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computer_f26c.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a>.

Following in this theme the "GS" in its name officially stood for "Graphics" and "Sound", a reference to its vast enhancement in this area over previous models of the line. Along with its true <a href="../../../1/6/-/16-bit_architecture.html" title="16-bit architecture">16-bit architecture</a>, increased processing speed, direct access to megabytes of RAM, wavetable music synthesizer and a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphical_User_Interface_080a.html" title="Graphical User Interface">Graphical User Interface</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_mouse.html" title="Computer mouse">mouse</a> now standard, the machine was a radical departure from any previous Apple II. While still maintaining full backwards compatibility with earlier Apple II models, along side its new features, it represented a hybrid machine of sorts that blended the Apple II and aspects of Macintosh technology into one. The Apple II<small>GS</small> set forth a promising future and evolutionary advancement of the Apple II line, but Apple paid it relatively little attention as the company increasingly focused on the Macintosh platform.</p>

The 16-bit Apple II<small>GS</small>. Offering the first <i>color</i> Graphical User Interface from Apple, as well as advanced graphics and sound capabilities.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The II<small>GS</small> was released in September <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>. It was intended to compete with personal computers such as the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_Amiga_e8db.html" title="Commodore Amiga">Commodore Amiga</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_ST_ca1a.html" title="Atari ST">Atari ST</a> at the time of its release and was somewhat popular with schools, but Apple failed to promote and update the II<small>GS</small>, preferring to focus on the Macintosh instead. The II<small>GS</small> lacked compelling features over its competitors and increasingly fell behind other personal computers over its lifetime, and Apple ceased production of it in December <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>.</p>

<p>The Apple II<small>GS</small> was an innovative computer with many improvements over the older <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIe_6c47.html" title="Apple IIe">Apple IIe</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIc_1a8c.html" title="Apple IIc">Apple IIc</a>. It emulated its predecessors by utilising a custom <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrated_circuit.html" title="Integrated circuit">chip</a> called the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_II_6d77.html" title="Mega II">Mega II</a> and used the new <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Design_Center_37ca.html" title="Western Design Center">Western Design Center</a> <a href="../../../6/5/8/65816_Microprocessor_e8c4.html" title="65816 Microprocessor">65816</a> <a href="../../../1/6/-/16-bit.html" title="16-bit">16-bit</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microprocessor.html" title="Microprocessor">microprocessor</a> running at 2.8 <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megahertz.html" title="Megahertz">MHz</a>, which was faster than the <a href="../../../8/-/b/8-bit.html" title="8-bit">8-bit</a> <a href="../../../m/o/s/MOS_Technology_6502_b7e0.html" title="MOS Technology 6502">6502</a> and <a href="../../../6/5/c/65C02_Microprocessor_79e3.html" title="65C02 Microprocessor">65C02</a> processors used in earlier Apple IIs and also allowed the II<small>GS</small> to use more <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_access_memory.html" title="Random access memory">RAM</a>. It also included enhanced graphics and sound, which led to its name. The graphics of the II<small>GS</small> were the best of the Apple II series, with new Super High Resolution (SHR) video modes. These included a 640×200-pixel mode with 2-bit palletized color and a 320×200-pixel mode with <a href="../../../4/-/b/4-bit.html" title="4-bit">4-bit</a> palletized color, both of which could dip in to a 4,096 color palette. By changing the palette on each scanline, it was possible to display up to 256 colors or more per screen, which was quite commonly seen within game and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_design.html" title="Graphic design">graphic design</a> software. Through some clever programming, it was possible to display as many as 3,200 colors at once. Audio was generated by a built-in sound and music synthesizer in the form of the <a href="../../../e/n/s/Ensoniq.html" title="Ensoniq">Ensoniq</a> Digital Oscillator Chip (DOC), which had its own dedicated <a href="../../../r/a/m/RAM_e536.html" title="RAM">RAM</a> and 32 separate channels of sound, which were paired to produce 15 voices, in <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereophonic_sound.html" title="Stereophonic sound">stereo</a> audio.</p>
<p>The II<small>GS</small> could support both 5¼-inch and 3½-inch <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floppy_disk.html" title="Floppy disk">floppy disks</a> and, like the IIe before it, had several expansion slots. These included seven general-purpose expansion slots compatible with those on the Apple II, II+, and IIe, plus a memory expansion slot that could be used to add up to 8 <a href="../../../m/i/b/MiB_e64c.html" title="MiB">MiB</a> of RAM. The II<small>GS</small>, like the IIc, also had dedicated ports for external devices. These included a port to attach floppy disk drives, two <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial_port.html" title="Serial port">serial ports</a> for devices such as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_printer.html" title="Computer printer">printers</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modem.html" title="Modem">modems</a> (which could also be used to connect to a <a href="../../../l/o/c/LocalTalk_6fa7.html" title="LocalTalk">LocalTalk</a> network), an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Desktop_Bus_1573.html" title="Apple Desktop Bus">Apple Desktop Bus</a> port to connect the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_keyboard.html" title="Computer keyboard">keyboard</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_mouse.html" title="Computer mouse">mouse</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composite_video.html" title="Composite video">composite</a> and <a href="../../../r/g/b/RGB_8895.html" title="RGB">RGB</a> video ports. These ports were associated with the slots, so for example using a card in slot 1 would mean the printer port was disabled.</p>
<p>The II<small>GS</small> also supported booting from an AppleShare server, via the AppleTalk protocol, over LocalTalk cabling. Shortly afterward, so could the IIe, via the "Apple IIe Workstation Card". Over a decade before NetBoot offered the capability for Macs.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIGS_9acf.html" title="Edit section: Graphics modes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Graphics modes</span></h3>
<p>In addition to supporting all graphics modes of previous Apple II models, the Apple II<small>GS</small> introduced several new ones through a custom Video Graphics Chip (VGC), all of which used a 12-bit palette for a total of 4096 possible colors, though not all 4096 colors could appear onscreen at the same time.</p>
<ul>
<li>320×200 pixels with a single palette of 16 colors.</li>
<li>320×200 pixels with up to 16 palettes of 16 colors. In this mode, the VGC holds 16 separate palettes of 16 colors in its own memory. Each of the 200 scan lines can be assigned any one of these palettes allowing for up to 256 colors on the screen at once. This mode is handled entirely by the VGC with no CPU assistance, making it perfect for games and high-speed animation.</li>
<li>320×200 pixels with up to 200 palettes of 16 colors. In this mode, the CPU assists the VGC in swapping palettes in and out of the video memory so that each scan line can have its own palette of 16 colors allowing for up to 3200 colors on the screen at once. This mode is computationally-intensive however, and is only suitable for viewing graphics or in paint programs.</li>
<li>320×200 pixels with 15 colors per palette, plus a "fill mode" color. In this mode, color 0 in the palette is replaced by the last non-zero color pixel displayed on the scan line (to the left), allowing fast solid-fill graphics (drawn with only the outlines).</li>
<li>640×200 pixels with four pure colors. This mode is generally only used for ensuring that the Apple logo and menu bar retain their colors in Desktop applications.</li>
<li>640×200 pixels with 16 dithered colors. In this mode, two palettes of four pure colors each are used in alternating columns. The hardware then dithers the colors of adjacent pixels to create 16 total colors on the screen. This mode is generally used for programs requiring finer detail such as word processors and the Finder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each scan line on the screen could independently select either 320- or 640-mode, fill mode (320-mode only), and any of the 16 palettes, allowing graphics modes to be mixed on the screen. This is most often seen in graphics programs where the menu bar is constantly in 640-pixel resolution and the working area's mode can be changed depending on the user's needs.</p>
<p>Like other Apple and Mac computers, the II<small>GS</small> lacked <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprite_%28computer_graphics%29.html" title="Sprite (computer graphics)">sprites</a>.</p>
<p>Later on, video cards such as Sequential Systems' Second Sight added <a href="../../../s/v/g/SVGA_55a1.html" title="SVGA">SVGA</a> modes allowing 24-bit color to the Apple II<small>GS</small>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIGS_9acf.html" title="Edit section: Audio features">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Audio features</span></h3>
<p>The Apple II<small>GS</small>' sound was provided by an included <a href="../../../e/n/s/Ensoniq.html" title="Ensoniq">Ensoniq</a> ES5503 DOC wavetable sound chip, the same chip used in <a href="../../../e/n/s/Ensoniq_Mirage_e1e9.html" title="Ensoniq Mirage">Ensoniq Mirage</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/s/Ensoniq_ESQ-1_cd6b.html" title="Ensoniq ESQ-1">Ensoniq ESQ-1</a> professional-grade synthesizers. The chip allowed for 32 separate channels of sound, though most software paired them into 16 stereo voices, as did most of the standard tools of the operating system (the MIDISynth Tool Set grouped 4 channels per voice, for a limit of 7-voice audio). The II<small>GS</small> is often referred to as a <i>fifteen</i>-voice system, though, since one stereo voice is reserved by the OS at all times for timing and system sounds. Software that doesn't use the OS, or uses custom-programmed tools (most games and demos do this), can access the chip directly and take advantage of all 32 voices.</p>
<p>A standard 1/8" headphone jack was provided on the back of the case, and standard stereo computer speakers could be attached there. However, it provided only mono sound through this jack, and a third party adapter card was required to produce true two-channel stereo, despite the fact the Ensoniq and virtually all native software produced stereo audio (stereo audio was essentially built-in to the machine, but had to be demultiplexed by third party cards).</p>

<p>The II<small>GS</small> was highly expandable. The expansion slots could be used for a variety of purposes, greatly increasing the computer's capabilities. <a href="../../../s/c/s/SCSI_87e0.html" title="SCSI">SCSI</a> host adaptors could be used to connect external SCSI devices such as hard drives and CD-ROM drives. Other mass storage devices such as adaptors supporting internal 2.5-inch IDE hard drives could also be used. Another common class of <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_II_peripheral_cards_ffbc.html" title="Apple II peripheral cards">Apple IIGS expansion cards</a> was accelerator cards replacing the computer's original processor with a faster one. <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applied_Engineering_6062.html" title="Applied Engineering">Applied Engineering</a> developed the PC Transporter that was essentially an IBM-XT PC on a card. A variety of other cards were also produced, including ones allowing new technologies such as <a href="../../../1/0/b/10BASE-T_5cf0.html" title="10BASE-T">10BASE-T</a> <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethernet.html" title="Ethernet">Ethernet</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/CompactFlash_6d07.html" title="CompactFlash">CompactFlash</a> cards to be used on the II<small>GS</small>.</p>

<p>Apple's first internal project to develop a next-generation Apple II based on the 65816 was known as the "IIx." The IIx project, though, became bogged down when it attempted to include various coprocessors allowing it to emulate other computer systems. Early samples of the 65816 were also problematic. These problems led to the cancellation of the IIx project, but somewhat later a new project was formed to produce an updated Apple II. This project, which led to the released II<small>GS</small>, was known by various codenames while the new system was being developed, including "Phoenix," "Rambo," "Gumby," and "Cortland."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIGS_9acf.html" title="Edit section: Influence on later computers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influence on later computers</span></h3>
<p>The Apple Desktop Bus, which for a long time was the standard for most input peripherals for the Macintosh, first appeared on the Apple II<small>GS</small>.</p>
<p>Though including a professional-grade sound chip in the Apple II<small>GS</small> was hailed by developers and users both, and hopes were high that it would be added to the Macintosh, it drew a lawsuit by <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Records_84af.html" title="Apple Records">Apple Records</a>. As part of an earlier trademark dispute with the record company, <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computer_f26c.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a> had agreed not to release music-related products. Apple Records considered the inclusion of the <a href="../../../e/n/s/Ensoniq.html" title="Ensoniq">Ensoniq</a> chip in the II<small>GS</small> as a violation of that agreement. Though the II<small>GS</small> was allowed to keep the Ensoniq, Apple has not included dedicated hardware sound synthesizers in any of its Macintosh models since (though of course, third-party products exist).</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, software that runs on the Apple II<small>GS</small> can be divided into two major categories: 8-bit software compatible with earlier Apple II systems such as the IIe and IIc, and 16-bit II<small>GS</small>-specific software, most of which runs under the Apple II<small>GS</small> System Software and takes advantage of its advanced features, including a Macintosh-like <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphical_user_interface.html" title="Graphical user interface">graphical user interface</a>.</p>

<p>The Apple II<small>GS</small> was almost <i>completely</i> backward compatible with older Apple II computers, so users wouldn't be left with large libraries of useless software. The II<small>GS</small> could run all of Apple's earlier Apple II <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operating_system.html" title="Operating system">operating systems</a>: <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_DOS_2327.html" title="Apple DOS">Apple DOS</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/ProDOS_3ddf.html" title="ProDOS">ProDOS</a> 8, and <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Pascal_1f8e.html" title="Apple Pascal">Apple Pascal</a>. It was also compatible with nearly all 8-bit software running under those systems. Like the Apple II+, IIe, and IIc, the II<small>GS</small> also included Applesoft BASIC and a monitor (which could be used for very simple assembly language programming) in ROM, so they could be used even with no operating system loaded from disk. The 8 bit software ran twice as fast unless the user turned down the processor speed in the II<small>GS</small> control panel.</p>

<p>The Apple II<small>GS</small> System Software utilized a graphical user interface (GUI) very similar to that of the Apple Macintosh and somewhat like <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphical_Environment_Manager_20d7.html" title="Graphical Environment Manager">GEM</a> for PCs and the operating systems of contemporary Atari and Amiga computers. Initial versions of the System Software were based on the <a href="../../../p/r/o/ProDOS_3ddf.html" title="ProDOS">ProDOS</a> 16 operating system, which was based on the original ProDOS operating system for 8-bit Apple II computers. Although it was modified so that 16-bit Apple II<small>GS</small> software could run on it, ProDOS 16 was written largely in 8-bit code and did not take full advantage of the II<small>GS</small>'s capabilities. Later System Software versions (starting with version 4.0) replaced ProDOS 16 with a new 16-bit operating system known as <a href="../../../g/s/2F/GS_OS_c708.html" title="GS/OS">GS/OS</a>. It better utilized the unique capabilities of the II<small>GS</small> and included many valuable new features. The Apple II<small>GS</small> System Software was substantially enhanced and expanded over the years during which it was developed, culminating in its final version, System 6.0.1, which was released in 1993.</p>

<p>The II<small>GS</small> system software provided a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_mouse.html" title="Computer mouse">mouse</a>-driven graphical user interface using concepts such as <a href="../../../w/i/n/Window_%28computing%29.html" title="Window (computing)">windows</a>, menus, and icons. This was implemented by a '"toolbox" of code, some of which resided in the computer's ROM and some of which was loaded from disk. The II<small>GS</small> GUI was very similar to that of early Macintoshes. One major application could run at a time, although other smaller programs known as Desk Accessories could be used simultaneously. The II<small>GS</small> had a Finder application very similar to the Macintosh's, which allowed the user to manipulate files and launch applications. By default, the Finder was displayed when the computer started up and whenever the user quit an application that had been started from it, although the startup application could be changed by the user.</p>

<p>The II<small>GS</small> System Software could be extended through various mechanisms. New Desk Accessories were small programs ranging from a calculator to simple <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_processor.html" title="Word processor">word processors</a> that could be used while running any standard desktop application. Classic Desk Accessories also served as small programs available while running other applications, but they used the text screen and could be accessed even from non-desktop applications. Control Panels and initialization files were other mechanisms that allowed various functions to be added to the system. Finder Extras permitted new capabilities to be added to the Finder, drivers could be used to support new hardware devices, and users could also add "tools" that provided various functions that other programs could utilize easily. These features could be used to provide features never planned for by the system's designers, such as a <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_protocol_suite.html" title="Internet protocol suite">TCP/IP</a> stack known as "Marinetti."</p>

<p>Upon its release in September 1986, Apple announced it would be making an upgrade kit to upgrade an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_IIe_6c47.html" title="Apple IIe">Apple IIe</a> to a II<small>GS</small> available for purchase. The upgrade replaced the Apple IIe <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motherboard.html" title="Motherboard">motherboard</a> for a 16-bit Apple II<small>GS</small> motherboard. Users would bring their Apple IIe machines into an authorized Apple dealership, where the IIe motherboard and lower baseboard of the case were swapped for an Apple II<small>GS</small> motherboard with a new <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseboard.html" title="Baseboard">baseboard</a> (with matching <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cut-out.html" title="Cut-out">cut-outs</a> for the new built-in ports). New metal sticker <a href="../../../i/d/_/ID_badge_582c.html" title="ID badge">ID badges</a> replaced those on the front of the Apple IIe, rebranding the machine. Retained were the upper half of the IIe case, the keyboard, speaker and powersupply. Original II<small>GS</small> motherboards (those produced between 1986 to mid 1989) had electrical connections for the IIe <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powersupply.html" title="Powersupply">powersupply</a> and keyboard present, although only about half produced had the physical plug connectors factory pre-soldered in, which were mostly reserved for the upgrade kits.</p>
<p>The upgrade cost US$500, plus the trade-in of the user's existing Apple IIe motherboard.</p>

<p>It proved unpopular as it did not include a mouse (which was an essential part of the new machine, much like the Macintosh); the keyboard, although functional, did not mimic all the features and functions of the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Desktop_Bus_1573.html" title="Apple Desktop Bus">Apple Desktop Bus</a> keyboard, as well as lacking a numeric keypad; and some cards designed for the new 16-bit machine did not fit in the Apple IIe's slanted case either. In the end most users found they were not saving much, once they had to purchase a 3.5 floppy drive, analog RGB monitor and mouse. Although it could use some IIe peripherals, most of them became obsolete in the upgrade due to their function being already built-in. It did however make an attractive upgrade for Apple IIe users wanting to use the machine strictly in IIe-emulation mode (ignoring the native part of the machine), which provided faster CPU operation, 256 KiB RAM, a clock and many built-in peripherals via the backports. <a name="Technical_specifications" id="Technical_specifications"></a></p>

<p>While in production between September 1986 and December 1992, the Apple II<small>GS</small> remained relatively unchanged from its original inception. However, during those years, Apple did produce some maintenance updates to the system which mainly compromised of two new ROM-based updates and a revamped motherboard. It is rumored several prototypes that greatly enhanced the machines features and capabilities were designed and even built, though all but one has ever been publicly exposed (i.e. the "Mark Twain"). Outlined below are only those revisions and updates officially released by Apple Computer.</p>

<p>During the entire first year of the machine's production an early, almost beta-like, firmware revision shipped with the machine and was noteably bug ridden. Some limitations were: the built-in <a href="../../../r/a/m/RAM_Disk_89aa.html" title="RAM Disk">RAM Disk</a> couldn't be set larger than 4096 KiB (even if more RAM was present), and the firmware contained the very early System 1.x toolsets. It became incompatible with most native Apple II<small>GS</small> software written from late-1987 onwards, and OS support only lasted up to System 3. The startup splash screen of the original ROM simply displayed "Apple IIgs" at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>Very early production runs of the machine had a faulty Video Graphics Controller (VGC) chip that produced strange cosmetic glitches in emulated (IIe/IIc) video modes. Specifically, the 80 columns text display and monochrome Double-High-Resolution graphics had a symptom where small flickering or static pink bits would appear between the gaps of characters and pixels. Most users noticed this when using AppleWorks classic or the Mousedesk application that was a part of System 1 and 2. Apple resolved the issue by offering a free chip swap upgrade to affected owners.</p>

<p>In August 1987, Apple released an updated ROM that was made available as a free upgrade to all existing owners. The main feature of the new ROM was the presence of the System 2.x toolsets and several bug fixes. The upgrade was vital as software developers, including Apple, ceased support of the original ROM upon its release (most native Apple II<small>GS</small> software written from late-1987 onwards would <i>not</i> run unless a ROM 01 or higher was present. This included the GS/OS operating system). This updated also allowed up to 8128 KiB for the RAM Disk, added some new features for programmers, and now included a copyright message and reported the ROM version on the startup splash screen.</p>

<p>In March 1988, Apple began shipping Apple II<small>GS</small> units with 512 KiB of RAM as standard. This was done by pre-installing the Apple II<small>GS</small> Memory Expansion Card (that was once sold separately) in the memory expansion slot--the card had 256 KiB of RAM on board with empty sockets for further expansion. The built-in memory on the motherboard remained at 256 KiB however, and existing users were not offered this upgrade.</p>

<p>In August 1989, Apple increased the standard amount of RAM shipped in the Apple II<small>GS</small> to 1.125 MiB (1152 KiB). This time the additional memory was built-in on the motherboard and required layout change, which allowed the opportunity for other minor improvements as well. This update introduced both a new motherboard and a new ROM firmware update, however neither were offered to current owners--even as an upgrade option (the new ROM, being larger, was incompatible with the original motherboard). Apple had cited the reason an upgrade was not being offered was on the basis that most of the features of the new machine could be obtained in existing machines by installing System 5 and a fully populated Apple II<small>GS</small> Memory Expansion Card.</p>
<p>The new ROM firmware was now 256 KiB in size and contained the System 5.x toolsets. The newer toolsets increased the performance of the machine by up to 10%, due to the fact less had to be loaded from disk and their highly optimized routines compared to the older toolsets (pre-GS/OS based). In addition to several bug fixes, more programmer assistance commands/features, a cleaned up Control Panel with improved mouse control, RAM Disk functionality, more flexible Appletalk support and slot mapping were added.</p>
<p>In terms of hardware the new motherboard was a cleaner design that drew less power and resolved audio noise issues that interferred with the Ensoniq synthesizer in the original motherboard. Over four times more RAM was built-in, with double the ROM size, and a enhanced Apple Desktop Bus microcontroller added hardware supported sticky keys, emulated keyboard mouse and LED updating on Extended keyboards. The clock battery was now user serviceable being placed in a removable socket, and a jumper location was added to lock out the text-based Control Panel (mainly useful in school environments). Support for the Apple IIe to Apple II<small>GS</small> upgrade was removed, and some cost cutting measures had some chips soldered in place rather than socketed. As the firmware only worked in this motherboard and no new firmware updates were ever issued, users commonly referred to this version of the Apple II<small>GS</small> as the "ROM 3".</p>

However, unlike previous Apple II models, the layout and shape of keys were the same standard for all countries. In order to access the local character set layout and display, users would change settings in the built-in software based Control Panel, which also provides a method of toggling between 50/60 Hz video screen refresh. The composite video output was NTSC only on all IIgs; users in PAL countries were expected to use an RGB monitor. This selectable internationalization made it quick and simple to "localize" any given machine. Also present in the settings was a QWERTY/DVORAK keyboard toggle for all countries, much like that of the Apple IIc. Outside North America the Apple IIgs shipped with a different 220v clip-in powersupply, making this and the plastic keycaps the only physical difference (and also very modular, in the sense of converting a non-localized machine to a local one).</p>

<ul>
<li>The first 50,000 Apple II<small>GS</small>s manufactured had a commemorative case lid marked <i>"Limited Edition"</i> with a reproduced copy of Steve Wozniak's signature (<i>"Woz"</i>) above it.</li>
<li>Owners of the Limited Edition, after mailing in their Apple registration card, were mailed back a Certificate of Authenticity and a (copied) letter from Steve Wozniak.</li>
<li>Internal code names for the machine included: "Gumby", "Rambo", "Phoenix", "Cortland" and "Apple IIx".</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Carmack_08df.html" title="John Carmack">John Carmack</a>, founder of <a href="../../../i/d/_/Id_Software_9f51.html" title="Id Software">id Software</a>, started his career by writing commercial software for the Apple II<small>GS</small>. The same is true of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Romero_710b.html" title="John Romero">John Romero</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Hall_421e.html" title="Tom Hall">Tom Hall</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfenstein_3D_e125.html" title="Wolfenstein 3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a>, based on the Apple II originated game <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle_Wolfenstein_c2a8.html" title="Castle Wolfenstein">Castle Wolfenstein</a>, came full circle back to the Apple II series when it was released for the Apple II<small>GS</small> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>.</li>
<li>Two mainstream video games, <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zany_Golf_1ed6.html" title="Zany Golf">Zany Golf</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Immortal_98e0.html" title="The Immortal">The Immortal</a>, originated as Apple II<small>GS</small>-specific games that were later ported to several platforms due to their immense popularity.</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/a/u/Naughty_Dog_7a0b.html" title="Naughty Dog">Naughty Dog</a>, the well known <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3f6f.html" title="PlayStation">PlayStation</a> game developer, started as an Apple II<small>GS</small> game software company.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/a/n/Pangea_Software_b36c.html" title="Pangea Software">Pangea Software</a>, one of the best-known and popular <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Macintosh_48d6.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Macintosh</a> game developers, started as an Apple II<small>GS</small> game software company.</li>
<li>The Apple II<small>GS</small> was the first computer produced by Apple Computer to use a color <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphical_User_Interface_080a.html" title="Graphical User Interface">Graphical User Interface</a>.</li>
<li>The Apple II<small>GS</small> was the first computer at Apple to introduce the "Platinum" (light grey) color scheme.</li>
<li>The Apple II<small>GS</small> was the first computer to use the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Desktop_Bus_1573.html" title="Apple Desktop Bus">Apple Desktop Bus</a> interface for keyboards, mice and other input devices.</li>
<li>The machine outsold all other Apple products, including the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Macintosh_48d6.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Macintosh</a>, during its first year in production.</li>
<li>A hidden Easter egg (activated by Command-Option-Control-N) lists the development team on screen, and even plays a digitized "Apple II!" shout from them on the ROM 3.</li>
<li>There were rumors of several vastly enhanced <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prototypes.html" title="Prototypes">prototypes</a> built over the years at Apple but none were ever released. Only one, "The Mark Twain", has been revealed so far.</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/t/e/VTech_d11f.html" title="VTech">VTech</a>, makers of the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser_128.html" title="Laser 128">Laser</a> series, demonstrated a prototype of a more powerful Apple II<small>GS</small> compatible in 1989. It was never released due to licensing issues with Apple.</li>
<li>A project called "Avatar" in the early 90s promised a <a href="../../../3/2/-/32-bit.html" title="32-bit">32-bit</a> state of the art machine that was backwards compatible with the Apple II<small>GS</small>. It was never finished or released. Some doubt that the project even got out of the conceptualization stage.</li>
<li>Cirtech started work on, but never completed, a black and white <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Macintosh_48d6.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Macintosh</a> hardware <a href="../../../e/m/u/Emulation.html" title="Emulation">emulation</a> plug-in card for the Apple II<small>GS</small> dubbed "Duet". Rumor has it that Apple bought the rights to the project in order to kill it, to avoid having Mac software running on a machine they were phasing out.</li>
<li>Between the late 80s to early 90s, the Apple II<small>GS</small> developed its own <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demoscene.html" title="Demoscene">demoscene</a> very similar in vein to that of the <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiga.html" title="Amiga">Amiga</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_ST_ca1a.html" title="Atari ST">Atari ST</a>, albeit much smaller and lesser known. The most popular demo group was called FTA (Free Tools Association) and was from France. Two of their demos (Nucleus and Modulae) were very popular and were used by Apple itself and by retailers to show off the computer.</li>
<li>During its introduction, Apple sold a specialized set of <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bose.html" title="Bose">Bose</a> Roommate speakers that were platinum colored with the Apple logo next to the Bose on each front speaker grille.</li>
<li>Sharing the same <a href="../../../6/5/c/65C816_e5b7.html" title="65C816">65C816</a> processor as the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Nintendo_60e0.html" title="Super Nintendo">Super Nintendo</a>, many early programmers used the Apple II<small>GS</small> as a Super Nintendo game development platform to write code on.</li>
<li>Bob Yannes, creator of the <a href="../../../m/o/s/MOS_Technology_SID_a2ef.html" title="MOS Technology SID">SID</a> synthesizer chip used in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_64.html" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a>, went on to design the <a href="../../../e/n/s/Ensoniq.html" title="Ensoniq">Ensoniq</a> 5503 DOC synthesizer used in the Apple II<small>GS</small>.</li>
<li>Some design features from the ill-fated <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_III_3230.html" title="Apple III">Apple III</a> lived on in the Apple II<small>GS</small> , such as GS/OS borrowing elements from SOS, a unique keyboard feature for dual-speed arrow keys, and colorized ASCII text.</li>
