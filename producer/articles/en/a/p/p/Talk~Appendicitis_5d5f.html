<p>The article states that appendicitis is caused by fecal matter getting lodged in the appendix. But the questions remain, "Why does this happen?" and "How can it be prevented?"</p>
<p>Clues to the ultimate cause of this disease come from the field of epidemiology. Although the article doesn't mention it, many other sources on the web state that this is a disease of the Western World, virtually unknown in the developing world.</p>
<p>As with <a href="../../../d/i/v/Diverticulosis.html" title="Diverticulosis">diverticulosis</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemorrhoids.html" title="Hemorrhoids">hemorrhoids</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colon_cancer.html" title="Colon cancer">colon cancer</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflammatory_bowel_disease.html" title="Inflammatory bowel disease">inflammatory bowel disease</a> and others, appendicitis recently emerged toward the end of the 19th century, and only in the Western world. All of these diseases have baffled modern medicine for over a century.</p>
<p>In the past 3 decades "dietary fiber" has been considered the explanation for the epidemiological evidence. But many studies, especially on colon cancer, have torpedoed the fiber theory.</p>
<p>According to kidshealth.org: "There are no medically proven ways to prevent appendicitis. Although appendicitis is rare in countries where people eat a high-fiber diet, experts have not yet shown that a high-fiber diet definitely prevents appendicitis."</p>
<p>There is another cultural difference between the developing world and the developed world which directly pertains to colorectal health, but which has been overlooked by researchers. Most of the world uses the squatting position for excretion and childbirth. This is the method the human body was designed to use, and our deviation from it damages the colon (and other organs) in a number of ways.</p>
<p>Regarding the appendix, the use of sitting toilets causes one to put downward pressure on the ascending colon, which can easily force wastes into the appendix.</p>
<p>My website <a href="http://www.NaturesPlatform.com/health_benefits.html" class="external free" title="http://www.NaturesPlatform.com/health_benefits.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.NaturesPlatform.com/health_benefits.html</a> explains this process in much greater detail, and gives a historical perspective on this disease that corroborates the theory.</p>
<p>Please have a look at it.</p>

<dd>Sounds highly speculative. If something has been "overlooked" by researchers you will first need case-control studies to detect whether the type of loo people use actually influences their appendicitis risk. For the moment I would not be too eager to have this in the article. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 21:44, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And how do you know appendicitis did not happen before the 19th century? Isn't it interesting that abdominal surgery developed around this time, and that previously the <a href="../../../a/c/u/Acute_abdomen.html" title="Acute abdomen">acute abdomen</a> was simply a death warrant without a diagnosis? <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 21:46, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear JFW,</p>
<p>Thank you for your comments.</p>
<p>To answer your second question, please visit the following site: <a href="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/175_01_020701/hugh/hugh.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/175_01_020701/hugh/hugh.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/175_01_020701/hugh/hugh.html</a></p>
<p>The relevant excerpt from that page follows:</p>
<p>"The epidemiology of appendicitis poses many unanswered questions. Almost unknown before the 18th century, there was a striking increase in its prevalence from the end of the 19th century, with features suggesting it is a side effect of modern Western life. Rendle Short8 and Burkitt1 summarised the rapid emergence of appendicitis in developed countries in the 20th century, and Burkitt noted its rarity in rural areas and in undeveloped countries."</p>
<p>To respond to your first comment, I know that further research is needed. But I believe that I have offered the most plausible hypothesis for a disease that has baffled modern medicine for over a century. An article about a disease that does not address etiology or epidemiology or prevention is incomplete. Presenting the most plausible hypothesis will inspire others to do research. (I am not a doctor, nor am I in a position to get involved with clinical research.)</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

There have been numerous other changes in society as well as that. How about increased sanitation? refrigeration? electricity? microwaves? the internal combustion engine? plastics? There's no evidence that any of these have caused the increase in appendicitis any more than sitting toilets versus squatting toilets. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 01:14, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jonathan, one of the crucial differences is the way in which views are supported. What you will need to do with your theory is try to construct a case-control study where all factors are controlled for. Again, your theory sounds great, but so do UFOs and men from Mars. Please find another forum for this. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 00:06, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi guys. I've read this talk page and the websites offered, and updated the main article in a way I hope is fair. I've tried to indicate there are alternate theories with a neutral viewpoint. Claims of pseudoscience and historical prevalences aside, it's worth mentioning that there are other theories. --<a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">K</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">rowyn</a> <i><sup><a href="../../../k/e/r/User_talk%7EKerowyn_1337.html" title="User talk:Kerowyn">Leave a note</a></sup></i> 21:10, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello all, Although I agree alternative theories of scientific worth may be valuable to discuss, writting them into the body of the article (especially under a Porcalain Throane heading) is a disservice. Epidemiological evidence for cecal emptying through knee compression is pure opinion, not data. Evidence for positive correlations between dietary fiber intake and appendicitis is substantial and worth mentioning, but speculative oppinion not substantiated by scientific evidence should memain in this discussion section of Wikepedia. The article should be restored to the version prior to these entries. The diagram of the location of the appendix is a good addition, however. K.Hobler 28 August 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that as an encyclopedia, Wikipedia should endeavor to be as factual as possible. However, this should include the fact that some people believe the "porclain throne" theory. If a theory exists, it ought to be included, if only to point out that it is considered pseudoscience which is not supported by scientific evidence.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, if you have any scientific article citations to support the correlations between fiber and appendicitis, I'd love to include them. I just don't have the time to sift through the data myself. --<a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">K</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">rowyn</a> <i><sup><a href="../../../k/e/r/User_talk%7EKerowyn_1337.html" title="User talk:Kerowyn">Leave a note</a></sup></i> 05:30, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Excuse me, but the fact that some people propose that toilets contribute to appendicitis rates ought to be mentioned, if only to point out that this is considered highly inaccurate by medical professionals. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">K</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">rowyn</a> <i><sup><a href="../../../k/e/r/User_talk%7EKerowyn_1337.html" title="User talk:Kerowyn">Leave a note</a></sup></i> 20:35, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The current version is worded better...that is the additions are presented clearly as hypotheses unsupported by good evidence and are not so prominently displayed to suggest otherwise. Could you tell me what (UTC) means? K.Hobler 30 August 2006.</p>

<dd>Regarding this statement: <b>Most health practitioners accept Dr. Burkitt's first cause as a contributing factor, but dismiss the second since there is no scientific evidence to support it.</b> Most health practitioners have never heard of the the toilet theory. There is no evidence (pro or con) because the researchers who read Burkitt's writings couldn't figure out how to test it. So, the above statement incorrectly implies that most health practioners are familiar with the theory and have dismissed it. I will do an edit that corrects this mistake. --65.151.216.98 01:04, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have added the following line:</p>
<p>There is also a possibilty of being extremely tired, and falling asleep almost instantly when laying down. Severe diahrea may occur as well, after waking up, a person may have to go to the restroom, unable to "hold it in" leaking diahrea before even making it to a toilet.</p>
<p>under symntoms, as this is a symntom, including the other symntoms I had before I found out I had appendicitis from the hospital.</p>
<p>The above symptoms are "atypical", in that "diarrhea" is not a feature of typical appendicitis symptoms. Lethargy and malaise may be a symptom of any acute or chronic illness, and therefore are non specific for the diagnosis of appendicitis. I would suggest therefore removing this latest addition and instead substituting "diarrhea" in the paragraph regarding "atypicial". Diarrhea makes one think of a diagnosis of gastroenteritis rather than appendicitis, but it can be seen in more advanced, atypical cases, especially if the inflammation is producing unremitting irritation of the adjacent colon.Khobler 18:12, 26 December 2006 (UTC) I have converted the lethargy comment, which was somewhat personal, into a generalized statement about the pertinence of lethargy as a general, non-specific symptom of infection and placed it in the atypical category where it is more commonly seen. Khobler 14:20, 5 January 2007 (UTC) Recent revisions have eliminated mention of obstruction as a cause of appendicitis. I think this was probably inadvertent, so I have added it back into causes.Khobler 00:27, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>On 10 Feb 07 a deletion in signs, symptoms and findings occurred (without discussion) and the resultant sentance is non-senesical. I suggest reverting to the 7 Feb 07 version, which makes more sense to me. Khobler 20:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have rewritten signs, symptoms and finding that I believe represent what most general surgeons experience in everyday practice. If there is disagreement, I would appreciate a discussion in this section.Khobler 19:15, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I made some changes to the pathophys. section scrubbing some of what was really not contempoary or widely accepted notions. Speculative theories which have neither been tested nor added to most surgical texts add too many tangents to a relatively simple concept. I re-reviewed several recent texts and the Uptodateonline.com which don't mention some of the ideas that were being featured at all.<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroliver_c7f0.html" title="User:Droliver">Droliver</a> 19:16, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've smoothed up some of the language in treatment, and I hope added a few details of general interest regarding incisions, anesthesia and lengths of stay. We may be just about "there", for now. Khobler 16:44, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
