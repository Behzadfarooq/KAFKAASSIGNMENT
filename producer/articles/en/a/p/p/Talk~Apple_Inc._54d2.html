<p>Why isn't there a section for this? Many people have issues with Apple, and seeing as there is one on the microsoft entry, makes me wonder why this hasn't been brought up before. Hogiaus 17:41, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While I like my Powerbook, IF it's typical for corporate entries at wikipedia to have a criticisms section, Apple should have one too. Of course, any editor may challenge or re-word badly written or un-sourced statements, and if no one can supply references, delete the corresponding claim. The ideal criticism should state the issue in question, why one side thinks it's bad, and if there's any defense, why the other side thinks not. For instance, the "Cadillac"+closed Mac approach led to higher prices, on the other hand it also led to better technology and end-user experience. The article cites NuBus for being proprietary. Well, that had pros and cons. It was better than anything at the time, but it also cost more.</dd>

<p>I tend to agree, Apple can be criticized for a lot of things, from enviromental issues (the iSight was banned from the European Union) to lack of expanded support options (next-day support etc) to their habit of never releasing information about future products in advance. 81.233.73.177/A helping hand</p>

<p>I don't think it's ready yet, but like <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> I think that Apple has an FA in it.

<dl>
<dd>I'd love to see this get to FA status! Here's my list of things I think we ought to look at:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>A longer lead section. This is a well-known, historically important technology company with a 30-year history, and for an article of this size, a solid four paragraphs covering all the major aspects should suffice.</li>
<li>The history section should be cut down in size. We have a separate article for the full history, so let's be razor-sharp and focus on all the important stuff, without dragging the reader down with little details like when revisions of computers were released or other contextually irrelevant things when discussing the history of the company as a whole. <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> gives us good guidance here.</li>
<li>The Corporate Affairs section shouldn't start off with criticism of the company. Something seems really wrong with that.</li>
<li>There should be no red-links, no unsourced statements, and every reference we do have should be checked to ensure they're still valid.</li>
<li>A picture of the Apple ][, a picture of the company's first employees, or at least -something- from the first 10 years of the company other than the 1984 commercial, would be fantastic.</li>
<li>A good FA should stand the test of time. That is to say, I should be able to read the article as it is now, in 2025, and not encounter meaningless temporal terms like "recently", or speculation about the future.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'll do some of this work myself in the coming days. We could also submit to <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_91e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">Wikipedia:Peer review</a> and get some perspective from other editors. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 02:36, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>There is nothing in here that says that criticizes Apple other than the lawsuits. How about the fact that Macs can't play games and can't run on AMD? --Rigist 22:31, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you misspelled "fewer games are available for Mac OS X than for Windows, and Macs use processors from Intel rather than AMD".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The first could be considered a deficiency of Mac OS X (not of Macs, any more, as you can install Windows on them if you want, even if they don't come with Windows). I'm not sure whether it would count as a "criticism" in the sense that a complaint that OS X is slow, or has security problems, or that applications crash, would be a criticism - the latter are things that one could argue should Just Be Fixed, but the only ways to "fix" the smaller number of games would be for Apple to:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>switch from OS X to Windows, which would probably cause many other people <i>not</i> to want to use Macs, as they buy it because they like the way OS X works better than the way Windows works (just as there are people who like the way Windows works, and there are people who like the way <a href="../../../k/d/e/KDE_c627.html" title="KDE">KDE</a> works, and so on - no "of <i>course</i> {Windows, OS X, etc.} is better" opining, please);</li>
<li>promote the use of games under <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtualization.html" title="Virtualization">virtualization</a> software such as <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallels_Workstation_6c36.html" title="Parallels Workstation">Parallels Workstation</a> or <a href="../../../v/m/w/VMWare_7f8b.html" title="VMWare">VMWare</a>;</li>
<li>promote the development and use of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwine.html" title="Darwine">Darwine</a>.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The second runs the risk of turning into Yet Another AMD Fanboy Versus Intel Fanboy war; the mere fact that Apple used processors from Vendor A rather than Vendor B isn't, by itself, an item to criticize, you'd need to justify why choosing chips from Vendor B is a better idea than choosing them from Vendor A, and that could turn into a long debate about the relative merits of various aspects of AMD and AMD's processors vs. Intel and Intel's processors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's no inherent reason why the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computer_f26c.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macintosh.html" title="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> pages should be free of a criticism section; if they shouldn't have one, <i>no</i> page about a company or product should have one. However, there are cases where criticisms of a company are "notable", e.g. criticisms of <a href="../../../e/x/x/ExxonMobil_c2ab.html" title="ExxonMobil">ExxonMobil</a> for the <a href="../../../e/x/x/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill_513d.html" title="Exxon Valdez oil spill">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/s/Nestl%C3%A9.html" title="Nestlé">Nestlé</a> for their marketing of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infant_formula.html" title="Infant formula">infant formula</a>, so clearly "no criticism sections" is wrong. However, a criticism section shouldn't just be a forum for gripes (just as a Web page about a company or organization shouldn't be full of breathless enthusiasm about a company); WP:NOT a Web bulletin board. <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Harris_fa37.html" title="User:Guy Harris">Guy Harris</a> 23:16, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On top of what has been said, regarding the Intel/AMD thing: Macs are a closed platform and always have been. It's entirely fair of Apple to choose Intel's chips, just as it was not worthy of criticism in an encyclopedia that they previously used PowerPC as a platform. In relation to games - that's more a criticism of game developers than Apple. Mac OS X has built-in OpenGL, so anybody can make games for it if they choose to invest the time and money, and as the Mac market grows, you'll see more of that happening - but it's not Apple's job to port other peoples software. <b><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidjk_f7cd.html" title="User:Davidjk">Davidjk</a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidjk_9134.html" title="User talk:Davidjk">msg</a>+<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Davidjk_b5ce.html" title="Special:Contributions/Davidjk">edits</a>)</sup> 17:02, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not concerned with such a notion of fairness. If you want to cite it in the corporation's main article, what matters is, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">is it notable</a> at the corporate level? The BSOD is well-known, appears in popular culture (i.e.--payphones, screensavers, humor, etc), and has been around since the early 90's. The tie between Microsoft, Windows, and BSOD is well-known. Microsoft is famous, so is Windows, and so is BSOD. It's a relatively common jab at Microsoft. Tiger crashing is hardly at that level of notability. On Microsoft-related topics, the idea of BSOD is hardly obscure. I don't think the tie between Apple and a Tiger crash screen is nearly so strong. That crash screen came into being in 2001...do you even know the name of that screen (it does have one)? This screen already appears elswhere in Wikipedia. Associated directly to the Apple article doesn't seem correct, it's not notable at the corporate level. Just like, on the MS side, consensus is that MS paying for Wikipedia edits, while it should appear somewhere in Wikipedia, isn't a noteworthy enough fact about MS to justify putting it in the main article.</li>

<p>It is notable at the corperate level, just as notable as the BSOD. it is an error screen that the machines are known for. as you say "It's a relatively common jab at Microsoft." Wikipedia is not the place for "jabs." Much like the need for the Microsoft page to include a photo of their operating system crashing, to be as accurate as possible, the Apple Computer page should include an image of their operating system crashing as well. The BOSD may be in pop-culture, but that does not make apple's crash screen unnoteworthy in fact, the fact that apple does crash is informational since the common misperception is that apples DONT crash, which from a user perspective, is very very not true. Perhaps information like this should be in An Apple Inc.'s own Criticism section? either that, or it should be fine where it is.</p>
<p>The fact that Blue Screen of Death has its own article indicates the reference on Microsoft' page is not for "pop-culture" significance, but is simply giving information about a reality of Microsoft systems. That standard, in strictly neutral encyclopedic interests, is being applied here. This is not a response to the Microsoft BSOD, simply following the standard that is used for Microsoft as a template in editing Apple. --<a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Zeeboid</a> 19:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>KEEP</b>--I am going to have to agree that the image should stay up. I have read an interesting justification for leaving it up, which makes a ton of sense and seems to coincide with a standard for information that is unconcerned with the negative vs positive image of the article's subject. The reasoning offered to censor the negative image about Apple is basically, "it is not commonly known that Apple crashes" and "you don't even know the name of the crash screen" therefore "it is not worthy of being on Apple's page".</dd>

<dd>Think about which standard we should apply as a Wikipedia rule of thumb. Leave the crash picture up because it is both a fact about the subject and in accordance with other articles in the same field.

<dd>Or is it the real reason for the double-standard application that leaving the image up for Microsoft is exactly a "jab at Microsoft" and, knowing the insane passions by the followers, consequently viewing a similar image for Apple as an equally vindictive "jab at Apple"--which simply is not permissible?</dd>

<dd>You are mis-construing my reasoning, and taking this mis-construction to ridiculous extremes. Have you followed the discussion at Microsoft talk page about whether or not the "paying for wikipedia edits" controversy is worth mentioning at the corporate level? I'll note that it was <b>me</b> that convinced the final hold-out that it was not worth mentioning at the corporate level. No one is suggesting that paid-edits controversy doesn't belong on wikipedia...just that it doesn't merit mention on Microsoft main page. Likewise no one is suggesting the Tiger crash screen should be eradicated from every location on wikipedia (it already exists in other articles). The standard I'm using, the same that we used on the MS talk page, is whether this info is notable at the corporate level. I'm fine if consensus decides it is notable at the corporate level, but please do not mis-construe my reason for feeling (so far) that it isn't notable at the corporate level. As said on the MS talk page, there are a million <i>facts</i> that are true about MS. Likewise Apple. Our goal is not to include every fact in every possible article, but to decide which facts belong in which articles. Otherwise every article would be 100MB and completely lose the reader in trivia and detail. I probably wouldn't care at all about this if it didn't initially strike me as POV-pushing and not coming from some reasoned rationale. ALL computers crash. That's probably best mentioned on a general article about operating systems. The only thing that makes that fact notable in regards to a particular OS is notoriety, or if it crashes unusually often. XP &amp; OS X seem about equally stable to me, however Windows, and it's crash screen, are WAY more well-known than either OS X or its crashes. This is not about information hiding. The Tiger screen is on wiki. It's about whether it's notable at the corp. level.</dd>

<li>Your latest edits to your reply are making your point less well IMO. Correct, wiki is not the place for jabs. However, the fact that BSOD is a common jab at MS is another bit of support as to why it's notable at the corporate level. How much popular culture lampoons the Tiger crash screen? How much lampoons BSOD? <b>Of course</b> BSOD having it's own article has nothing to do with pop-culture. But the reason for even mentioning BSOD at the corporate level is because it IS very well known. <i>"simply following the standard that is used for Microsoft as a template in editing Apple"</i> I don't believe other articles are supposed to set detailed <i>standards</i> for one another. But I'll let veteran wikipedians weigh-in on that one. In any case, overall, you have made some good points, though I don't agree with all your reasoning...we'll wait to see what others think.</li>

<p>All operating systems can crash. That does not mean every computer company article has to have a picture of its crash screen. Most reviewers credit OS X with being very stable. Absent some reliable source that says this crash screen is commonly enountered by OS X users, it's not notable and doesn't belong in this article. Whether BSOD belongs in the Microsoft artilcle should be discussed there, not here.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 20:57, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>KEEP</b>--What is your definition of "The only thing that makes that fact notable in regards to a particular OS is notoriety, or if it crashes unusually often." because from what I understand it’s all a numbers game. It is clear that a computer with 95% of the market share, would have the perception of crashing more often then one with 3.5% of the market share. The reason the windows crash screen is better known is because 95% of the users out there have a Windows machine. I am not here to argue semantics or play numbers games, or bicker over a better operating system, but the As we are all in agreeing that "all computers crash," my reasoning for posting that image is to help show other users that despite <a href="http://www.apple.com/lae/switch/whyswitch/" class="external text" title="http://www.apple.com/lae/switch/whyswitch/" rel="nofollow">Apple's Advertising claims</a>, and apparent majority misconception about the product, the computers actually do crash. As <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_aboutme_96fb.html" title="User:Mnyakko/aboutme">Tony</a> stated, information about a topic that is not "commonly known" is just as important as the information that is "commonly known." Because of the misconception that is out there about Apples not crashing, is precisely the reason it is important to keep up.--<a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Zeeboid</a> 04:25, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do you have a source for your claim of an "apparent majority" "misconception that is out there about Apples not crashing"? Macs do have a reputation for being very reliable. Many independent reviewers have said so. But I haven heard anyone say they <i>never</i> crash. Do you have a source that contradicts this? Apple's market share has nothing to do with this reputation. If they crashed a lot, Mac users would be as familiar with the screen you show as Windows users are with the BSOD. I've been using OS X since 1999 and have seen that screen once, on a friend's machine, many years ago. I'm not saying I've never had to reboot, but full crashes like that are uncommon in my experience. In any case, this article is about the corporation, not <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_OS_X_b8d4.html" title="Mac OS X">Mac OS X</a>.

<dd>Wikipedia is not a forum for answering every exaggerated advertising claim. I just went to microsoft.com and their front page has an ad for Office that says "Essential. Reliable. Easy." Should we answer that in the Microsoft article? I think not. If there is real controversy about the veracity Apple's ads in published sources, a discussion belongs in an appropriate section with a clear explaination of the issues. Merely showing a crash screen would not suffice. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 18:57, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please quote the "original research". And the NPOV seems to be from the "pictures of Apple crashing cannot be permitted on the Apple article" side. What is NOT verifiable? The fact that Apple crashes? Or the part that Apple claims to 'never crash'? Or is the screen itself not verifiable? And, is that a threat? I do not understand what "to see what happens to editors who fail to conform their behavior" is supposed to mean. Those who do not view NPOV the way you do are subject to penalties? Sure seems easy to throw out accusations, masked threats in the face of 'sources' that contradict you POV.</dd>

As long as I have been observing these back and forths throughout Wikipedia I have noticed that such is not the case more often than not. It is very easy to apply these omission standards throughout Wikipedia...and perhaps a movement doing such should be started. We'll call it "NO-Double Standards" and remove negative content from articles using the very quotes being provided here.</dd>

<li><i>"The reason the windows crash screen is better known is because 95% of the users out there have a Windows machine."</i> Right. Therefore making it's crash screen more notorious. And, actually, thinking about it, I rescind my earlier claim. In my extensive experience with NT, XP, and OS X, OS X crashes <b>far</b> less often. Working in IT with Windows, I see crashes several times/month. However, combined my family has 18yrs experience with OS X. It's crashed exactly once. <i>"despite Apple's Advertising claims"</i> Apple probably shouldn't say that. Then again, Microsoft says a lot of things they shouldn't say. And, given that the Apple crash incidence seems to be close to 0, I'd actually forgive Apple that bit of hyperbole. Microsoft engages in far more exaggerated hyperbole.</li>

<dd>Yep, and everyone will claim to know someone or personally experience exactly what they are claiming to support. I have a friend who works at an imaging company that uses Macs and he says one of them crashes every other day, while his windows PC crashes once every 6 months of running 24-7... which would be Windows in use crashing <b>far</b> less often then a Mac. I am in the same boat. My windows machines are left on 24-7 and I can’t remember the last time one of them bombed out for a reason other then me altering core settings to see how that would affect it. However, for encyclopedic information, your personal experience, my personal experience, and the personal experience of my friend don't matter. What matters is the actual facts. Facts are, like you said: “all computers crash.” However there is a misconception that is spread from Apple themselves about how Apples “Don’t Crash.” There are many examples of correctting misconceptions. That is why Wikipedia exists, to educate those who wish to look it up. Because it is less known that Apples Crash, and because of The Apple Corporation’s advertising claims stating the contrary, is precisely why the image of the Apple Crashing screen (along with perhaps more information about apples crashing and Apple Inc's false advertising) should exist on their company Wiki.--<a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Zeeboid</a> 14:59, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Frankly, it seems that if it is a fact that Apple purported its product as "never crashing" (which obviously does not apply to their iPods, as both of my wife's iPods crash every 5 or 6 hours of use) makes their crash screen applicable on the corporate level as well (i.e. effective misleading or exaggerated marketing).</dd>

<li><i>"What is the factual problem with the picture of an Apple crash screen?"</i> As I wrote (though you might easily have missed it), the addition seemed to me like an attempt at POV-pushing, and not based out of any reasonable rationale. The more we have discussed this, the more I believe my initial reaction was correct. There has been, I think, FINALLY, *ONE* interesting rationale about putting it in here. Yet, in regards to notability, EVERY article in wiki is not supposed to be a collection of EVERY possible relevant fact, and I remain unconvinced that this crash screen is notable at the corp. level. Under <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crash_%28computing%29.html" title="Crash (computing)">Crash (computing)</a> it would make a great deal of sense. I don't know that it even belongs under <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_OS_X_b8d4.html" title="Mac OS X">Mac OS X</a>, unless someone can cite an authoritative source that Macs crash frequently. <i>"all because people want to prevent any negative content of fact from being placed on an article of facts"</i> Perhaps you missed all the negative stuff under <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Inc._771e.html#Corporate_affairs" title="Apple Inc.">Apple_Inc.#Corporate_affairs</a>, which I've already written in another Talk that it ought to be in its own Criticisms section. '<i>"the fact that Apples do crash is (1) verifiable and (2) brings the article closer to "encyclopedic"</i> The issue has to do with notability. Why isn't the paying-for-wikipedia edits issue on Microsoft main page? Because we all agreed it wasn't notable at the corp. level. Have you seen <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wiki is not an indiscriminate collection</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_an_encyclopedia_94c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia">Wiki is not a dumping ground</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> (not the same as WP:NOT)? <i>"if it is a fact that Apple purported its product as "never crashing" makes their crash screen applicable on the corporate level as well (i.e. effective misleading or exaggerated marketing)."</i> Do you think EVERY advertising claim should be de-bunked on EVERY corp.'s main page? That would make EVERY corp. article rather long, and lose the reader, and the main point (the corp.) in the process. Change the subject for a second, do you think the paying-for-wiki-edits issue belongs on the Microsoft main page? Why/why not? Consensus there was "no" (with me convincing the final hold-out).</li>

<dd>If I may—I concur with <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_C.K._d6e1.html" title="User:Jason C.K.">Jason C.K.</a>. It is clearly a fallacy that Mac OS X never crashes, but the Apple Inc. main page just doesn't seem to be the right place to try to debunk that particular myth. There is an article on <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screens_of_Death_0917.html" title="Screens of Death">Screens_of_Death</a> which includes the Mac OS Kernel Panic screen—so it is on Wikipedia somewhere. The other odd thing about where it comes in the article. There is no reference to OS X crashing in the text, yet there the kernel panic is. In a fairly short software section, it just seems out of place. I'm not, of course, advocating that it should not be on Wikipedia, far from it, but simply that it seems very out of place at the moment. And countering personal experience of OS X not crashing with other personal experience is no decider on its place on this page—no-one's personal experience surely has the logical upper hand! Instead, I would urge people to strongly consider whether it really belongs on Apple Inc's main page.--Walafrid 11:36, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For me, the question seems to be this: because Apple have made the claim that Mac's don't crash, does that mean a screenshot of a Kernel Panic belongs on Apple Inc.'s main page? No-one here (I hope) is arguing that kernel panics don't happen; rather, as I have said before, there has to be a better place for this particular picture. For one thing, if it is to stay, I think it needs a reference in the text. At the moment, its presence <i>is</i> pushing a particular POV simply because there is no attempt to balance it: its only reason for being there appears to be to prove that Mac OS X crashes, in response to a perceived view that it doesn't. Is it the place of Wikipedia articles to attempt to address every supposed misperception? As to the argument that Microsoft has the BSOD, so Apple's page must too: why can't OS X stand up on its own merits? Again, the question is raised—does the kernel panic screen have such notoriety that a visitor wishing to learn about Apple Inc. would find it useful? As the article stands, the answer has to be ‘No’. --Walafrid 23:12, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>One controversy over this issue is whether Microsoft's payoff was indeed then "bailing Apple out", or whether it was indeed paid to Apple in order to settle previous and upcoming lawsuits.

<li>LOL, be careful what you wish for, Skidoo &amp; others...the full story looks pretty poor on Microsoft. Anyway, gave more detail to the entire issue. Some very interesting reading at <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Canyon_Company_9c3d.html" title="San Francisco Canyon Company">San Francisco Canyon Company</a>. There was lots of speculation about the settlement. Was it really an end to fighting + a partnership, as stated, or was there more to it? Is it because of the stolen QuickTime code? Who benefitted more? The $150 mill wasn't worth much to Apple. The IE default wasn't worth much to MS (they didn't need IE on Macs to gain browser dominance). MS got out of the lawsuits. Apple got Office. How likely was the Office cancellation? Maybe they both won, and both lost (the definition of compromise?). Only Bill and Steve know.</li>

<p>Is the part on Greenpeace (the whole section "Environmental Issues" is on Greenpeace's criticism) relevant? Checking Google, Greenpeace has similarly criticized every major computer manufacturer I could think of. I think that it should be removed from this article, the <a href="../../../h/e/w/Hewlett-Packard_9234.html" title="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a> article and every other article that has a Greenpeace section. If a company has a serious problem, it will be noted by other organizations than Greenpeace. Also, if the majority of computer manufacturers are behaving similarly, criticism about the industry's should be placed in a generic article, like <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a> or an article on computer manufacturing or environmental issues, if there is one. A mention in the Greenpeace article may also be appropriate. Finally, in my experience, Greenpeace is not a reliable source. First, they are biased. Getting environmental information from them is like getting gun violence statistics from the National Rifle Association or global warming information from the coal industry. Bias affecting results or information need not be intentional. Second, like most political organizations, they are inept when it comes to logic, committing logical fallacies regularly (some of their (political organizations) favorites are guilt by association, straw man and false dilemma). Third, they do not understand technical issues, like the safety of a substance or technology. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 12:09, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

I believe the Greenpeace, as a current event, belongs in a secion marked "Controversy and Criticism". I *do* believe it is relevant but it is not appropriate in the current place (under "Hardware") as this section should be considered part of the story that explains Apple's relationship to other entities.

<dd>The caption isn't quite accurate for the image, but the Apple I was sold initially as just a motherboard, so technically the facts are right.

<dd>Not sure. I've heard the urban legend about the $666.66 but can't recall ever seeing actual proof of it. Caption should probably just be changed to "Photo of the Apple I in wood housing with keyboard" or something similar. 24.57.195.9 03:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

It also reproduces on the same page Apple's first ad, published in the September 1976 edition of <i>Interface Age</i> on page 13, which also give the price as $666.66.

<dd>Personally, I prefer my version of the last sentence of the lead paragraph:
<dl>
<dd>The company was known as <b>Apple Computer, Inc.</b> for its first 30 years of existence, but announced that it would be dropping the word "Computer" from its name at the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macworld.html" title="Macworld">Macworld</a> conference on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_9.html" title="January 9">9 January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a><sup id="_ref-AP_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AP" title="">[1]</a></sup> when it debuted the much-anticipated <a href="../../../i/p/h/IPhone_4136.html" title="IPhone">iPhone</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_TV_a44c.html" title="Apple TV">Apple TV</a>.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can part with the Apple TV link, but I think a link to the iPhone is critical because the product is such a hotly anticipated item (2200 google news hits and the keynote ended less than half an hour ago <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=iphone&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=iphone&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) that most readers in the next few days will be visiting this page BECAUSE of the iPhone. Further, discussing the iPhone helps explain Apple's decision to drop the word "computer" from its name. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 19:30, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Further, I think that talking about the iPhone is important to defining Apple. As Steve said during the keynote, Apple revolutionized the computer, than it revolutionized music and now its attempting to revolutionize phones and to a lesser extent TV. What we saw was a big shift from being a computer company that makes one line of consumer electronics products to a company that focuses on many different aspects of a user's experience with technology. Digital convergence and all that. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 19:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Being "hotly anticipated" doesn't mean it belongs in the lead section. If you want to write news, the folks at Wikinews will always appreicate the help. Apple introduces major new products every year, but it's only the test of time that determines whether any one specific product belongs in a concise, encyclopedic description of a company. When the iPhone is released, yes, it will merit two or three words in the lead as part of the list of categories of products the company produces. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 21:31, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a bit of a stickler for accuracy so: Has the legal name actually changed yet?

<dd>I agree with Guy Harris that a Form 8-K is official evidence that the company has completed its name change to Apple Inc. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, American corporations have to be very honest with the federal government. I was surprised to learn from the form that both the old and new corporations were California corporations, Most American corporations prefer to incorporate in Delaware where the board of directors has much more power vis-a-vis the shareholders. As for whether this article should be titled Apple Inc. or Apple (company), I believe there are valid arguments on both sides, so I am neutral on that issue. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 03:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the History/Early years section, the following appears: "In the early 1980s, IBM and Microsoft continued to gain market share at Apple's expense in the personal computer industry. Using a fundamentally different business model, IBM marketed an open hardware standard created with the IBM PC [...]".</p>
<p>It seems to me that the IBM PC was very much a closed hardware system, until Compaq managed to clone the PC (remember the fuss about PC clones back in the mid-80s?). Also, in the early 1980s, Microsoft was a bit player, just a contractor to IBM. And IBM could hardly "continue" to gain market share as it was just starting out in the PC business. IBM *began* to gain market share at Apple's expense.</p>
<p>I'm writing this here on the talk page rather than editing the article because I would prefer that someone who knows the history better do the actual revision.

<dd>The IBM PC used off-the-shelf hardware parts to keep the cost down and profits high. The hardware was very open, but the software including the BIOS was not.

<li>And the early reverse-engineered BIOSes weren't COMPLETELY reliable...so buying a clone was some risk...but I believe cheaper. Eventually the BIOSes got very good, but for a while it was marketing FUD that it was dangerous to buy a clone because they were unreliable. I don't think they were ever THAT unreliable...and eventually they were fine. But the FUD continued to be useful...for a while. I think that history is why "Intel inside" got started, and resonates with the scary old past of unreliable clones. But good ole' Intel, they're reliable.</li>

<p>As pointed out in <b>Name change official?</b> above, the company's name has officially changed. Unfortunately, this means we need to move the article again. Per <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28companies%29_abfd.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (companies)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (companies)</a>, the legal status of the company (Inc. in this case) is not normally part of the article name. Since removing that would leave us with <b>Apple</b>, which is ripe for disambiguation, the article needs renamed to <b>Apple (company)</b>.</p>
<p>I'd make the change myself, but I've yet to deal with double-redirects, so I'll let someone else make sure the move goes properly. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 03:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>According to <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a>: "Generally, article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The rule for companies is "The legal status of the company (Corp., plc or LLC), is not normally included, i.e. Microsoft or Wal-Mart. When disambiguation is needed, legal status, main company interest or "(company)" can be used to disambiguate: for example, Halifax (bank) or Converse (company). When the legal status is used, it is abbreviated in the article title. In the article itself, the title sentence of the article should include the abbreviated legal status. For example: Generic Corp. Ltd. is largest provider of widgets in the world."</dd>

<dd>My point being, how many people are going to actually refer to the company as "Apple Inc."? The vast majority of folks simply refer to it as "Apple." Per your first quote, I would think "Apple (company)" would be more clear. Heck, even when the company was named Apple Computer, most folks just called them Apple.

<dd>The more I think about this, the more I am siding with Kesh's argument. Very few people referred to them, in ordinary speech or formal writing, as Apple Computer Inc., and I think Kesh is right that very few people would actually say Apple Inc. when it's clear which "Apple" they're referring to from the context. Therefore, Apple (company) is probably the superior article title. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 04:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regardless of how we name this article, someone typing in "Apple" is going to the fruit article.

They might use Apple Inc., especially as Apple starts using that name more. Also consider links. A link to [ [Apple Inc.] ] won't need a pipe, but if the article is named Apple (computer), every link will need a pipe. There is nothing in WP:NAME that says (company) is the preferred disambiguation approach.

<p>Clarification: Just as "Apple Computer, Inc." recently became "Apple, Inc." according to the company itself, "Macintosh" was modernized to simply "Mac" several years ago, circa the release of the G4 -- and following the abstraction of the <b>Mac OS</b> as a distinct product.</p>
<p>I think this is a model article, and I only wish to freshen it by suggesting that the term <i>Macintosh</i> be updated to <i>Mac</i> when used generically -- it should <i>remain</i> "Macintosh" for historical accuracy. As example, I recommend the following as basic guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>The "Macintosh Plus" was an early <i>Mac</i> computer. At the time, the entire series of related computers were known collectively as <i>Macintoshes</i>.</li>
<li>The current line of personal computers offered by <b>Apple Inc.</b> are now collectively known as <i>Macs</i>.</li>
<li>Any computer that runs any version of the <b>Mac OS</b> can be referred to as a "Mac" generically. (Servers notwithstanding.) However...</li>
<li>...If it was manufactured before ca. 2001, it might have "Macintosh XXX" as its model name.</li>
</ol>
<p>I already made changes in the lead of the article to reflect this. I would/will do more if I have time.</p>
<p>Keep up the great work on the article(s). And please feel free to discuss further clarifications here on the talk page.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
