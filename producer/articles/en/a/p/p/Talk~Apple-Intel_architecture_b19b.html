I take issue with this, I think Photoshop is a bad example because:</p>
<p>1. it is not designed only for osx 2. it does NOT work faster on osx 3. it is not any more intuitive on osx</p>
<p>I would suggest putting Final Cut Pro or Logic in there instead, and have amended accordingly.</p>

<p>"OpenOSX WinTel is just Q renamed and sold without giving anything back to the original developer, not even credit for their work."</p>
<p>Can you prove that? And even if it's true, does that mean that people reading the wikipedia article should not allowed to be aware of its existence? I'd bet that whoever owns OpenOSX probably would dispute your claim (I have no idea if it's true or not).

<dd>OpenOSX WinTel and Q are both ports of QEMU. OpenOSX WinTel is sold under the GPL, according to their website. Since your assertion that "OpenOSX WinTel is just Q renamed" is false, I'm putting the mention back in the article. If you think that OpenOSX is doing something wrong in their marketing of WinTel, maybe you should add a mention to the Q article, or create a WinTel article (since it looks like there isn't one yet). <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranhamo_4524.html" title="User:Aranhamo">Aranhamo</a> 19:56, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. You still haven't given any reason why WinTel should not be mentioned in this article. It is not "Q repackaged", but it is based off of some of the same code. Q has a different set of features than WinTel, while WinTel has superior performance. If WinTel was simply a commercial repackaging of Q, then they would have the same features and performance. Can you give any good reason why WinTel should not be mentioned? Are you the final arbiter of which virtualization solutions get mention in wikipedia, so that you can exclude WinTel just because you don't like them? You're obviously biased against WinTel and toward Q. I don't use either, nor any other virtualization solution, and I don't see any reason why WinTel should not be mentioned in the article. And so far, all you seem to have come up with is that you don't like the WinTel developers because you think they ripped off Q. If there is some kind of dispute about that, it belongs in the Q or WinTel articles, not here. Merely deleting any reference to WinTel because you don't like them is called "censorship". I guess it's not possible to have even one NPOV article on wikipedia, even on a technical subject. wikipedia is such a sham; you can have it. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranhamo_4524.html" title="User:Aranhamo">Aranhamo</a> 07:44, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I can see no reason to exclude a particular product, though Wikipedia isn't a catalogue. One key point, however, is that this WinTel thing doesn't have a Wikipedia article, while Q does. References to things with articles are always preferable. Of course, that does lead to the suggestion that there be an article created for the other software; if there are properly sourced criticisms of its provenance, that is the place to document them. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 10:30, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aranhamo, perhaps you should read up on the subject first. You said "It is not Q repackaged, but it is based off of some of the same code."</p>
<p>Perhaps you could try reading their website, "WinTel is our popular Cocoa graphical user interface used to control the included powerful underlying open-source "Qemu" x86 virtualization/emulation software."<a href="http://openosx.com/wintel/" class="external autonumber" title="http://openosx.com/wintel/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> All they have done is create a GUI that configures and launches Qemu. Specifically the version of QEMU ported to Mac OS X, otherwise known as "Q", hence the line "Special thanks to Gwenolé Beauchesne for his excellent Intel port of Fabrice Bellard's fast Qemu opensource virtual machine."<a href="http://openosx.com/wintel/" class="external autonumber" title="http://openosx.com/wintel/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>If you still don't believe me how about reading some reviews of the product.<a href="http://www.macupdate.com/reviews.php?id=14531" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.macupdate.com/reviews.php?id=14531" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/18545&amp;mode=feedback" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/18545&amp;mode=feedback" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <a href="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/OSX/openosx_x86_emulator.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/OSX/openosx_x86_emulator.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> They all agree that Wintel does NOT have superior performance.

<dd>I may just be misattributing quotes, but didn't you say "not even credit for their work", and now you indicate that their web site gives two specific credits?

However some people think that if you take someone else's work and sell it, that you should give something back to the people who did the actual work. OpenOSX give nothing back, and they only credits the people whose work they sell because people complained repeatedly.<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pr/openosx.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pr/openosx.php" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 21:39, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
