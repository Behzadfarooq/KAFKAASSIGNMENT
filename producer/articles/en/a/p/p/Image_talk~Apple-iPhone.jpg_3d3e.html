<li><b>Agree</b> - The focus is the product itself and the image isn't an actual screen grab. <b><a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERoguegeek_d28b.html" title="User:Roguegeek">Roguegeek</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../r/o/g/User_talk%7ERoguegeek_5916.html" title="User talk:Roguegeek">talk</a>)</small> 16:28, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Work with me, here. I'm not Scepia, who wanted to characterize the photo in its entirety as copyrighted.

<dd>Remember, <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a>. That image may be mis-labeled. However, that image doesn't focus so much on the user interface. That image details the color, shape, screen size, etc. of the iPods, and the UI isn't the biggest part. However, the iPhone image shows mostly the UI. I think you need to read about derivative works, Roguegeek. <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7EScepia_1657.html" title="User:Scepia">Scepia</a> 19:57, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've also prepared <a href="../../../a/p/p/Image%7EApple-iPhone-002.jpg_9301.html" title="Image:Apple-iPhone-002.jpg">another image</a> that's more than ready to be placed into the iPhone article.

<dd>I'm not saying we should remove fair use from the article. The UI is an important part of the iPhone. But if you have fair use, you need to tag it as such. <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7EScepia_1657.html" title="User:Scepia">Scepia</a> 19:57, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, how do you know what the iPhone looks like when turned off? It may be shiny, it may be dull, it may be bumpy, but do you have any proof that that texture is true? <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7EScepia_1657.html" title="User:Scepia">Scepia</a> 19:58, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't play this game. We know what we know about it already. It's a smooth shinny surface, but it doesn't matter simply because we are blocking out the questionable material. Even so, it's being shot through glass and the images are very low quality, so it simply doesn't matter. I suggest you spend a little more time looking for or creating images instead of trying really hard to keep failed fair use material and discouraging editors to do the same. <b><a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERoguegeek_d28b.html" title="User:Roguegeek">Roguegeek</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../r/o/g/User_talk%7ERoguegeek_5916.html" title="User talk:Roguegeek">talk</a>)</small> 20:11, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can do whatever I please on Wikipedia. In fact, why don't you do something useful instead of contradicting every word out of my mouth? Fair use is fair use. Don't make excuses. You are the one playing a game - "Even so, it's being shot through glass and the images are very low quality, so it simply doesn't matter." That's ridiculous, you can see the screen quite well.

<li><b>Disagree</b>: Per <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a>'s comments above, this is a derivative work. A large section of the image details the copyrighted user interface (running <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_OS_X_b8d4.html" title="Mac OS X">Mac OS X</a>.) Mac OS X is clearly copyrighted. Since Apple didn't claim that the UI was out of copyright, we must legally assume that it is copyrighted. Web pages often don't have a copyright notice, but they are copyrighted regardless. Unless Apple comes and says "screenshots of iPhone are free use", they are fair use. <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7EScepia_1657.html" title="User:Scepia">Scepia</a> 19:57, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I like how my question was avoided so let me bring it up again. Explain to me this. How did <a href="../../../i/m/a/Image%7EImage-IPod_5G%2C_nano_2G%2C_shuffle_2G.jpg_d61d.html" title="Image:Image-IPod 5G, nano 2G, shuffle 2G.jpg">this image</a> get uploaded and passed at Commons(!) no less? No fair use images of any kind are allowed there, yet that image clearly shows the operating system running on the iPod. If we apply your thinking to the iPod image, it should deserve a fair use tag also.

<dd>I asked this on the Village Pump, and they said if it is small/insignificant enough, it doesn't matter that there's a bit of fair use. It's not going to hurt anyone, basically. But still, <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a>. Perhaps that image is fair use, and should not be on Commons.

<dd>You don't think things can slip by on Commons, too? I've been contributing at Commons quite a bit lately, and I can literally list hundreds of images there, including many reviewed by administrators, that have probable copyright issues. I am planning on putting many them up for review eventually, when I get around to it. From what I've observed, admins often just mechanically go through images to see if the images and licenses match with the indicated source page, and don't examine further than that. Images from Flickr are especially prone to be overlooked like this. Image:Itunesquellen.png had been on Commons for nearly a year, and it was only today that it was caught.<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Deletion_requests/Image:IPhone_at_Macworld_(front_view).jpg&amp;diff=4068344&amp;oldid=4068174" class="external autonumber" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Deletion_requests/Image:IPhone_at_Macworld_(front_view).jpg&amp;diff=4068344&amp;oldid=4068174" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Unless it's survived the full <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Deletion_requests" class="extiw" title="commons:Commons:Deletion_requests">deletion requests</a> process, I wouldn't take it for granted that the image passes just because it's on Commons. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 20:20, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
