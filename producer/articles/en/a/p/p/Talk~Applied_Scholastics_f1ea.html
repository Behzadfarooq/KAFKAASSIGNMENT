<p>Isn't that grossly POV editing? To judge a site to be a "watchdog site" is perfectly okay..... when sitting around drinking a beer with the boys. But not in an encyclopedic article. State the site as it appears to the reader or as it appears when called up, "Scientololgy vs Education" or something. But "watchdog site," that is original research, a conclusion drawn by the editor and posted to the article to sway the reader in a POV. I'm refering to the reference which proceeds: <a href="http://studytech.org/archives/000049.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://studytech.org/archives/000049.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 14:10, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The term "<a href="../../../w/a/t/Watchdog.html" title="Watchdog">Watchdog</a>" for such groups is not uncommon, and I don't know why you think it is only used among beer-drinking Joe Hardhats. Since studytech.org assiduously collects every scrap of news related to the use of Scientology and Dianetics in schools, the term fits. It is what it is, and not a POV push. Their watchdog purpose is clearly stated on their front page: <b>"We also want to equip parents, educators, and media with the tools to not only spot these front groups when they creep into town, but to question politicians, school boards, and principals who might knowingly or unknowingly support such intellectual fraud."</b> Still, whether the term "watchdog site" is replaced with something more generic like "critical site" really isn't a major issue with me, I just have to wonder why it's such a major issue with you. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 14:29, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Wikipediatrix. Its perfectly okay with me if everyone thinks of it as a "watchdog" site, but I propose that stating it as a watchdog site is an act of original research, a conclusion drawn by an editor and inserted into an article which predispositions a reader's right to draw his own conclusions. Let the dang site speak for itself, okay? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 14:38, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is quite an odd statement from you Terryeo. In another article ,[Dianetics], you have recently been editing and adding the words "Critical Site" to many sites that do not identify themselves as critical sites (The Straight Dope for one). Do you agree that your classification of sites as critical is original research? <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> 07:15, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A recent edit has Terryeo labeling studytech.org as a critical site. In light of his previous opinion 6 weeks ago that we should "let the dang site speak for itself", I find this new edit somewhat perplexing. If studytech.org is a "critical site" then I want to see a citation for that, because it appears that this classifaction by Terryeo is Original Research. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> 16:27, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are two sites which are similar in name. One is run by the Church of Scientology and a controrersy site has sprung up, attempting to duplicate the Church's presentation, so as to make it easier to juxtapose themselves as a controversial element. The Church runs "studytechnology.org" while the controversy appears at "studytech.org" Thus, it is easy to be misled, easy to misunderstand, easy to not 'get it' about which is which. I would say our job as editors is to do the hard work for the reader. Perhaps "critical site" is a little bit harsh, perhaps "controversy site" might sound more appropriate to [<a href="http://www.studytech.org" class="external text" title="http://www.studytech.org" rel="nofollow">studytech</a>'s site. I am willing to state my opinion on these talk pages, I am willing to spell out specifically how the site mis-represents Study Technology.

<dd>If there is to be any labeling it should be "Church of Scientology owned sites" and "Others". This clears up whatever "confusion" that may exist.

<p>"and the Church of Spiritual Technology, that it cannot be regarded as being anything other than a Scientology subsidiary...... ". I paste it here because there is no citation which establishes that Applied Scholastics receives money or support in a physical way from the Church of Scientology. "subsidiary" means that in some manner, they receive some kind of ongoing support. Perhaps you meant something almost the same? In any event unless Applied Scholastics receives money or other real world goods its relationship as a "subsidiary" to the Church of Scientology isn't immediately obious and clear and would need to be supported with a verification. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 04:02, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Applied Scholastics' parent corporation is ABLE, which is staffed by Sea Org members and has offices physically located in Churches of Scientology, including FLAG in Clearwater. Applied Scholastics appears as a Scientology organization in Scientology literature, such as this: <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Stop-Narconon/Documents/IntScnNews/" class="external free" title="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Stop-Narconon/Documents/IntScnNews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Stop-Narconon/Documents/IntScnNews/</a></dd>
<dd>It is not necessary to receive money from a parent to be considered a subsidiary. What Applied Scholastics receives is a license to use and sell L. Ron Hubbard's study tech materials, which originally appeared in Scientology's sacred scripture, the "red volumes". This is all documented in detail at <a href="http://StudyTech.org" class="external free" title="http://StudyTech.org" rel="nofollow">http://StudyTech.org</a> -- <a href="../../../t/o/u/User%7ETouretzky_3a3d.html" title="User:Touretzky">Touretzky</a> 04:08, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In regard to your link there, to that site. That site does not fully understand what they are talking about. First of all, the questions I raise below about "subsidiary" are valid. Secondly, that site attempts to present an "interpretation" of the study tech, that is, it attempts to tell the reader what study tech is. It fails. Whoever wrote that article does not understand study tech and if someone applied what that site describes as study tech, the student would be likely to fail. The site doesn't got it about study tech but it purports that it does. Since you seem to be willing to talk about it, I'll specify the first mistake I found about that site's presentation of "study tech". At: [<a href="http://studytech.org/study_tech1.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://studytech.org/study_tech1.php" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] it presents the first of 3 principals of study, (1) use pictures and diagrams to illustrate the concepts being taught. Well, both "principals of study" and that (1) are just plain wrong (according to Scientology's study tech). What is wrong with it is that a lack of mass (actual physical universe mass, a feather has a little and a rock has a lot) is hard on a student. It is a huge gap between what I said and what they describe it as. And it is not a principal of study, it is a barrier. They don't have the idea. They do have that there are 3 things. They don't have that the 3 things are barriers which make learning more difficult. To take that site's word (interpratation) of Applied Scholastic's relationship to Scientology doesn't make much sense. Besides which, I've spelled out below how "subsidiary" doesn't describe the relationship.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 08:17, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please "word clear" the definitions of "principal" and "principle". You appear to have those two words confused. Now, it's true that Scientology talks about <i>barriers</i>, and the essay at StudyTech.org talks about <i>principles</i>, but they are two sides of the same coin. Study tech says that lack of "mass" is a barrier, and recommends that physical examples. or pictures, be used as remedies for this supposed lack of "mass". The essay accurately summarizes this as a principle that pictures should be used to illustrate the concepts being taught. If you don't see the equivalence of these statements, that is your interpretation, but plenty of ex-Scientologists have read the essay and told me that I got it exactly right. I concede that I am not mimicking Hubbard's style of presentation. I am deemphasizing the barriers and focusing on the remedies. It's not my intent to "exactly duplicate" him, but rather, to extract the essential ideas and phrase them in a way that is most comprehensible to non-Scientologists. Since you appear to be well-versed in the Scientology lingo and world view, let me point out, without any disrespect, that you are not my target audience. However, I would welcome any other criticisms of the essay you care to offer. -- <a href="../../../t/o/u/User%7ETouretzky_3a3d.html" title="User:Touretzky">Touretzky</a> 04:21, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Its a pleasure to communicate with the author of that article. But just because you are right about my confusion of the two words "principal" and "principle" does not mean you're right on the whole article, HEH&#160;! I consider the article communicates some points of study tech but does not communicate other points. I juxtaposed the two links, but now see the differences aren't nearly as apparent to people as I hoped they would be.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 14:42, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Touretsky, in re-reading that site which again, I am glad to be in communication with you because you help create it. I want to point out (though you do whatever you want with the site) the site does not accurately represent what Hubbard says about Mass. The site says, "In other words, mass is what can be visualized." but that is not it, I submit to you that is not what Hubbard says is those quotes. Hubbard says, "mass" and that is what he means. Most people know "mass" as used here on earth to be "weight" and that is the quality of matter which Hubbard is meaning to say. Mass. period. not "what can be visualized" and not "what can be imagined" but "actual mass" weight. Studying about feathers the student wants feathers and studying bridges the student wants tons of steel. Note too, the result of this barrier. "It is hard on the student" and this does not mean the student can't, it just means it is easier on a student if he has the mass (weight) of his study available to him. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 22:37, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is true enough, as far as it goes. But the term "subsidiary" as defined by a common dictionary means: `.Serving to assist or supplement; auxiliary. or 2.Secondary in importance; subordinate. and then in the case of companies who hold stock, 51% ownership makes a company a "subsidiary" of a parent company. Applied Scholastics does sell a technology they did not themselves produce and they get that information / technology from the Church of Scientology. But they do things which the Church does not do. They address issues and present the information in ways the Church does not. I have checked into how the study tech can be used, exactly because I wanted to help some high school students. I don't believe the word subsidiary quite describes the situation because it implies Applied Scholastics does nothing but those actions the Church does, that it is a parallel effort. But this is not the case because Applied Scholastics makes efforts, original, creative efforts in areas the Church doesn't attempt to touch. Yes, they sell a product they receive from the Church, but then so do many companies sell products they get from another source than themselves. They aren't just a storefront, they create communication and do things independent of the Church and a person would have to judge "how much is Applied Scholastics" and "how much is the Church?" and to this question, the only commonality is the printed paper which they sell copies of. I won't try to list out the activites that Applies Scholastics does of their own accord and creation, but it is significant and therefore "subsidiary" is not an accurate description of the realtionship. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 08:06, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The use of the term subsidiary to describe Applied Scholastics relationship to Scientology is entirely accurate. A subsidiary is simply an entity that is controlled by another entity, usually a corporation (the legal definition implicitly expects a subsidiary to be a corporation). The 1993 Agreement between Scientology and the IRS explicitly recognizes a number of "Scientology-related entities," which is a term of art specific to the Agreement. Some are even named, including ABLE, and Applied Scholastics International. Most importantly, however, the named entities are obligated to refrain from certain conduct. That the 1993 Agreement can presume to contractually bind "Scientology-related entities," including Applied Scholastics, indicates the presence of an agency relationship between Scientology (the Agreement also formally cleaves "Scientology" into separate corporate factions, including CSI, RTC, &amp; CST, amongst others) and the mentioned "Scientology-related entities." Indeed, the first page of the Agreement indicates as much: "WHEREAS, the Church of Scientology and its 'constituent entities' (the "Church") and the Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") have a long history of controversy spanning over 30 years..." (emphasis mine). As Dave points out, Applied Scholastics is directly controlled by ABLE, which is in turn controlled by CSI, mostly through licensing fees and royalties paid uplines. But the IRS Agreement establishes, at a minimum, a subsidiary relationship between Applied Scholastics and Scientology. <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikk_818c.html" title="User:Tikk">Tikk</a> 07:01, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Its good of you to point out the partent document which spells out the relationship, Tikk. I was pointing out that paying licensing and royalty fees uplines doesn not make a subsidiary. The valid point, "must not engage in some activites" does not make a downstream corperation a subsidiary. But I'll have to agree that Applied Scholastics under ABLE serves to assist or supplement CSI. Again, thanks for pointing to the parent document. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 14:42, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While licensing agreements and royalty fees do not by themselves make one a subsidiary, the Agreement's prohibition and restrictions on "Scientology-related entities" (expressly including Applied Scholastics) are indicative of control and authority, which are the hallmarks of an agency relationship. While temporary agency relationships can exist between non-subsidiary corporate entities, the IRS Agreement concretely establishes a parent-subsidiary relationship, by describing the various parent and subsidiary inter-relationships in detail. The entities mentioned in the Agreement are all subsidiaries in one way or another to either RTC or CST, ultimately, although the Scientology corporate structure is complex that it's more common to describe a particular subsidiary in reference to its immediate parent. But the Agreement's prohibition on "engaging in some activities," as you put it, in the context of this Agreement, does indeed make the downstream entities (and especially ASI, as it is explicitly mentioned) subsidiaries of Scientology. <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikk_818c.html" title="User:Tikk">Tikk</a> 18:12, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>From the point of view that a business lease a liescence from a parent business and sell their products (being careful in their presentation of said products), Applied Scholastics is a business. Four Season's Greenhouses does this throughout America with their technology and sells their products and gets a piece of the action through distirbution. Applied Scholastics similarly does. Its product is information (often printed) but it distributes and disseminates the product it pays for (per agreements). RTC might be the legal parent body, but the Church of Scientology isn't the legal parent body. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 20:07, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see why it shouldn't be merged. The Delphi Schools licence Applied Scholastics, and under the covers, the relationship is probably closer than that. I can't see there being enough information to fill out <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delphi_Schools_eead.html" title="Delphi Schools">Delphi Schools</a> to more than a stub, and I'm surprised that there's no mention of Delphi on this page. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroidCat_71d5.html" title="User:AndroidCat">AndroidCat</a> 15:59, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree there needs to be a subsection on Delphi on here, but I also think the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delphi_Schools_eead.html" title="Delphi Schools">Delphi Schools</a> article can be expanded into a long and informative article of its own.

<dd>I will attempt to respond to AndroidCat's question, so don't be accusing me of attempting to "push a POV" or other emotionally slanted verbage, okay? A.B.L.E. is the parent corperation. Applied Scholastics answers to it. Delphi schools, as I understand it, exited in brick and morter, and operated before Applied Scholastics existed as an organization but now falls under Applied Scholastics. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 22:29, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
