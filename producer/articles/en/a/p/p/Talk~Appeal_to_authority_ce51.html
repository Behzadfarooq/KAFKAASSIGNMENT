<p>Hmm, where does this "Five conditions" section come from? Surely it would be better to put an argument by authority into a valid form:</p>
<ul>
<li>If person X says statement Y and Y is about subject area Z then X is true</li>
<li>Person X does say Y and Y is about subject area Z</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Therefore</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Y is true</li>
</ul>
<p>Most arguments by authority presumably hinge on the truth of the first premisis.</p>
<p>Also I feel that this article should address the need for appeal to authority as a social neccessity (eg doctors orders) and a consiquence of the division of labour. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryfdoherty_9404.html" title="User:Harryfdoherty">harry</a> 13:42, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the entry for <i><a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_Fallacy_fcf4.html" title="Logical Fallacy">Logical Fallacy</a></i> under the sub-heading <b>Fallacies in the media and politics</b> it states; "...An appeal to authority is always a logical fallacy though it can be an appropriate form of rational argument if, for example, it is an appeal to expert testimony."</p>
<p>This is in conflict with this article, especially where this one reads; "Sometimes, an appeal to authority is a logical fallacy." The approach in the Logical Fallacy article is preferable and it would be good if the article here reflected it, perhaps also mentioning an 'appeal to expediency' as another example of an often rationally legitimate 'appeal to authority'. Actually, an appeal to expert testimony is only justified by an appeal to expediency. Sometimes there simply is not enough time to argue about who has the best argument in current pressing circumstances.</p>
<p>But, it is <i>always</i> a fallacy to conclude the ultimate soundness or correctness of an argument by authority, even though it may be wise to proceed as though it were both sound and authoritive. That is, an argument must not rest crucially on an 'appeal to authority' to be actually correct or sound. <a href="../../../l/a/y/User%7ELayman_41f9.html" title="User:Layman">Layman</a> 02:17, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC) message edited <a href="../../../l/a/y/User%7ELayman_41f9.html" title="User:Layman">Layman</a> 04:44, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The forms section distinguishes between legitimate and fallacious arguments from authority. However I do not believe the <i>form</i> of such an argument is what determines its validity. In each case, a simplified version of the argument could be:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Person A asserts X</dd>
<dd>2. Person A is likely to be correct about X (almost equivalent to: A is an "expert" in the field of X)</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>therefore</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>3. X is likely to be correct</dd>
</dl>
<p>This argument is only fallacious when statement 2 (or to a lesser extent 1) is false or dubious, or if it's ignored completely.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a lot of the confusion about whether or not arguments from authority are <i>always</i> fallacious is a result of confusion over whether one can ever fully trust another person. One other reason why the appeal to authority may not fall under the banner of "pure" logic is that authority is established through a person being true repeatedly, and this relies to some degree on correlation indicating causation.</p>
<p>As an example of commonly accepted arguments from authority (like the suggested "doctors" scenario) is the fact that most people believe in things which they have never directly percieved, on the basis of the authority of others. For example, I have never directly seen Barbados, yet I believe it exists because of the <i>authority</i> of atlases, encyclopedias, etc.</p>
<p>I think that the idea that any argument should be based "solely on direct evidence" is not clear. If "direct evidence" means empirical evidence, ie. experience, one would be convinced of barely anything one reads, unless it concerns the page right in front of them.</p>
<p>If anyone has any problems with the above, post here or preferably on my talk page; otherwise I'll work on the article. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeon..._a425.html" title="User:Leon...">Leon...</a> 11:38, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Validity is based on form. That's how the word validity is defined in the realm of logic. "A <i>deductively valid</i> argument is one in which it is impossible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false." So says my old logic text, Austen Clark 2001, printed by the UConn Coop.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just because an argument is fallacious doesn't mean the conclusion is wrong. But for an argument to be valid by relying on authority, we have to assume their infallibility. This doesn't mean we can't work under the assumption they know what they're talking about. But it's still <i>possible</i> they're wrong, which is the point. Fallacious doesn't mean stupid, it just means it has logical problems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think the article suggests we should only be convinced of what we percieve directly. Direct evidence, rather, refers to information as opposed to testimonial. Rather than simply listening to people's conclusions, we have to listen to their arguments. And if we want, we may be convinced by testimonials. Logic isn't really about belief. You can believe whatever you want, but you can use logic as a tool to evaluate arguments. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> 15:38, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks NickelShoe.</dd>
<dd>Paragaph 1 - Perhaps I have misused the word fallacious, however I can't see any logical problems in the structure I gave in my last post, and I believe that this is the structure most appeals to authority take. It doesn't provide any guarantees, since it's only <i>likely</i> that the authority tells the truth, but I don't think there are problems in the form of the argument. Infallibility only has to be assumed if you're looking for a sure answer, or if you're in the realm of formal logic. This article deals generally with such appeals.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Paragraph 2 - point taken, however I believe the expression "direct evidence" to be misleading. Any facts which are not a priori and are outside our experience, are taken from authority anyway. It just seems incorrect to suggest that an argument is ok when dealing in statements (information), but when it tries to substantiate those statements with testemonial, it becomes fallacious.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If fallacy follows form, then I'm suggesting that appeals to authority aren't fallacious unless one is trying to deal in absolutes, or doesn't acknowledge the element of chance.</dd>

<dd>I agree that if your conclusion is that X is <i>likely</i> to be correct, it is no fallacy. Perhaps you should edit the article to explain that.</dd>

<dd>Yes, I understand the directness problem. I don't know the best way to address that in the article. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> 22:13, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Fallacious" isn't a helpful term here, I think, as it's often used non-technically to mean no more than "incorrect in some way"; it would be better to distinguish between validity (which is what "fallaciousness" means strictly speaking) and soundness. The argument form in question is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Person A asserts X</dd>
<dd>Person A is likely to be correct about X (almost equivalent to: A is an "expert" in the field of X)</dd>
<dd>Therefore X is likely to be correct</dd>
</dl>
<p>There's a problem about the way this is expressed ("asserts" in the minor premise but not in the major) which makes the arument invalid as it stands, and if that could be fixed the validity depends further on what exactly is meant by "likely". The soundness of the argument obviously depends upon the truth of the major (second) premise.</p>
<p>My own feeling is that the argument is dubiously valid. Even if some expert <i>e</i> is, let's say, 75% likely to be right about the truth of <i>i</i>, we can't infer from <i>e'</i>s assertion that <i>i</i> that <i>i</i> is 75% likely to be true.</p>
<ol>
<li>It may be that <i>e</i> is for some reason misrepresenting her true opinion.</li>
<li>It may be that another expert, <i>ε</i>, is 80% likely to be right about the truth of <i>i</i>, and <i>ε</i> asserts that <i>i</i> is false.</li>
<li>It may be that the background probability of <i>i</i> is so low that we shouldn't accept <i>e'</i>s testimony (Hume's argument against belief in miracles is the limiting case of this).</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know if that helps or just confuses things further... --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 11:08, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think your discussion (and the three points you make) demonstrate the impossibility of trying to determine the exact probability that <i>e</i> is correct about the truth of <i>i</i>. However, this probability doesn't have to be determined to show the validity of the argument's structure (only to make it perfectly sound). In everyday life, one estimates such probabilities routinely even though the number of determining factors may be beyond comprehension.</dd>
<dd>Besides that, the (hypothetical) probability in question has been determined by taking into account <i>all</i> other factors, including the background probability of <i>i</i>, any other assertions <i>e</i> could have made, and the probability that <i>e</i> lies. Again, this probability doesn't have to be calculable, but the listener may have some idea of it, just as the probability of a coin landing tails up isn't exactly calculable.</dd>
<dd>Obviously there are a lot of problems with this sort of appeal in terms of soundness (as a "guesstimate" is almost always involved), but I still believe that there's nothing invalid about that <i>form</i> of argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I think the term "assert" could be present in the major premise if it were rewritten as "person A's assertion of X is likely to be correct" (or "has P% chance of being correct)<a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeon..._a425.html" title="User:Leon...">Leon...</a> 11:31, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think that what you term the assessment of probability in everyday life is in fact usually (always?) the development of degrees of psychological certainty. More importantly, I can't agree that the background probabilty of a particular case is included in the assessment of a person's expertise; that leads to a circle, in fact (we assess the likelihood of <i>i</i> based on the expertise of <i>e</i>, and we assess the expertise of <i>e</i> in terms of the likelihood of <i>i</i>...).</dd>
<dd>Each of my three points challenged the <i>validity</i> of the argument (not merely the acceptability of its premises). The argument could perhaps be tweaked in order to survive one or two of my criticisms (though I don't know whether it would be of any use in its new form), but not all of them without making it trivial.</dd>
<dd>Changing the major premise to include "assertion" would only push the problem back, as we'd need to ask why we should think that A's asserion was likely to be true — and presumably we'd be offered an argument about A's expertise... --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 11:45, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a question about <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_Authority_d231.html" title="Appeal to Authority">Appeal to Authority</a>. Any comment is welcome.</p>
<p>I am often finding myself to be the victim of a rhetorical technique in forum debates and I'm not sure if it is an invalid <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_Authority_d231.html" title="Appeal to Authority">Appeal to Authority</a> or if it is something else entirely.</p>
<p>This is a the basic form that I have seen:</p>
<pre>
   Person Y states A
   Expert E states: B
   Person Z draws (but does not prove) conclusion C from B
   Conclusion C is incompatible with A
   Person Z states that expert E disagrees with A and therefore A is likely to be false
</pre>
<p>Superficially, this may look like a valid <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_Authority_d231.html" title="Appeal to Authority">Appeal to Authority</a>. But I argue this isn't really an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_Authority_d231.html" title="Appeal to Authority">Appeal to Authority</a>. The conclusion drawn by Z is not coming from the authority. If the conclusion C obvious from the B, I would say it is (probably) valid. What I see, however, is that the conclusion proposed by Z is not the only possible conclusion.</p>
<p>As a good example of how this was used and clearly invalid I was once in an argument where this tactic was used and then later it was shown that the expert in question had explicitly contradicted the conclusion drawn by Z.</p>
<p>A related tactic would be misquoting the expert or inventing statements and attributing them to an expert falsely.</p>
<p>Any help classifying this form of rhetoric is appreciated, thanks.</p>

<dd>I don't really see how the expert statement comes into play here. You don't appear to be challenging that statement (if quoted correctly), but rather the conclusions your debate opponent drew from those statements. In this case, the type of logic error would vary, depending on how your opponent reached that conclusion. Did the expert say "all cats are mammals" and your opponent concluded that "all mammals are cats", for instance ? So, basically consider the expert statement to be the assertion, and decide for yourself if that leads to the conclusion supplied by your opponent. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 17:34, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the response. The reason that the expert statement comes into play is that any question of the conclusion is answered by the assertion that I am going against the authority. I think I get your point, though, the flaw is in the conclusion. Here's an example of this error:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
   A: Not all classes should have factory methods
   B: Josh Bloch (expert) states that factory methods are generally better than public 
      constructors (this is true)
   B: Therefore all classes should have factory methods and no public constructor (Josh Bloch 
      actually contradicts this in the same work where the above statement is written)
   A: I agree factory methods have many advantages over public constructors but that doesn't 
      mean we should never use public constructors.
   B: You should read Josh Bloch's book as he is very smart and knowledgeable about this 
      subject.

<dd>I guess what I am running into is that the these wiki pages are often a quick way to disarm rhetoric without getting off subject. Trying to show somone's logical flaws can obsure the original argument. I'd like to have a reference that I can point to and say "this is what you are doing." Dubwai 18:11, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe an argument from authority is always a fallacy. The reason being is that it is up to each person to determine if another is an authority on a subject or not, so therefore noone should try to convince a third party (IE make an argument) that something is true becuase and authoritative sorce said so.</p>
<p>I believe this can be determined from the information admitted to in the already existing article. It says that the authoritative source cannot be biased. But if someone points to them as an authoritative source, it is always possible if not likely that they simply share the same biases. So while it might be fine to simply point to an authoritative source and let someone do what they will with it, I think it is incorrect to try and force someone to accept or act due to the claims of an authoritative source they do not trust.</p>
<p>Furthermore talking about abscence of bias is unrealistic in my opinion, as I have met few if any people in life whose only goal is to provide objective information.</p>

But the reductionism approach in today's scientific methodology (and this is evident in medical literature) permit that other scientist in related fields ( such as chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, biophysics or nutrition- present their hypotesis in a formal manner, so that Science, as a whole, can test their claims. To believe in Linus Pauling just because he won the Nobel Price is misleading way of thinking. To go to any scientist other than the medical doctor as if this scientist have Medicine as a profession is also misleading, even if we get lucky. But that a Chemist, Biochemist, Biophysicist, Nutricionist, Pharmacologist, or Biologist have the opportunity to prove his theory on vitamin C is no fallacy. It's a valid approach , as long as correct science is used. That is the way Science as a whole grows. Medicine uses a lot of Chemistry, Biology and Physics. So we must be careful here. Just because one is not a Physician is no reason to render that person as a complete ignorant of that field. Scientist do research. A formal and well credited Scientist should be given the proper time to explain his hypotesis. Perhaps if the person doesn't have the proper credential is it justified to simply require that he earn them before proposing his ideas, to be fair, because with so many ideas one have to choose which are more likely to be correctly developed, even if this process is imperfect, so as to not waste the resources. But as far as I have seen, Chemist, Biochemist, Biophysicist, Nutricionist, Pharmacologist, or Biologist all have that needed credential. To dismiss them as ignorant just because they are not M.D.'s is a fallacy-</p>

<p>My Logic textbook (Hurley's <i>A Concise Introduction to Logic</i>) uses the term "appeal to unqualified authority" rather than "appeal to authority." Does anyone know of any other source using the term or did the author make it up himself because he thought it was clearer? --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilver2195_22fc.html" title="User:Silver2195">Silver2195</a> 23:39, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have seen the following example being deleted at least twice recently:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Something must be true because it is in Wikipedia.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>However, either someone shows me why this example is <b>not</b> as fallacious as the other examples, or please refrain from deleting it.</p>
<p>It can also be argued that it is redundant (an encyclopedia is mentioned also) or innecessary, but I consider that it is actually quite appropriate. Deleting it makes us look like we are saying the Wikipedia can not be wrong, and is always a valid authority, when Aristotle, Einstein or any other encyclopedia have already been mentioned as not necessarily correct.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I used to think that that example ought to be removed, due unto its being redundant considering the aforementioned example of an encyclopædia; however, considering the way in which Wikipedia is becoming an increasingly unquestioned resource nowadays, it might be a very good thing to remind readers that it most certainly isn’t. I therefore <b>support</b> the inclusion of the example of Wikipedia.

<p>I don't know if you can even sign without making an account. Anyway, The main reason I deleted it was because it looked redundant. It also looked a bit like pointless self insertion. Putting Wikipedia on the same level as Aristotle or Einstein seemed silly. Anyway, I just reworded it now so it makes more sense. I don't of anyone that seriously uses Wikipedia as an unquestioned source, while people do with many of the other things mentioned. 66.0.141.195 01:03, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've noticed a particular deceptive method of discourse that I'm trying to categorize. Let me start with an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reasonable Assertion: "The <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_River_e27c.html" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> represents the soul in the works of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Twain_2795.html" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a>."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reasonable Challenge: "What is your evidence for that ?"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unreasonable Reply: "Well, if you'd read the complete works of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Twain_2795.html" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a>, all of the scholarly analyses of Twain, and, in particular, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Milton_a919.html" title="John Milton">Milton</a>'s <i><a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradise_Lost_ae40.html" title="Paradise Lost">Paradise Lost</a></i>, as I have, you wouldn't need to ask such an ignorant question."</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, this "evidence" is usually of exceptional volume, ensuring that, even if the challenger were to read all of the sources given, the debate would long be over by that time. Another feature of this argument is that it lacks specific, like "Mark Twain explained this on page 112 of his autobiography". And, it is necessary that the person making the assertion represent themselves as an authority, in order for their defense to be believable, and that the challenger not already be well-versed in all the references given. Of course, since nobody is well-versed in everything, the "authority" can always reach for more and more obscure references, and even make them up entirely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unreasonable Reply: "Well, if you'd read Szilrwepopski's theory of flombugartigation, as I have, you wouldn't need to ask such an ignorant question."</li>
</ul>
<p>So, my question is, do we have a name for this type of deceptive argument ? (I know, if I'd read Szilrwepopski, I wouldn't need to ask, LOL). <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 11:36, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have no idea wher this come from and why it is here, but it definetly looks like original research. The entire section is unreferenced (as most of the article, anyways). Besides, it's just incorrect or contradictory to previuos statements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* The authority must have competence in an area, not just glamour, prestige, rank or popularity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas above, it' stated that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>appeal to authority is a logical fallacy: authorities can be wrong, both in their own field and in other fields</p>
</blockquote>
<p>. Same for the following point. If the person who put [Linus Pauling] as an example had taken the time to look into the entry about him, he or she would have noticed that he's also</p>
<blockquote>
<p>noted as a versatile scholar for his expertise in inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, metallurgy, immunology, anesthesiology, psychology, debate, radioactive decay, and the aftermath of nuclear warfare, in addition to quantum mechanics and molecular biology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>. So wrong and with a badly chosen example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* The authority must be interpreted correctly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the matter of dispute is the interpretation of the authority, so the problem persists (X, who is an expert says that Y means... We might agree upon what Y says, but not about what it means)</p>
<p>Next point, Galileo example is non fitting. Galileo stand accused of heresy. His assertion of the sun immobility contradicted the scriptures and the aristotelian view (in this case the authorities).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* The judgment must be representative of expert opinions on the issue (as opposed to an unrepresentative sample).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* A technique is needed to adjudicate disagreements among equally qualified authorities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both these points require the ability to judge experts qualification, which again cannot resort to be appeal to authority.</p>
<p>In conclusion I'm tempted to delete this whole sections, but I wanted to hear about it first. 194.94.96.194 01:14, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually, I hadn't thought about that, but you are correct. I think that the whole section misses the point entirely: an argument from authority is fallacious <b>always</b>. The section regards the conclusions of an argument from authority being more or less likely <b>correct</b>, which is immaterial. The point is there is no logical connection between something being said by someone, and it being correct or incorrect. This fact can be more or less likely, and the proposer can be more or less trusted... but this has nothing to do with <b>deducting</b> her conclusions from her sole words. — <a href="../../../i/s/i/User%7EIsilanes_e76a.html" title="User:Isilanes">Isilanes</a> 11:05, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I do not like the current explanation on the parents' "because I said so" stuff, although the previous one was not perfect either. The fact is we are discussing logic here. We are not judging whether kids should <b>obey</b> their parents, or whether parents have the "right" of forcing kids to do whatever they see fit, giving no reason for that. The strict truth is that "because I said so" <b>is</b> a fallacy, in the sense that whatever the parent said is not so <b>because</b> she said so, but rather for other unespecified reasons. It amounts to the same as "apples fall because Newton said so", instead of "because of gravity". — <a href="../../../i/s/i/User%7EIsilanes_e76a.html" title="User:Isilanes">Isilanes</a> 18:18, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
