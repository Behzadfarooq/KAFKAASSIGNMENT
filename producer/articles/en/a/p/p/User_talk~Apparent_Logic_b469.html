<p>I've noticed that you put in a link to the Guinness beer drinking records page. That page is about a drinking record. It is not about beer. Nor is it about beer culture. At a pinch it may be classed as <a href="../../../d/r/i/Category%7EDrinking_culture_e7bf.html" title="Category:Drinking culture">Category:Drinking culture</a>. At an outside chance you may debate it belongs in Pub games. But it does not belong as a direct link from the main beer article. There are many articles on Wiki which have some relation to beer. Not all these articles are linked from the main beer page. But - good try! You gave it a go. I also notice that you removed a merge tag from that beer drinking records article before discussion had taken place. I'll pop back the tag for now. Give it at least a week for people to give their opinion (if any - often people can't be bothered!), then you can remove it without anyone else bothering you to say you removed it too soon! Cheers! And happy editing! <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 13:20, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Merge tag. You were right to remove it. The tag had been there for nearly a month with no response. Also, as you say, the article could be about beer drinking records that are not Guinness related. It's not a great article though. Do you think it could be expanded? Or should it be put up for deletion? <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 13:25, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for getting in touch. I see you are now working on the <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_games.html" title="Beer games">Beer games</a> article. I think that is the most appropriate place for the speed drinking record as that article already contains references to speed drinking. Happy editing. I hope to see you contribute to more beer articles.

<dd>Hi Silk Tork: You and I realize that the link to World Beer Drinking Records is there via the "Beer Culture" link since we have both worked on it, but an uninformed user who visits the beer page would not know that. The user needs to click on the subcategory "Beer culture" then know enough to click on "Drinking Culture" when he arrives at the second page. Additionally, when you search for "Beer Drinking Records" that page was replaced by a redirect to "Drinking Culture" by you, and the user needs to scan the contents to realize the sub-section is there. That's 3 redirects. I don't think adding a direct link to the section under the "Beer" category "duplicates the link", it just clarifies that the section is present and facilitates navigation to it. I design websites and understand how the average user navigates. To suppose that someone would understand that "records" were under "beer culture" would be a mistake. Perhaps 1 in 100 people would be able to find the final link. I feel that a link to "beer records" in a category discussing beer is just as worthy as one to "Pub games", "Pub crawl", and "Public house", which you do not have a problem with. Do you agree? <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EApparent_Logic_937b.html" title="User:Apparent Logic">Apparent Logic</a> 14:05, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>There are various aspects of beer. Not all aspects can or should be directly linked from the main beer article, otherwise it would become overheavy with links. The best thing that can be done is to group related interests together in one article or category and then link to that category. It's certainly worth considering if Pub games and Pub crawl and Public house are all needed. Though I think you are being very playful when you suggest that a redundant and unknown beer drinking record is significant enough to deserve a direct link. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 14:32, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Apparent Logic,</p>
<p>I'm new to this matters, so my post "you have been warned." meant simply that I've posted a new advisory in the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents</a>. I have a prompt response that they warned the user with a "final spam warning", so I'm confident he/she stops wasting time on the article.</p>
<p>Thanks for contributing!</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/p/User_talk%7EApparent_Logic_b469.html" title="Edit section: Avian flu">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Avian flu</span></h2>
<p>The paragraph that needs rewriting is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Avian flu viruses are noninfectious for most species. When they are infectious they are usually asymptomatic, so the carrier does not have any disease from it. Thus while infected with an avian flu virus, the animal doesn't have a "flu". Typically, when illness (called "flu") from an avian flu virus <i>does</i> occur, it is the result of an avian flu virus strain adapted to one species spreading to another species (usually from one bird species to another bird species). So far as we know the most common result of this is an illness so minor as to be not worth noticing (and thus little studied). But with the domestication of chickens and turkeys, we have created species subtypes (domesticated poultry) that can catch an avian flu virus adapted to waterfowl and have it rapidly mutate into a form that kills in days over 90% of an entire flock and spread to other flocks and kill 90% of <i>them</i> and can only be stopped by killing every domestic bird in the area. Until <a href="../../../h/5/n/H5N1_77bb.html" title="H5N1">H5N1</a>, this was basically the whole story of avian flu so far as anyone knew or cared (outside of the poultry industry). Now with H5N1, we have a whole new ballgame with H5N1 inventing new rules as it goes with behaviors never noticed before, and possibly never having occurred before. This is evolution right before our eyes. Even the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_flu.html" title="Spanish flu">Spanish flu</a> virus did not behave like this. What is worth mentioning about illness from avian flu viruses is covered in <a href="../../../h/5/n/H5N1_flu_a8ad.html" title="H5N1 flu">H5N1 flu</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flu.html" title="Flu">Flu</a>, and the subtype articles (<a href="../../../h/5/n/H5N1_77bb.html" title="H5N1">H5N1</a>, HxNy) linked below (and the references in those articles)." <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 04:57, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is true but poorly written (I wrote it). With regard to pigs and so forth please read the other articles related to this one; especially <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_spread_of_H5N1_9eb7.html" title="Global spread of H5N1">Global spread of H5N1</a> which says "Avian influenza virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs ("swine flu") in China and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. Health experts say pigs can carry human influenza viruses, which can combine (i.e. exchange homologous genome sub-units by genetic reassortment) with H5N1, passing genes and mutating into a form which can pass easily among humans. H3N2 evolved from H2N2 by antigenic shift and caused the Hong Kong Flu pandemic of 1968 and 1969 that killed up to 750,000 humans. The dominant strain of annual flu in humans in January 2006 is H3N2. Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine in H3N2 in humans has increased to 91% in 2005. A combination of these two subtypes of the species known as the avian flu virus in a country like China is a worst case scenario. In August 2004, researchers in China found H5N1 in pigs." <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a></p>
