The line about how the "Hot Hot Hot" video was a joke intended to poke fun at the food being too spicy at an event is not confirmed on the source that is listed.

<p>Added this sections under Organizations. However, I may have dates wrong and possibly missed interims.

<p>Very good, I just wrapped up my research on this. I have a 1986 Alumni directory on hand and verified the list as far as it took me. Harvey Durham was the second interim, due to medical conditions of the acting chancellor again. Dr. Cratis D. Williams is credited as "Acting Chancellor" in 1975 according to the Directory. I'm imagining a temporary leave of Wey? I'm placing it as this reads, and citing.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDankstick_8345.html" title="User:Dankstick">Dankstick</a> 19:23, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Most college and university articles at Wikipedia list their alumni without restricting the list to just those who have graduated. It would not be in their best interest eliminate non-graduates from the list of notable alumni because these colleges and universities wish to associate themselves with successful people. A simple search through Wikipedia reveals that there are some college and university articles who have made the distinction between graduates and non-graduates, and have made other categorizations of alumni as well....sports, arts, politics, etc. I trust that my constructive comments in this regard will not be again deleted from this Talk page by <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeologik_087a.html" title="User:Geologik">Geologik</a>, as I see such deletions as vandalism and shall report it as such.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibones_ef38.html" title="User:Wikibones">Wikibones</a> 21:09, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeologik_087a.html" title="User:Geologik">Geologik</a> has deemed that the only Alumni to be listed in the Notable Alumni section can be graduates. He has therefore deleted valid alumnus entries at will. Read on please...</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is correct. In the context of the page as an encyclopedic article, alumni are graduates of the university. Please resepect that. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeologik_087a.html" title="User:Geologik">Geologik</a> 19:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please leave discussion on my talk page. Thank you. Following general guidelines from other college and university pages located on Wikipedia, they alumni list is reserved for those that have graduated from the university. Once again, please respect that. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeologik_087a.html" title="User:Geologik">Geologik</a> 19:58, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alumni are those that graduated from an institution. Why doesn't it say alumni anymore and just "notable people", why not Notable Students? I found that other university pages have an alumni section. Vandalism, lol <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDankstick_8345.html" title="User:Dankstick">Dankstick</a> 03:42, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The thread on this is getting worn out, but in fair response to the above, the article should indeed have a notable alumni section, however the definition of "alumni" by any source (dictionary.com, Webster's New World Dictionary, and <b>ASU's own Alumni Association</b>) is anyone who graduated or attended the school. If my previous posts about the definition of "alumni" had not been deleted from this discussion, I would have never used the word "vandalism". I posted those definitions for the purpose of discussion and when those definitions were deleted, this discussion was purposely impeded. Since then, Geologik and I have come to some positive and common ground on this it seems, as he has offered to change the heading and I have suggested and pointed out that some schools clarify the heading. Anyone who attended or graduated from ASU is "alumni" by even the school's own definition. Mr. Wooten has passed on, so it really doesn't matter to him, and regrettably after speaking with Mr. Hill this morning (just after my last two edits to the listing), he is so bothered that he has become the subject of this debate that he has asked me to respectfully remove him from the list (though someone other than myself will probably put him on the list at some point because of his ongoing ties with ASU). I will leave the choice of whether the now deceased Gene Wooten (he was Kenneth Wooten at ASU) be removed or not. In closing, I have said all along that these people are alumni of ASU, and not only that, they are people who have gone on and spoken often of their ASU years being formative in their careers (as evidenced by the ASU Newspaper article on Mr. Hill). The focus on whether an alumni graduated or not is beside the point. Neither of these men are seeking status by being on the list. Having on them on the list is good for the article. I think you will agree, that this section of the article really needs some content when compared to other schools. I thin you should look at the Notable Alumni lists for Dartmouth, Harvard, West Point, Smith College, Holy Cross, Rhode Island, USAF, Bowdoin. All of these schools either make a distinction between graduates and non-graduates, or list them all together, but in each case respectfully call them all "alumni". Sorry to have troubled you.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibones_ef38.html" title="User:Wikibones">Wikibones</a> 13:59, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is an interesting bit of trivia that an alumni not necessarily mean someone that had graduated. wikibones is right in the definition it seems. Takes a lot away from the prestige of being an alum. o well. In light of the definition, I move to place those good folks on the list. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDankstick_8345.html" title="User:Dankstick">Dankstick</a> 02:21, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Does this list needs some upkeep? I don't want to start nuking people i feel aren't important. NFL players, well known authors ok, but some of these i feel are too obscure for encyclopedic note.</p>
<p>Agreed, I think the list can be slimmed down a bit. Especially when stuff like the ASU student - almost mayor stuff is making it in.</p>
<p>Are there any guidelines out there?? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDankstick_8345.html" title="User:Dankstick">Dankstick</a> 03:05, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I really don't think that club sports have a place in this article. Club sports are out of article scope, asu's are not noteworthy, "nationally recognized" "dominated" do not add to article and don't tell the reader anything. Sounds like salesman dribble. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDankstick_8345.html" title="User:Dankstick">Dankstick</a> 13:24, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I go around checking other university pages for ideas and kind of added information about club sports back into the article. The cycling team is actually really good and has gathered some acclaim (I've read a few articles)..the rugby teams also does quite well and they host Rucktoberfest every year to decent sized crowds. I had no idea that ASU fielded a hockey team, yet they had a winning record competing out of Greensboro. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeologik_087a.html" title="User:Geologik">Geologik</a> 07:26, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>I added a page for ASU's SD program - my apologies to whoever linked to "sustainable development" in a general sense - I thought it made more sense to link to ASU's program. I also added a subsection under "Interdisciplinary Studies" for "Watauga College," a residential college within the university. Theosaslow 21:04, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
