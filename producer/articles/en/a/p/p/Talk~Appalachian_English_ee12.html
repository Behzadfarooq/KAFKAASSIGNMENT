<p>Please do not contribute original research (i.e. one's own thoughts or ideas) to Wikipedia (especially to linguistics articles). Doing so is against Wikipedia policy. (<a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>)</p>
<p>Aside from that fact, just "living in an area" for a long time does not make one an expert on dialect(s). There are too many variables to consider (including the influence of mass media, popular culture, and the 20th Century advent of easily-accessible rapid transit). Unless you are trained and educated in the subject of linguistics, your unqualified opinions may serve to only add confusion to an already complex subject. "I've never heard..." or "I've always heard..." does not cut it.</p>

See PBS.org for information about their series "Do you Speak American," which demystifies and celebrates the fascinating diversity of American English. The Following is an excellent example of Appalachian English taken from their website:</p>
<p>A-Hunting We Will Go …for a-prefix words. This exercise was taken from Walt Wolfram’s 1993 essay, “Teaching the Grammar of Vernacular English” in: Glowka, A. Wayne, &amp; Donald M. Lance, eds., Language Variation in North American English: Research and Teaching.</p>
<p>Some dialects of English put an a- sound before words that end in -ing, so that you hear phrases like "a-hunting we will go.” In the sample sentences given below, only one sentence out of each pair can take an a-prefix. Which sentence do you think can have the a-prefix before the -ing-form? Choose - or make an educated guess. If you’re not sure, try reading each version of an a-prefix out loud to yourself. Do you recognize a pattern?</p>
<p>a. The man likes sailing. b. The man went sailing.</p>
<p>a. The woman was coming down the stairs. b. The movie was shocking.</p>
<p>a. He makes money by building houses. b. He makes money building houses.</p>
<p>a. Sam was following the trail. b. Sam was discovering the cave.</p>
<p>a. William thinks fishing is silly. b. William goes fishing every Sunday.</p>
<p>a. The movie was fascinating. b. The movie kept jumping up and down.</p>
<p>a. Sally got sick cooking chicken. b. Sally got sick from cooking chicken.</p>
<p>a. The man was hollering at the hunters. b. The man was recalling what happened that night.</p>
<p>The sentences which can carry the a-prefix are 1b, 2a, 3b, 4a, 5b, 6b, 7a, and 8a. Most students, including many ESL students, instinctively get this right, even if they have a hard time explaining why. In some cases, they will argue that the other form just doesn't sound right - and they will be exactly right. The important thing is that a pattern emerges from these sentences: not all -ing-forms can randomly be prefixed with a-, but there is a certain set of rules to it:</p>
<p>The a- prefix can occur only ...</p>
<p>... with verb complements, not with -ing participles that function as nouns (sentences 1 and 5) ... with verbal -ing forms, but not with -ing participles that function as adjectives (sentences 2 and 6) ... when the -ing forms is not followed by a preposition (sentences 3 and 7) ... with verbs that have a stressed initial syllable, not with verbs with an unstressed first syllable: in follow and holler, the first syllable is stressed; in discover and recall the first syllable is not stressed (sentences 4 and 8)</p>
<p>The conclusion to be drawn from this pattern or set of rules is that dialects, too, have their own grammar - dialects are not just “bad” or “wrong” ways of speaking; they are subject to grammatical rules just like any other variety of a language. In this, dialects differ from "broken language" or an imperfectly learned second language.</p>

He has pioneered research on social and ethnic dialects since the 1960s, publishing 16 books and more than 250 articles on language varieties such as African American English, Latino English, Appalachian English, and Southern Vernacular English. Wolfram is deeply involved in the application of sociolinguistic information and the dissemination of knowledge about dialects to the public. In this connection, he has been involved in the production of TV documentaries, museum exhibits, and other community-based dialect awareness initiatives; he also served as primary linguistic consultant for the Children's Television Workshop, the producers of Sesame Street.

<p>In the article, one example given for the prevalence of double-negatives is the comparison of two phrases;</p>
<p>"I will not go to that funeral", becomes "I won't be goin' to no funeral."</p>
<p>While the second phrase does contain an apparent double negative, the nuance of the statement is that the speaker will not go to ANY funeral, not just the one at hand.</p>
<p>I'm not a linguist, just a native speaker.</p>
<p><br />
"I won't be going to no funeral" indicates that the speaker will not be going to the formally-scheduled funeral proper [with any number of reasons, including the possibility of fracas] but does intend to socialize with others elsewhere as an informal funeral remembrance or privately alone. 11/26/2005 22:44, 26 November 2005 (UTC) beadtot</p>
<p>I'm smack dab in the middle of Appalachia and I ain't got no idear what you just said there. The sentence means "I'm not going to ANY funeral (at all)." I think if he wanted to specify a particular funeral, a speaker would naturally say, "I ain't goin' to the funeral." I'm a linguist, and a native speaker. 63.23.55.172 23:31, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I second (or third) that point. "I'm not Xing no Y" could be "I'm not buyin' you no beer!". If someone says this to you, don't expect to be sippin' suds anytime soon, ya hear? 'Cause you' gonna have to go get it yourself! In other words, Appalachian/Southern-American English (etc.) can be quite informal, but it is not without logic. Far from it:<br />
A: Borrow me a couple o' bucks, will ya, Whitland.<br />
B: Now, I ain't lendin' you no more money, 'cause you done crossed the line.<br />
A: How d'ya figure?<br />
B: Well, Russell, seein' how's you still owes me from last time and ain't paid none o' that yet, I reckon you just might <i>double</i> your debt and forget the whole mess all over again thinkin' it don't make no nevermind.<br />
A: I won't forget this time, cross my heart!<br />
B: You think I ain't got no brains, boy? Hell, there ain't <i>nobody</i> in this town you ain't in debt with an' I ain't obliged to stand no more of your fibbin'.<br />
A: But I'll pay you back, plus interest. I promise. You know me, Whit. I ain't telling no lie.<br />
B: Yes, I <i>do</i> know you, Russ, and I suspicion that you <i>is</i>."<br />
Question: Did Whitland loan any money to Russell at the end of the preceding dispute?</p>

<p>In the article it is stated that "both dialects have contributed to the devlopment of African-American Vernacular English". This was in reference to both Appalachian and Southern English. In the majority of recent texts I've read, it is assumed to be the otherway 'round.</p>
<p>African-American Vernacular is actually a significant source of many of the pronuciations and words common in these dialects. I will update with sources as soon as possible. Matjac 04:35, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Great article.</p>
<p>It would be great if in addition to the IPA(?) pronunciation guides in the Pronunciation section that standard English examples could be included as well. For example "Creek" is pronounced [kɹɪk] like Standard English's "Rick."</p>

<dd>Much of the syntactical variation of Appalachian English is derived from the Scots-Irish dialect." How? much. I saw very little that was similar to <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Scots_language_6a2d.html" title="Ulster Scots language">Scots</a>.</dd>

<p>Use of "ain't" softens speech and diction directed toward a specific person or audience, being a contraction of "would fain not" [a reference to the protection of temples and religion] and is also a slang term for "ancient" as a descriptor. 11/26/2005 22:57, 26 November 2005 (UTC) beadtot</p>

<dd>I'm not sure why you deleted all the work I did to clean up the phonology section (and other sections) to bring it up to a more scientific standard. The way it's rewritten (I believe this is all from the old version?) is really unprofessional from a linguistic point of view. If the section is going to be entitled "phonology", I think it should be written in a way that phonologists would describe the language. Please let me know what you think about the possibility of changing that section back to my previous edits.</dd>

<p>I didn't write it for a linguistics journal. I wrote it so that people with no knowledge of the IPA could read and understand the English I grew up speaking before I exchanged my Appalachian drawl for Ivy League drawl. Other readers on this talk page have expressed their frustration with the IPA. As it stands now, nothing is wrong, but, since IPA is apparently Wikipedia policy, I'll revert back those transcriptions that were correct. Feel free to clean up what you think was "unprofessional," but please make sure you get it right this time. This isn't the Jeff Foxworthy Show. BrianGCrawfordMA 18:01, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not a problem. If people found the way I rewrote things unclear, there is of course no need to use it. I only thought since someone earlier wrote that they wanted to see this article look more like the Southern American English page, that this is what they meant, but I guess not! I'm not a speaker of this dialect, and I'm not familiar with it either, so it's not like I am in a position to say much about it, hah. I'm fine with the article as it is. Just so you know, I don't think I *added* any information of my own; I just rewrote what others had written, so if there was something wrong, I hope it was not due to my edits.

<p>The word "skillet" has been deleted from the sample lexicon twice. I just put it back. I'm not really concerned about whether it is used in the Midwest, which is Kmweber's reason for removing it. It's the usual word for "frying pan" in Appalachia, which is why it is here. In addition to having my own knowledge as a native speaker of the dialect, I pulled this out of a linguistic textbook as one of the salient vocabulary differences of the dialect. <i>Of course</i> it's used in some places in the Midwest. Some Appalachians have moved westward over the past couple of hundred years. BrianGCrawfordMA 18:24, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The lexicon section is for words or usages that are UNIQUE to Appalachia. The word "skillet" is used almost universally among American English speakers, whether interchangeably with or in place of "frying pan". <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 23:16, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>When I rewrote this article in its entirety, I didn't make the determination that the sample lexicon should contain only words unique to Appalachia, and I'm not even sure if there are such words in existence, with all the moving around people have done in the last few decades. Don't tell me what I meant to write. If you think that the lexicon should contain only those words that are unique to Appalachia, then consult the relevant literature, change the article, and defend your edits here. I really can't be bothered by what you folks in southern Indiana call a frying pan. People in the Southern Midland dialect area say "skillet" instead of "frying pan," and it's documented in dialect surveys. If you're so keen on describing your own language, maybe you should start your own article. BrianGCrawfordMA 23:42, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The whole point of providing samples of a language is to show how it differs. If a "sample lexicon" said people from Appalachia use the words "the", "bear", "food", "pencil", and "truck", it would be true, but it would also be pointless. Only usages that are UNIQUE to Appalachia should be included; there's no point in including anything else. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 02:49, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All I was trying to do is to describe the dialect for people who don't speak it. If you'd like to produce a list of words that only Appalachian speakers use, I'm all for it, but I have serious doubts about whether such a list could be reliably made. Someone could torpedo any word on the list and say, "hey, I live in X and we say that, so it must not be unique." This is a problem of original research, which is why I have cited a linguistics textbook at the bottom of the page. It seems like you have a fundamental disagreement on the prevailing methodology in dialect studies, and I'm neither inclined nor qualified to sort it out with you, since I don't have a PhD in linguistics or English, and I haven't published anything on dialect myself. If the idea of "skillet" being in the word list remains a real problem for you, maybe you should contact someone at the Dictionary of American Regional English at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and ask them to explain their methodology. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<dd>About the 'sample vocabulary.' Perhaps a RECENT peer-reviewed SOURCE of Appalachian vocabulary is in order, with words randomly selected and accompanied by appropriate citations of the source. There are a number of things to consider. Perhaps there have been significant changes within Appalachian culture (and subsequently the dialect) in the postmodern age. While perhaps 40 years ago the usage of the article’s selected words was more prevalent, most of the listed vocabulary is antiquated and seldom used colloquially in everyday interaction. Perhaps the selected words as a current vocabulary do not adequately reflect the cultural and linguistic vicissitudes that have occurred since the postmodern age, as it seems the article treats their usage as temporally immutable. Perhaps the range of words selected seems a little narrow; 4 words describing tobacco and its use, 3 words for food, and one for a shotgun. Seems a little stereotypical, as surely there are a number of old sui generis Appalachian words that exist aside from tobacco, food, and guns; surely the current selections wouldn't match the counts of a randomly selected pool of Appalachian words in a normal distribution. Moreover, perhaps the example sentence choices for the vocabulary and grammar needs to be changed. Examples like "That boy done slobbered all on my plug," "Lay down and hush" or "If Wal-Mart ain't got it, you don't need it" all feed into the stereotype of a rural cultural backwardness of someone 'slobberin' on someone else's tobacco, bizarre behavior ('Lay down and hush'?), or being a Wal-Mart dependent consumer base. Perhaps the article is good (and done in good faith), except for the vocabulary selection and vocabulary and grammar examples, as they need revision. As I mentioned before, while I’m sure the usage of the listed vocabulary is extant, perhaps its usage is limited mostly to the older generations of Appalachia and the vocabulary needs to be supplanted with a more up-to-date, collectively exhaustive random selection of Appalachian words from a peer-reviewed source, as well as the vocabulary and grammar examples improved to reflect the reality of a more culturally diverse region than they depict.

<dd>I don't see any backwards-ness about an 'orn skillet.' That's what my momma calls it and what my grandma calls it. My mother also tells children to "lay down and hush," and although noone in my family smokes tobacco, she sometimes comments if she sees someone "slobberin." I can see your point that stereotypes are bad, but where I come from, we call a skillet a skillet.--<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaskedScissorDoll_1329.html" title="User:MaskedScissorDoll">MaskedScissorDoll</a> 23:20, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Has anyone ever formally studied how Southern and Appalachian English mix in the zones where they meet? I'm thinking of places such as Knoxville, Asheville or Roanoke. My impression is that the more Southern an inhabitant's speech, the more affluent they're likely to be. I could speculate on the reasons, but I'd be interested to learn what more formal studies have found. (Or if any have confirmed or disconfirmed my impression). --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 17:08, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A.B., see "<i>Linguistic Diversity in the South</i>" (Bender, et al) for some research on the issues you mention. In a nutshell, there does appear to be a general tendency that the Southern dialectic person has more formal education than someone with an Appalachian dialect. However, this is a by-product of, and not a cause of this disparity. The remoteness, and hence the difficulty in traveling into and out of the Appalachian mountains before the late 1800's, resulted in a certain amount of isolation that contributed to the disparity in educational resources from those in the flat-lands.</dd>

<p>I understand that life-long residents who have been raised speaking the dialect and hearing it spoken are "does not cut it" when it comes to explaining to others how we speak, regardless of the profiency in Standard English they have achieved. However, <i>kyarn</i> not a separate collequialism in the sense that <i>poke</i> is when referring to a small bag or sack, but a dialectal pronunciation of <i><a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrion.html" title="Carrion">carrion</a></i> and therefore refers to all rotting flesh and not roadkill specifically.</p>

<dd>What people mean when they say that speakers are not experts in the dialect is that there can be a lot of what you might call "ideolectical interference" -- that is, no two speakers of any language or dialect speak literally the exact 100% same way. There are a lot of minor variations in speech in an area from town to town and even from speaker to speaker, so part of dialect research is gathering data from a broad range of subjects and areas rather than just listening to one person tell you how they talk. (Also, sometimes speakers of a dialect are not able to accurately explain their word usage -- in the same way that native speakers of a language often cannot give good grammar explanations even if they use the grammar 100% correctly in their daily speech.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.180.44.242_a819.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.180.44.242">68.180.44.242</a> (talk) 15:04, 27 February 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>When I hit college, I was deemed enough of an expert in Appalachian English (wich they referred to as Appalachian Regional Dialect) to be forced to sit through a non-credit class to weed out regionalisms. Be that as it may, there are a lot of claims made in this article, and the only one which is directly cited is my addition of directly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also object to the claim (which has every marking of original research!) that native speakers are stumped to explain their language--especially to native speakers. It takes only a teenager of average intelligence to explain what the word <i>hella</i> means (as in <i>he's hella cool</i>). He doesn't need a Ph.D. in linguistics who has conducted field research involving multi-city vocabulary surveys to be able to say "<i>Hella</i> means "<i>very</i>". He just needs a working knowledge of the slang he is using and of Standard English.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But this is a digression. The claim, which has no support that <i>kyarn</i> is a regional lexical feature rather than a reigional pronunciation of <i>carrion</i>, is still in the article. Since no claims in the article are referenced, and it would be useless to add the "citation needed" notation after every single sentence, implies that <i>some</i> original research is tollerated, but just not from native speakers of Appalachian English. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonPraises_e756.html" title="User:SonPraises">SonPraises</a> 02:58, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Currently the article has two seemingly contradictory paragraphs:</p>
<p><i>English speakers who settled the area came mostly from West Anglia, the Scottish Lowlands, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland via Northern Ireland in the middle 18th and early 19th centuries, and their speech forms the basis of the dialect. Along with German immigrants, these groups populated an area which is still largely homogeneous culturally.</i></p>
<p><i>Some speakers claim that those who came to Appalachia from Scotland by way of Northern Ireland, the Scotch-Irish or Ulster Scots, had the greatest role in shaping modern Appalachian English, but there is no evidence of this aside from overly sympathetic and romanticized comparisons with modern English spoken by Protestants in Ulster. Such comparisons are often made by self-educated amateur local historians who self-identify as Irish or Scotch-Irish.</i></p>
<p>Aren't the English speaking people who immigrated to Northern Ireland and then to America Scotch-Irish? That is basically what the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots-Irish_American_fea7.html" title="Scots-Irish American">Scots-Irish American</a> page says, as well as various books I have. So the first paragraph here seems to be describing the Scotch-Irish (aka Scots-Irish), while the second paragraph denies any connection in a rather critical tone. One book I have, "A History of Appalachia" (Drake, 2001), describes the dialect of the 18th century Scotch-Irish immigrants as what became the norm in Appalachia. Among the specifics he describes are "the love of r, as in fire (far), hair (har), and bear (bar); triphongs and quadrithongs, as "abaout" (for about ) and "haious" (for house); the use of h for specific emphasis, as "hit" (it), "hain't" (ain't), and hyander (yonder); the double and triple negatives for emphasis.." and more.</p>
<p>I'm tempted to <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold</a> and simply delete the second paragraph and add some of this info with references. But I thought I'd write here first, since it looks like others have discussed this a bit in the past.
