<dd>You're right, it's a copyvio. I've sent an email to eklatt@mailer.fsu.edu for permission to use the material.

<p>Professor Klatt was not pleased, so I'm listing this on <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> and I've undertaken a rewrite. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 18:29, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reluctantly, I have rewritten the page in a more concise form. I removed the pictures. The first one needs review for&#160;?copyvio, and the blood donation picture does not pertain here (apheresis needs two needles). Finally, there was no room for the platelet bag. Please complain on my talk page. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 19:05, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(apheresis needs two needles) &lt;- right and wrong!</dd>
<dd>I've been a platelet donor for over a deacde. In the early 90s, there were only two-needle models. But today there are many models that use the same tube to draw and return blood. These pictures were taken by me three days ago. I was the donor. It was a single-arm model. Not every platelet donor can use the single arm machine. You need to have a larger and stronger vein. You also have to be over 50 kg in weight. There are few models that can separate about 500 ml (2 units) of platelets in less than 2 hours. Most of them are still using two needles. But today's newer single unit machines are single-arm models. Dual-arm models are older ones or reserved for people whose veins are too thin. I knew there's a single-arm two-unit model. But I have not tried it. -- <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToytoy_34ee.html" title="User:Toytoy">Toytoy</a> 12:53, Dec 5, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow, that sucks; I would have thought we were going to get permission for this one. Thanks for the rewrite, I'll work on it this week if I see anything I can add. Didn't the picture of blood separation come from the other website too (unfortunately...)?</dd>
</dl>
<p>What did you mean "the picture of blood separation"? The pictures taken by a cheap cellphone camera were mine. And the bell-shaped line-drawing seperator was drawn by someone else for Wikipedia. I think all pictures are OK. However, I will redraw the bell-shaped seperator because it is not empty inside. It has a core. See my picure for details. I will take more pictures next week when I donate platelet again. I have not much time this week. -- <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToytoy_34ee.html" title="User:Toytoy">Toytoy</a> 05:30, Dec 7, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, and that is one manufacturer. We should really aim to make generic diagrams, not ones that are linked to one particular type of apheresis machine. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 16:03, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I have time, I'll check if their diagrams can be simplified or generalized. These patents are public domain and they are of very high quality. It will be good to use them. Since I am a Haemonetics user, I actually do not know how other machines work. But I have two blood transfusion handbooks that mentioned about this subject. -- <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToytoy_34ee.html" title="User:Toytoy">Toytoy</a> 16:23, Dec 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, patents are great resources of usable public domain texts. For example, here's a the BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION section taken from the U.S. patent #6,613,009:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>One type of extracorporeal blood processing is an apheresis procedure in which blood is removed from a donor or patient, directed to a blood component separation device (e.g., centrifuge), and separated into various blood component types (e.g., red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, plasma) for collection or therapeutic purposes. One or more of these blood component types are collected (e.g., for therapeutic purposes), while the remainder are returned to the donor or patient.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>A number of factors affect the commercial viability of an apheresis system. One factor relates to the operator of the system, specifically the time and/or expertise required of an individual to prepare and operate the apheresis system. For instance, reducing the time required by the operator to load and unload the disposables, as well as the complexity of these actions, can increase productivity and/or reduce the potential for operator error. Moreover, reducing the dependency of the system on the operator may lead to reductions in operator errors and/or to reductions in the credentials esired/required for the operators of these systems.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Donor-related factors may also impact the commercial viability of an apheresis system and include donor convenience and donor comfort. For instance, donors typically have only a certain amount of time which may be committed to visiting a blood component collection facility for a donation. Consequently, once at the collection facility the amount of the donor's time which is actually spent collecting blood components is another factor which should be considered. This also relates to donor comfort in that many view the actual collection procedure as being somewhat discomforting in that at least one and sometimes two access needles are in the donor throughout the procedure.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Performance-related factors continue to affect the commercial viability of an apheresis system. Performance may be judged in terms of the "collection efficiency" of the apheresis system, which may in turn reduce the amount of donation time and thus increase donor convenience. The "collection efficiency" of a system may of course be gauged in a variety of ways, such as by the amount of a particular blood component type which is collected in relation to the number of this blood component type which passes through the apheresis system. Performance may also be evaluated based upon the effect which the apheresis procedure has on the various blood component types. For instance, it is desirable to minimize the adverse effects on the blood component types as a result of the apheresis procedure (e.g., reduce platelet activation)</i></dd>

<dd>With a little re-write and copy-edit, you may turn the above text into usable material. There are other patents that talked much more about the technological background than this. -- <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToytoy_34ee.html" title="User:Toytoy">Toytoy</a> 17:33, Dec 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
