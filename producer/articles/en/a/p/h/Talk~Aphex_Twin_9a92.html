<p>Richard's close friends support his claims that he built his own synthesizers and samplers from scratch in his early years—he is experienced in electronics and electricity, and has modified and circuit bent his equipment from a young age. Further, the UK music magazine Future Music ran an article (with photo) about a sampler he built for his microelectronics degree.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mike Paradinas was on Richard's label, Richard has had his music released on Mike Paradinas' label. In an interview with Joyrex of www.joyrex.com, Mike Paradinas claimed Richard's claims about building synthesizers and samplers from scratch were total lies. Future Music magazine even got tricked into posting a picture of an obviously fake looking sampler. Mike Paradinas claims Richard used only normal equipment that was easily available to everyone, although some equipment was slightly modified. It's a shame I can't find the source, because some troll is twisting this article to suit his own bullshit.</dd>

<p>Well, there's a difference between what you call IDM music, and then how the name IDM is applied to some music. When Aphex Twin makes a song he's just making music, and he's influenced by a lot of Acid House and Electronic Music and Classical composers. He is not doing anything "IDM". It's just that he hyped up his genius in the press to sell more copies, so the internet fans started a discussion forum and they describe his music as IDM. Even though his music is Electronic Music, which is a much more accurate name, considering Aphex Twin's history of studying Electronics and having Stockhausen as a hero. It's a popular name people use to describe music, but most of the time if you look at the individual albums up close then there is a better more specific name for it like Acid House, Drill and Bass, Ambient Techno, Ambient, Noise, Prepared Piano. They are also popular names to describe music, and they are more specific. If you then look at Autechre or some more modern groups then you could definitely call them IDM as they fall into it easily and can't be described as much else. I'm really into Aphex Twin and Electronic Music, and see it labelled IDM instead of something more accurate, and find it just weird. That IDM list could just take someone's artistic work and pidgeonhole it to a not very descriptive name, and we should stick with that even when most usually there are much more better and popular names available.</p>
<p>When Aphex Twin pushed the boundaries, he pushed the boundaries of Drum and Bass, Acid House, and so on. After this music came out, the fans labelled it IDM and drill and bass, and that is represented later on in the article. Seeing as that is what actually happened, I feel like that is the best way to show it in the article. So we say Aphex Twin is electronic music, because that's where the history, ideas, influences, and music come from. Then we say that the fans on the internet IDM list made the IDM name popular to describe it all, and that goes in the third party influences section, because they are a third party who created that stuff.</p>
<dl>
<dd>IMO IDM is not a music genre. It is something undescriptive and inaccurate. It is just a category invented for the hard to categorize genres. IDM is like alternative rock - no essence.</dd>

<dd>Selected ambient works: Ambient Techno, Selected Ambient Works 2: Ambient, I care because you do: Ambient Techno, Richard D. James album: Drum and Bass/Drill and Bass, Drukqs: Prepared Piano/Drill and Bass, Chosen Lords: Acid House. With those albums listed, it should be obvious!

<dd>Of course he has made many different types of music but it is generally agreed that he is one of the major figures in the IDM genre along Autechre, Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, etc. Also I would argue with much of your categorization, for instance I wouldn't say ICBYD is ambient techno by any stretch and I would say Drill and Bass is a subgenre or at least overlaps heavily with IDM. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 17:27, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, what the hell is IDM? It was invented by the IDM list to categorise Rephlex Records songs. What is drill and bass? A genre name made by fans to describe Aphex Twin's take on drum and bass. If we're going to describe Richard D. James album, drill and bass is accurate, popular, and perfect really, how the heck is that a subgenre of IDM? In reality it's a subgenre of Drum and Bass.

<dd>The question is not whether or not he is drill and bass, but whether or not he is IDM.

<dd>The first time I saw Aphex Twin on MTV, it was 1991/92, I can't remember now the name of the song, but I recorded it on a VHS tape and I still have here. I suddenly compared him to Kraftwerk, and I found it very strange that MTV was broadcasting such pure electronic music with no danceable rhythms. Those days, the Orb and Aphex Twin were referred to as <i>electronic music</i>, <i>electronic dance music</i>, <i>techno</i> and <i>ambient techno</i>, some works by AT were <i>jungle</i> (a term that is still used in Germany, see [<a href="http://www.laut.de" class="external text" title="http://www.laut.de" rel="nofollow">here</a>] for example). The words <i>IDM</i> and <i>electronica</i> appeared on the web many years later, and I honestly have never heard of them in the real world; I don't live in UK, though I'm (or I have been) familiar with people from every corner of the world.<a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktor_Who_a947.html" title="User:Doktor Who">Dr. Who</a> 02:23, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IDM was originally created for the rephlex records. Rephlex records is practically just aphex twin. It think it's the ultrimate to describe Aphex Twin. IDM can be any thing from Acid House TO Drum and Bass. Sure it wasn't the first genre to describe, but it's easier to say IDM then, to list 10 diffren't grenres. IDM is an evolved genre title, and is far more effecient. When you hear the term "Electronic" you usually think of cheesey techno stuff, and more formatic groups like Chemical Brothers and Daft Punk. so IDM is the "Intelligent" side of Electronic, in my personal view. This can be further debated, but I baleave that the fact that Richard pretty much created the idealism of IDM that he should be quallified as so. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamWhite_bc8e.html" title="User:SamWhite">SamWhite</a> 03:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>the term "IDM" has nothing to do with Rephlex records. it comes from the name of a mailing list started to discuss the WARP records "artificial intelligence" records. Rephlex records is most certainly not "practically just aphex twin". Take one look at the discogs entry and you can see this.</dd>
<dd>I don't think that Wikipedia should take in serious consideration that "Electronic" is a "cheesey techno stuff". <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_music.html" title="Electronic music">Electronic music</a> is a well defined genre of music, this is not the place for slang, word of mouth or hearsays.</dd>

<p>I've updated the infobox. There is no need to list every genre and subgenre that he has explored, becouse a complete list should include almost everything related to electronic music, that is a really huge list.--<a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktor_Who_a947.html" title="User:Doktor Who">Dr. Who</a> 22:37, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the list of genres pretty accurately describes the music of Aphex Twin's career. It's pretty accurate, isn't it? The list doesn't need to become any bigger than about 8 genres because everything is covered by Electronic Music. I think it's great to show that Aphex Twin makes noise music as well as electronic music. The list is long because Aphex Twin worked in all those genres. The list doesn't need to become bigger again, but having it like this shows the reader more of the colour of Aphex Twin's palette than he'd see otherwise.Newsnight Watcher 08:33, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The list is too long, no other musician on Wikipedia has such huge list, it's like saying that Pink Floyd's genres are:Psychedelic rock, symphonic rock, music concrete, noise, electronic (art) music, progressive rock, hard rock, folk ballads, that is true, but the term progressive rock is enough. Anyway, I'll change ambient with <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambient_music.html" title="Ambient music">Ambient music</a>, becouse he explored both the pure drumless Ambient Music (the <i>Eno</i> style) and the more recent Ambient house and Ambient Techno. The <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambient.html" title="Ambient">Ambient</a> page should be a disambiguation one, given that the word itself has so many meanings to different people and contexts, even outside music. The word IDM is meaningless, it's a sort of hyperonym that will to encompass all the above genres, so it's not really needed. Prepared piano is not a genre, it's a technique used in many different <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_classical_music.html" title="Contemporary classical music">Contemporary classical music</a> and <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avantgarde.html" title="Avantgarde">Avantgarde</a> music contexts. Oh, I forgot to mention that Mr Aphex Twin has so many fans and listeners that really do not care about the obsessions that many Wikipedians have with regard to classifying information, facts and people.<a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktor_Who_a947.html" title="User:Doktor Who">Dr. Who</a> 13:27, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aphex Twin worked in very seperate genres, and it's good to note them all down. It's wrong to compare him to a rock band or another musician as he is not exactly the same as them, we should just treat him on what he does rather than compare him to rock bands. You are dead right about prepared piano. I agree that only wikipedians care about a tiny little genre name list, that's why it's good that we get it right, because we're the ones geeky enough to care enough to correct it! P.S. I personally like the genre list right now. Newsnight Watcher 19:59, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is no problem in mentioning al the subgenres of Electronic Music, electronic dance music and so on along the article and/or the discography. I just believe that it's useless if those are listed in the infobox (I would list just one, maybe 2 or 3, not 5 or 8!); and beside useless, it makes the page and the infobox more difficult to read. The infobox should represent information so that you can fully watch and read it in less than 1 second. With regard to my VHS tape reporting a video by Aphex Twin on MTV Europe in early 1990s, I do not have the right videocard for uploading, I am very sorry. I would be pleased that someone else aged about 38/42 would help such articles, but I sadly realized that people of my generation are not great Wikipedians, they seem too busy with work, and in many cases they come here, stay for a while and then leave becouse they do not want to have nothing to do with younger people.

Please if you find any great sources about Aphex Twin but you feel you don't have the time to make edits then please post those sources here. We have some good sources for the biography section and so on. If anyone has any more, please add them here. This sources section has nothing to do with genre names. Thanks. Good luck!

<p>IDM, beside having been a term that some journalists sometimes used in a metaphoric way, is only the product of some stupid people that are trolling the whole web. You do not need to be a scientist to fuck Google, it is named <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_bombing.html" title="Google bombing">Google bombing</a>. And by the way, I suspect that many Wikipedians are almost crazy , beside being very rich and with no real problems in the real world, becouse there is no such a thing like hundreds of music genres in the real world. Music genres are not more than a couple of dozens, in the worst case, in the best case are less than 10.

IDM is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, indeed the term was coined by some groups of fans and the article itself explains that Richard D. James doesn't take it seriously, indeed he laughs at it; the point is that, according to critical reasoning, there is no proof that IDM is a term that describes a genre in a way that no other word can describe or address. It is obvious that every artist has his/her own <b>style</b>, that doesn't mean that we can maintain an Encyclopedia with a different genre for each artist.

<dd>Don't expect too many more responses from me on this, because I don't take your position very seriously.

You obviously do not understand <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> very well if you think that a genre that has been used by dozens of legitimate publications is OR, and perhaps you should take a good hard read of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> which explains the whole "verifiability, not truth" thing. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 15:53, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As you can see from previous talks (above), I'm not the only guy that has to "complain" about the abuse of the term IDM. I'm arguing that it should not be put in the infobox, that's all, but of course it has to be covered in the page. From the point of view of a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_theory.html" title="Music theory">music theorist</a>, IDM is a meaningless word; is <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_theory.html" title="Music theory">music theory</a> still important, or you are going to tell me that journalists can teach <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a>?

<dd>Recury, it's not nice to see that you still haven't given a reliable print source from a respected publication for your assertion that IDM is actually a genre of music and that Aphex Twin makes his music in that genre. There is no source for it because it's false and just your opinion. Deleting the ambient music genre from the infobox is laughable, especially as two of Aphex Twin's albums are called <i>Selected Ambient Works</i> Why delete Electronic Music from the genre name list? You know Aphex Twin is totally influenced by Electronic Music, right? You know he makes Electronic Music. You know he made his own equipment from his knowledge in Electronics?

The point of having sources is so we can check to see if it's incorrect or not. Recury, I don't understand why you insist on having an unverifiable genre name in the infobox considering that there are perfect verifiable genre names that represent Aphex Twin's work and descriptions of his work from various print magazines such as Rolling Stone. Considering that Aphex Twin has never made an IDM genre record, I can't understand your position at all. The genre list is for genres that Aphex Twin has worked in and released albums in. Like, it's supposed to show the reader what style of music Aphex Twin has made and stuff. Recury, we are being bold by stating Aphex Twin's musical genres, please be helpful and stop replacing the verifiable genre names used by magazines with unverifiable names invented by internet fanboys.

<dd>IDM is already mentioned in the 3rd party influences section where it belongs, as IDM was invented by the IDM list (a specific group of internet fans of Aphex Twin). As the Rolling Stone source shows, Aphex Twin is known as a pioneer of techno and ambient electronic music. These are what his genres are, and that is what goes in the genre box! The rolling stone article is correct in saying that among fans of IDM but it neglects to mention that IDM is a mailing list so we have other sources such as a link to that site to explain it. Whatever, Aphex Twin's musical genres are clear as day, and Aphex Twin is a pioneer in them. IDM belongs in the 3rd party section, and that's where it is. You have the damn mention of your bloody "IDM discussion list" so please stop trying to put mention of it everywhere in the article where it doesn't belong.<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyrex_1fab.html" title="User:Joyrex">Joyrex</a></dd>

<p>Im suprised no one added The Bad Plus "Flim" Cover (personal fav). Someone should do a quick crosscheck on anyone else prominent who's done covers. I of course am too lazy.</p>

<p>Mention should be made of Richard D James's foray into film and animation. In 2003 he wrote and directed an animated short film titled 'New Balls Please' that recieved an Honarary Mention at the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prix_Ars_Electronica_2272.html" title="Prix Ars Electronica">Prix Ars Electronica</a> 2004 <a href="http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=12819" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=12819" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. This is very interesting in the fact that it is a creative interest of his, not entirely related to sound, in fact Sound Production for the film is credited to sound designer Barnaby Templar - <a href="http://www.britfilms.com/britishfilms/catalogue/browse/?id=D9CC70591b1ff23A0FoRy40476FE" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britfilms.com/britishfilms/catalogue/browse/?id=D9CC70591b1ff23A0FoRy40476FE" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>He was also joint winner with Chris Cunningham for the Golden Nica award <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prix_Ars_Electronica_2272.html" title="Prix Ars Electronica">Prix Ars Electronica</a> 1999 for the Come to Daddy music video clip <a href="http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2177" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2177" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>The following is his Bio from Ars Electronica - <a href="http://www.aec.at/documents/PR_2004_James_001_E.doc" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aec.at/documents/PR_2004_James_001_E.doc" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p><i>Richard James (UK) is a graduate of the National Film and Television School. His film Dick was screened in festivals including Annecy and Hiroshima. Richard’s first year film Studs premiered on ITV in 2001 and was a finalist in the DepicT short film festival in Bristol. He also co-designed, illustrated and applied all of the 3D texturing on the NFTS graduation film The Trinket Maker.</i></p>
<p>The most recent info i can find is that RDJ created animation for the opening title sequence of the 2005 feature film Bob the Butler, (seemingly) through the production company Sherbert <a href="http://www.sherbet.co.uk/html/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sherbet.co.uk/html/index.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> who also produced New Balls Please</p>

<dd>Heck, you've done most of the work already; just make it sound encyclopedic and add it. We'll format it for you if you don't know how. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 21:19, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure, I could add the info, but don't have great deal of time so give me a few days (01/11/06) and thanks, i may need formatting correction. If an articulate fan in the meantime would like to do the honours though, feel free.</dd>

<dd>Have you got any proof it's actually "Richard D. James" the Aphex Twin? It's not a very unusual name really and this would be the 1st a lot of people would have heard of this.................
<dl>
<dd>It certainly is him, look at the ARSelectronica website <a href="http://www.aec.at/en/personen_page.asp?iPersonID=238" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aec.at/en/personen_page.asp?iPersonID=238" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> along with a skanky photo of RDJ it states he's attained two awards - one for the Come to Daddy video <a href="http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2177" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2177" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> with Chris Cunningham, the other for his animation New Balls Please. My guess is that his interest in animation might exlain why he hasn't been as prolific with his music over the last few years.</dd>

<dd>Can you find reference to this on any other site? I doubt it very much. Btw that is a picture of Chris Cunningham not RDJ, and as for him being less prolific recently, what about the _12_ analord 12 inches last year? I'm pretty certain its not the same 'richard d. james'.</dd>

<p>The ARS Electronica website is incorrect, Sherbert Productions have stated to me that Richard D James is not Richard James, producer of New Balls Please.</p>

<p>Apparently Richard James's twin sibling died at birth - influencing his title Aphex Twin - can anyone clarify this?</p>

<p>One of my favorites, it's not on the discography.

<dd>"Classics" is a compilation not a proper release, it can be viewed via the discography page. furthermore this is one of the very few releases RDJ is credited as "The" Aphex Twin, the Digeridoo single is another one. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexOvShaolin_aee0.html" title="User talk:AlexOvShaolin"><font color="Grey"><b>Alex</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AlexOvShaolin_5b4f.html" title="Special:Contributions/AlexOvShaolin"><font color="black">Ov</font></a><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaolin.html" title="Shaolin"><font color="red"><b>Shaolin</b></font></a> 19:43, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
