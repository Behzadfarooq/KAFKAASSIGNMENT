<dd>If the Biography was rewritten to be conjoined with Aphex Twin's major record releases, it would make more sense. Because this is an Aphex Twin article rather than a Richard D. James article, shouldn't we concentrate on Aphex Twin the musical career? I believe some things are difficult to prove, even if they have an internet source (like Aphex's parents living in Cornwall, Canada before moving to Cornwall, England) Some details are trivial towards Aphex Twin's musical career, and are difficult to prove. Some of these minor things should be left out of this article unless they have print sources.</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your kind remark, Luke. I think that eventually this article should change from "Aphex Twin" to "Richard D. James" for a number of obvious reasons. Secondly, I will not have much more time to work on this article due to personal issues (moving, college, etc.), so whatever happens to the article is fine by me, provided the information is correct, sources are linked, and the article maintains a plesent aesthetic. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsomniak_caba.html" title="User:Insomniak">Insomniak</a> 02:55, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Close friends" are not valid sources. He shouldn't be referred to as "Richard", it's not encyclopedic. Either by surname (James) or moniker (Aphex). Very nice read, but it's more a fan piece than a FA candidate at the moment. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 06:19, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Close friends is a bit confusing. Joyrex from www.watmm.com interviewed Mike P, who had his music released by Aphex Twin, and has released music by Aphex Twin, and whose label has been praised by Aphex Twin in public. Mike P was there with Aphex Twin back in the day according to the interview, and he was there when James invented a fake sampler box to show Future Music magazine. James didn't make his own equipment, Mike P confirmed that Aphex Twin used perfectly normal keyboards and samplers, perhaps a few ever so slightly modified. I don't know how close a friend Mike P is to Richard James, but I know that he is a valid source. It's a shame we don't have the interview to add as a source to the article. I'm looking for it.User:Simminizian</dd>

<p>REPLY(Robbie): I agree with the above. Some Aphex twin fans have the tendincy to be a little gullible. I was shocked to find "melodies from mars" listed as an official album. Boy internet rumours do spread fast. Just because aphex twin made a joke in an interview or unofficial websites claim something is true does NOT make it true. The problem is how does Wikipedia deal with an entry about a real person who lies all the time in interviews? They do not have any special circumstance for dealing with this. So we should be careful about what non-provable information we put in.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Richard is definately not Global Goon. I know the guy. The only "frontman" Aphex has ever used was Bradley Strider.</dd>
</dl>
<p>REPLY:(Robbie)&#160;: what guy do you know Global Goon or RDJ? If you RDJ, please ask him to clear up some of his lies and or wild claims in this wikipedia discussion.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Notable photographer</span></h2>
<p>I think this line should be removed. Taking photos for his own album covers doesnt make him a notable photographer. Maybe he should be called a notable soldier for owning a tank, or a notable painter because of the ICBYD cover.</p>

<dl>
<dd>i suggest not mentioning it at all. Its definitly POV. His photography is only notable to you because you probably like his music.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Richard didnt take the photos on SAW2 - they were by his then girlfriend Sam Robinson (who also took the Polygon Window Cornwall shots).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh realy? The liner notes to SAW2 seem to disagree with you. <a href="http://xltronic.com/media/artworks/maxi/warplp21ltd-inlay1.jpg" class="external text" title="http://xltronic.com/media/artworks/maxi/warplp21ltd-inlay1.jpg" rel="nofollow">Source</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>When I heared that Richard is a talented photographer I wanted to see his work. I was disappointed... We know about 2 or 3 photos made by him and we call him a photographer? I`m sorry to say it, 2, 3 or even 10 photos do not make him a photographer. Maybe he is. Maybe the photography is one of his hobbies, but do we have some proofs?</p>

<dd>the claim is POV fanboy drivel. It should be changed simply to note that he has provided much of his own photography for his own record sleeves.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 14:44, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Interview information</span></h2>
<p>(robbie)It seems like alot of this aphex twin article is filled with information Aphex twin has claimed in his interviews. Him having a dead twin brother, and having 100 hours of unreleased music are very hard to believe statements he has made. Does anyone have any proof to back these up besides what RDJ himself has said? (Remeber: this is the guy who made an Album called "Selected ambient works 85-92", acid techno was first made by Dj Pierre around 1987. How likely is it that RDJ invented acid techno on his own at age 14, 2 years before DJ pierre?)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What's odd about 100 hours of unreleased music? 100/24 = 4 days worth. If you spend well over a decade making music during most of your free time, you're likely going to have that much music onhand. --I run like a Welshman 18:53, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm pretty sure that the rumor about him living in a converted bank is true. i've read interviews (sorry no links) where he said he bought it for it's acoustics (RDJ Album era interveiw). Also, the runout groove on "2 remixes by AFX" has 'Squidged out of the bank by Aphex' etched in it. I doubt he'd keep up a lie like that for this long...but then again...he IS Aphex Twin.</dd>

REPLY (Robbie): I consider myself an acoustic expert. And the fact that he would say that he chose a bank or even a vault as a preferred studio proves to me he is either joking/lying. "...but then again...he IS Aphex Twin." exactly</p>
<p>Also, Acid Techno is different from Ambient. <i>SAW85-92</i> has very little, if any, Roland TB-303's on it, THE sound of Acid Techno.</p>
<p>REPLY(Robbie): actually the acid techno sound does not have to be only using a TB-303. In fact i think most musicians would argue with you that an SH-101, mc-303, or any newer Roland synths can produce "acid techno". Most acid techno enthusiasts or musicians will say the 303 is the best acid sound, but it can be easily recreated with any similar Low pass filter and saw tooth wave osciallator. I can think of at least 3 songs from memory ( on the album of reference) that use an definite acid techno sound (resonance turned all the way up while a cutoff envelope is being used or cutoff knob)</p>

<dd>The Girl/Boy EP has an old photo of a grave with the name "Richard James". Plus, he didn't claim to have a real twin, just an older brother with the same name. I'd put my money on this claim being true. --<a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuyincog_35b0.html" title="User:Guyincog">Guyincog</a> 17:15, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>REPLY(robbie): doesnt matter if you put your money wherever. Wikipedia calls this a POV. Which is not allowed. The problem is this is grey area, since Aphex Twin is known for compulsively lying. I dont know how we'd prove it either way. The photo in RDJ album could have been easily doctored, or not related to him in any way.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sign comments, please, so that we know who said what. I personally believe this claim to be true. This is opinion. However, it's not opinion to say "James claimed in an interview..." because he did in fact say that. - <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuyincog_35b0.html" title="User:Guyincog">Guyincog</a> 19:02, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>REPLY(Robbie): yes i agreee with the above. IT is fine to put "he claimed in an interview" and that he put a photo of it in RDJ album. However didnt he only start talking about this when RDJ album came out? I dont remember him making this claim about this band name being related to a dead brother he had before RDJ came out.</p>

<dd>tank = true, submarine = false, synths = mostly false, 13 acid = depends on your interpretation of acid, bank = true, brother = true (shame on you for doubting it). incidentally i agree that acid house is not just the preserve of the 303. and there was plenty of acid music before 1987.</dd>
</dl>
<p>REPLY(robbie) : how do you know the tank is true? I've seen a very low quality photo of Aphex standing next to a tank, but knowing aphex he probably just took a picture of himself next to a tank at an old war exhibit in England 13 acid - i honestly dont believe he made any of the music on that CD at age 14, if he did he was more creative than any of the worlds electronic music artists, because he made several genres of music on that album that didnt exsist yet in the year "84". Bank is most definitly not true, it has now been proven to me that he is lying because he claims he did it for "acoustics". If you go into a bank vault or even just a bank lobby, you will see the amount of sound reflection and comb filtering/phas cancellation would be very bad for acoustics. The surfaces are just too hard and reflective. I could see him liking this type of sound if he also happened to like the acoustics of a public bathroom with tiled floors. Brother= shame on me? Im sorry for not believing everything the man says.</p>
<p>he has lied about more things - 1- "if i use a sample once in a song, i never use it again" = prove lie, just listen to his music 2- "I use Csound to make my new music" = if he does how come it sounds nothing like he used Csound, but that he used mostly other recognizable software and or hardware such as Metasynth and other String sampling libraries. 3- "I played the cello you hear on RDJ" = if he did, why does it sound so much like a sampling library? if he played it, he sure did a bad job of sampling himself into his songs while maintaing the realism and escaping form the "cheesy string" preset sound 4- "All my fans are wankers and im going to bury myself with 100 hours of unreleased music and my fans will have to dig me up to get it" = We know now that the man doesnt have this music unreleased music. IF so why isnt he trying to capitalize on it and just release all of it? We already know he likes making money. (end of reply by Robbie)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But does he like making money? As far as I can tell he's making music because that is what he loves to do. Whether his fans hear his creations or they get sold is of no consequence, it seems. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_McVickar_c091.html" title="User:Matthew McVickar">Matthew McVickar</a> 16:47, Nov 2, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not unbelievable to own a tank. I saw the pictures in the paper. It wasn't a modern tank, it was an old WWII tank. You can buy them on the net for a reasonable price, just search google. As for submarines, you can buy them on ebay. Although I can't confirm the submarine.</p>
<p>The bank is real. A journalist wrote an article about visiting Aphex's bank house. Aphex lives on one floor, and Mammoth and Cylob have a floor each. Something like that, but the bank is real. Stop hovering on this "for acoustics" rubbish. It doesn't matter, because Aphex really lives in a bank. Also, fans from watmm.com have been outside the bank and visited Aphex twin for a cup of tea and a joint.</p>
<p>Mainly the bank is used for recording purporses now, however it was slept in tobegin with - however it was too cold for richard. Its used for recording as it provides good acoustics for "real -reverb", which rich mentions in his many posts under the monika "analord" on the planet-mu foreunm.</p>

If not Richard himself, it's at least someone in his circle. The Rephlex label, of course, was started by Richard D James and one of his other colleagues. --I run like a Welshman 18:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Hold up, ive got that "melodys from mars" album, and quite a few of the song are on the RDJ album. i dont understand why you ask if its actually him or not. Course its him! im guessing he didont want to release it because 1, the sound quality was terrible (well from my copy it is) and maybe he just wanted to improve them? note, they are heavily improved on the RDJ album.</p>
<p>Umm. Threat of legal action = proof of Rephlex. An extended version of Fingerbib on Melodies from Mars = proof of Aphex. The similarity of aesthetic between the songs to Fingerbib = extra hints at Aphex. Leave it there. Oh by the way, Melodies from Mars mp3s are from a CASSETTE given to Warp/Rephlex bods.</p>
<p>whiterabbitwhiterabbit at gmail dot com -- From what I remember from years and years ago Melodies from Mars was the follow up to "I Care Because You Do..." Un relased. Loops of it are located <a href="http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/afx/" class="external text" title="http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/afx/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

Outputting a value at one of its ports would cause interference with the television signal. Different values created different frequencies. Those frequencies were mapped out to near-musical notes.

Instead of jizzing over the fact that (gasp) a 30-odd year old nerd who happens to make some pretty decent electronic music might have come onto this site and made some changes, why don't you go out and meet people?

<dd>OK - time to finally break the news - there's not actually any such person as Richard D James. It's just all a big hoax perpetrated on gullible Americans by us 17 people who live here in England. We all thought the initial mix-up with all those different artist names would be a bit of a give-away! but still you guys fell for it. That guy we keep taking the photos of is actually just a student from Milton Keynes, real name Kevin Bimble.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A Proposition</span></h2>
<p>I am suggesting adding a paragraph of information to each of the RDJ Alias discographies. This would allow us to have detailed info on the different aspects of his sounds, without clogging the Biography section.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>"The Caustic Window EP's, some of the first material released by Richard's label, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Rephlex_Records_b6b9.html" title="Rephlex Records">Rephlex</a>, was a departure from the more ambient side of material released a year earlier on <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warp.html" title="Warp">Warp</a> and <a href="../../../r/%26/s/R%26S_Records_732d.html" title="R&amp;S Records">R&amp;S Records</a>. Described as "Hardcore" by the label, the harsh, abrasive songs were released in very limited pressings of 1000 or less. They were later re-released by Rephlex in 1998 as a single CD and triple vinyl"</p>
<p>Thought I should get other editors consensus before beginning this series of edits.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Record buying geek detail about the releases rather than the artist. You should write a review of the record, and link it into the article or something. Link it on the record names. It shouldn't be on the article about Ahex and his art. If this is gonna be a feature article, less people gonna care about 1000 records pressed or not 13 yeasr ago.<a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.252.32.13.html" title="User:62.252.32.13">62.252.32.13</a> 11:05, 27 July 2005 (UTC)LukeAcid</dd>

<dd>Some of these records are actually by the Kosmik Komnmando Mike Dred. Other ones said to be made by Martin Tresseder. Aphex did some stuff, but only on 2 records. Anyone have the facts? At least on one kosmik kommando record it says he made 2 of the UI records, then years later he did a purple version. 2 records have martin tresseder and aphex twin. 1 of them is defeinitaly aphex (red one i think), the evidence is one song is on the aphex twin interview cd, and all the other music on there is by aphex twin. Anyone know more? Or good facts? I will just say this in discussion and someone else can edit the article in better english than me....

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Diceman</span></h2>
<p>I got hold of a copy of a 12" by The Diceman in the early 90's having being told by the NME that this was another RDJ psedonym. It was released on the Vivatonal label in 1993 (VTT008), and features tracks'Le blanc', 'Gris' and 'Le noir'. Songs are credited to James/Jamieson. I've no idea as to the authenticity of the RDJ connection--Outbak 15:57, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The Warp Records "Artificial Intelligence" Album (Warp 6) has a track called Polygon Window by "The Dice Man". The Warprecords.com site states that, "AI marked the Warp debut for Aphex (as the Diceman)"--Jon, Manchester</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jon is correct, "The Diceman" was Richard's first psudonym on Warp, followed by Polygon Window, then bringing over his Aphex Twin psudonym from R&amp;S. As for your 12", I've never heard of any of those tracks by RDJ, <i>however</i> I did read once in the Unofficial AFX FAQ that there was another group called Diceman or Dicemen, and that both of them read the same book with a character named The Diceman or something. I'm looking right now for that refrence. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsomniak_caba.html" title="User:Insomniak">Insomniak</a> 19:24, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>RDJ only released on track under the alias "The Diceman". This alias has also been used by several other artists including Colin James formerly of Meat Beat Manifesto.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">who cares...?</span></h2>
<p>seriously, when i first got into aphex (the time ctd was released) i just thought that was part of the mystique to him as an artist. the fact that he is so elusive with interviews and in the press. nothing else matters about him besides the music he releases. i've never believed a single rumor i've heard about him. the only thing that upsets me is the fact that he releases music under alias', which is understandable considering the fact that he may not want people to be biased when listening to his new shit. other than that i really don't care about anything said because i can choose to ignore what i don't like, i highly recomend you try it for yourself.</p>

<p>some people bought the analogue equipment when it was unfashionable and very cheap though. some of us are over 30 you know! anyone remember when 303`s were £50? and coke was 16p a tin? crisps 5p</p>
<p>also you have overlooked A LOT of other points because its not all about the overall frequency response of the recording system its how the sound gets there in the first place. here are some things which you can`t get from a plugin,they are often emulated but due to their hugely complex nature are always pretty crass aproximations..</p>
<p>the sound of analogue equpiment including EQ, changes very noticably over even a few hours due to temperature changes within a circuit. Anyone who has tried to make tracs on a few analogue synths and make them stay in tune can tell you this,you leave a trac running for a few hours come back and think Im sure I didnt fucking write that,I must be going mental!</p>
<p>this affects all the components in a synth/EQ in an almost infinte amount of tiny ways. and the amount differs from circuit to circuit depending on the design.</p>
<p>the interaction of different channels and their respective signals with an analogue mixer are very complex,EQ,dynamics.... any fx, analogue or digital that are plugged into it all have their own special complex characteristics and all interact with each other differently and change depending on their routing. Nobody that ive heard of has even begun to start emulating analogue mixer circuitry in software,just the aesthetics,it will come but im sure it will be a crap half hearted effort like most pretend synth plugins are. they should be called PST synths, P for pretend not virtual.</p>
<p>Every piece of outboard gear has its own sound ,reverbs,modulation effects etc real room reverb, this in itself companies have spent decades trying to emulate and not even got close in my opinion, even the best attempts like Quantec and EMT only scratch the surface.</p>
<p>analogue EQ is currently impossible in theory to be emulated digitally,quite intense maths shit involed in this if youre really that interested,you could look it up...good luck.</p>
<p>your soundcard will always make things sound like its come from THAT soundcard..they ALL impose their different sound characteristics onto whatever comes out of them they are far from being totally neutral devices.</p>
<p>all the components of a circuit like resistors and capacitors subtley differ from each other depending on their quality but even the most high quality milatary spec ones are never EXACTLY the same.</p>
<p>no two analogue synths can ever be built exactly the same,there are tiny human/automated errors in building the circuits,tweaking the trimpots for example which is usually done manually in a lot of analogue shit. just compare the sound of 2 808 drum machines next to each other and you will see what I mean,you always thought an 808 was an 808 right? same goes for 303`s they all sound subltey different,different voltage scaling of the oscillator is usually quite noticable.</p>
<p>VST plugins are restricted by a finite number of calculations per second these factors are WAY beyond their CURRENT capability.</p>
<p>Then there is the question of the physicallity of the instrument this affects the way a human will emotionally interact with it and therfore affect what they will actually do with it! often overlooked from the maths heads,this is probably the biggest factor I think. for example the smell of analogue stuff as well as the look of it puts you in a certain mental state which is very different from looking at a computer screen.</p>
<p>then there is analogue tape...ah this really could go on forever....</p>
<p>im quite drunk cant be bothered to type anymore... so yeah,whatever, you obviously dont have to have analogue equipment to make `good` music in case thats the impression im giving,EVERYTHING has its uses .And not all anlaogue equipment is expensive you can still get bargains like old high end military audio devices,tape machines fx etc just go for the unfashionable stuff.</p>

<dd>It's "weird" the way the artwork matches the theme of the song? My god! what a novel concept! This is gonna revolutionize album cover art. Richard is such a pioneer.

<dd>this picture on analord 11 is of a big shiny memorial thingie in the middle of a big roundabout in elephant + castle in london ... I believe Afx has said in interviews that he bought this building, it also seems to be a bit of a rumour around the area, i think it's probably bullshit but who knows ? It kind of explains the label photos i think</dd>

<dd>When Analord came out I read a review which said "the names of the songs sound like viruses, perhaps this is to stop people downloading them from p2p sites" or words to that effect.

<p>Hey all. I heard a jazz remaking of two different aphex twin songs for a few seconds between stories on NPR. I've looked around online and can't find anything about them. Anyone know what album this is? I think the article could possibly mention it too. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuasipalm_6524.html" title="User:Quasipalm">Quasipalm</a> 15:27, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>If anyone has contact with either Joyrex the webmaster of www.watmm.com or the webmaster of www.xltronic.com, please get in touch with either or both of them and politely request that they let us have access to their vast collection of Aphex Twin interviews and articles. I think the lack of sources lets this article down. It seems like we've all read these articles in the past, and that's what the article is based on, but wouldn't it be better to base our Aphex Twin page on the articles themselves rather than on our memories of those articles from years ago. I am particularly interested in any interviews of Mike P, Grant, Luke Vibert and other friends of Rephlex that were hosted on the mentioned websites. They are a hive of information about Aphex Twin. With these sources, I think we could make the best Aphex Twin article ever. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyrex_1fab.html" title="User:Joyrex">Joyrex</a></p>

<p>I took this out because, Rubber Johnny is apparently Jason Buckle of All Seeing I, who has released stuff on Rephlex Also this release is not unreleased because it came out on Warp records. It does sound a bit like AFX to me but I don't think it's actually him?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Acid Effects and Richard's Brother</span></h2>
<p>I was under the impression that AFX stands for Acid Effects and that this preceded the name Aphex Twin. I read somewhere that the change was made because of problems with a record label. I have also heard that Richard's mother's first son (who was to be named Richard) died at birth. She then gave her second son the same name and hence the 'Twin' in Aphex Twin. I currently have no evidence for any of this so I will get searching. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 15:41, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Canada looks suss. It was never mentioned before. Even though that is a source, compared with most other Aphex Twin articles, it looks suss. I think it would have been mentioned before 2003.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Album and Singles info boxes</span></h2>
<p>Firstly, great job on all the hard work everyone has put into this page. It's definitely taught me alot about an artist who is notorious for being so mysterious and confusing.</p>
<p>My point anyway. The infoboxes in the album and singles sections are beginning to get a bit confusing, I was editing the Girl/Boy single when I realised that some of the singles have links to albums, whilst others seem to crossover, it's all a bit of a mess, but nothing serious.</p>
<p>Anyway is the general opinion that albums and singles should be in different series, or to you all feel (as I do) that each single is as important as an album. E.g. The <i>Girl/Boy EP</i> should have a link to <i>The Richard D. James Album</i> and vice versa. I mean many of Aphex Twin's best songs end up on singles and EPs. I know it's petty but what do you guys think? <a href="../../../a/j/p/User%7EAjplmr_2b7c.html" title="User:Ajplmr">Ajplmr</a> 21:40, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"James was one of the first to use spectral imaging in music, and has been imitated by various artists including <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plaid.html" title="Plaid">Plaid</a> (as seen in "3recurring") and" i took this out because "not for threes" which 3recuring if off was out a good 2 years before windowlicker wasnt it? so he imitated them by this type of logic</p>
<p>3recuring is on rest proof clockwork, released in 1999 --Dave</p>
<p>Pretty sure the recurring threes pattern shows up on both "not for threes" and "rest proof" albums, although i cant be bothered to download a spectral analyser and scour through the albums to find out the tracks. <a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Grace_b34c.html" title="User:A.Grace">A.Grace</a></p>

<p>I previously added Philip Glass to the "Influences" section, but notice it has been removed. I re-added him, along with supporting examples. I also added a link to the article "Philip Glass and Richard D. James" in the External Links section, with goes into the connections between these two musicians in more detail.

<p>How is Phillip Glass an influence? he just did some stuff with him You removed Marvellous cain, painjerk, and Bernard Parmagiani, why? he's said himself that these people have influenced him but never said that of Phillip Glass</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The article I linked about the two indicates that RDJ specifically approached Glass to work on the Icct Hedral orchestration together. This certainly indicates he is an admirer. As far as influence, you can hear this in many RDJ tracks, but the most blatant example is probably "Polynomial-C" as heard on the album <i>Classics</i>. I apologize for removing the other 3.... they were all broken links, there was no supporting explanation, and a web search didn't find any connection between them and RDJ either... I shouldn't have done that without asking here first. Still figuring out this Wiki stuff... I will insert them in alpha order, if that's appropriate (I assume M. Cain would go under the C's...) cheers -- <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunks_db42.html" title="User:Funks">Funks</a> 15:26, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>So come on then, I'm compiling a presentation on RDJ for one part of one module of my Uni degree course at the moment, and a cursory Google for 'Aphex Twin born August' reveals that various sites report his birthday as any one of the three above dates (with most of them seeming to indicate the 18th, but a blogcritics article (written by someone who's actually interviewed RDJ in person... And I know he lies and all in interviews sometimes, but with various sites proffering various dates, which one's regarded to be his real birthdate by general concensus?</p>
<p>FWIW, Blogcritics article: <a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2003/09/29/132156.php" class="external free" title="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2003/09/29/132156.php" rel="nofollow">http://blogcritics.org/archives/2003/09/29/132156.php</a></p>
