<dd>Perhaps we need both titles. 'Mouth ulcer' (UK) / 'canker sore' (US) could be an overview, with links to more specific conditions such as 'aphthous ulcer'.

<p>I have definitely had ulcers that last considerably more than a month, on rare occasion more than 2 months. If I'm alone in this fair enough, but otherwise I think the time frame should be extended, or an 'occasionally longer' added. Wedgeh 09:15, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I, too have had such long-lasting outbreaks of RAS. If you are unlucky enough to suffer these long-lasting outbreaks, you <i>must</i> make the acquaintance of a good ENT specialist. He or she will be able to treat these longer outbreaks with steroids, either in oral (methyprednisolone, in this case) or subcutaneously injected form (kenalog, in this case). -- <a href="../../../z/d/o/User%7EZdover_d833.html" title="User:Zdover">Zdover</a> 09:15, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My two cents for all the other canker sore sufferers.... For half my life, I chewed gum almost every day, and for that half of my life, I had several canker sores every month. Stopped chewing gum, and the canker sores have been rare. (as both curious and masochistic, I will occasionally still chew gum, and have found that the more gum, and the more sugary it is, the more certain that a sore will shortly develop.) The other bit of advice from my own experience is this: while almost any kind of irritation to my mucus membrance will develop into a sore, I've found that if I can get some mouthwash on it during the first several minutes after the injury, the liklihood of ulcer development is much less.

<dd>It's also correct information. I've been using Rembrandt and noticed a definite decline in frequency of canker sores. Supposedly they have also done controlled studies involving that particular brand. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.54.208.177.html" title="User:24.54.208.177">24.54.208.177</a> 17:16, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am using the Rembrandt toothpaste currently, but I have my doubts. It appears that the 'active ingredient' is simply not having SLS.</p>
<p>I changed my toothpaste too (not to Rembrandt) and found I had less canker sores. I think it's more due began brushing and flossing much more regularly than the particular brand of toothpaste. However, this is merely anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>I've gone from 10+ canker sores a month to less than 1 a month simply by changing my toothpaste. I used to use Aquafresh (contains SLS). Now, I use Trader Joe's Peppermint (no SLS). The reason I changed was that I heard that SLS in toothpaste might cause canker sores. The TJ's toothpaste was the first I found w/o SLS. If Rembrandt does not contain SLS, then their claims may very well be valid. But, other toothpastes without SLS probably yield the same result. There are a handful of medical studies which link SLS in toothpaste to canker sores. I added them to the canker sore page earlier today. <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJrennie_cc6c.html" title="User:Jrennie">Jrennie</a> 00:25, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article recommends using Ambesol (spelling?) or Campho-phenique. But the warnings on my tube of Campho-phenique Cold Sore Treatment states, "If swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison control center right away." So if you place this on a canker sore, it would be swallowed - although a small amount. Can anyone provide a answer to the delima?</p>

<dd>I use it myself, so obviously I'm not too worried. If you apply it and rinse it out carefully, the few micrograms you might swallow are far below toxic doses. What the label means is, "Don't drink it".</dd>

<dd>I use listerine for canker sores, works for .5-4 hours. My key is to hold it in my mouth until all the pain in my mouth goes away (1-5 minutes), includes tongue and canker soure, and then I play/rub/lick/clean/scrub the sore with my toungue until its impossible to get pain out of it and repeat one or 2 times more because the salivia will dilute the listerine like crazy the first time in the series of listerine washes making it useless and only getting rid of pain because of the decreasing concentration of listerine vs saliva. Because it take a long time (1-5 mins) for the pain to go away per wash, I usually go back to whatever i was doing with listerine in my mouth. Also anasthetics are A JOKE, they cause more pain than they take by incomplete numbing. Also they NEVER stay where they should and numb the whole mouth and throat leading to accidental bites of toungue and cheek. And you cant eat with anasthetics or taste anything. With listerine i can eat a meal and taste it, not lidocaine flavored bread. Also, im not sure, or placebo effect, but one time i HAD to get rid of a canker sore ASAP for a hookup. I listerined it every 2-3 hours or each time i got a bathroom chance for all the hours i was awake for 3 days (day found+day 1+day 2) and on day 3 morning it was painless, and by afternoon gone. I think listerine helped, but there needs to be a serious study done, i havent tried to repeat it since. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatcat88_71f1.html" title="User:Patcat88">Patcat88</a> 18:57, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i usually get mouth ulcers, and have tried listerine. Seems to do the trick, i don't really know whether it helped "heal" the ulcer or just help relieve the pain, either way it disapeared quickly. 218.101.64.16 00:18, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Listerine is essentially alcohol, It would kill the pain because the alcohol would burn the heck out of your ulcer ( alcohol burn) same as rubbing alcohol on to a sore, yowzer) Listerine has some anti-inflammatory properties, but I think that listerine would be about as effective as bathing your ulcer in whiskey.

<p>I have found that <a href="../../../l/y/s/Lysine.html" title="Lysine">Lysine-L</a> has helped prevent mouth ulcers as well as <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitamin_C_bba2.html" title="Vitamin C">vitamin C</a> particularly in Apricot Nectar (juice). However at times of high stress I still get them and they are aggravated by things such as soft drinks and chocolate. Interestingly <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">beer</a> seems to help but whether this is due to some property of the beer or that I associate beer drinking with less stress is open for debate. I think it may be a combination of the two.</p>

<p>My grandmother used to recommend plain yoghurt. Maybe it's just the placebo effect, but it seems to work for me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>From my personal experience, yogurt does seem to be good at not only healing but preventing canker sores. Last year, I was getting awful canker sores every 6-8 weeks that made it difficult to speak and eat. Desperate to end this reoccuring pain, I decided to try the yogurt cure by eating small portions of yogurt after every meal. 9 months later, I cannot recall the last time I developed a canker sore in my mouth. Yogurt is most certainly worth a try for anyone who is tired of canker sore pain! <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Eng_9359.html" title="User:K. Eng">K. Eng</a> 04:13, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>edit: i just purchased a box of Cankermelts-gx (ive read that only able to purchase online, but found them at a local grocery store [NW washingtion "Haggen's"]). and oddly enough i think there working. i had bittin my lip and it was obviously going to turn into a canker stinging and getting bigger, but i put a cankermelt on it and today when it would normaly be blistering its still just a small bite mark with no sign of pain or turning into a canker. thouhg these things are tricky to get into position, they taste like Liquorice root (which is the active ingredinet!? Glycyrrhiza herbal extract). which is fine by me. ill come back after a few trials with this product to see if it really works.</dd>

<p>I use hydrogen Peroxide to clean mine. A little bit poured in the cap and some cotton swabs(q-tips) usually does the trick but sometimes I rinse my mouth out with it. The peroxide is painful when swabed on the sore but I find after cleaning that the sore doesnt hurt anymore and I can poke it with my tongue without pain. Mouth wash quickly removes the peroxide flavor.</p>
<p>I’ve found that Hydrogen Peroxide only makes it feel better by comparison. I usually experience pain when using it, but in recovery the pain receptors are less sensitive to pain. Like when you’re outside in the bright sun, but go inside its dark.</p>

<dd>In my personal experience, I've found no connection between amalgam fillings and canker sores. Since I was a child, I've had regular canker sores---it's rare that I'd go a few days without one. Appx. January '06, I switched to a non-SLS toothpaste. Appx. March '06, I had an amalgam filling. Since I switched toothpastes, I've seen a significant decrease in canker sores to the point that since about mid-July, I haven't had a single one. I.e. if amalgam fillings caused canker sores, I wouldn't have seen a steady decrease in their incidence from January to July. 'course, this is just one person's experience---other people may be affected differently.

<p><a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_Chinese_medicine_294b.html" title="Traditional Chinese medicine">Traditional Chinese medicine</a> says that mouth ulcer (along with sore throat and more pimples) are caused by consuming too much "hot" food (eg. deep fried food, fried food, oily food, baked food, arranged from most severe to least severe) and can be cured by eating "cold" food like pears, watercress, traditional Chinese herbal tea (very bitter) etc. The cause makes sense to me as I got a mouth sore the day straight after I ate at BK and the cures had worked most of the times. Does these worth mentioning in the main article? Or is it just a placebo?</p>
<p>There seem to be traditional chinese cures for almost every ailment, I would guess that every article relating to the human body could contain a bit about traditional remedies.

<p>I'd love to share stories. Someone should start a blog. One time i was attempting to eat a slice of pizza (bad idea) with crushed red peppers on top (really bad idea) at the same time my entire head hurt because i had such a huge sore on the inside of my lip. well, a crushed red pepper found its way directly inside the bounds of my sore, and my head almost exploded. my friends didn't know what the hell was going on. the next day, someone asked me when i started doing dip because my lip was so irratated and puffy. i usually use alum, which i feel works. however, the sore will usually "fight back" after the first application or two. if you fight back harder with alum, after 2 to 3 days of at least two "battles" per day, you're golden. it's a rough go, but hell, it beats feeling like S and acting like your cranky war vet grandpa for two weeks.</p>
<p>I had a couple on the back of my tongue. They were extremely painful whenever I swallowed or talked. I had to drink through a straw and couldn't eat&#160;:)</p>
<p>I once burnt my tongue with coffee and developed about 25 simultaneous canker sores on the tip and under the tongue. It was a most painful experience, I had to eat soups and stews and jelly while they healed, I couldn't talk. It lasted around two weeks. I just waited for it to heal naturally.--200.14.108.1 20:09, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have suffered from recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) since pre-adolescence, and I have noticed a correlation between consumption of ibuprofen and the outbreak of RAS. I have not read anything in RAS literature suggesting an etiological link between ibuprofen consumption and RAS outbreak, but the last time I took ibuprofen (September 2000) I developed severe RAS on the back of my throat near my tonsils, and the ulcers did not go away for months (and had finally to be treated with methylprednisolone). I had noticed before that I developed RAS ulcers after consuming ibuprofen, and I strongly suspect that ibuprofen is a RAS-outbreak trigger. Any specialist or doctor who wishes to contact me about this (or about having textbook-grade RAS outbreaks) is hereby encouraged to do so. -- <a href="../../../z/d/o/User%7EZdover_d833.html" title="User:Zdover">Zdover</a> 09:15, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I think this perspective needs to be stated somewhere in the introduction before focusing on the mouth (i.e. <a href="../../../a/p/h/Aphthous_stomatitis.html" title="Aphthous stomatitis">aphthous stomatitis</a>). <a href="../../../a/-/g/User%7EA-giau_1480.html" title="User:A-giau">A-giau</a> 06:42, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps something about this should be mentioned on the site:</p>
<p>2) Deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) DGL is the herb licorice that has had the glycyrrhizic acid removed, the portion that can increase blood pressure. In one research study, DGL was found to promote the healing of canker sores, with a 50-75% improvement in one day. This study used a mouthwash made of powdered DGL mixed with water.</p>

<p>I've not been a fan of the "OMG CITE THIS" nonsense infecting Wikipedia, but surely we don't need them for the Home Remedies section, do we?

<dd>The "OMG cite this" "nonsense" infecting wikipedia is the only thing thats going to be make it a source worthy of reading. Without it you end up with all kinds of common, and not-so-common, knowledge which is not true passed off as fact. For example, who would think to cite "coffee dehydrates you", or "water always spins the same direction when going down the drain depending on what hemishpere your in" when everyone knows it! Turns out neither is true (the coriollis effect only works on large scale systems such as hurricanes and caffiene dehydrates you, but coffee has enough water to compensate.) Home remedies should <i>of course</i> be cited. Its even more important when the information is as questionably effective as "home remedies" often are. Even if they are sourced it won't make them any more effective, but atleast we know where the information is coming from, and if it wasn't just made up by a contributor. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentt_2b51.html" title="User:Brentt">Brentt</a> 17:18, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>i read this part 'Aphthous ulcers normally heal without treatment within 1–2 weeks. Good oral hygiene should be maintained, and spicy/acidic/salty foods and drinks are best avoided, as they may irritate existing ulcers.' man i have a healthy eating habbit of hotsauce (i loved it), but i dont get the full effect of the pain on an ulcer until i brush my teeth-- it feels like it's being pulled inside out, and then burned with a blowtorch. it sucks. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.25.104.250_e874.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.25.104.250">75.25.104.250</a> (talk) 04:50, 30 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Remarkable page, confirms many deductions I made from experiment and it's hell of a lot more than a GP could ever tell me. I cannot believe that Marmite is seriously listed as a remedy. I did try this once (as a child), not sure why. It is highly acidic and will make a small ulcer develop rapidly into a giant seething cluster. Your pain level will go from annoying to debilitating.</p>
<p>More helpful would be to advise people to avoid consuming Marmite (in particular, Marmite is more acid than Vegemite and whenever I have ever had it, it created ulcers the same day).</p>
<p>I intend to delete from the article the sentence about applying marmite to the ulcer because I think it is liable to cause someone great pain sooner or later.</p>
<p>I suggest a caveat should be added as to antacids as well. I used to try using sodium bicarbonate, and the result, ulcers are blasted but a cut develops and one day that cut will develop back into an ulcer. More effective for me is simply to drink a little milk, wrinsing slightly.</p>

<p>Please stress that any food containing citric acid can bring on recurrent aphthous stoatitis in some people.Since I have been watching all food and drink labels, I have eliminated 90% of my mouth soars by eliminating all citric acid containing foods and drinks. All soft drinks seem to contain citric acid. I previously suffered from mouth soars (sometimes up to 10 at a time) almost every day. In regard to the location of this topic...How many people who have mouth soars know that it should be looked up under Aphthous Ulcer. I didn't know that term after having mouth soars for 40 years. The words where an item is located should be ones people would commonly look up.````<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ddailey2 (<a href="../../../d/d/a/User_talk%7EDdailey2_ce73.html" title="User talk:Ddailey2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ddailey2_5ab3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ddailey2">contribs</a>) 09:18, 11 February 2007.</small></p>
