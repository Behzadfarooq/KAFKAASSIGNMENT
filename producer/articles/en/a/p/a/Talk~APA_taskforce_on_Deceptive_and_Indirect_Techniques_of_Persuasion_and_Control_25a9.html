<dd>The task force was <i>formed</i> to investigate "brainwashing and coercion", forms of psychological abuse. How is this not directly relevant? In any event, as it is a psychological report, surely it should be contained within one of the psychological categories. I will offer a compromise and put it in a more general psychological category for the time being. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smeelgova</a> 02:24, 1 January 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I've changed the sentence regarding the summons to "The court summons issued in the case on behalf of Singer and Ofshe stated that the the rejection of the DIMPAC report was 'described by the APA as a rejection of the scientific validity of the theory of coercive persuasion'".</p>
<p>This is <i>all</i> that can be objectively reported. We don't know that this is Singer's language as opposed to her attorney's language. We don't know that Singer "acknowledged" anything.

<p>The BSERP is an APA board.

<dl>
<dd>BSERP thanks the Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control for Its service but Is unable to accept the report of the Task Force. In general, the report lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA Imprimatur.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The report was carefully reviewed by two external experts and two members of the Board. They Independently agreed on the significant deficiencies In the report. The reviews are enclosed for your Information,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Board cautions the Task Force members against using their Past appointment to Imply BSERP or APA support or approval of the positions advocated In the report. BSERP requests that Task Force members not distribute or publicize the report without Indicating that the report was unacceptable to the Board.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, after much consideration, BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient Information available to guide us In taking a position on this Issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Board appreciates the difficulty In producing a report In this complex and controversial area, and again thanks the members of the Task Force for their efforts.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is a letter of rejection. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 17:11, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The word "reject" or "rejected" is not mentioned anywhere in the finding, nor anywhere in any other citation. This is simply your own POV spin, and is not acceptable. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smeelgova</a> 17:13, 1 January 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>And I am concerned about the attempts to spin the nature of the BSERP decision. As stated in citations in other parts of the article already, researchers on both sides of the aisle still debate the true nature of the decision itself. I am glad that you feel that "not accepted" is a fair compromise. How is the section naming inconsistent and misleading? We are stating <i>exactly</i> the wording that the BSERP used. Is this not NPOV? <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smeelgova</a> 17:30, 1 January 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I agree that objective reporting requires that we use the language of the Board, They chose to use "does not accept" rather than the far more pejorative term "rejects". I'm sure they thought carefully about how they worded the memo, and that therefore they in fact deliberately chose to use the less pejorative term. As for the BSERP question, I've tried to follow the edits but I'm still not sure what that controversy is. Could someone be specific in explaining it to me? <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 20:04, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Smeelgova, read articles <i>about</i> the DIMPAC controversy. No one uses BSERP and no one uses "not accepted". All sources I found speak of a rejection by the APA. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Singer and Ofshe, the negative decision in the Fishman case set a precedent that meant the end of their lucrative sideline in providing expert testimony in criminal court. But that wasn’t their last word. Outraged, they were determined to retaliate. Alleging that Richardson and other cult-friendly scholars had manipulated the APA and the ASA into taking positions against the brainwashing theory, Singer and Ofshe filed a federal civil suit in New York City under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act in 1992. The suit named as defendants the APA and the ASA, as well as numerous individuals connected with writing the Molko-Leal briefs. Treating those staid, scholarly organizations as though they were the Mafia (which was the original target of the RICO law), the suit alleged a complex conspiracy involving the APA and the ASA’s statements in the Molko-Leal case; various pieces of correspondence among the parties that reflected negatively on Ofshe and Singer; and a 1987 <b>rejection by the APA</b> of a task force report authored by Singer and critical of the Unification Church.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even Singer supporters such as Amitrani and Di Marzio say "The main point of the document is this: the Memorandum expresses no official rejection of mind control theories, but only <b>rejects a report</b> drawn up buy a committee on the issue of mental manipulation theories as applied to New Religious Movements. This rejection was due to a lack of proper methods."</p>
<p>The Maryland Cult Task force documentation includes text such as "Contrary to what Mr. Loomis told the Task Force, this document is unequivocal in its <b>rejection of a draft report</b> submitted by Margaret Singer on behalf of the DIMPAC committee she chaired.</p>
<p>So, the report was rejected, and that is not POV pushing, is a fact and we should refer to it is as such. Also, you keep referring to the BSERP as it was not the APA, and that is incorrect. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 17:48, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that we are bound by those who choose the more pejorative term instead of BSERP's actual, probably carefully chosen, wording. As an encylopedia we should objectively report the facts, and the fact is that BSERP used "can not accept". <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 20:04, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please provide the links for these citations so that I may check them. And as far as the BSERP - it is clearly stated many, many times within the article that this is a division of the APA.

<dd>BSERP is not a "division" of the APA. BSERP is the board that commissioned and rejected the report. Do a search for "DIMPAC reject" in Google and any newspaper archive, Lexis Nexis, etc. There are many sources that describes is as it is: <b>a rejection of the report by the APA</b>. Note that the dispute is if the DIMPAC rejection means a rejection of Singer's theories or not. But no one, even Singer's supporters dispute that the report was rejected.

<dd>Singer and Ofshe claimed malicious intent on the part of APA and named defendants. That was the basis of the lawssuit.

<dd>I can believe it. I greatly respect Singer's work. I think that she pursued her expert witness activities out of a sense of compassion and activism rather than out of monetary motives. I think that she wanted to re-establish her expert witness status out those higher motives. However, also I think that she was a <i>much</i> better psychologist then she was a "legal mind". I think that she was extremely, even extraordinarily, ill advised to pursue that lawsuit; it was probably doomed from the beginning, and it just made things much much worse. She should have just taken her beating and moved on. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 23:02, 1 January 2007 (UTC) It's easy to have 20/20 hindsight though. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 23:03, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would prefer not to get too much into expressing opinions in talk pages, but I would say just this: The extreme position she took in the DIMPAC report, the lack of scientific research and the sensationalist, scaremongering tone of the report all contributed to a total dismissal of any validity related to the concerns about coercive persuasion as they apply to practices in some destructive cults (which are most probably correct). The DIMPAC report and the subsequent lawsuit, all contributed to the lack of solid research on the subject, as no scholar would touch the subject given the negative connotations that perspired during these years. The unfortunate result of the controversy regarding the DIMPAC, fueled by Singer's "conspiracy theories", is the extraordinary polarization of the subject since then and the little or no scientific research that would help clarify the subject. This polarization, IMO, is exacerbated by the use (and abuse) of the term "cult", "brainwashing", "mind control"as applied to groups that have none of these traits, as used by people as a political weapon in their fight against groups they oppose. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 23:56, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The report very accurately represents the "cult critic" position and IMO it is accurate. However, it was too much of a "leap", and way too much for professional collegues who hadn't lots of experience in the trenches on the subject to swallow. Being merely a "report" it couldn't go into the extreme detail that would have been required to support the arguments made. I can easily see why it was treated as being extreme and not "even-handed". In 20/20 hindsight it was too much to feed to the scientific community at one time. And the lawsuit just put nails in the coffin. So I agree that it must have had a chilling effect on any further research into the topic. The whole thing was a disaster.</dd>

<dd>And I'm sure that terms like "cult" are often misused. One extreme is to use such terms without careful consideration and intellectual rigor, the other extreme is not to use them at all. My big example is Scientology, which IMO is so extraordinarily dangers that it deserves label like "cult", because "new religious movement" doesn't at all convey the truth of the situation.
