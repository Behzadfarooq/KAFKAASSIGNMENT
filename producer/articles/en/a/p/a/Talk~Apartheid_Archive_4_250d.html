<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jewish settlement</span></h2>
<p>I've removed "European Jews" as 18th century settlers of South Africa. No reason to give them special mention, any more than we distinguish between Protestant Germans and Catholic Germans when we mention the German settlement. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 05:17, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>--The Jews themselves view their settlement in S. Africa as distinct from the Dutch, English, etc. See <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/South_Africa.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/South_Africa.html" rel="nofollow">Jewish Virtual Library</a></p>
<p>Located on the tip of the African continent, South Africa is famous for its diamond and gold mines. Cape Town, South Africa’s first city, was founded in 1652 by the Dutch to provide fresh produce and meats to the members of the Dutch East India Company, who were traveling between Europe and the Orient. In 1806, the colony switched hands and became part of the British Empire. Discoveries of gold and diamonds changed South Africa from an agricultural society to modern metropolis.</p>
<p><b>Jews have been a part of South Africa’s development from the very beginning.</b> Portuguese Jewish cartographers and scientists contributed to Vasco Da Gama’s discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1497. A number of non-professing Jews were among the first settlers of Cape Town in 1652, despite restrictions against the immigration of non-Christians.</p>
<p>Religious freedom was granted by the Dutch colony in 1803 and guaranteed by the British in 1806. Among the first British settlers to come to Cape Town were 20 Jews. The first South African Jewish congregation was founded in 1841 in one of the homes of the new British settlers. Eight years later, the first synagogue, Tikvat Israel ("Hope of Israel" - referring to the Cape of Good Hope) was established in Cape Town and is still standing today.</p>
<p>Jews prospered during the apartheid era and were more educated than their white counterparts. More than 50 percent of the Jews were matriculated, compared to the average 23% in the total white population. Ten percent of the Jewish community had university degrees, compared to only 4% of the total white population. Jews were disproportionately represented in the commercial and financial sectors of society. The Jewish population peaked in the early 1970's reaching nearly 119,000 people. <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/South_Africa.html#Apartheid%20Regime" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/South_Africa.html#Apartheid%20Regime" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<dd>While Jews were present in the earliest settlement, their presence was not particularly significant in the early stages. They were tiny minorities for most of that time; they only really immigrated in significant numbers in the 20th century, and even then they never exceeded 3% of the European population of South Africa. One could also claim that Brazil and the United States were founded by Jews, based on tiny numbers of Jews (mostly <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marrano.html" title="Marrano">marrano</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sephardi.html" title="Sephardi">Sephardi</a>) that settled in those countries in the 17th and 18th centuries, but this would be a misleading view of their numbers, impact, and significance. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 15:02, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The math is pretty clear. Even at their peak numbers -- 119,000 -- that represents around 2% of the European population of the time. They barely show up as a blip, demographically. So what if they were more educated etc.? Now, if the anon is trying to make a point that Jews were complicit in apartheid in South Africa, feel free to present evidence for that. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 15:41, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Jayjg: There were many people of all races involved in anti-apartheid activities, not just the small group of Jews that you mentioned. This does not however diminish the fact that European Jews actively participated in the Apartheid regime as Whites, politically and economically, same as the "English", "Dutch", "Germans", etc. that are mentioned. Jayjg, one must be truthful and look at the issue from the perspective of the Blacks who considered the Jews as White, and a part of the Apartheid regime.

<dd>Why should we single out Jews for special mention when speaking of European immigrants anyway? To me that sounds rather biased, almost as if your intention is to overemphasize the role of Jewish South Africans in perpetrating Apartheid, which is rather unnecessary considering the fact that they formed such a miniscule proportion of the White population. Also, I see nothing in Jayjg's comment that even looks remotely like minimising the role of other races in the Anti-Apartheid Movement. In contrast, all I see is a point (a valid one, might I add) that there were many prominent Jews in that movement. For instance, from the same source you got your quote from, comes the following: "An example of individual Jewish involvement in anti-apartheid movement is the arrest of 17 members of the African National Congress, in 1963, for anti-apartheid activities, all five whites arrested were Jewish." This is in contrast to your own comment, where you claim that they "were a part of the apartheid apparatus" (so was virtually anybody living in SA at the time, technically), while seemingly completely ignoring the fact that a decent portion of the community was involved in Anti-Apartheid activities. While it's true that as a whole, the Jewish community did not speak out against Apartheid (since when has the South African Jewish community, or any other ethnic community for that matter, had one voice on any issue?), in 1985 the South African Jewish Board of Deputies (without a doubt a very important organisation) passed a resolution rejecting Apartheid. So it's not quite true to insinuate that the community as a whole was quiet. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 18:29, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nobody is singling out anybody. It's being more accurate and inclusive. It is the Jews themselves that saw themselves as distinct from the English, Dutch, Germans, etc. Would it be more accurate to say Lithuanian Jews? like the South African Jews do amongst themselves? In being inclusive and factual, it does not overemphasize anything, that is only your interpretation. 119,000 people is not "miniscule". It sounds like you are being anti-semitic in diminishing the accomplishments and contributions of Jewish people to South African history. S. Africa's Jewish community has always been one that Jewish people have taken pride in. There were many White people involved in anti-apartheid activities on a worldwide basis. The emigration of Jews out of South Africa is directly and statistically correlated to the decline of the apartheid regime of which many were a part of. Let's not make a special exception here. History is history and "Jews" were involved in apartheid right alongside the "Dutch", "English", and "Germans".69.216.245.115</p>
<dl>
<dd>The sentence you quoted was from a website whose subject was, quite specifically, the history of Jews in South Africa, so the distinction of which you speak would obviously be valid on such a page. It is, however, not valid here. Regardless of the achievements of South Africa's Jewish population, which has occurred on a scale dwarfing their relatively small population size, the fact remains that as a percentage of the White population they are too statistically insignificant to be afforded such a prominent place in the article. After all, you might as well start to write a demographics article about South Africa then, breaking down in detail every type of immigrant group that established themselves in South Africa. I would suggest it would look rather farcical to have the article distinguish between Protestant and Catholic Germans, and do the same for the Dutch and the others. Quite simply, the opening paragraph for the section on Apartheid's history only lists the MAIN White immigrant groups to South Africa, for it is their descendants who naturally formed the majority of South Africa's White population. We don't mention the Irish, Italian, Belgian or Portuguese immigrants for this reason. Therefore there is no reason to specifically mention European Jews in that intro paragraph.</dd>
<dd>I also find it ironic that you accuse me of apparent anti-semitism, and yet you are the one who automatically assumes that those Jews who have emigrated from South Africa post-1994 have done so "because of the decline of the apartheid regime of which many were a part of". On the contrary, there are numerous logical reasons for any South African Jew to leave South Africa, including a significantly increased violent crime rate. So I now have to question your motives, as your automatic assumption that Jewish emigration is motivated, at least in part, by racism, and your continued effort to attempt to list the South African Jews as major perpetrators of Apartheid, absence proper evidence to the contrary, do not seem to be the hallmarks of a neutral editor.</dd>

<dd>Your points are all quite valid. In addition, I might point out that South African Jews were not just "involved in anti-apartheid movement", but were prominent leaders of it, often at considerable personal risk to themselves. I'm also interested in understanding our anonymous editors claim that "from the perspective of the Blacks" Jews were considered "a part of the Apartheid regime." Does he have evidence of that? Is he speaking for South African blacks?

<dd>Sorry, what does your response have to do with my post? South African Jews were not just "involved in anti-apartheid movement", but were prominent leaders of it, often at considerable personal risk to themselves. Where is your evidence that "from the perspective of the Blacks" Jews were considered "a part of the Apartheid regime." Does you have evidence of that?

<dd>I see you refused to reply to my statement. Quite simply, the intro lists the MAIN European immigrant groups that formed the White population of South Africa. Including the reference to European Jews is POV because it makes it seem that they had a disproportionate role in dominating the indigenous population. Including such a small group as the Jews in the intro would only make sense if one then included ALL white immigrant groups, such as the Italian, Irish, Polish, Portuguese etc. As you can see, it would quickly become unworkable, which is why, in the interests of accuracy and neutrality, we should only list the main groups, which are German, French, Dutch and English settlers.

<p>Gentlemen: Overbearing is better applied to those who would delete and deny the existence and reference of the Jewish community in South African history. It is not anywhere near "unworkable" to include the European Jews, along with the Italian, Irish, Polish, and Portuguese, if you like, in the one sentence in the article. Please.</p>
<p>It is absolutely accurate to say: "South Africa was settled by the Dutch, Germans and French from the 17th century onwards. European Jews and the English followed in the 19th century.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Non-Revisionist Jewish History</span></h2>
<p>19th Century</p>
<p>The discovery of diamonds in 1867 in Kimberly <b>attracted Jewish entrepreneurs and businessman from all over the world.</b> (Diaspora Jews) Because of the extensive Jewish trade network, Jews immediately became involved in the diamond and precious stones industry. Two famous Jewish South African entrepreneurs were Barney Barnato and Sammy Marks. Barnato founded the De Beers Consolidated Mines for mining diamond fields.</p>
<p>First Half of the 20th Century</p>
<p>During the Boer War, Jews served on both sides, although the arrival of English Jews helped out the British side. Some Boers harbored prejudices against the Jews, while others felt a kinship toward them. In 1902, the British defeated the Boers and, in 1910, they formed four British South African colonies. <b>The British gave the Jews equal status to the other white citizens</b>, giving British authority legitimacy among Jews.</p>
<p>Following the mining boom, Jews became part of the rapid industrialization of South Africa. They became involved in food processing; clothing, textile and furniture manufacturing; insurance; hotel management; advertising and entertainment. Jews also established supermarkets, department stores and discount store chains.</p>

<dd>Yes, small numbers of Jews emigrated to South Africa in the 20th century, along with all sorts of other Europeans. So what? Small numbers of Jews emigrated to to almost every country in the world in the 20th century.

People will not submit to this intimidation by a biased group. jayjg ought to be banned for complete and utter bias, at least at a minimum from this article henceforth. Read the facts. There were many Jews along with the 1) English, 2) Dutch, 3) French, 4) Germans, and 5) other European settlers (that jayjg has no problems listing) that played an active role in the economic and political history of South Africa. To deny that Jews were active in politics and economics in the history of S. Africa is pure revision.

<dd>The main immigrants were the Dutch and French, and later the English. I have no problem mentioning Europeans, because there were indeed small numbers of other Europeans. I don't see the point in mentioning the many sub-groups of Europeans, though, as that is trivia. I especially don't approve of mentioning only one particular sub-group of Europeans, purely for the purpose of POV-pushing. As for trying to "contribute" to Wikipedia against a "gang", when 9 separate editors revert your edits, it's time to start realizing that your "contribution" detracts from the article, rather than improving it. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:25, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jayjg, enough already. You don't "see the point", because you have a POV or a blind spot or something. The contributions of Jews to South Africa are numerous. Jews make up a minority/small percentage of every single country in which they dwell but Israel, but should we not acknowledge their contributions and presence in the histories of the USA? Britain? Canada?, Germany? etc? Jayjg, you are so POV it is laughable. On Wikipedia you want to push a POV that is Jewish-centric when you think it helps your bias, and you want to deny and revise on other occasions like this one.</p>
<p>The Jews were heavily involved in the highly exploitative diamond and mining industries during apartheid, and well as highly active in politics and business. The Jews themselves saw their community as strong and distinct from the Europeans. Fact and History. That's the way it was. Reread history and I have provided you a Jewish source!

<p>With the institutionalization of apartheid agenda, anti-Semitism was no longer a major issue.

<dd>Give it up already, anon. <i>You</i> are citing biased sources (the <b>Jewish</b> virtual museum, remember?), <i>you</i> have made your your bias towards the inclusion of Jews at the cost of obfuscating the article quite plain. Wikipedia operates on consensus, which you are not gaining, not through either your edit warring or your arguments. Insulting the users here certainly doesn't give you a moral high ground or make others more amenable. Think about that.</dd>
<dd>I suggest you come up with a new tactic if you wish to convince others of your opinion. One which isn't aggressive, and one which can be debated and fleshed out to gain a suitable standard for inclusion. Those are, unfortunately, the breaks, especially for articles on such a delicate topics as apartheid. <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewet_832c.html" title="User:Dewet">Dewet</a> 06:24, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Dewet: I have continually pointed to the facts, and I have been on the receiving side of the insults. "Thanks for all your laughs." The facts are above in bold. The inclusion of the Jewish community to the list of prominent ethnic groups in S. Africa's economic and political history is warranted and backed up by history. The inclusion under discussion involves one sentence in the whole article. This inclusion in no way skews the other facts or history or content of the article in a major way. Think about that. Let's start the debate already. Not one person, you included unfortunately, can provide any reasonable evidence that the Jewish community was not an integral part of S. Africa's economic and political landscape as the inclusion states. Raw numbers and statistical percentages never tell the correct and whole story, and that argument can be dismissed out of hand.69.209.236.191 15:02, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>So, to summarise: "Actual facts and figures, such as statistics, do not tell the story as I want it to be told, so we should ignore them. I believe in what I am doing, despite all arguments to the contrary, and anybody opposing me is just part of some POV-pushing gang, a revisionist and a denialist." - Yep, I think that's a close enough approximation. Anon, let me summarise our rebuttal for you: This is the article on Apartheid, not on South Africa. Therefore, any additions, or unwarranted attention given to any group, is inherently POV unless completely justified. The main European groups to move to South Africa were the Dutch, French, German and English, the descendants of these early colonists make up by far the majority of South Africa's white population. The number of European Jews that emigrated to South Africa are relatively small, and in fact are similar to the numbers of Italians, Portuguese, Irish and other groups who emigrated to SA. In order to make your inclusion fair, we would have to list each and every immigrant group that ever moved to SA in such numbers - a proposal that any logical person can see will be both unwieldy and unnecessary. In addition, I have to ask why you must separate European Jews into their own category. Were they not British, French, German, Italian etc? Judging by your proposals on this page, we had best start saying: "European Jews, Protestants, Catholics, Pagans, Atheists, Agnostics etc etc etc and the English followed in the 19th century." - Why can you not grasp how patently ridiculous this is? <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 17:21, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Impi: you again? I was hoping for an unbiased, third-party contributor and not another one of your POV buddies. I can see this is going nowhere fast. You continue to avoid and evade the matter at hand: Kindly provide any reasonable evidence that the Jewish community was not an integral part of S. Africa's economic and political landscape as the inclusion states. Let's review the inclusion: "South Africa was settled initially by the Dutch, Germans and French from the 17th century onwards. English, Diaspora Jews and other European settlers followed in the 19th century. As was typically the case in the African colonies, the European settlers dominated the indigenous population through military and political control and the control of land and wealth."</p>
<p>Why cannot you grasp that this is inclusive and accurate? S. Africa was settled by Dutch, Germans, French, English, other Europeans (Irish, Portuguese, Italians) and Diaspora Jews. Is this not a fact? What is your problem? It is not accurate to include Diaspora Jews in with the "Europeans" because history proves they were considered separate and distinct as an ethnic &amp; religious group, it is confirmed by Jewish history and S. African history. Were there not different laws for "Europeans" and Jews in S. African history (answer: Yes), and then later the Jewish community was classified White during apartheid (answer: Yes)?</p>
<p>So: 1) They were seen as separate and distinct groups, so the inclusion is accurate and clear. 2) you cannot whitewash the activity and everyday complicity of the Jewish community during apartheid, right alongside the rest of the list of distinct groups. The Jews were heavily involved in the highly exploitative diamond and mining industries during apartheid, and well as highly active in politics and business. With the institutionalization of apartheid agenda, anti-Semitism was no longer a major issue. Jewish/Israeli involvement in the apartheid era was mixed; <b>as a whole the South African Jewish community did not speak out against the apartheid system</b>.

<dd>It's rather amusing to see you accusing other editors of being unbiased, Anon... Oh, and you forgot to sign your comments again. What's the matter? Afraid of being accountable for what you say?</dd>
<dd>The Jews fall easily under the "other European settlers" definition, just as the other groups do. They were European, and no different to any other European groups. By your logic, we should include other religious and ethnic groups too, for why should we differentiate between Jews, Catholics, Protestants etc?</dd>
<dd>Your only claim for the Jews being considered "separate and distinct" is a website that deals specifically with Jewish history. Of course that website is going to speak about Jews as separate and distinct, that's their chosen subject matter. Honestly, this is like taking a magazine article written about Rubens Barrichello and using it as proof that Rubens is separate from and distinct to the other F1 drivers...</dd>
<dd>In fact, for the entire history of South Africa as a country, Jews were subject to the SAME laws as other whites in South Africa. There were no separate laws for Jewish South Africans. Additionally, so what if they were classified as white? So were the Japanese immigrants - should we now add them to the awfully long list you seem to want to include?</dd>
<dd>This article is not the place to discuss the demographics of South Africa's population. That is all covered under the demographics section of the South Africa article, and it has NO place here.</dd>
<dd>The Jewish community was no more complicit than any other white group in South Africa, and in fact I'd say Jewish groups did the most of any of the small ethnic groups to try end Apartheid. For its size, the Jewish community produced an extraordinary number of anti-Aparthed groups and activists. Compare this, to say the Portuguese, Irish or Italian communities, who seldom if ever even expressed discomfort with the system.</dd>
<dd>Anon, your comments are sorely lacking in facts, and everything you have written on this page draws me to the conclusion that your sole motive is not historical accuracy but rather an attempt to pen the blame for a large part of Apartheid on the shoulders of the South African Jewish community, completely out of proportion to their actual involvement.</dd>

<p>"The discovery of diamonds in 1867 in Kimberly <b>attracted Jewish entrepreneurs and businessman from all over the world.</b> (Diaspora Jews) Because of the extensive Jewish trade network, Jews immediately became involved in the diamond and precious stones industry. Two famous Jewish South African entrepreneurs were Barney Barnato and Sammy Marks. Barnato founded the De Beers Consolidated Mines for mining diamond fields."</p>
<p>In 1902, the British defeated the Boers and, in 1910, they formed four British South African colonies. <b>The British gave the Jews equal status to the other white citizens.</b></p>

<dd>Haha, you have accused virtually every editor here of blatant Pro-Jewish bias, and in fact your last five or so comments regarding Jayjg and SlimVirgin have been nothing but ad hominem attacks. Yet now you complain that you're the victim of same? Get real, you haven't received half of what you've dished out. For the record, I have replied to your points in at least one post above, but you seem fond of ignoring such replies.</dd>
<dd>I also note you refer to the matter under discussion as "your deletion", implying that this is something I alone am pushing. This is incorrect. What is under discussion is an addition to a previously stable article that YOU and you alone have proposed, an addition which is opposed by at least five other editors. In short, consensus is not on your side, and your attempts to make it seem that we're the ones against consensus is laughable.</dd>
<dd>The only source you have quoted is the Jewish Virtual Library, a website dedicated to the history of Jews. As such, of course they speak of Jews as a distinct entity - that is their subject matter. This does not however mean that Jews at the time were distinct and separate. For example, there are a number of articles written about, say, Afrikaners in the Union Defence Force during World War II. These articles focus on Afrikaners, which may make it appear that they were a distinct and separate entity within the UDF, but such an impression is misleading as in the UDF itself there was no distinction made between English and Afrikaans South Africans. The same applies to the current situation: The Jewish Virtual Library speaks of Jews as a separate and distinct entity because the Jews of SA are their chosen subject matter in this article, but in South Africa at the time Jews were treated no differently under the law to any other White groups.</dd>
<dd>So what if the diamond and gold mines attracted many Jews? They attracted many, many more immigrants from other ethnic and religious backgrounds as well. This article will not mention them, becuase, as mentioned before, it is focusing on the history of South African Jews, not on the overall history of South Africa.</dd>
<dd>Your source also mentions that Jews were given equal legal status in 1910. Well, here's a history lesson for you: Prior to 1902, there were four separate countries within the region that would one day become South Africa. These were the British colonies of Natal and the Cape, and the independent Boer republics of the Transvaal and Orange Free State. Within the latter two states, only Boers were allowed to be citizens and thus have the rights of citizens (like voting). So ALL non-Boer Whites, whether they were Jewish or Irish or whatever, were discriminated against. Now, in 1910 the Union of South Africa was formed under an Afrikaner PM. This new state consisted of four provinces (Natal, Transvaal, the Cape, the Orange Free State), and enshrined equal rights under the law to ALL Whites. It was not as if it was suddenly decided that Jews had lesser rights and therefore needed to be made equal - the Jews always shared the same rights as non-Boer Whites and thus were elevated to full legal equality at the same time the Irish, Russian, English, American etc immigrants were.</dd>
<dd>Finally, we speak about the comment that: "as a whole the South African Jewish community did not speak out against the apartheid system". My answer to this is: So what. Not a single ethnic or religious group in South Africa was unanimous in its condemnation of Apartheid, not even any of the Black South African groups (after all, Black South Africans joined the SADF and were deployed to the SWA-Angola border, and some Black leaders from all the groups collaborated with the Apartheid government to run the Homelands). So when you tell me that the Jewish community as a whole did not speak out against Apartheid, I ask with incredulity whether you actually consider that to be damning evidence...</dd>
<dd>In fact, considering its size, the South African Jewish community probably spoke out against Apartheid more than any other of the White groups in South Africa. For example, a large proportion of the White anti-Apartheid campaigners were Jewish (Helen Suzman, Ronnie Kasrils, Ruth First, Joe Slovo, Arthur Chaskalson and Harry Bloom are just a few that come to mind). In addition, the South African Jewish Board of Deputies issued a declaration condemning Apartheid in 1985, which is something none of the other minority White groups (such as the Portuguese and Italians) did.</dd>
<dd>Really, there's nothing more to debate here. You insist on using a source that focuses on one ethnic group as evidence for the wider history of SA, which is quite patently absurd, and furthermore you continue to modify the article in contravention of the consensus - which is clearly against you. Kindly expend your efforts elsewhere, as it is clear that your POV addition to this article is not accepted by the majority of editors involved. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 23:24, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Impi, I think you are still missing the point: Clarity. Here's the list in the article that you so "vehemently" object to:
<blockquote>
<p>"South Africa was settled initially by the Dutch, Germans and French from the 17th century onwards. English, other European settlers, and Diaspora Jews followed in the 19th century."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it. So......in other words if the term "European settlers" stays in, then someone might not otherwise know that S. Africa had an important, thriving Jewish community also. To list the Jewish community alongside the other groups is being factual and inclusive, and it's adding clarity to the article. How can you not see that? You have to look at the statement/change itself. Since when is adding minor clarity (2 words) to an article a massive rewrite or throwing it off NPOV? It is not. It adds simple, concise and accurate clarity and you know it. Read the sentence again. I believe you are reading far too much into it. The Jewish community existed, separate and distinct from the Dutch, Germans, French, English and other Europeans. You know it. How is that so objectionable? It's being clear. A Jewish community did exist and does exist, separate and distinct, and that's all the 2 word Inclusion states.<a href="../../../a/m/y/User%7EAmYisrael_d277.html" title="User:AmYisrael">AmYisrael</a> 00:53, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jewish settlers in south africa had to profess their allegiance to Christianity. However, after 1803, they were free to express their religion. Numbers have the jews at around 100,000 in the 70 and 80's population of s. africa. Apartied policies could not have been influenced by such a small population of people. To make such allegations without substantial proof is borderline criminal. Your anti-semitic issues are prevelant. Here is a short list of aparteid leaders, please tell me which are jewish: President PW Botha, J.B.M. Hertzog, DF Malan, J.G. Strijdom, H.F. Verwoerd, B.J. Vorster.</p>
<p>In contrast, historically, the afrikaaners were german sympathizers post ww2. One with an intelligent understanding of geopolitics could easily see the anglo-saxon(german) racial bias, ie: nazi type ideology. Pro christian, pro white. To say jews were outright leaders of aparteid would contradict history. My personal opinion, you are trying to tie in racial prejudice of the aparteid regime to the current Israeli political status, very devious. --PrinceMarko 14:42, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Your personal opinion is dead wrong. How dare you. The Inclusion states no such thing, and nothing even close to it. You have a strong personal bias and it shows. You do not have a crystal ball into the minds of others. Kindly refrain from ad hominem illogic and your personal opinion, and stick to the Inclusion at hand, which is not false and does not discuss current Israeli politics in any way, shape or form. The inclusion is about who settled South Africa. Diaspora Jews were one of those groups. That a simple fact. It really is interesting to see Deletionists deny that simple fact, a two-word inclusion.

<p>It seems to me that the person commenting on the Jewish diaspora in South Africa at the time of apartied has a bias against them. Historically, the jews in south africa have been very very few. To insinuate that they were major players in Apartied is juvenile.</p>
<p>"Persons of Jewish descent found their way to the Cape from the earliest beginnings of white settlement. However, they could not be professing Jews before the beginning of the 19th century because the Dutch East India Company's rules required that all who were in its service at the Cape must profess the Reformed Christian religion. Only after freedom of religion was introduced at the Cape under the Batavian republic in 1803 was it possible for anyone who openly professed his/her adherence to the Jewish faith to live in the country.</p>
<p>From that time onwards a small trickle of individual Jews, for the most part from England and Germany, began to arrive. Some remained permanently, while others later returned to their home countries. There were among them colourful and adventurous personalities.</p>
<p>In 1841, seventeen Jews organised the first Hebrew Congregation in Cape Town. They named it Tikvat Israel Congregation (the Hope of Israel). By the end of the 1860s, several hundred Jews were living in South Africa. They played a significant part in cultural and civic life and added materially to the country's economic progress. Some had settled in remote places. A number lost their identity as Jews."</p>
<p>Only around 100,000 jews were in South Africa during the 70's and 80's. Such numbers cannot even begin to influence a society enmasse, especially on social/political issues. PrinceMarko</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jews as part of White Ruling Class in South Africa</span></h2>
<p>According to many observers, the South African Jewish Community had become by the end of the First World War, the wealthiest Jewish community in the world on a per capita basis. Nor was the "size" of the Jewish minority, as Rabbi Dr. Andre Ungar observed, a true reflection of the position of the Jews in South African life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"it would be a grievous mistake to underestimate the significance of the Jewish minority. Even purely numerically speaking, under the absurd rules of South African arithmetic, the size of the Jewish population constitutes a factor necessary to reckon with...in the two main cities, Johannesburg and Cape Town, the Jews constitute one-tenth of the citizens "that count": the Whites."

<p>jpgordon, provide your reasoning for Deletions. Two words added to the article provide clarity that would not otherwise exist. Other European settlers and Diaspora Jews should not be combined. Why should they? Be an inclusionist. Wikipedia should not be changed if it means knowledge will be lost (unnecessary deletions). The subject at hand (deletion) on this article reduces the clarity and diminishes facts. Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, it is not limited in size. Unless you can provide any basis for the Deletionism, it will not stand. There is nothing objectionable about the facts: "South Africa was settled initially by the Dutch, Germans and French from the 17th century onwards. English, other European settlers, and Diaspora Jews followed in the 19th century." That statement is TRUE.

jpgordon, Let's recap the following, since you have misunderstood Wikipedia:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Wikipedia is the the free-content encyclopedia that ANYONE can edit. Wikipedia is a WikiWiki, which means that anyone can easily edit any unprotected article and have those changes posted immediately to that page. EVERYONE can edit pages in Wikipedia — even this page! Just click the edit this page link at the top of any page (except for protected pages) if you think it needs any improvement or new information."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"You don't need anything special; you don't even need to be logged in. We (on Wikipedia) don't individually try to "own" the additions we make to Wikipedia. We are working together on statements of what is known (what constitutes free human knowledge) about various subjects. Each of us individually benefits from this arrangement. It is difficult to single-handedly write the perfect article, but it becomes easier when working together. That in fact has been our repeated experience on Wikipedia."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Systemic bias "Wikipedia coverage is heavily biased by the sorts of people who want to contribute to it. This seems to be a perfectly legitimate concern. Certainly, Wikipedia coverage is patchy. It's easy to find examples of a really long article on one subject, whereas another, equally important subject, has a very short article. Sometimes this is just the result of a single enthusiastic contributor. Other times it is due to systemic bias."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Editability "Wikipedia articles are extremely easy to edit. ANYONE can click the "edit" link and edit an article. Peer review per se is not necessary and is actually a bit of a pain to deal with. We prefer (in most cases) that people just go in and make changes they deem necessary. This is very efficient; our efforts seem more constructive than those on similar projects (not to mention any names). Wikipedia is open content, released under the GNU Free Documentation License. Knowing this encourages people to contribute; they know it's a public project that everyone can use."</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, are you trying to tell me that a group of Deletionists, that have not proven the Inclusion untrue.....makes the Inclusion False? The Inclusion is fact and it is true, and it should not be removed due to bias. Until the Inclusion is proven false, it should remain. Wikipedia is about seeking the facts, not protecting consensual or systemic bias. Reread again jpgordon. Unless the Inclusion is false, which it is not, it should remain. Using the rationale of the Deletionists, we might as well remove the French from the list, and also the Germans, and "other European settlers". This is not a good idea, as it deletes fact and history. The Diaspora Jewish community is significantly distinct from the others on the list, and it ought not be deleted.<a href="../../../a/m/y/User%7EAmYisrael_d277.html" title="User:AmYisrael">AmYisrael</a> 14:53, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but then what should we do with the list: Dutch, Germans, French, English, other European Settlers, Diaspora Jews? How can any of these groups be listed and with others removed without claiming bias? They were all considered "White" and profitted under the apartheid system.

I want to give you all a chance to work this out without edit warring, and that means trusting you all to make the right decisions without Big Brother looking over your shoulder. For that reason I took the unusual step of reversing Slimvirgin's protection of this article. I do not take Amyisrael's last revert as evidence of bad faith--his stated reason seems to suggest a willingness to discuss. However if the edit war resume to any great extent then protection would again be in order.

The original "Dutch" settlers of South Africa surely had an ethnic mixture similar to those that founded <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Netherland_d534.html" title="New Netherland">New Netherland</a> (later greater New York City and the Hudson Valley). There included the Dutch, but there were also many French and Walloon <a href="../../../h/u/g/Huguenots.html" title="Huguenots">Huguenots</a>, refugees from anti-Protestant persecution, whose religious beliefs were nearly identical to those of the Dutch Reformed Church and were readily asimilated into Dutch culture and economic life. Many of the Germans were soldiers hired by the Dutch settlement organization, and as late as the 17th century the distinction between Dutch and north German was slight. There were English settlers in Holland escaping the religious persecutins between Protestant groups. With a smattering of other Europeans (Scandinavians and more Germans) they settled the Dutch colonies. They themselves all assimilated into the Dutch way of life.</p>
<p>To say that under Dutch rule that the "French did this, the Germans did this, the English did this" becomes absurd. The white settlers of South Africa became a melting pot in their own right, and one can't compartmentalize people by ethnicity after the melting pot starts assimilating people into one common culture. That culture was clearly Dutch even if genealogies indicate that some Afrikaner has little Dutch ancestry. --66.231.38.97 2 July 2005 05:47 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would first like to explain that the anonymous editor solicited my attention on my <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthewcieplak_c298.html" title="User talk:Matthewcieplak">talk page</a>, because I am listed at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Inclusionist_Wikipedians" class="extiw" title="m:Association_of_Inclusionist_Wikipedians">m:Association_of_Inclusionist_Wikipedians</a>. Second, I would like to commend both Jayg and the anonymous editor for not descending into total absurdity as they debate their points, using references and making cogent arguments.</p>
<p>About the argument: I am not qualified to say whether the inclusion of references to Jewish settlers who did not oppose apartheid is strictly relevent; it certainly seems superfluous. It may be factually true, and is ostensibly providing more information, but this does not qualify it for inclusion into an article about apartheid. This does not explicitly exclude it from the article, but so often on wikipedia are there claims of pro-Jewish propaganda that I am inclined to think the anonymous editor is being disingenuous and, as Jayg said, "pushing a POV." However, a quick glance at Jayg's edit history and talk page reveals that he/she edits many a page related to Judaism, perhaps provoking the anonymous editor's suspicions.</p>
<p>The argument itself is not one of inclusionism versus deletionism, or trivia versus history, it is about maintaining both neutrality and usefulness. If we were to include every ethnicity and religion of settlers of South Africa, the article would be staggeringly overblown, and make retreiving useful information a nightmare. To say that South Africa was simply settled would again be useless. To include relevant information about the background of settlers is to acheive usefulness, but to include disingenuous information or exclude relevant information is to unbalance the neutrality of the article. Because this is such a fine line, no one editor should tread it alone. Hence we have talk pages and community consensus.</p>
<p>In this particular case, Jayg was appointed an administrator because he tends to make reasonable decisions, according to the WP community (or cabal, as some would have it). Also, other editors have supported him in this argument, and so do I. Therefore, the community decision is to exclude the information about Jewish settlers on this page. This edit war should never have gone on this long, and I hope that the anonymous editor will let the community decide and focus his/her efforts on other, more productive projects on WP.</p>
<p>So my recommendation to both Jayg and the anonymous editor is to take a break from this page and let those not so personally involved make educated decisions about neutrality. I once again commend both of you for your hard work and patience, and your dedication to your causes. But remind yourselves that editing should be fun, not pain. Wikipedia is outrageously fun, and edit wars are lame. If this continues, it may end up on <a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">WP:LAME</a>, and nobody wants that. Two words, after all, should not be that important to either party. Sorry for the length. I hope this helps. - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewcieplak_612b.html" title="User:Matthewcieplak">Matthew Cieplak</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthewcieplak_c298.html" title="User talk:Matthewcieplak">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matthewcieplak_8a4d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matthewcieplak">(edits)</a></sup> 05:35, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Matthew, thank you. I thank you for your level-headed approach to this. However, this has been exactly what I've been trying to convey in my previous reasonings here — albeit not so eloquently, maybe — but which seems to have just fallen on deaf ears. You can take a look at the history of this page — the amount of arguments here must be spanning over 200k so far, and shows no sign of abating. It boggles the mind how such a silly thing can be so vehemently fought for.

If there's anything ad hominem about the argumentation here, it's your allegations of collusion and malfeasance; besides consensus, another principle of Wikipedia is <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, which everyone else here is doing (which is why we're not treating your behaviour as vandalism or trolling). It doesn't take any back-channel conversations. And, yes, anyone can click the edit link and edit an article; in the same way you independently want to put in your change, a large number of other editors don't want it in. Your cries of "censorship" are mistaken (though hardly novel); this is called "editing", the very definition of which implies cutting unwanted material. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 00:09, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Include them if you like, but I believe they are covered by "other European Settlers". The inclusion is not "blame Jews for Apartheid". Nice try, but the Inclusion states Diaspora Jews settled in S. Africa in the 19th Century. That's it. Your paranoia POV is astounding. Read the words and please comprehend what they actually state, not what you "think" they might mean if you don't read them correctly. Are we blaming the French for apartheid by saying they were settlers? Also, the Jewish community in S. Africa was significant, there are plenty of references that have been provided substantiating it. Kindly read the Inclusion, do rely on ad hominem attacks accusing me of POV. The words are what they are, the facts are what they are also. 69.221.60.181 22:45, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>My strongly held POV is that there is an excessive unjustified and unjustifiable effort by a single anonymous editor to include "Diaspora Jews" in a list of immigrants as somehow distinct from "other European Settlers". It would appear that pretty much everyone else but you agrees with me. Incidentally, please stop capitalizing "diaspora" and "settlers"; neither are proper nouns. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 23:29, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>

The Diaspora Jews were separate and distinct from other European settlers. Why do say they are the same? That makes absolutely zero sense. However the Europeans did classify the Jews as "White" during the apartheid era. 4) Your disdain and POV comes through loud and clear, but please note the last sentence of the paragraph of Diaspora Jews:[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew#Diaspora_.28outside_of_Israel.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew#Diaspora_.28outside_of_Israel.29" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>].

<li>Thank You <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> for pointing out Jayjg's gross oversimplifications and misstatements. He isn't fooling anyone with ad hominem attacks, in lieu of discussing the subject Inclusion at hand. He can ban all the user names he wants, but it really just smacks of censorship. The Inclusion really boils down to this: Is it trivial or not? If not, then since it's accurate and fact, it ought not be deleted. It is not trivia. Clinton's shoe size is "trivia", but saying that Diaspora Jews settled in S. Africa is not "trivial", it's factual history and we all know it. If another person says that the Inclusion blames Apartheid on the Jews, well that's just so far off-base, it doesn't deserve a response. The Inclusion does not state that.69.221.60.181 23:06, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>If no more than two words can be said about it, it probably <b>is</b> trivial, at least concerning apartheid. It may not be trivial concerning the Colonisation of South Africa or the geography of the diaspora. Ultimately, I recommend merging the history section of this article into the History of South Africa and merging most of the apartheid section of that article into this one.

Regarding the diaspora Jewish community in S. Africa during 19th and 20th Centuries, more can be written about it, than say "the French" for instance. There are volumes of material written about Jan Smuts and Chaim Weizmann and Israel and S. Africa's Jewish community, so it isn't trivial. Alot more can be written about it than about the "Germans" or the "French". How can anyone say the South African Jewish community is trivial?

<p>Explain just how many sources you need to justify that "diaspora Jews settled in South Africa in the 19th Century". I mean how can you possibly justify that statement as false to be deleted? It's just ridiculous. The 2-word inclusion does not blame the Germans or the French or the Jews for Apartheid. It discusses the fact that a distinct Jewish community (that is not, never was trivial) existed alongside the rest of the list. The debate is just gotten so twisted it need to refocus on the inclusion at hand. Geez. 69.221.60.181 20:06, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you read the archives of discussion on this particular article, you'll see that most of the discussion is about the Jews. Is there any factual base for this? Not really. But unfortunately (for WP), there is a noisy fringe, eager to use it as a soapbox and push their pathetic POV, which in this case happens to be <i>blame the Jews</i>. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens"></a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">Talk</a> 05:39, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

To me living in South Africa there are far more Muslims than Jews. And being a english speaking white South African, I was not directly responsable for aparthied BUT I benefited from it by getting a good education while the majority of the people didn't. I know quite a few Jews who fought against aparthied but most of the Jews being white like me also benefited by the system. So you can't lay the blame of Aparthied at the feet of Jews, but at the feet of the whites, even me who got something out. I was so protected growing up that I didn't even know what was going on. During my forced 2 years in the army in the 80s threw me into the thick of things. I am thankful that South Africa has become the "Rainbow Nation". This nation of ours is a miricle. Now stop this mud slinging about who is to blame and get on with making this article a good and informative --<a href="../../../j/c/w/User%7EJcw69_dff3.html" title="User:Jcw69">Jcw69</a> 12:47, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>1) The text does not "blame" or "sling mud" at the South African German, French or Jewish communities. Have you read the subject text we are discussing? This has been covered already. Seriously. Please read the issue at hand, there is no blame being placed on the French or the Germans or anyone else. There is no POV text preceding or following anything we are discussing. There is no "blame" being placed anywhere. Read the text. Can you justify that accusation? Thank you for saying: "most of the Jews being white like me also benefited by the system." However, that's not the issue at hand, although many want to make it such, that's not what the text states.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2) To have a meaningful googletest, the query should be put in quotes, otherwise you pick up issues about for instance, Germany and France and S. Africa as distinct modern day countries, not the "South African Germans, etc." which is what we are trying to discuss. If you google South Africa Israel you get <b>39,300,000</b> which is the highest number yet. That is not the right analysis, don't you agree? 69.209.193.213 29 June 2005 06:10 (UTC)</li>

Thank You <a href="../../../j/c/w/User%7EJcw69_dff3.html" title="User:Jcw69">Jcw69</a> for contributing to the discussion. In any case, it appears that the relative and actual amounts of Google Hits shows that the South African Jewish community is indeed a meaningful one.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> Using that same logic: The article as it stands says <b>"blame the Germans and French"</b>. Do you have a problem with that? I haven't heard you say such a thing so far, why bring it up now? However, the inculsion does not blame anyone and it doesn't contain the word blame. You, Jpgordon, Jayjg and maybe a few others with a "POV" are the ones that introduced the word "blame" into this discussion and nobody else has.

<dd>Oh this is absolutely pathetic. Dewet is completely correct, you're a waste of time, Anon. When the disputed portion of this page was written, it was decided to include the four MAJOR European immigrant groups. Every single piece of literature you read on South Africa's White population is unanimous that the vast majority of white South Africans descend from these four European countries/groups. What you are attempting to include is POV because it implies that South Africa's Jews formed a much greater proportion of the white population than they actually did. This is not a matter of inclusionism vs deletionism, this is a matter of historical accuracy, and attempts to avoid misleading statements. We have laid out comprehensive rebuttals to everything you have claimed above, yet you have yet to respond in a meaningful way to any of it, instead lashing out with insults and irrelevent statements. So, until you prove yourself to be an editor in good faith, and work to build consensus instead of attacking everybody who disagrees with your unilateral inclusion, nobody will take you seriously (and for good reason). Also, until you do so, I refuse to argue further for the time being, as consensus has already been established and it is CLEARLY against you. I see no need to continue wasting my time. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 16:01, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> There is no consensus except ad hominen illogic against me, instead of looking at the issue. I am editing in good faith. Most editors, that have dipped in for a quick comment, have not followed the discussion in its entirety to the logical conclusion, or contributed to it in anything other than a reactionary way.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, the rebuttal used was that the Jewish community was/is trivial, that has been proven false. There are <b>13 times more hits</b> than for the French or German. Other POV rebuttals dishonestly claimed the edit placed "blame", when it clearly does not. Then we have historical accuracy. The subject edit is historically accurate. Read the text. That argument is proven false as well.</p>
<p>So the only reason you can come up with now is: "when first written, it was decided to include the four major groups". Oh, 4 only. says whom? as determined by? that's set in stone forever on a Wiki project? [Impi], seriously, why do you think Wikipedia should simply copy and duplicate orthodoxy, and not progress? Wikpedia is not limited in size. Maybe you should be selling paper encyclopedias. ;-)</p>
<p>Every single piece of literature you read on South Africa's White population is unanimous that diaspora Jews settled in South Africa in the 19th Century, and that the Jews were classified as White during the apartheid era.</p>
<p>The subject edit is true and non-trivial and in no way places blame on any group. Please stop deleting the contribution to the article. The rebuttals have not withstood scrutiny.69.221.60.181 16:56, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>That's subjective and inconsistent. Kindly explain when, in your opinion, a Googletest is applicable and when it is not. It cannot be based on whether the results are "to your liking". Consistency should be applied, which Jayjg does not. Thanks.69.209.210.198 2 July 2005 10:55 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, you might want to have Jayjg <i>get right on his mission</i> and go correct the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sol_Kerzner_b144.html" title="Sol Kerzner">Sol Kerzner</a> page where <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> is listed before <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian.html" title="Russian">Russian</a>.

<ul>
<li>Please sign your comments. Also, google hits do not indicate the relative influence or importance of the community, but the amount of attention they receive on the internet. It is especially suspect as there is a large number of anti-semetic sites who would tend to inflate the relative prominence of Jewish people in any historical setting of discrimination, and there is a much smaller level of animosity towards these other particular groups of Europeans. These sites' brazen opinions render them essentially useless as sources of factual information, as they make no claims of neutrality. Consequently, the google hit argument does not prove that the Jewish settler community was any more influential than any other community. Just to clarify, I am not accusing you of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitism.html" title="Anti-semitism">Anti-semitism</a>. However, you have not provided any <i>neutral</i> sources which demonstrate that the South African Jewish settler community was influential enough in sustaining <b>Apartheid</b> to warrant its specific inclusion in the article. To include it without such evidence implies wrongly that it is documented and in WP for a reason, and the the Jewish community had a more significant, sustenant influence than any other ethnic group which goes unmentioned. - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewcieplak_612b.html" title="User:Matthewcieplak">Matthew Cieplak</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthewcieplak_c298.html" title="User talk:Matthewcieplak">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matthewcieplak_8a4d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matthewcieplak">(edits)</a></sup> 22:12, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewcieplak_612b.html" title="User:Matthewcieplak">Matthew Cieplak</a> Oh, I see. A Googletest is only applicable when it supports your position, when it does not, then let's toss it out? The numbers do not lie. Matthew, have you read any of the 9,000 google hits? They do not appear anti-semitic in any way. Calling them "brazen" is yet another example of the fact that most people haven't reviewed this discussion in detail, and are simply editing in a reactionary way. Review the 9,000 google hits, and tell us what you conclude. The rebuttal was that the contribution was "Trivial". That has been proven false, so why delete it? Those who would delete have provided no justification for their position. If we are going to have to talk about the so-called "blame" once again, (which the text does not), where is the outrage over including the French or the Germans? There is no blame being placed in that text, that issue is dead and a red herring anyway. The Google test is a great indicator that the Jewish community is noteworthy (relative or otherwise) in the history of White S. Africa during the 20th Century, and the results are off the charts supporting my position. What do you have to suggest otherwise? 69.221.62.82 18:13, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC) Can I get a barnstar now?!</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I tried. I suppose I should have taken the advice not to feed the troll, but better late than never, eh? Anyway, my closing statement is simply to say that you haven't provided any counterarguments or refutations of my points (or anyone's really). Since you insist on arguing, in the face of the Wikipedia principles you claim to be defending, this is my last rebuttal: Certainly the Jewish community was <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/pop/2000/00000034/00000004/art00004" class="external text" title="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/pop/2000/00000034/00000004/art00004" rel="nofollow">noteworthy</a> but your way of including it without context is inadequate and implies responsibility. Also, French and German probably should not be in that list alone, as you said. To conclude: trolling, scouring people's talk pages and getting offended when "enemies" of yours are noticed for being nice isn't the way to start getting barnstars. Also, having a username would help you get noticed for your efforts, and so would being patient and keeping a neutral tone, even on talk pages. I do hope you'll stick with the Wiki and make some great contributions. I'm sorry if I've offended you, though I imagine you would not argue this vehemently and determinedly if you didn't enjoy it a little bit, so I doubt you'll mind. Also, I'm unwatching this page as this debate is sort of pointless, so any comments directed to me would best be left on my <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatthewcieplak_c298.html" title="User talk:Matthewcieplak">talk page</a>.

<li>If we continue dragging this forever (which you seem to be interested in), there will be more hits. By your theory, this would bring you more legitimacy.

<p>You should not drag it on then. The facts are clearly laid out.69.209.222.92 29 June 2005 05:19 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>2) The google sites are anti-semitic. They are not.</li>
<li>3) The google sites are brazen. They are not.</li>
<li>4) Not enough neutral sources. There are over 9,000 google sources to choose from, with more if you widen the search by removing the quote marks.</li>
<li>5) Deletion of the French and Germans also. Thank you for seeing the inconsistency. If one had followed this discussion and revert war in its entirety, one would see that some of the exact same editors who reverted back the removal of the French and Germans (i.e. made sure they were on the list), would not allow the diaspora Jews to be accurately represented and included. Thank you for noting the inconsistency. I believe none needs to be deleted, as the text does not place blame and is historically accurate, despite the relative irrelevance the googletest attributes to the Germans and the French.0</li>
<li>6) You had concerns about "no evidence". There is simply no evidence to conclude that the opposite is true. Kindly read the text being discussed. The Germans, French, Jews, Dutch, and English did settle in South Africa, and their history and communities in the 20th Century were not trivial. There is plenty of "evidence" to support it. Again, 9,000 google hits should be enough evidence for anyone.
<ul>
<li>See above. You failed to bring any serious evidence. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens"></a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">Talk</a> 28 June 2005 21:31 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>7) trolling, scouring, etc. That is a two-way street. Have you noted the flagrant attempts at censorship? the tracking? then the reverting, all across Wikipedia, providing no reason or justification on Talk pages? I am not naming names, I believe we know who practises this against targeted others.</li>
</ul>
<p>How can you say your concerns were not addressed? Thank You.</p>
<p>Also, refutations have been provided against:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) The contribution is "trivial". It is not, see googletest results.</li>
<li>2) "placing blame" The text does not place blame of anyone, including the French and Germans.</li>
<li>3) Ad hominem illogic against the hated Anon--(me) does not make the subject text false. Let's try to remember that.</li>
<li>4) The text does not "single out". The text already included a list.</li>
<li>5) "biased" sources. There are many existing Wikipedia links that support the subject text. I can link them all if needed. Plus there are 9,000 Google hits. Just what would be an acceptable source, if these are not?</li>
<li>5a) A few whining editors objected to using a Jewish source as "biased". That cannot be true. Correct me if I am wrong but doesn't Wikipedia contain multiples of links to Jewish sources and organizations in a variety of other articles on this encyclopedia? Will those links be likewise discredited as biased? Gee, I suspect not.</li>
<li>6) the text "obfuscates" and "destabilizes" the article. False also. The subject text is 2 words, that represent fact, with no POV text following or preceding it. Hardly destabilizing.</li>
<li>7) the text lacks "historical accuracy". It does not lack accuracy. That is big-time false.</li>
<li>8) "relative minority". Not one person has provided population figures about the German and the French communities, from an unbiased source, this entire time.</li>
<li>9) "Raw numbers." Can go both ways. Using raw numbers for up/down might not always the best indicator as you mentioned. Using raw population figures could be meaningless, for the precisely same reasons a googletest might be determined meaningless. It's subjective. If raw numbers are bad, then we cannot use the population argument. So, which of the two numbers tests are we going to allow, and which will be tossed? That seems POV, does it not? I think a Googletest is a far more meaningful indicator than relying on raw population data, that's why a googletest exists on Wikipedia and people use it, to provide insight and meaningful interpretation to otherwise bland, nondescript data.</li>
<li>10) "good faith". I have edited and discussed in good faith. I did have to avoid censorship a few times, but it was the censors that lacked the good faith.</li>
<li>11) Seriously, with brevity, is there anything that I missed? Thanks. 69.209.222.92 28 June 2005 19:40 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You once again miss the point by a large margin, anon. Nobody is claiming that Jews did not emigrate to South Africa, nor is anybody saying that they exerted no influence. The point all those reverting you have made is that South Africa's Jews form a statistically minute portion of the population, and the influence the community posesses is nothing compared to that which the main white group of Protestant origin has. To repeat myself for what feels like the hundredth time, the vast majority of South Africa's white population descends from British, Dutch, French and German (mostly Protestant) immigrants. For example, the official South African government information site says: "The white population descends largely from the colonial immigrants of the late 17th, 18th and 19th centuries - Dutch, German, French Huguenot and British." <a href="http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/demographics/population.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/demographics/population.htm" rel="nofollow">1</a>, and the demographics statistics from the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_South_Africa_2d8f.html" title="Demographics of South Africa">Demographics of South Africa</a> article has the following: "86.8% of White residents are Christian, 8.8% have no religion, 0.2% are Muslim, 1.4% are Jewish, and 0.0% are Hindu. 2.7% have other or undetermined beliefs."</dd>
<dd>As you can see, even the official SA govt information page on South Africa lists only those four major groups. It does not say: "diaspora Jews", it does not say: "various groups of Irish, Italian and Portuguese immigrants". Instead, as is the situation here, it highlights only those four groups. So are you now going to accuse the South African govt of pro-Jewish bias and propaganda the same way you've attempted to besmirch the reputation of some of your fellow Wikipedia editors?</dd>
<dd>Frankly, I don't see why this entire debate is still ongoing. The opposing arguments have been set out comprehensively more than once, only to be ignored completely by you, and consensus, which was reached weeks ago, is clearly against you. If you cannot handle the fact that Wikipedia operates by consensus, then go somewhere else where your unilateral insertion of POV statements is wanted. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 29 June 2005 08:06 (UTC)</dd>

An effort has been underway to spin off the relevant part of the history article (which is overly long) into this article, but has been stalled because of the revert war and protection. I don't think any purpose is being served by having the article protected right now. There has been plenty of time for discussion on the talk page, and the discussion has been unproductive for the reasons given in Dewet's "don't feed the trolls" post above. If there was any hope that this extremely long revert war was going to go away once people had a chance to calm down, I think that hope has vanished. I think the article should either be unprotected, or, better yet, be marked for a vfd, since it's redundant, dysfunctional, and not up to the same level of quality as <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_b4a8.html" title="History of South Africa">History of South Africa</a>.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 21:42, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

We are discussing demographics in 2 sentences in the article.

<dd>Anon, I find it ironic that you're attempting to use my sources to prove your point, because they actually prove the opposite. Your contention all along has been that not including "diaspora Jews" alongside "French, German, British and Dutch" is POV (and essentially unique to the editors involved here), as well as that the Jewish population of South Africa is statistically significant enough to warrant inclusion in this article. As my sources pointed out, the <i>officially accepted</i> way to describe the origins of South Africa's White population is to say that they descend mostly from Dutch, English, French and German colonialists. Religion is not mentioned, because it is not relevant. In fact, the only reason I quoted figures for religious groups in my second source was to point out to you just how tiny the South African Jewish population is when compared to the overall white population.</dd>
<dd>So, in sum, the only wording I will accept is: "South Africa was settled initially by the Dutch, Germans and French from the 17th century onwards. English and other European settlers followed in the 19th century." Anything else is irrelevant to the article, and should not be included because to do so would be POV in that it would overemphasize the importance of certain groups in propagating Apartheid. ::You know, this really is getting a bit tiring, Anon. Please accept that the consensus is against you, and move on. You will continue to be opposed here and reverted on the article itself not because of some conspiratorial "revert gang" plot against you, but because every single other editor involved with this article has disagreed with the inclusion you wish to add. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 29 June 2005 23:13 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seven or eight editors reverting you is actually a huge group by Wikipedia standards; that's not "abusing the spirit" or "avoiding the rule", that's consensus in action. If you could get anyone else here to agree with you, you could play that "game" too, couldn't you? But you clearly can't, since the consensus is overwhelmingly against your edits.

<dl>
<dd>No it should not, religious data belongs in demographics articles, it need not pollute every single article relating to South Africa because it is irrelevant. That little intro piece is only intended as a brief introduction to the origins of South Africa's White population. The vast majority by far of the population, something like 90% of it, descends from early Dutch, English, German and French immigrants and colonialists, and so any other groupings, whether they be Jewish, American, Italian, Irish or Martian, are statistically insignificant and should not be added. If an article exists that details the specific history of South Africa's White population, only then perhaps would such inclusions be notable as they would be relevant to the subject matter. As it is, using your inclusions on this article and others relating to South Africa would be akin to pointing out on all shoe articles that a certain model of shoe has exactly 1323 stitches, or perhaps like pointing out on all pages dealing with celebrities that Sean Connery has exactly 18 nosehairs. Could either of those be true? Certainly (though I doubt anybody knows how many nosehairs Mr Connery has). Could such inclusions be defined as factual? Yes, nobody could dispute the facts of those. However, such inclusions would not be relevant, and could actually be POV for highlighting a specific issue/group/fact far in excess of its actual importance.</dd>
<dd>Your additions are not relevant, and they appear to be an attempt to assign a far greater responsibility to Jews for creating and sustaining Apartheid than they in fact had. For this reason, though the inclusion is technically factual (as my previous examples are), it is POV and inaccurate for overemphasizing the size and therefore importance of the South African Jewish population, and therefore myself and many other editors will continue to oppose it. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 29 June 2005 23:13 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> "Pollute" is an interesting choice of word, and what's with that nosehair analogy? But what's the alternative text that works? The text should provide more, not less, information to the reader (that's the whole point), and it should be accurate and brief. It should recognize the settlement groups and be inclusive of the Protestant Europeans -- (Dutch, French, Germans, English), the Catholic Europeans -- Portuguese, Irish, Italians), and the Jews. The following text adds information to the article, remains brief and accurate, and it recognizes the relativity of populations, does it not?:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><b>"South Africa was settled initially by the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_people.html" title="Dutch people">Dutch</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germans.html" title="Germans">Germans</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_people.html" title="French people">French</a> from the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a> onwards.

</ul>
<p>It's a simple sentence that provides improvement and clarity to who comprised the Whites in the 20th Century. It recognizes the relative numbers but doesn't completely omit information to the reader that the Googletest proves is not trivia. It's an improvement to the article. The religious info would provide more information, and I don't think it "pollutes" to have it in there, but <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impi.html" title="Impi">Impi</a> what do you think of the text now (with religion removed)? The new text doesn't blame or highlight, it takes into account the concerns of all editors, it doesn't change the content of the article, but most importantly, it accurately informs the reader.69.209.210.198 1 July 2005 19:57 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">From the RFC Request</span></h2>
<p>I'm not Jewish, but have great respect for the broad river of humanitarianism, respect for learning, and socialism that began with the 'one-foot Torah lesson' of Rav Hillel (alav hashalom) and came out of the shtetls in a tidal wave during the late 1800s/early 1900s.</p>
<p>Apart perhaps from very secular Jews--and I mean <i>very</i> secular--Jews see themselves as a people apart, much as the Amish do. So I don't see a problem in calling out their immigration in the same way other distinct groups are called out. It would be the same if a group of Amish or Japanese or Jivaro had immigrated to SA--the number is less important than the fact that this is a group that chooses to set itself apart.</p>
<p>That's my take, anyway. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatzenjammer_c526.html" title="User:Katzenjammer">Katzenjammer</a> 29 June 2005 20:44 (UTC)</p>
<p>May I offer another take on it, which clarify matters a little?</p>
<ul>
<li>In the context of Apartheid, race has great importance. So, much as I find it offensive to do so, it is not possible to discuss apartheid without mentioning race. Much of the debate above is entirely at cross purposes: one side is arguing that Judaism is simply another religion, the other that Jews are a distinct ethnic group. Nationality is thrown in to muddy the water.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Two "races" migrated from north of the Sahara to South Africa: Caucasians and Semites. The Caucasians were Christians [Protestant (Dutch Reformed, Presbyterian and Anglican), Orthodox and Catholic], the Semites were primarily Jewish, with tiny numbers of Muslims. These races (and religions) also had Nationalities. So there were Caucasian and Semite English, Caucasian and Semite Dutch, German etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Before the migration, the Caucasians considered themselves to be the Master Race, genetically superior to the Semites. After the migration, they still considered that to be the case, but made the Semites 'honorary whites' (at some level) and both superior to the Negro. (I told you that this would get offensive). <i>Some</i> Christians and Jews opposed apartheid (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Biko_5ef5.html" title="Steve Biko">Steve Biko</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desmond_Tutu_a927.html" title="Desmond Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth_First_ec25.html" title="Ruth First">Ruth First</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Slovo_1fd2.html" title="Joe Slovo">Joe Slovo</a> being the more well known among them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So it is accurate to say that Europeans and Semites went to SA. It is accurate to say that Dutch, English, Germans etc went to SA. It is accurate to say that Christians and Jews went to SA. What is <b>not</b> encyclopedic is to mix these categories at will.</li>

<dd>I doubt that there is any valid scientific justification for your two racial categories, Caucasian and Semitic. Modern genetic studies do not generally provide any support for the objective biological existence of traditional racial classifications. When you say, "I hope that moves the discussion forward," let's keep in mind that a clear consensus has already been established on this issue. The discussion moved forward, and was completed, a long time ago.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 30 June 2005 20:37 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree totally. That is why I began "much as I find it offensive to do so".

<li>What's valid is the historical justification and distinctions. This is not the place to discuss genetics. Semites were not considered European, but they were made honorary Whites. The Jews were relevant as a distinct group in the 20th Century in SA.Peri2 30 June 2005 21:26 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Can you bring forth any verifiable sources for this assertion? Semites are considered a subrace of Caucasians by every definition of the term I've ever read that treats "semites" as a "race". More often, however, "semites" refers to speakers of a group of related languages without reference whatsoever to "race". <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> July 1, 2005 00:01 (UTC)

<li>OK. Now, what is the relevance of this to the insertion that's the source of the now two month old deadlock -- the relative importance, or lack thereof, of the miniscule 19th-century Jewish component of European settlement in South Africa towards the history of apartheid in South Africa? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 1 July 2005 15:44 (UTC)

I am supporting the view that the intro should mention Nationality OR Religion OR "Race" and NOT to mix types. So I guess that makes me a "Deletionist", but I had hoped to break the impasse by tackling it from a different perspective. Clearly I haven't done so. I'm sorry if this was all discussed in an earlier archive.

<dd>You've demonstrated categorically that, looking at the percentage of Jews in the White population, to wit, 1.4%, there is no justification in including the Jewish immigrants in any discussion about dominant contributions to "White culture" in ZA. As for the google test being highly significant, as I've already pointed out several times, the ZA Jewish community is historically important when discussion Jewish issues, which is why there are so many google hits. Look at what the "hits" link to instead of just counting them. At the same time, since you've pushed the issue, we now have the numbers to demonstrate that the Jewish community was a miniscule part of the White community, and was not sufficiently influential in shaping its character, to warrant mention <i>in this article</i>. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> July 1, 2005 18:34 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, <i>your</i> version is pushing a specific POV: that the Jewish community was an integral part of White society in ZA. It does not <i>omit</i> the Jewish community, it, rather, selects to not mention a very small minority that was <i>never</i> integrated into White ZA society, as evidenced by the fact that ZA is, to this day, the diaspora community least affected by assimilation and is, in fact, the diaspora community that has maintained the highest rate of Orthodox observance. While the European Jews may have been classified by the Apartheid system as "Whites", that is not an important aspect of Apartheid. Nobody has revised or diminished the existence or relevance of the European Jewish community (the only Jewish community of ZA you seem to care about inserting mention of, every which kittywumpus way) in ZA, nor elsewhere. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> July 2, 2005 00:46 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Intellectual Dishonesty and Revision</span></h2>
<p>It is clear that a few biased editors have no problem including "other European Settlers" on the list, but want to skip over the fact that the Jews were considered white in 20th Century South Africa also. Kindly explain why you don't object to the inclusion of other "European Settlers"? There hasn't been one peep of an objection. What were the relative numbers of "European settlers" that are acceptable for the list? How do they compare?</p>
<p>Jpgordon, is right, and his opinion reflects historical accuracy to say that the "other European settlers" and "diapora Jews" considered each other separate in ethnicity. That is manifested today in the fact that a European-descended South African wouldn't be given citizenship in Israel. The Jewish community sees a distinct difference, and it's backed up in historical fact going both ways.</p>

<p>Thanks for the input.

It's totally POV, and the googletest is off-the-charts supporting the inclusion in the text, which once again, is accurate and truthful.

<p>Charles P.'s suggestion is excellent. There is a clear consensus that the current text does not need to be "improved" by adding a reference to Jews. The current text does need to be improved in many other ways, and that can't be done if it's only unprotected for a few hours every month. The problem is that regardless of how many good suggestions like Charles P.'s we get, all it amounts to is feeding an anonymous troll who has shown no intention of making any constructive contributions to wikipedia or of doing any real research.

<dd>Exactly. Anon's consistent insistence on listing European Jews as separate from other Europeans is intensely POV, and what's more his addition implies that Jews formed a much greater proportion of the White population than they in fact did. Jayjg's modification of my original compromise wording is the best and most elegant solution, and should be the one that remains in the article. Consensus is clearly against Anon, and further insults on his part shall not change that. A miniscule 1.4% of SA's white population is Jewish, the rest consists overwhelmingly of descendants of German, French, Dutch and English settlers. What's rather amusing actually, is that Anon uses the Google test to try and prove to us that there are few French and German South Africans, but plenty of Jewish South Africans. This is an oxymoron, and also evidently the argument of one who is less than familiar with the history of South Africa. It's a basic and widely-known fact that the French, German and Dutch colonists gradually assimilated into one another to form the Afrikaaner people, something attested to by the sheer amount of French surnames in Afrikaans families (Olivier, De Klerk, Le Roux, etc). Furthermore, I agree, it really is unfortunate that an anonymous editor can paralyse an article in this way. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 2 July 2005 21:36 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"Wikipedia is the the free-content encyclopedia that ANYONE can edit. Wikipedia is a WikiWiki, which means that anyone can easily edit any unprotected article and have those changes posted immediately to that page. EVERYONE can edit pages in Wikipedia — even this page! Just click the edit this page link at the top of any page (except for protected pages) if you think it needs any improvement or new information."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>"You don't need anything special; you don't even need to be logged in.</b> We (on Wikipedia) don't individually try to "own" the additions we make to Wikipedia. We are working together on statements of what is known (what constitutes free human knowledge) about various subjects. Each of us individually benefits from this arrangement. It is difficult to single-handedly write the perfect article, but it becomes easier when working together. That in fact has been our repeated experience on Wikipedia."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Editability "Wikipedia articles are extremely easy to edit. ANYONE can click the "edit" link and edit an article. <b>Peer review per se is not necessary and is actually a bit of a pain to deal with.</b> We prefer (in most cases) that people just go in and make changes they deem necessary. This is very efficient; our efforts seem more constructive than those on similar projects (not to mention any names). Wikipedia is open content, released under the GNU Free Documentation License.

<dd>If what you say were true, none of the votes on the Wikipedia, especially Votes for Deletion, would be valid. Fact is, most decisions on articles on Wikipedia are taken through finding consensus, whether this be between 3 editors or three hundred. What these votes are is a measure of what the editors <i>involved with the article in question</i> believe is the best option. Clearly, all the editors who have been involved in this article over the past month or so are against your inclusion, which means consensus has been reached against you.

<p><b>Miscellaneous commentary:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>This immobile discussion has gone on long enough. My sense is that there is a single anonymous (and rather cantankerous) editor who is attempting to insert a specific (albeit unspecified) POV into the article, and that EVERY OTHER EDITOR WHO'S PAYING ATTENTION TO THE DISPUTE IN QUESTION disagrees with the editor in question as to the relevance of the specific information said editor repeatedly insists needs to be inserted into the article for "accuracy" and "inclusivity". Since discussion has not resolved the issue in the form of either side convincing the other, I propose this vote so that we can, all of us, vote to demonstrate consensus (or lack thereof) and move forward for at least two months to more productive activity than bashing each other over the heads with the same, by now, tired discussion points. I say, for now at least, let's vote and have done with it for 2 months and move on. WHICHEVER "SIDE" WINS, I say that UNLIMITED daily reverts, WP policy notwithstanding, in favor of the winning position be permitted for the specified period, and that any questions by admins whose "help" is sought to block those reverting to uphold this decision, be referred to this vote and discussion, and that such admins take both seriously. This argument has consumed FAR more time and effort than should be necessary to resolve such disputes. Should this vote be characterized as an attempt to squelch a POV, let me be perfectly clear: THIS VOTE IS DESIGNED TO SQUELCH, FOR THE SPECIFIED PERIOD, THE "LOSING" POV. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> July 3, 2005 08:01 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>YES, THIS VOTE IS DESIGNED TO SQUELCH, and censor the facts of the settlement of South Africa, especially in the 19th and 20th centuries. Wikipedia is not limited in size. The improved text (two words) improves the accuracy of the article, and takes into account the concerns of all editors, except those that want to <b>totally delete/withhold accurate information</b> "just because they don't like it". It's not about being on a losing side. It's about honesty, accuracy, and historical fact.</p>

<dd>I had a quick look at <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_South_Africa_2d8f.html" title="Demographics of South Africa">Demographics of South Africa</a> and I cannot agree with some of the figures mentioned, i.e. the population of Bloemfontein compared to Vereeniging! Never ever can the population of Vereeniging be almost the same, even more than Bloemfontein! Maybe with all the surrounding towns of Vanderbijlpark, Sasolburg &amp; Meyerton (called the Vaal Triangle), included but not Vereeniging alone! Just compare the changes that user:152.163.100.203 on 17 June 2005 has been made on his/her own previous edit to the population levels of the two cities – cut it almost by halve! Ridiculous, where did these statistics came from? Is that the whole population of the two cities, or only a certain group? Who checked it?</dd>
<dd>OK, that’s a different case and must be treated seperately, but you claimed that the Jews should be mentioned on said article. Where? I cannot find any mentioning of Jews in <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_South_Africa_2d8f.html" title="Demographics of South Africa">Demographics of South Africa</a>! Anyway the Jews, however a small percentage of the South African white population, have made major contributions to the development of South-Africa, politically but especially economically, and virtually in all facets of life. To mention a few, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_Barnato_99b2.html" title="Barney Barnato">Barney Barnato</a>, the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Oppenheimer_2e90.html" title="Harry Oppenheimer">Harry Oppenheimer</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sol_Kerzner_b144.html" title="Sol Kerzner">Sol Kerzner</a> and many more. In fact, there are several Jews in leading positions in the politics of SA at this present moment; therefore I agree with user 69.219.53.138 that they are worth mentioning in this article. Without that, the article will be incomplete and inaccurate!</dd>

<dd>Clarification: this comment was not signed, and appears to be by the same anon.

<li>This will be taken by some people as ducking the issue I know but, looked at from the PoV of the people whose land was taken by force of arms, it is rather irrelevant from which European tribe they came. So how about: <b>"South Africa was colonised by European settlers from the 17th century onwards. The early settlers spoke Dutch and German, later settlers followed in the 19th and 20th centuries, speaking English, French, Yiddish, Russian and other European languages"</b> --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_King_2192.html" title="User:Red King">Red King</a> 5 July 2005 14:49 (UTC).</li>

<dd>That's just a re-hash of the same trivia in an attempt to make is more palatable, and it's original research to boot. Do you know what the prevalence of language spoken by immigrants to South Africa was? Even if you did, why on earth would it be relevant to and article about <b>Apartheid</b>? It might have a place in a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Languages_of_South_Africa_6069.html" title="Languages of South Africa">Languages of South Africa</a> article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 5 July 2005 15:09 (UTC)

<dd>It's an attempt to try again from a different perspective. Yes, your counter-argument is valid <b>but</b> the logical conclusion of your position is that <i>all</i> the colonists' original nationalities are irrelevant and so the <i>only</i> NPOV opening para is <b>"South Africa was colonised by European settlers from the 17th century onwards."</b>. Drop the dutch, the german, the english and then you have a reasonable basis to drop the diaspora jews. Otherwise you don't. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_King_2192.html" title="User:Red King">Red King</a> 5 July 2005 16:45 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The Dutch, the Germans, and the English were the very heart of the history of apartheid in South Africa.

<p>Oh, what happened to the "French"? The diaspora Jews settled in South Africa. Reread the text. It does not say blame the Jews, which is the <b>ONLY</b> issue you care about, not facts, not truth, not historical accuracy, nothing else but your biased POV.</p>
<p>Thank you. Jayjg is still here pushing his POV, that has already been disproven. The Jewish community was considered white, and it was a relevant and notable community in the 20th Century. The 17th Century Germans and French, that Jayjg dishonestly demands be on the list, were much less significant as political or economic entities during the 20th Century in South Africa. This the Googletest proves with flying colors. After all this time, nobody has addressed the inequities of the text as it relates to "the list" until now, even after many requests. So thank you for contributing and not joining a kangaroo court. Not one person has addressed the history of <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Smuts_4a11.html" title="Jan Smuts">Jan Smuts</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaim_Weizmann_e21e.html" title="Chaim Weizmann">Chaim Weizmann</a> and the political implications and issues that resulted during the apartheid era. Irrelevant? Maybe to some with a history of POV. The improved text is accurate, fair and inclusive. The amount of denial and POV by a few problematic editors, lasting over 2 months, in the face of mountains of information and thoroughly researched and footnoted data, is staggering.69.209.239.161 5 July 2005 17:12 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is not a new proposal, it's a reiteration of the same intellectually vacuous arguments that the anon has been repeating for months, and that have already been rejected by a clear consensus of the editors who are interested in this article.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 5 July 2005 17:16 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's the same empty rhetoric you've been using for months. Empty. It adds nothing, it contributes nothing. Address the issues raised, just one time. 69.209.239.161 5 July 2005 17:19 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have addressed the issues raised, just one time. It's just that, unlike you, I don't crapflood the talk page by repeating the same arguments over and over.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 5 July 2005 17:24 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--Why don't you try taking a stab at some text that <b>all</b> editors can agree with? that is fair and accurate and doesn't omit information to a reader? 69.209.239.161 5 July 2005 17:28 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thus far, only editor <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> has attempted to improve the text. Many other editors have popped into the discussion offering suggestions also. However, certain Jewish POV editors <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> , <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a> have abused the open collaboration effort have used censorship and supressed the facts, and have not offered a text that avoids dishonesty. 69.209.239.161 5 July 2005 14:15 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please <b>work to provide an improved text</b> below in lieu of censorship and POV:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Crapflooding</span></h2>
<p>"This page is 211 kilobytes long. This may be longer than is preferable; see article size." It seems obvious to me that the anon is trying to distract attention from the vote, by cutting and pasting the same arguments over and over again, in an attempt to crapflood this talk page. Maybe if he can get the vote to scroll way off the top of the screen, he can keep people from noticing that the consensus is overwhelmingly against him, and that all his arguments have already been debated extensively, and haven't convinced anybody. To feed this troll right now just encourages him. --<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 5 July 2005 17:31 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are the troll. Personal attacks are against Wikipedia policy. Please try contributing (one time) some text that all can agree with. Please make an attempt.69.209.239.161 5 July 2005 17:53 (UTC)</p>
