<p>Please reread:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Wikipedia is the the free-content encyclopedia that ANYONE can edit. Wikipedia is a WikiWiki, which means that anyone can easily edit any unprotected article and have those changes posted immediately to that page. EVERYONE can edit pages in Wikipedia — even this page! Just click the edit this page link at the top of any page (except for protected pages) if you think it needs any improvement or new information."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>"You don't need anything special; you don't even need to be logged in.</b> We (on Wikipedia) don't individually try to "own" the additions we make to Wikipedia. We are working together on statements of what is known (what constitutes free human knowledge) about various subjects. Each of us individually benefits from this arrangement. It is difficult to single-handedly write the perfect article, but it becomes easier when working together. That in fact has been our repeated experience on Wikipedia."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Editability "Wikipedia articles are extremely easy to edit. ANYONE can click the "edit" link and edit an article. <b>Peer review per se is not necessary and is actually a bit of a pain to deal with.</b> We prefer (in most cases) that people just go in and make changes they deem necessary. This is very efficient; our efforts seem more constructive than those on similar projects (not to mention any names). Wikipedia is open content, released under the GNU Free Documentation License. Knowing this encourages people to contribute; they know it's a public project that everyone can use."</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Your opinion will be given the most weight if you are logged in with an account that already existed when the nomination was made. Anonymous and new users are welcome to contribute to the discussion, but their votes may be discounted, especially if they seem to be made in bad faith.</li>
<li>Please vote only once. If there is evidence that someone is using sock puppets (multiple accounts belonging to the same person) to vote more than once, those votes will not be counted.</li>

<li>That's false. This is a kangaroo court with no standing. Even Bishop <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desmond_Tutu_a927.html" title="Desmond Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a> himself could not vote according to the rules this little group has set up: <i>This vote shall not consider anonymous IP addresses, nor registered wikipedians with fewer than 500 edits not directly related to this issue prior to June 30, 2005</i>. <b>Unacceptable.</b> Unless <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> says this proposal is acceptable, then forget it. Work to provide an improved text, please do not allow censorship or ad hominem illogic.

<li>This does not discriminate against anonymous editors, it discriminates against anonymous editors whose grasp of the fundamental policies that make the Wikipedia run smoothly is in legitimate doubt. It is, perhaps, poorly worded, however, in expressing that, since this wording eliminates consideration of <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohanL_bdcd.html" title="User:JohanL">JohanL</a>'s vote (&lt;sarcasm&gt;haHA! censorship at work! how convenient&lt;/sarcasm&gt;) as well, eventhough thus far he has not done anything that demonstrates that he's not a useful editor (except possibly for voting in favor of this troll). Nevertheless, at this point, I think anyone who has read the voluminous discussion perpetrated by this single individual, who flagrantly violates wikipedia polices without even the merest semblance of disgression, meanwhile crying foul whenever he thinks he can get away with accusing anyone and everyone else of having violated said policies, will agree that such stringencies on eligible votership are not surprising, nor entirely unreasonable, all due apologies to valuable editors who do not fit said criteria. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> July 6, 2005 07:49 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for the compliment! Maybe I haven't done much to demonstrate my usefulness, but I don't think we need an expert to see that discrimination and sensoring is at work on this page. Furthermore, I wonder who is "increasingly verbally abusive" now? (See Section 4 below, and count the votes against that statement!). I can clearly see why "anon" prefer to stay anonymous. Anyway, you got my vote now and I don't want to argue with you any more. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohanL_bdcd.html" title="User:JohanL">JohanL</a> 6 July 2005 09:27 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> would you kindly stop using the term troll already? That's a stupid term, and "it takes one to know one". A reason to stay "anonymous" is the <b>administrator abuse</b> and deceitful tracking that is dishonest. Some POV adminstrators will rollback anything without discussion based on a user name and ad hominem illogic, if they have <b>targeted</b> that user. It's disgraceful, and it will be reported henceforth. I think plenty of editors and administrators have revealed just who they are. 69.218.25.180 8 July 2005 15:00 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If what you say were true, none of the votes on the Wikipedia, especially Votes for Deletion, would be valid. Fact is, most decisions on articles on Wikipedia are taken through finding consensus, whether this be between 3 editors or three hundred. What these votes are is a measure of what the editors <i>involved with the article in question</i> believe is the best option. Clearly, all the editors who have been involved in this article over the past month or so are against your inclusion, which means consensus has been reached against you.

<p><b>Comments in favor of neither:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I say neither proposal works. Singling out Jews is anti-semitic drivel. But singling out Europeans when South Africa has minority communities from all over the world including Indians, Malays, Chinese, Koreans, Nigerians, Moroccons etc etc etc besides European minorities is unecessary bias againts Europeans. Trying to justify singling out European minorities on the grounds that they are part of the so-called "white" group is to perputuate the rubbish racial classification scheme that was cornerstone of Apartheid. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuratowski%27s_Ghost_768e.html" title="User:Kuratowski's Ghost">Kuratowski's Ghost</a> 6 July 2005 15:59 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree. The best proposal that I've seen here is the one that says "start from 1948". Forget the early colonists, apartheid was not their creation. The "scientific racism" fallacy is a creature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

<p><b>Miscellaneous commentary:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>This immobile discussion has gone on long enough. My sense is that there is a single anonymous (and rather cantankerous) editor who is attempting to insert a specific (albeit unspecified) POV into the article, and that EVERY OTHER EDITOR WHO'S PAYING ATTENTION TO THE DISPUTE IN QUESTION disagrees with the editor in question as to the relevance of the specific information said editor repeatedly insists needs to be inserted into the article for "accuracy" and "inclusivity". Since discussion has not resolved the issue in the form of either side convincing the other, I propose this vote so that we can, all of us, vote to demonstrate consensus (or lack thereof) and move forward for at least two months to more productive activity than bashing each other over the heads with the same, by now, tired discussion points. I say, for now at least, let's vote and have done with it for 2 months and move on. WHICHEVER "SIDE" WINS, I say that UNLIMITED daily reverts, WP policy notwithstanding, in favor of the winning position be permitted for the specified period, and that any questions by admins whose "help" is sought to block those reverting to uphold this decision, be referred to this vote and discussion, and that such admins take both seriously. This argument has consumed FAR more time and effort than should be necessary to resolve such disputes. Should this vote be characterized as an attempt to squelch a POV, let me be perfectly clear: THIS VOTE IS DESIGNED TO SQUELCH, FOR THE SPECIFIED PERIOD, THE "LOSING" POV. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> July 3, 2005 08:01 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>YES, THIS VOTE IS DESIGNED TO SQUELCH, and censor the facts of the settlement of South Africa, especially in the 19th and 20th centuries. Wikipedia is not limited in size. The improved text (two words) improves the accuracy of the article, and takes into account the concerns of all editors, except those that want to <b>totally delete/withhold accurate information</b> "just because they don't like it".

Never ever can the population of Vereeniging be almost the same, even more than Bloemfontein! Maybe with all the surrounding towns of Vanderbijlpark, Sasolburg &amp; Meyerton (called the Vaal Triangle), included but not Vereeniging alone! Just compare the changes that user:152.163.100.203 on 17 June 2005 has been made on his/her own previous edit to the population levels of the two cities – cut it almost by halve! Ridiculous, where did these statistics came from? Is that the whole population of the two cities, or only a certain group? Who checked it?

<dd>OK, that’s a different case and must be treated seperately, but you claimed that the Jews should be mentioned on said article. Where? I cannot find any mentioning of Jews in <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_South_Africa_2d8f.html" title="Demographics of South Africa">Demographics of South Africa</a>! Anyway the Jews, however a small percentage of the South African white population, have made major contributions to the development of South-Africa, politically but especially economically, and virtually in all facets of life. To mention a few, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_Barnato_99b2.html" title="Barney Barnato">Barney Barnato</a>, the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Oppenheimer_2e90.html" title="Harry Oppenheimer">Harry Oppenheimer</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sol_Kerzner_b144.html" title="Sol Kerzner">Sol Kerzner</a> and many more. In fact, there are several Jews in leading positions in the politics of SA at this present moment; therefore I agree with user 69.219.53.138 that they are worth mentioning in this article. Without that, the article will be incomplete and inaccurate!
<dl>
<dd>How is such a miniscule group, even if they are presently in leading positions of power, or have made significant contributions to the development of ZA, sufficiently relevant to warrant prominent mention in a discussion of <b>APARTHEID</b>? That the Jewish immigrants are not mentioned in <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_South_Africa_2d8f.html" title="Demographics of South Africa">Demographics of South Africa</a> is a shortcoming of <i>that</i> article, not this one. That there are Jews in leading positions in the current government of ZA is probably irrelevant all around, unless such things are considered sufficiently noteworthy in ZA that their prominence should be noted, not here, but in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_South_Africa_be7c.html" title="Politics of South Africa">Politics of South Africa</a>. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> July 5, 2005 18:09 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not mentioning something in <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> that's not particularly important to the discussion of Apartheid, is not POV, it's "sticking to the subject". To say that because an ethnic group is included in <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_South_Africa_2d8f.html" title="Demographics of South Africa">Demographics of South Africa</a> means it should be included in <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> is not "consistent", it's "repetitive".

(<i>See <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_South_Africa_2d8f.html" title="Demographics of South Africa">Demographics of South Africa</a>.</i>)"...that's concise, NPOV, and informative.

<p>Oh, what happened to the "French"? The diaspora Jews settled in South Africa. Reread the text. It does not say blame the Jews, which is the <b>ONLY</b> issue you care about, not facts, not truth, not historical accuracy, nothing else but your biased POV.</p>
<p>Thank you. Jayjg is still here pushing his POV, that has already been disproven. The Jewish community was considered white, and it was a relevant and notable community in the 20th Century. The 17th Century Germans and French, that Jayjg dishonestly demands be on the list, were much less significant as political or economic entities during the 20th Century in South Africa. This the Googletest proves with flying colors. After all this time, nobody has addressed the inequities of the text as it relates to "the list" until now, even after many requests. So thank you for contributing and not joining a kangaroo court. Not one person has addressed the history of <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Smuts_4a11.html" title="Jan Smuts">Jan Smuts</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaim_Weizmann_e21e.html" title="Chaim Weizmann">Chaim Weizmann</a> and the political implications and issues that resulted during the apartheid era.

<li>We're talking a one-sentence introduction to the history of the colonization of South Africa as it pertains to apartheid, not a detailed discussion of the history of the demographics of South Africa. (I notice nobody has mentioned the Indian population, by the way, which was, I believe, far more numerous than the Jewish population -- something like 2.5% of the population currently, versus 0.14%.) If it can be shown that the Jewish immigration was fundamental to the foundation of apartheid (as was, for example, the Dutch), then the Jewish population bears mention in this context. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 5 July 2005 19:47 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What is not clear to me is (as golfers would say) "who makes the cut?" (what's the number and who decides). How big a proportion of the colonists do you have to have to be listed or not listed? You say that language is not relevant, but it is a lot more evident than original nationality (Dutch/Afrikaans speakers being more hardline; only the Afrikaaner "Dutch" Reformed Church searched for a Biblical basis for racism). The <i>only</i> factor that was really "fundamental to the foundation of apartheid" was (a) skin colour and (b) a belief in racial supremacy. All the rest is mere drapery. So, to be intellectually rigorous, you <b>must</b> either omit all mention of origin <b>or</b> include every category that anybody wants included. Though why anybody would want to to accept guilt by association with such an abominable perspective is beyond me. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_King_2192.html" title="User:Red King">Red King</a> 5 July 2005 23:04 (UTC)

<li>But none of this is necessary. SA was colonized primarily by German, Dutch, French, and later English settlers; that probably describes 95%-99% of the voluntary immigrants (I'm excepting the Indian indentured servants, mostly because I don't know the numbers). I think that's a pretty clean cut for a short introduction to the history. "Intellectual rigor" is fine where appropriate; intellectual rigor does not mean mentioning every possible fact every place it can be mentioned. We could, of course, just say "See <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_b4a8.html" title="History of South Africa">History of South Africa</a>" -- and maybe we should. Did apartheid per se (as opposed to the much more common minority European domination of aboriginal peoples) exist prior to its post-WWII codification? Maybe this would work better, under "History of apartheid in South Africa"</li>

<p>I think Kuratowski's Ghost's and 69.217.200.164's latest posts contain the germ of a solution. Surely there can be no other motivation for this anonymous editor's addition than a feeling that if his version is not used, that a certain group will feel left out and discriminated against. Thus, his version should be expanded to include, as KG catalogues "Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Lebanese, Polish, German and Swiss,... Russian, Croatian, Serb and Czech" not to speak of fat Europeans and non Europeans, thin ones, gays, lesbians, people who weren't sure one way or the other, ones who came wearing funny hats, bald men, bearded women etc. ad infinitum. Not to do so would be anti-Czech, homophobic, and fat-people-hating. In the absence of the anonymous editor providing us with a superior version including all such groups of equal prominence with the diaspora Jews (why should Jews emigrating from Palestine/Israel be left out?) I feel that there is no choice but to sadly use version 2 for the moment. He should probably make up his own very long article on the subject, as he clearly has the time and interest to do so.--<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Z_7bb4.html" title="User:John Z">John Z</a> 6 July 2005 10:09 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, the two most obvious, and perhaps the most important, are <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_385d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a>. The purpose, in both cases (as well as here) is to avoid <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sockpuppetry</a>, and it's not a casual issue; it's blitheringly easy to stack a vote by logging in from a dozen different IP addresses, or by creating a new Wikipedia account. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 8 July 2005 15:45 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, I've reviewed those pages, but where is the mention that a vote can be "restricted" in such a fashion? Please show me. Your concerns about sockpuppetry cannot trump an open, free vote and restrict it to a small like-minded group. The vote is clearly undemocratic and against policy unless someone can show us the policy that states otherwise. The vote as set up is illegitimate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regrading <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sockpuppetry</a>, I have learned what the term is. What is unusual is the constant idiosyncratic views on Wikipedia that are apparent when the same few POV editors revert and censor others over and over, they have the exact same editing style and POV, they protect articles from NPOV and improvement, and they communicate to avoid the 3 revert rule. That's dishonesty. That's also what I have learned about some editors and administrators on Wikipedia. No names or personal attacks, I think all can see it clearly. 69.218.25.180 8 July 2005 16:29 (UTC)

<li>Sockpuppet votes are discounted everywhere, but what Jpgordon was referring to in addition to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_Adminship_662a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for Adminship">RfA</a> was not <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">VfD</a>, but rather <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion</a>, where the rules regarding sockpuppetry are spelled out quite clearly. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> July 8, 2005 17:36 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">interpretation of vote; starting from 1948</span></h2>
<p>The anon's complaints about the voting qualifications are irrelevant. According to the criteria proposed by Tomer, the vote is 11 to 1 (since JohanL doesn't meet the criteria). But even if the criteria were relaxed, the vote would still be 11 to 3 (assuming the anon would have cast one vote). So the only issue is whether the vote was 78% in favor or 92%. Either way, there's a clear consensus.</p>
<p>I agree with Red King and others, who suggest that the best thing to do would be to start from 1948 anyway. This article is redundant with <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_b4a8.html" title="History of South Africa">History of South Africa</a>, which is a very high-quality article, but too long. Pall, Maveric149, and I have already discussed spinning off the apartheid-era history, and Maveric149's work so far is at Talk:History_of_apartheid. I would actually favor a title more like History of South Africa in the Apartheid Era, for two reasons: (1) apartheid didn't start suddenly, like turning on a light switch, and (2) if the idea is to split up <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_b4a8.html" title="History of South Africa">History of South Africa</a> into smaller parts, then the article needs to cover more than just apartheid itself (although apartheid was, of course, the central issue in that period).</p>
<p>Of course, the effect of all this might just be to divert the anon into revert-warring over the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_b4a8.html" title="History of South Africa">History of South Africa</a> article, which would be the only article that would actually be covering the colonial period. However, if an article has to be afflicted with a revert war, I think it's better for that article to be <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_b4a8.html" title="History of South Africa">History of South Africa</a> for a while. <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_b4a8.html" title="History of South Africa">History of South Africa</a> was nominated twice for FA, and narrowly missed the second time around. Because it went through that process, it's in extremely good shape, and doesn't need a lot of work right now. If an article has to be paralyzed by the anon, it might as well be the one that doesn't need a lot of work.</p>
<p>In any case, I think the vote has had the desired effect of proving that there is an overwhelming consensus against inserting the anon's agenda into *any* of these articles.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 8 July 2005 22:10 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur. There is precedent for undoing the full effect of the vote, by opening a new vote on when to start the discussion of Apartheid. If the discussion begins with the first apartheid-like <i>laws</i>, the discussion of where the Europeans came from will be completely mootified, as it will no longer be included in the article. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> July 8, 2005 22:22 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've preserved all the apartheid analogies in a section at the end of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_Era_0085.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid Era">History of South Africa in the apartheid Era</a>, although frankly I think the analogies are mostly nonsense. IMO the best case to be made is in the Southern U.S. before the civil rights movement, and even there it's pretty weak --- it wasn't a tiny white majority in power, and blacks were U.S. citizens. I don't see the status quo as a valid option; the duplication between <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_b4a8.html" title="History of South Africa">History of South Africa</a> has been under discussion for a long time, and needs to be fixed. I would be happy to put the analogies section somewhere else, but I don't think it belongs at Political epithets; 95% of that article is short definitions of a long list of terms applied to individuals (e.g., "feminazi") rather than forms of givernment. I think I'll make a separate Apartheid Outside South Africa article, but I see that as a separate issue from the need to eliminate the duplication, which I think should be obvious. The reason I asked if we needed a formal vote, and waited 24 hours, was simply that this would go against the letter, although not the spirit, of the vote, which says to preserve a certain sentence for 60 days. The need to eliminate the duplication is something that has been discussed extensively already (in the FA discussion, and on talk pages), and my impression is that a strong consensus has already been reached on it. I think it might have just fallen off of the radar because of the revert war here (and the revert war was also the reason why Pall, Maveric149, and I have been delaying carrying it out).--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 18:18, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
