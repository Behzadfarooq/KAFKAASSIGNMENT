<p>Aparicio Saravia was born on August 16, 1856 in Cerro Largo, Uruguay. He was the fourth son of thirteen had by Francisco Saraiva (his surname was hispanicized from Saraiva to Saravia)and Favorable Gives Rose. The large and numerous family had fields on both sides of the then- irregular border of Uruguay and Brazil, which explains the patriadas that organized years later. Aparicio Saravia, with some of his brothers from both Uruguay and Brazil, cultivated certain privileged bonds with the political powers that be of the Brazilian state Rio Grande do Sol.</p>
<p>Aparicio went to school in Montevideo but as an adolescent, he ventured into 'la Revolución de las Lanzas(1870 - 1872)' on the side of the white. It was there that he obtained the degree of tip originating thus the pejorative nickname "old tip" that their enemies they gave him. After that, he returned to the family estate where internalized still more in the present of the field, so that with time he would come to be a rural personality in comparison to the "urban doctors" of Montevideo, whom usually participated in Uruguayan politics.</p>
<p>In 1875 with his two brothers, they embarked upon the Tricolor Revolution or 'la Revolución Tricolor', under the command of Angel Muñiz. Two years later he married Candid Díaz, niece of a red leader, which caused her to flee her house to avoid the opposition of her parents to her union with Aparicio. Later still, he continued participating in other revolutions such as the Revolution of the Quebracho, or la Revolución del Quebracho, in 1886.</p>
<p>In 1893 he decided with his brothers Gumersindo and Mariano to participate in a Brazilian civil war in which trajó from Uruguay 400 lancers who carried the white currency with the motto "Defender gives lei". In that war, Aparicio acquired a great prestige that was exported to Uruguay via the newspapers. He earned the nickname "el castelhano" (the Spaniard). In that war, his brother Gumersindo died, causing Aparicio to become the sole commander, and thus he decided in 1895 to return to Uruguay with the rank of general.</p>
<p>Once in his native country, he gained more support from the National Party, which already had tensions against the red government of Idiarte Gunwale. Not only that, he also collided with Justino Múníz,one of the most important White party politicians of Cerro Largo. Later, Saravia managed to gain all the sympathy of the white party in the north of the country, (Cerro Largo is in the northern part) deferring politically to Múniz.</p>
<p>In 1895 Aparicio Saravia was named referring politician of Cerro Largo. Armed with that title, he went to the capitol of Uruguay, Montevideo, where he found that the Board of directors of the National Party (The White Party) had armed him with more then that title, but with an armed movement.</p>
<p>Upon returning to Cerro Largo, paid attention omitted to that decision of the board of directors and passed to organize its next steps in silent form giving birth to an uprising at the end of 1896 with 80 people. But al not to obtain supports and resources, went al Brazil. In 1897 a white revolution exploded in which Aparicio had a military role since the neighboring country with ups and downs. All finished when Idiarte Gunwale was murdered and its succeeding one Juan Lindolfo you Cost decided to cut all by the healthy thing establishing the Pact of the Cross.</p>
<p>That pact stipulated that the white could have 6 departments (basically all the north of the country) under its direct control, amen of some electoral laws demanded by the white. They were times in which the Uruguay was handled by two governments as during the Large War when was the Government of it besieged Montevideo and the Government of the Hill: the constitutional government was in Montevideo and the opposition in the campaign.</p>
<p>But Aparicio, by his individualism and his charisma, already had evil relations with the board of directors of the National Party, which was retaken by the "doctors", whom disdained the leaders of the field, such as Aparicio. They treated them as obstacles for the "civilizing progress" of the country. One of those "doctors" was Eduardo Acevedo Díaz and it is with him who Aparicio had the greatest political displeasure in the following presidential election. March 1, 1903 was chosen President of the Republic, for the first time, José Batlle and Ordóñez. His election was given in the following way: the National Party thought to offer its support al Dr. Juan Carlos White, candidate by a red sector in exchange for maintaining the Pact of The Cross. But Eduardo Acevedo Díaz obtained sufficient white votes to elect to Batlle for 55 to 33. Therefore same Eduardo Acevedo Díaz was expelled of the White Party.</p>
<p>Batlle and Ordóñez had ideas "very constitutional"&#160;: for him it was unacceptable that the country lived together with two governments, one in Montevideo incarnate in it and another in the campaign, whose informal leader was Aparicio Saravia. Consequently, Batlle and Ordóñez according to the Pact of the Cross, he renewed the political headquarters of the 6 departments reserved for the white but in two of them he put men of Eduardo Acevedo Díaz. That for Aparicio Saravia was an offense and in contempt of the Pact of the Cross.</p>
<p>It seemed the civil war already again but an official mission was interviewed with Saravia and the armed fight with the white solution to appoint citizens through the board of directors of the National Party was avoided like the leaders of those departments. That was in 1903. At the beginning of 1904, in the department of Rivera (governed by a white political leader) was person under arrest a rebellious brother of the prefect of the Brazilian city of Livramento, neighboring to Uruguay. Then the prefect with some acolytes invaded oriental territory to free it. The government decided to send there official troops to oust those forces but once there, they found with which they went to their country. What then continued was that the president Batlle and Ordóñez ordered those troops to be remained in Rivera therefore was considered constitutionally leader of the armed forces as to decide sovereign where should be each troop in the national territory.</p>
<p>Aparicio Saravia felt challenged therefore and proclaimed then that the continuance of the official troops violated the Pact of the Cross and initiated the civil war.</p>
<p>Thus happened the following battles: Mansavillagra (14 of January), Illescas (15 of January) and Tupambaé battles happened June 24 and that was the bloodiest one of all in theoriental history: both edicts were judged the victory. The final battle was in Masoller, September 1, 1904, between the limits of the Departments of Rivera and Artigas and the Brazilian border. The battle of Masoller was fierce because the forces that collided there were couples and they used the same armament. September 1, 1904 in the afternoon the official army was in some fences of stone (somewhat common in the country of before of the alambramiento to delimit rural properties) and shot the revolutionary. Then being felt scarce of munition they withdrew of there. The saravistas could occupy those fences but it did not they do for fear to that were mined. So that the army returned to the same place with more fire still.</p>
<p>Thus it was the situation when Aparicio Saravia was supervising the battle. But his figure turned out to be clearly recognizable by the hat he wore, and the I puncture white that used and that ropaje that would accompany him even in the legend did it a white easily fold-up one: which happened, was crossed by a bullet that wounded him the kidneys and the intestines. Being known badly injured, gave orders of resisting in its absence and pretended that was all well.</p>
<p>Aparicio Saravia was removed of the country toward the Brazil, concretely to a stay close to the border, property of a political overlord riograndese that was a friend of the Saravias, in Carovy. It was there where he passed away, on the 10th of that month.</p>
<p>But it known the mortal injured and subsequent death of Saravia the forces of Aparicio were discouraged al extreme that there not being another leader that him tie in charisma, they opted for being disbanded. Later the Peace was signed of Aceguá September 24, 1904. Thus the last civil revolution was finished.</p>
<p>Saravia and the National Party they sought that healthier electoral laws with the concreteness of the obligatory, secret, and universal vote be established. The ironic thing is that Batlle and Ordóñez also sought those same goals. The null communication of both large political leaders of the Uruguay enabled a civil war that was avoidable.</p>
<p>Aparicio Saravia was buried in the pantheon of the family Brazilian Pereira gives Souza. In 1921 by management of Luis Alberto of Blacksmith then president of the National Party, its remainders were repatriated and buried in the Montevidean cemetery of the I Dive; little time they were transferred Holy Clara of Olimar, where rests next to its family.</p>
