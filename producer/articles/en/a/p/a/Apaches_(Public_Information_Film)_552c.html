The 26 - minute long film deals with the subject of the dangers to children on <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farm.html" title="Farm">farms</a>, and has been broadcast in schools all over the country. The time frame of the film is somewhat confusing, giving a <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">surreal</a> feeling to the events portrayed. <i>Apaches</i> is now one of the most notorious public information films of all time.</p>

<p>The film follows the misadventures of a group of young children in a rural <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">British</a> village, who go to stay on a nearby farm for the week. Several scenes show the children playing at being "<a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowboys.html" title="Cowboys">cowboys</a> and Indians" (<a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas_3e71.html" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Native Americans</a>), hence the title. All but one dies in various shocking accidents, and the deaths are all through carelessness on the children's part, suggesting that the children would still be alive if they had known what dangers lay ahead.</p>
<p>At the start of the film we see the children playing while, back at the farm buildings, a sort of <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea_party.html" title="Tea party">tea party</a> is being prepared for them. As the farmer opens a gate and drives his <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tractor.html" title="Tractor">tractor</a> through the field where the children are playing, one of the boys becomes overconfident and jumps up onto the trailer part, shouting to his friends. He falls off and is run over by the tractor, and the camera focuses on the horrified expressions of the other children, followed by close ups of a large pool of blood on the ground and a broken toy gun nearby. We then see the class teacher back at the children's <a href="../../../s/c/h/School.html" title="School">school</a>, removing the name tag from the victim's storage peg in the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Changeroom.html" title="Changeroom">changeroom</a>.</p>
<p>In the next scene the children are playing in the fields again as their parents prepare to go to the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea_party.html" title="Tea party">tea party</a>. They decide to play <a href="../../../h/i/d/Hide_and_seek.html" title="Hide and seek">hide and seek</a>, and while searching for the remaining children, a boy walks along the top of the fence surrounding the <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slurry.html" title="Slurry">slurry</a> pit, but falls in and drowns. We hear that the children at the village school have been given a day off because of his death, and the class teacher is shown removing the books from this child's desk.</p>
<p>Back at the farm, the table is being set for the children's party, and the children are again playing at "cowboys and Indians." When the game finishes, the children wander into an equipment shed, and one of the boys picks up a bottle of chemicals, suggesting they "drink to celebrate." The children discuss whether or not the contents might be poisonous, and pass the bottle around to sniff. A little girl pretends to take a sip from the bottle but accidentally swallows a considerable amount. She spits it out and seems to be fine, but as the children go home after the party, she is coughing quite violently. We then see the exterior of her house at night, and hear her screaming for her mother as the lights go on inside. The next shot is of the girl's parents clearing out what had been their daughter's bedroom, with a close up of the now empty bed.</p>
<p>Later, the remaining children are again playing in the fields, and one of them narrowly avoids being run over by a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tractor.html" title="Tractor">tractor</a> like the first victim. They are chasing each other, pretending to be characters from the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> series <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Starsky_and_Hutch_c4a1.html" title="Starsky and Hutch">Starsky and Hutch</a></i>, when one of the boys accidentally pulls down a heavy iron gate and is crushed beneath it. The camera focuses on the lifeless remains lying in a pool of blood, as the child's parents pull up to the farm in their car.</p>
<p>There are now only two children left, and even though they have been told to play together, one of them decides to go off on his own. He walks through the <a href="../../../c/e/m/Cemetery.html" title="Cemetery">cemetery</a> where his friends are buried, and finds an abandoned tractor where the farmer has left it at the top of a hill. He plays behind the wheel but accidentally releases the handbrake, and it careens down the slope as the farmer rushes to help him. His parents are then shown in his empty bedroom, comforting each other before his funeral.</p>
<p>There are funeral scenes of the latest victim's coffin being buried as the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastor.html" title="Pastor">pastor</a> recites a prayer, before the mourners move on to the funeral breakfast. Only one child is still alive, and looks miserable as he thinks about what has happened to his friends. The child who has been narrating the film all along talks calmly about his grandparents as the images fade, and we realize this child was the last one to die, and whose funeral we have just seen on the screen.</p>
