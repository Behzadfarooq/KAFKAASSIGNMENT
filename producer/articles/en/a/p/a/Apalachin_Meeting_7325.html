<p>The <b>Apalachin Meeting</b> was a historic <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summit_meeting.html" title="Summit meeting">summit</a> of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">mafia</a> and attended by roughly 100 mafia crime bosses from the United States, Canada and Italy. Expensive cars with license plates from around the country aroused the curiosity of the local and state law enforcement, who raided the meeting, causing mafiosi to flee into the woods and the surrounding area of the Apalachin estate. Over 60 underworld bosses were detained and indicted due to the disastrous meeting. The direct and most significant outcome of the Apalachin meeting was that it helped to confirm the existence of a <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Crime_Syndicate_4de8.html" title="National Crime Syndicate">National Crime Syndicate</a>, which some - including <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Edgar_Hoover_ecb6.html" title="J.

<p>Living in <a href="../../../n/a/p/Naples%2C_Italy_57de.html" title="Naples, Italy">Naples, Italy</a> in 1946, at the end of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Boss <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito "Don Vito" Genovese</a>, who had fled the New York from a 1937 murder indictment was arrested and returned to the United States to face trial, but was eventually released due to the fact that the only witness to the murder, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_LaTempa_780e.html" title="Peter LaTempa">Peter LaTempa</a>, was himself murdered in his jail cell while awaiting the trial. After his releases, <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito Genovese</a> began competing with <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Costello_05f7.html" title="Frank Costello">Frank "The Prime Minister" Costello</a> for control over the biggest and most powerful underworld crime family, La Cosa Nostra's <a href="../../../l/u/c/Luciano_Family_322c.html" title="Luciano Family">Luciano Family</a> of New York. Once Genovese had control of the Family his intentions were to take control of the Commission and La Cosa Nostra, but to do this he had to remove the long established "Conservative Faction" or old guard mafia, which controlled the Commission. The Commission's "Conservative Faction" of Bosses Bonanno-Profaci-Mangano-Gagliano-Magaddino had exerted a major influence over La Cosa Nostra's politics, policies and rules since the Commission's formation in 1931 and had dominated since the 1936 imprisonment of Boss and criminal powerhouse, <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucky_Luciano_5d8b.html" title="Lucky Luciano">Salvatore "Charlie Lucky" Luciano</a>. By 1951 the New York underworld and the Commission were experiencing a change in the mafia that caused the formation of factions and infighting amongst the Bosses. By 1957 the new "Liberal Faction" had gained enough power and influence to rival the old mafia power structure and decided to make a grab for control of the Commission and La Cosa Nostra. At the head of this new faction was Boss <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito Genovese</a> and his allies Gaetano Lucchese and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlo_Gambino_3096.html" title="Carlo Gambino">Carlo Gambino</a>. The events and conflicts perpetrated by <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito Genovese</a> and his allies from 1951 through 1957, such as the assassination of five New York Bosses were designed to bring about a power change in the New York underworld and the Commission, but in 1957 the change was leading to a war in La Cosa Nostra and a solution was necessary. <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito Genovese</a>, who now controlled the most powerful Family in La Cosa Nostra called for a national meeting of Bosses from around the country. Genovese elected Buffalo Boss and Commission member, Stefano "The Undertaker" Magaddino, who in turn chose Northeastern, Pennsylvania crime boss Joseph Barbara and his Underboss Rosario "Russell" Bufalino to oversee all the arrangements for the important meeting.</p>

<p>The Commission's "Conservative Faction" began its decline and loss of power in La Cosa Nostra with the 1951 alliance of Bosses <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Costello_05f7.html" title="Frank Costello">Frank Costello</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Anastasia_c0b7.html" title="Albert Anastasia">Albert Anastasia</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Accardo_1b8b.html" title="Anthony Accardo">Anthony Accardo</a>. The Commission's Costello-Anastasia-Accardo faction, along with their allies began the rise of the new "Liberal Faction" over La Cosa Nostra's "old guard" of mafia Bosses. The old guard mafia Bosses consisted of mafiosi born in Sicily who were determined to obtain power, influence and profit by following the old world traditions and principles of the mafia, while the new "Liberal Faction" was made up of the Americanized Bosses who's sole purpose was to obtain power, influence and profit through any means necessary. The old guards traditional mafia values had no place in the new mafia's future and this began a "cold war" among New York's mafia powers. The new "Liberal Faction" began its rise to power with the 1951 disappearance of Boss and "Conservative Faction" member, Vincenzo "Don Vincent" Mangano and the assassination of his "Substituto" Underboss and brother, Philip Mangano, which placed Underboss, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Anastasia_c0b7.html" title="Albert Anastasia">Albert "The Mad Hatter" Anastasia</a> at the head of the Family and gave him a Commission seat. Also in 1951, mobster <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito Genovese</a> began his plan to overthrow Boss <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Costello_05f7.html" title="Frank Costello">Frank Costello</a> and take control of the Luciano Family when he started campaigning to have Luciano Family Underboss and strong Costello ally, Quarico "Willie Moore" Moretti assassinated due to his advanced case of syphilis and his constant and wild conversations concerning La Cosa Nostra affairs. Vito Genovese's first move was accomplished in a New Jersey restaurant on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_4.html" title="October 4">October 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>, when <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Moretti_1a4f.html" title="Willie Moretti">Willie Moretti</a> was assassinated for the greater good of La Cosa Nostra and <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito Genovese</a> was promoted to Underboss of the Luciano Family.</p>

<p>The 1951 assassinations of the Mangano brothers and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Moretti_1a4f.html" title="Willie Moretti">Willie Moretti</a>, along with <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Anastasia_c0b7.html" title="Albert Anastasia">Albert Anastasia</a>'s elevation to Boss of the second largest crime family in the United States elevated the "cold war" in the New York underworld and the Commission to a new level. After these events the New York underworld split even further with the most powerful Bosses and mafiosi lining up against one another. With the loss of ally <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Moretti_1a4f.html" title="Willie Moretti">Willie Moretti</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Costello_05f7.html" title="Frank Costello">Frank Costello</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Anastasia_c0b7.html" title="Albert Anastasia">Albert Anastasia</a> lined up against the alliance of <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito Genovese</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Lucchese_d984.html" title="Tommy Lucchese">Tommy Lucchese</a> and their ally <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlo_Gambino_3096.html" title="Carlo Gambino">Carlo Gambino</a>. The evident changes in the New York mafia led the Sicilian, conservative Bosses to believe that the new Americanized Bosses and their allies were preparing for a possible takeover, but for the time being the conservative Bosses watched and waited as present and future events played out in La Cosa Nostra. One these events was the 1953 death of "Conservative Faction" and Commission member, <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaetano_Gagliano_1536.html" title="Gaetano Gagliano">Gaetano Gagliano</a>, leaving his successor, <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaetano_Lucchese_e2a5.html" title="Gaetano Lucchese">Gaetano "Tommy Brown" Lucchese</a>, as the new Family Boss and Commission member. By 1957 only three of the five original conservative or old guard Bosses still had a Commission seat. The "Conservative Faction" of Bonanno-Profaci-Magaddino was losing power and influence to the "Liberal Faction" and knowing this "Conservative Faction" member, Magaddino secretly sided with the "Liberal Faction" against his former allies Joseph Bonanno and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Profaci_d17c.html" title="Joseph Profaci">Joseph "The Old Man" Profaci</a>. Luciano Family Underboss, <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito Genovese</a> realized by 1957 that the mafia's political climate in New York and on the Commission was right for a power move. Genovese schemed with allies <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Lucchese_d984.html" title="Tommy Lucchese">Tommy Lucchese</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlo_Gambino_3096.html" title="Carlo Gambino">Carlo Gambino</a> to remove <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Costello_05f7.html" title="Frank Costello">Frank Costello</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Anastasia_c0b7.html" title="Albert Anastasia">Albert Anastasia</a> from power by assassinating them, thus allowing Genovese and Gambino to elevate themselves to the heads of their Families.</p>

<p>Vito Genovese's final grab for total power and the domination of La Cosa Nostra came in 1957 with the removal of three of New York's most powerful mafia Bosses. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2.html" title="May 2">May 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>, Genovese gunman and protégé, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Gigante_1964.html" title="Vincent Gigante">Vincent "Chin" Gigante</a> tried to kill <a href="../../../l/u/c/Luciano_Family_322c.html" title="Luciano Family">Luciano Family</a> Boss <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Costello_05f7.html" title="Frank Costello">Frank Costello</a> in the lobby of his Manhattan apartment building , but botched the hit, leaving Costello with only a minor scalp/head wound. Costello got the message and sent word to <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito Genovese</a> that he would step down as Boss of the Luciano Family and retire with his gambling interests. Then Anastasia Family Underboss and Luciano/Costello ally, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Scalise_802b.html" title="Frank Scalise">Frank "Don Cheech" Scalise</a> was assassinated on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">June 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> by Anastasia nephew and gunman, Vincent "Jimmy/Jerome" Squilante. Past underworld reasons for <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Scalise_802b.html" title="Frank Scalise">Frank Scalise</a>'s murder range from a botched heroin shipment, to his sale of La Cosa Nostra memberships for $50,000 with his Boss, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Anastasia_c0b7.html" title="Albert Anastasia">Albert Anastasia</a>, but whatever the truth, the hit was most likely sanctioned by Anastasia, reinforced by Anastasia being Squilante's Boss and the only one who could sanction him as the shooter. <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito Genovese</a> and his allies then used the Scalise hit and Albert Anastasia's attempt to muscle into the Havana, Cuba casino operations of Jewish Boss <a href="../../../m/e/y/Meyer_Lansky_dd43.html" title="Meyer Lansky">Meyer Lansky</a> and his partner, Florida Boss <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santo_Trafficante%2C_Jr._9632.html" title="Santo Trafficante, Jr.">Santo Trafficante, Jr.</a> as another example of Anastasia's madness and a reason to kill him. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_25.html" title="October 25">October 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>, in the barber shop of Manhattan’s Park Sheraton Hotel, Costello ally <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Anastasia_c0b7.html" title="Albert Anastasia">Albert "The Mad Hatter" Anastasia</a> was shot and killed by two masked gunmen sent by Bosses <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito Genovese</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlo_Gambino_3096.html" title="Carlo Gambino">Carlo Gambino</a> and Joseph Profaci, who was also an Anastasia rival in Brooklyn. <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito Genovese</a> was now Boss of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genovese_Family_9aea.html" title="Genovese Family">Genovese Family</a> and a Commission member, making him the most powerful Boss in La Cosa Nostra.</p>
<p>The make up of the Commission would keep on changing, strengthening the "Liberal Faction" even more throughout the years. In 1957, Chicago mafioso, Salvatore "Sam Mooney" Giancana was elected to replace former Chicago Outfit Boss and Commission member, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Accardo_1b8b.html" title="Anthony Accardo">Anthony "Joe Batters" Accardo</a>, giving the new "Liberal Faction" another strong ally. By 1960, two more Bosses who had achieved great power in La Cosa Nostra, Joseph "Joe Z." Zerilli of Detroit and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelo_Bruno_640f.html" title="Angelo Bruno">Angelo "The Docile Don" Bruno</a> of Philadelphia were elected to the Commission. They were both new to the National La Cosa Nostra political arena and naturally sided with one of the two factions. Detroit Boss <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Zerilli_f660.html" title="Joseph Zerilli">Joseph Zerilli</a> was related by marriage to New York crime boss Joseph Profaci, Zerilli's son having married Profaci's daughter gave the Detroit Boss great reason to side with the "Conservative Faction", while Philadelphia Boss Angelo Bruno was close to New York Boss <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlo_Gambino_3096.html" title="Carlo Gambino">Carlo Gambino</a> and his friend and in law, New York Boss <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Lucchese_d984.html" title="Tommy Lucchese">Tommy Lucchese</a>.

<p>Powerful mafiosi from all over the United States, Canada and Italy convened at the Apalachin, New York estate of Northeastern, Pennsylvania mafia boss Joseph Barbara to socialize and resolve the mafia affairs in New York and La Cosa Nostra operations such as gambling, casinos and narcotics dealing. The Scalise and Anastasia murders were topics of great importance that needed immediate attention, since men in the Anastasia Family still loyal to the Anastasia/Scalise regime such as the powerful caporegimes <a href="../../../a/n/i/Aniello_Dellacroce_9024.html" title="Aniello Dellacroce">Aniello "The Lamb" Dellacroce</a> and Armand "Tommy" Rava were about to go to war against <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Genovese_c790.html" title="Vito Genovese">Vito Genovese</a> and his allies. It hadn't been just the Genovese-Lucchese-Gambino alliance that wanted to see <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Anastasia_c0b7.html" title="Albert Anastasia">Albert Anastasia</a> dead. Some of the most powerful Cosa Nostra Bosses throughout the country, such as Tampa Family boss Santo Trafficante, Jr., Northeastern Family Underboss Rosario "Russell" Bufalino, New Orleans Family Boss Carlos "Little Man" Marcello and even Jewish Boss and mafia financier, <a href="../../../m/e/y/Meyer_Lansky_dd43.html" title="Meyer Lansky">Meyer Lansky</a>, worried about Anastasia's attempts to muscle in on their Havana casino operations just before the Commission sanctioned his assassination. In fact, Cuba, was one of the Apalachin meetings topics of discussion, particularly La Cosa Nostra's gambling and narcotics smuggling interests on the island. The international narcotics trade was also an important topic on the Apalachin agenda. Shortly before Apalachin, Bonanno Family members Joseph Bonanno, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmine_Galante_6d2c.html" title="Carmine Galante">Carmine Galante</a>, Frank Garofalo, Giovanni Bonventre and other American Cosa Nostra representatives from Detroit, Buffalo and Montreal visited Palermo, where they held talks with Sicilian Mafiosi at the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Hotel_des_Palmes_Mafia_meeting_1957_16d9.html" title="Grand Hotel des Palmes Mafia meeting 1957">staying at the Grand Hotel des Palmes</a>. One of the topics discussed was transatlantic heroin shipments and the narcotics traffic. In addition to the narcotics trade, the New York Garment Industry interests and rackets, such as loansharking to the business owners and control of garment center trucking were other important topics on the Apalachin agenda. The outcome of the discussions concerning the garment industry in New York would have a direct and in some cases an indirect effect on the business interests of some of the other Bosses in around the country, mainly those interests in garment manufacturing, trucking, labor and unions, which brought in large incomes for the Families involved. Thus all in all, the state of American Mafia affairs was to be discussed at this meeting, leaving no debates or questions as to who would now be leading the new "Liberal Mafia", controlling and enforcing its national rules and policies.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">November 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>, the bosses, their advisors and many <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodyguards.html" title="Bodyguards">bodyguards</a>--adding up to around a hundred men at Barbara's 53 acre (21.46ha) estate--met at Barbara's estate in Apalachin to discuss these issues.</p>
<p>A local state trooper named Edgar Croswell had been aware that a suspicious meeting had occurred at Barbara's estate the previous year; state troopers had pulled over Carmine Galante as he sped away from Barbara's house in 1956, and they had found that Galante was not only driving without a license, but he had an extensive criminal record in New York City. In the time immediately preceding the November 1957 meeting, Croswell had become aware that Barbara's son was reserving rooms in local hotels; this made Croswell suspicious, and he therefore decided to keep an eye on Barbara's house. When the state police found many <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxury_car.html" title="Luxury car">luxury cars</a> parked at Barbara's home, they began taking down <a href="../../../l/i/c/License_plate.html" title="License plate">license plate</a> numbers. Having found that many of these cars were registered to known criminals, state police reinforcements came to the scene and began to set up a roadblock.</p>
<p>Having barely started their meeting, Bartolo Guccia a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castellammare_del_Golfo_4062.html" title="Castellammare del Golfo">Castellammare del Golfo</a> native and Joe Barbara employee (with a criminal record) spotted the <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadblock.html" title="Roadblock">roadblock</a> while leaving Barbara's estate. Guccia would later state he was returning to the Barbara home to check on a fish order. Some attendees attempted to drive away but were stopped by the roadblock. Others trudged through the fields and woods, ruining their expensive <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suits.html" title="Suits">suits</a> and tossing <a href="../../../g/u/n/Guns.html" title="Guns">guns</a> and cash away in case they were caught. Locals reported finding $100 bills scattered about the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Countryside.html" title="Countryside">countryside</a> for months afterwards.</p>
<p>Up to fifty men escaped, but sixty-three were apprehended, including Commission members Vito Genovese, Carlo Gambino, Joseph Profaci and Joseph Bonanno. Virtually all of them claimed they had heard Joseph Barbara was feeling ill and that they just had popped in to see him and wish him well. Everyone thought it very curious that so many men of <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> descent from various cities, the majority with criminal records, should happen to be all gathering at one place at the same time, but as no crime had been committed the men who were caught were all eventually released. It was a great embarrassment to La Cosa Nostra and the also to the <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a>. Famed FBI director J. Edgar Hoover had denied the existence of a "National Crime Syndicate" and the need to address organized crime in America . After the Apalachin Summit, Hoover could no longer deny the National Crime Syndicate's existence and its influence on the North American underworld, as well as La Cosa Nostra's overall control and influence of the Syndicate's many branches throughout North America and abroad. J. Edgar Hoover created the "Top Hoodlum Program" and went after the National Crime Syndicate's and La Cosa Nostra's top Bosses throughout the country. Many of the National Crime Syndicate's most powerful Bosses such as Vito Genovese, Joseph Bonanno, Sam "Momo" Giancana, Stefano Magaddino, Frank Costello, Carlos Marcello, Meyer Lansky, Abner "Longy" Zwillman and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip__Dandy_Phil__Kastel_eb2a.html" title="Philip &quot;Dandy Phil&quot; Kastel">Philip "Dandy Phil" Kastel</a> just to name a few, found themselves with greater law enforcement scrutiny, indictments and grand jury subpoenas being handed down.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/a/Apalachin_Meeting_7325.html" title="Edit section: Conspiracy theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conspiracy theory</span></h2>
<p>Some law enforcement members and mob historians throughout the years since the historic Apalachin Summit debacle, believe that the 3 senior mob members that were absent for the meeting, namely Charles Luciano, Frank Costello and Mayer Lansky conspired with each other to tip off the Apalachin and state law enforcement officials who raided Joseph Barbara's estate and discovered the existence of a National Crime Syndicate. No matter what the state of the affairs of the National Crime Syndicate or La Cosa Nostra at the time of the Apalachin Summit, good or bad, may it be peace, war or otherwise, most mob watchers would never believe that two men such as Charlie "Lucky" Luciano and Frank Costello would ever break their vows of "Omerta" or betray their fellow Bosses and allies who were present at Apalachin on November 14, 1957. The facts were that Vito Genovese had stripped Frank Costello of leadership in the Luciano Family and further placed the exiled Charlie Luciano near the last vestiges of power and prestige that he maintained throughout the National Crime Syndicate and La Cosa Nostra. Never again would Luciano regain the total domination of the National Crime Syndicate and La Cosa Nostra without a powerful Family and soldiers behind him, but no matter in what position of underworld power these two men found themselves in, they would never purposely try to destroy what they built from the beginning, together with their childhood friends, the most powerful Crime Syndicate in North America. Also Luciano and Costello were in awkward positions, Charlie "Lucky" Luciano having been deported to Italy in 1946 and not allowed back into the U.S. and Frank Costello recently being shot and stripped of power on Vito Genovese's orders, could not attend the Apalachin Summit, but they had contacted an old friend and ally Frank "The Cheeseman" Cucchiara, the New England Patriarca Family Consigliere who was representing his Boss <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Patriarca_Sr._f0b3.html" title="Raymond Patriarca Sr.">Raymond "El Padrone" Patriarca, Sr.</a>, but also agreed to represent Luciano's and Costello's interests at the Summit as well. As far as Meyer Lansky not being present at Apalachin, it is known that he and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stacher_9861.html" title="Joseph Stacher">Joseph "Doc" Stacher</a> declined to go, but were invited to discuss the state of casino operations in Las Vegas and Cuba, seeing as they were two of the operations investors and overseers. It's easy enough to surmise were the "Set Up" scenario comes to mind for some people, but since the most important and powerful Jewish National Syndicate Bosses such as <a href="../../../a/b/n/Abner_Zwillman_bf02.html" title="Abner Zwillman">Abner "Longy" Zwillman</a> , <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Kastel_7fcd.html" title="Philip Kastel">Philip "Dandy Phil" Kastel</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morris_Dalitz_9b4b.html" title="Morris Dalitz">Morris "Moe" Dalitz</a> along with Lansky and Stacher who were all present at the 1946 "Havana Conference" in Cuba were not present for this Summit, clearly shows that the Apalachin Summit was strictly a La Cosa Nostra gathering that had no importance for the other National Crime Syndicate Bosses concerning national rules, policies or joint operations.</p>

<p>After the Apalachin Summit meeting that brought Northeastern Family Boss Joseph Barbara nothing, but total aggravation and humiliation. The aggravation was brought on by the subsequent raid on his home by law enforcement authorities and the humiliation was reaped upon him by the arrest and indictment of 62 La Cosa Nostra Bosses that were guaranteed the meeting would be safe and secure at the Barbara estate. This should have been another honor on Joseph Barbara's La Cosa Nostra career since Barbara had hosted a previous national meeting the year before with no problems what so ever, but Barbara had warned Buffalo Boss Stefano Magaddino that he was not comfortable with holding the meeting at his estate once more. Stefano Magaddino and Vito Genovese were the Commission members who called for the meeting once the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Anastasia_c0b7.html" title="Albert Anastasia">Albert Anastasia</a> assassination took place, Magaddino wanted to play the big shot and hold the meeting on one of his close allies territories so he could quietly show that his power and influence had made the meeting and its important agenda a success, but his stupidity and pride backfired. Fellow Castellamarese Clan members Joseph Barbara and Joseph Bonanno had warned Stefano Magaddino that it was not a good idea to hold the meeting in the same venue as the last year and Joseph Barbara warned Magaddino that he and a local cop by the name of Crosswell disliked each other very much and that the cop may cause problems if he discovered the meeting, but Magaddino said it was to late too call it off because all the arrangements had been made and the invitees were already en route. After the raid, arrests and indictments, many of the Bosses held Buffalo crime boss Stefano Magaddino and Vito Genovese responsible for all the trouble that surrounded La Cosa Nostra after Apalachin. Some time after the publicity and heat from law enforcement subsided there was an attempt made on the life of Stefano Magaddino for his unforgivable mistake. Magaddino lived in one of several "Mafia Row" houses on Dana Drive in the suburb of Lewiston, New York, the houses were owned by Magaddino and his son-in-laws James V. LaDuca, Charles A. Montana and Vincent Scro who were all "made" members of his crime Family. In the attempt on his life a grenade was tossed through the window of his home, it failed to detonate, but the message was sent. Joseph Barbara however, who should have reaped the glory, was instead constantly harassed by law enforcement and indicted for not revealing to a grand jury what exactly occurred at his home on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">November 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>. Barbara's business interests even took a beating, he lost his lucrative bottling contract with Canada Dry. Joseph Barbara's health continued to deteriorate and he finally died of a heart-attack on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">June 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, but his old estate still exists to this day, having been bought and used for site seeing tours and then auctioned off a sold a number of other times, with the ranch style home getting new owners with no mafia ties.</p>
