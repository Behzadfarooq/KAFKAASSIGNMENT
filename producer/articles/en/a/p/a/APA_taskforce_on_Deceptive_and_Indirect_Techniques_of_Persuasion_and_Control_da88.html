	    <p>The <i><b>APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC)</b></i> was formed at the request of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychological_Association_357c.html" title="American Psychological Association">American Psychological Association</a> (APA) in 1983. The APA asked <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Singer_e382.html" title="Margaret Singer">Margaret Singer</a>, who was one of the leading proponents of coercive persuasion theories, to chair a <a href="../../../t/a/s/Taskforce.html" title="Taskforce">taskforce</a> to investigate whether <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainwashing.html" title="Brainwashing">brainwashing</a> or "<a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercive_persuasion.html" title="Coercive persuasion">coercive persuasion</a>" did play a role in recruitment in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movements.html" title="New religious movements">New religious movements</a> and other groups.</p>
<p>Before the taskforce had submitted its final report, the APA submitted an <i><a href="../../../a/m/i/Amicus_curi%C3%A6.html" title="Amicus curiæ">amicus curiæ</a></i> brief in a case pending before the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Supreme_Court_f844.html" title="California Supreme Court">California Supreme Court</a>, which involved issues of brainwashing and coercive persuasion. The brief stated that Singer's hypotheses "were uninformed speculations based on skewed data". The APA subsequently withdrew from the brief, stating that its participation was premature in that DIMPAC had not yet submitted its report. Scholars who were co-signatories to the brief did not withdraw.</p>
<p>The final report of the task force was completed in November of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>. The APA Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC report; stating that "it (the report) lacked scientific rigor and an evenhanded critical approach to carry the <i><a href="../../../i/m/p/Imprimatur.html" title="Imprimatur">imprimatur</a></i> of the APA", also stating that "it did not have sufficient information to take a position on the issues that DIMPAC was charged with investigating". The BSERP board requested that the task force members not distribute or publicize the report without indicating that the report was unacceptable to the board and cautioned the taskforce members against using their past appointment to it to imply support or approval by BSERP or APA.</p>
<p>Singer and her professional associate <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociologist.html" title="Sociologist">sociologist</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Ofshe_702e.html" title="Richard Ofshe">Richard Ofshe</a> subsequently sued the APA in 1992 for "defamation, frauds, aiding and abetting and conspiracy" and lost in 1994. Singer was subsequently not accepted by judges as an expert witness in cases alleging brainwashing and mind control.</p>

<p>The task force began the "Ethical Issues for Psychologists" section by citing the preamble to the American Psychological Association's <i>Ethical Principles of Psychologists</i>, and emphasizing the need for the dignity of the individual, as well as the need for psychologists to increase the knowledge and understandings of themselves, human beings and human behaviour, and the nature of human interaction.</p>
<p>They contrasted the "self-development" and "caretaker" attitudes that psychologists often take when treating patients, and focused on the ethical aspects of changes and innovation within their profession.</p>
<p>Finally, the task force warned of the <i>"dangers posed by the inappropriate use of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control"</i>, and also stated that the danger is far greater when these techniques are utilized by untrained individuals or <a href="../../../l/a/r/Large_group_awareness_training.html" title="Large group awareness training">large group awareness training</a> organizations due to their lack of professional qualifications.<sup id="_ref-DIMPAC_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DIMPAC" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>The task force stated that the growth of cults and large group awareness training organizations, particularly those that advocate "moral positions antithetical to the mainstream", contribute to a conflict that exists with regard to religious pluralism. Specifically, the need for a pluralistic society to maintain tolerance, balanced against <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalism.html" title="Totalism">totalism</a>.</p>
<p>The task force goes on to focus on the challenge of establishing an "ethical consensus" between pluralism and "moral anarchy". They state that the "study of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control in cults and large group awareness trainings" exemplifies the "unethical extreme of persuasive processes", and can serve as a fram of reference for the manner in which these groups attempt to influence public perceptions. They state that more research is required in order to understand how to integrate the body of social psychology and apply it to what they define as the "influence continuum."<sup id="_ref-DIMPAC_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DIMPAC" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>The three main recommendations of the task force focused on the areas of research, professional ethics and education, and public policy.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Research</dt>
</dl>
<p>The task force put forth two recommendations in the area of research. First, they emphasized that psychologists should spend more time trying to understand indirect and deceptive social influence techniques. Second, they stated that this study of "deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control" should be accompanied by a study of how to resist/neutralize these techniques, as well as a way to treat those who have been harmed by them.<sup id="_ref-DIMPAC_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DIMPAC" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<dl>
<dt>Professional ethics and education</dt>
</dl>
<p>In the area of professional ethics and education, the task force encouraged the American Psychological Association to consider revising future versions of their ethical code; with respect to: "the ethical implications of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control used in LGATs, innovative psychotherapies, and other settings."<sup id="_ref-DIMPAC_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DIMPAC" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<dl>
<dt>Public policy</dt>
</dl>
<p>With regard to public policy, the task force put forth two recommendations as well: First, they stated that psychologists must educate the public about the "deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control". Second, they noted that the increasing amount of litigation related to these techniques poses a threat to "consumers and ethical psychologists." They recommended that the American Psychological Association advocate stricter regulations; for "nonprofessionally run programs" which seek to change behaviour through the use of these techniques.<sup id="_ref-DIMPAC_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DIMPAC" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Before the taskforce had submitted its final report, the APA, together with a group of scholars, submitted on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> an <i><a href="../../../a/m/i/Amicus_curi%C3%A6.html" title="Amicus curiæ">amicus curiæ</a></i> brief in an pending case before the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Supreme_Court_f844.html" title="California Supreme Court">California Supreme Court</a>, involving issues of brainwashing and coercive persuasion related to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unification_Church_2f2f.html" title="Unification Church">Unification Church</a>. The brief stated that Singer's hypotheses were uninformed speculations based on skewed data.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup>. The brief characterized the theory of brainwashing as not scientifically proven and advanced the position that "this commitment to advancing the appropriate use of psychological testimony in the courts carries with it the concomitant duty to be vigilant against those who would use purportedly expert testimony lacking scientific and methodological rigor."</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, the APA filed a motion to withdraw its signature from this brief, as it considered the conclusion premature, in view of the ongoing work of the DIMPAC taskforce.

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_11.html" title="May 11">May 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, the APA <i>Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology</i> (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC report because "the brainwashing theory espoused lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur."<sup id="_ref-APA_memo_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-APA_memo" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The rejection memo was accompanied by two letters from external advisers to the APA that reviewed the report (the internal review of the APA was not made public). One of the letters, from <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Beit-Hallahmi_97f1.html" title="Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi">Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi</a> of the University of Haifa, stated amongst other comments that "lacking psychological theory, the report resorts to sensationalism in the style of certain tabloids" and that "the term 'brainwashing' is not a recognized theoretical concept, and is just a sensationalist 'explanation' more suitable to 'cultists' and revival preachers. It should not be used by psychologists, since it does not explain anything", and asked that the report should not be made public. The second letter, from Jeffrey D. Fisher, said that the report "[...] seems to be unscientific in tone, and biased in nature. It draws conclusions, which in many cases do not mesh well with the evidence presented. At times, the reasoning seems flawed to the point of being almost ridiculous. In fact, the report sometimes seems to be characterized by the use of deceptive, indirect techniques of persuasion and control - the very thing it is investigating".<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The BSERP board also cautioned the taskforce members "against using their past appointment to imply BSERP or APA support or approval of the positions advocated in the report" , and that they shound "not distribute or publicize the report without indicating that the report was unacceptable to the Board."<sup id="_ref-APA_memo_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-APA_memo" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The memorandum concludes with "Finally, after much consideration, BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue."<sup id="_ref-APA_memo_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-APA_memo" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>On August of 1988, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals overturned the <i>Kropinski v. World Plan Executive Council</i> case, based on the lack of scientific support for the theories presented by Margaret Singer, Ph.D. during her testimony as an expert witness<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1989, the Fourth Appellate District Court of Appeal of California, in the <i>Robin George v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness</i> case, rejected Singer's expert testimony on the basis that the brainwashing theory of false imprisonment was an attempt to premise tort liability on religious practices that the plaintiff believed to be objectionable, and that such premise was inconsistent with the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Amendment_8cc4.html" title="First Amendment">First Amendment</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1990, District Court Judge Lowell Jensen excluded her testimony in <i>United States v. Fishman</i>, because the Court was not convinced that the application of coercive persuasion theory to religious cults was widely accepted in the medical community and did not accept the coercive persuasion theory in the context of cults.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1991, in the <i>Patrick Ryan v. Maharishi Yogi</i> case filed in the US District Court in Washington, DC , Judge Oliver Gasch refused to allow Singer to testify, based on the premises that Singer and Ofshe's theory did not enjoy substantial scientific approval and was therefore not admissible as the basis of expert opinion.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>When her findings were rejected by the APA's BSERP, Singer sued the APA and other scholars in 1992 for "defamation, frauds, aiding and abetting and conspiracy", under the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act_1837.html" title="Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act</a> (RICO), and lost in 1994.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The lawsuit alleged that several top executives at the APA and ASA attempted to destroy their careers, charging that from 1986 to 1992 they resorted to improper influence of witnesses in state court litigations, filed untrue affidavits, attempted to obstruct justice in federal litigations, deceived federal judges, and committed wire and mail fraud. Ofshe and Singer said that these actions damaged their reputations as forensic experts in the fields of psychology and sociology in the area of coercive persuasion, preventing their testimony against cults, and specified acts of collusion between several of the defendants and cult groups.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In an interview with the <i>The Cult Observer</i>, Michael Flomenhaf, a lawyer in the firm representing Singer and Ofshe, said that "All the facts are there. It's a very insidious thing, and it' s hard to believe that such institutions could have engaged in this behavior. This case had to be brought very deliberately because the nature of the complaints causes skepticism". He referred to the relationships of some the defendants as "incestuous".<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>An article in the same <i>The Cult Observer</i>, describes a press release by Flomenhaf in which it is stated that besides the APA, other defendants named where Raymond Fowler (then APA chief executive officer); Leonard Goodstein (former APA executive director); Donald N. Bersoff (lawyer), Bruce J. Ennis (lawyer), Newton Malony (professor at the <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fuller_Theological_Seminary_02e6.html" title="Fuller Theological Seminary">Fuller Theological Seminary</a>, Pasadena, California), James Richardson (professor at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Nevada_93ae.html" title="University of Nevada">University of Nevada</a>, Rodney Stark (professor at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Washington_e29d.html" title="University of Washington">University of Washington</a>), Joan Huber (former president of the ASA and professor at <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_State_University_2761.html" title="Ohio State University">Ohio State University</a>), William D'Antonio (former ASA president and professor at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Massachusetts_d915.html" title="University of Massachusetts">University of Massachusetts</a>), and Dick Anthony, (resident of Albany, California, and writer on new religious movements.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[12]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The case was dismissed by the court on the basis that the claims of defamation, frauds, aiding and abetting and conspiracy constituted a dispute over the application of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Amendment_8cc4.html" title="First Amendment">First Amendment</a> to a public debate over academic and professional matters; that the parties may be be described as the opposing camps in a longstanding debate over certain theories in the field of psychology, and that the plaintiffs could not establish deceit with reference to representations made to other parties in the lawsuit.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

They quote <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Zablocki_9830.html" title="Benjamin Zablocki">Benjamin Zablocki</a>, professor of sociology and one of the reviewers of the rejected DIMPAC report, as writing in 1997 that people were "misled about the true position of the APA and the ASA with regard to brainwashing", and that the APA urged scholars to do more research on the matter. They also write that they have reason to believe that the APA still considers "psychological coercion" to be a phenomenon worth investigating, and not a notion rejected by the scientific community.</p>
<p>They quoted <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Zablocki_9830.html" title="Benjamin Zablocki">Benjamin Zablocki</a> from a personal email: "In my opinion, the DIMPAC committee went too far in the other direction by asking the APA to affirm that brainwashing in religious cults was a proven psychological fact. It was for this that they were censured. It is not true that the APA affirmed the contrary, that brainwashing was disproved. Instead, the APA argued that it could not go along with EITHER SIDE in this matter. I would say that neither side got what it wanted from the APA. As an organization representing ALL psychologists in the USA, it took a proper agnostic position that no final decision could be given at this time".<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

The disputant may fairly be described as the opposing camps in a longstanding debate over certain theories in the field of psychology. The speech of which the plaintiff's complain, which occurred in the context of prior litigation and allegedly involved the "fraudulent" addition of the names of certain defendants to documents filed in said prior litigation, would clearly have been protected as comment on a public issue whether or not the statements were made in the contest of legal briefs. The court need not consider whether the privilege of Civil Code 47 (b) extends to an alleged interloper in a legal proceeding. Plaintiffs have not presented sufficient evidence to establish any reasonable probability of success on any cause of action.

"The Deprogramming Survivors Network issued the following: The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York recently dismissed psychologist Margaret Singer's suit alleging a conspiracy by the American Psychological Association (APA) to destroy her reputation. Singer and her colleague, sociologist Richard Ofshe, had sued the APA, the American Sociological Association (ASA) and 12 individual scholars and lawyers under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Their suit charged that the two organizations and 12 individuals conspired to ruin their credibility as "expert witnesses" in lawsuits concerning new religious movements, thus preventing them from earning personal income. In dismissing Singer and Ofshe's complaint, Judge Lawrence M.McKenna found that "the amended complaint in the present case simply cannot sustain a RICO claim ... no 'pattern' of racketeering activity can be discerned from the acts alleged." "The decision is another stunning victory for religious freedom and freedom of speech in America," said Dr. Isaac N. Brooks Jr., nationalp resident of the Deprogramming Survivors Network, an organization formed to eradicate religious kidnapping and deprogrammings by pushing for criminal prosecutions of deprogrammers. "For years, Singer and otherslike her have engaged in a racket to profit from asserting falset heories in courtrooms. Once again, they have been exposed."</li>

"The professionalization of the ACM was accompanied by a broad-based effort to reconceptualize mind control theory so that it would pass muster with the judiciary and professional associations that adjudicated the standards for knowledge as well as account for “walkaways” and address the growing opposition to mind control theories from NRM scholars. [...] In a campaign to gain professional legitimacy, ACM-connected psychologists sought the support of the American Psychological Association for mind control ideology. In 1983 a task force, the Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC), was established to report to the APA's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility (BSERP). ACM members dominated the task force. When a report was submitted three years later, BSERP concluded that it lacked scientific rigor and rejected it. [...] Overall, the effort to revamp ACM ideology was never completely successful, although it was more successful in popular than scientific culture.</li>
