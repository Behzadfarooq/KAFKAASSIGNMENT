Jay, how does redirecting to segregation deal with the term "global apartheid" or, for that matter "Israeli apartheid" when neither of those phrases appear on that page?Homey 03:26, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And how can you possibly argue that terms such as <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_wall.html" title="Apartheid wall">Apartheid wall</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> do not justify a disambiguation article?Homey 03:42, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe we should disambiguate <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritual_murder.html" title="Ritual murder">ritual murder</a> and say that it "is a term used by some critics" to describe Jewish customs? ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 05:25, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is clear you are trying to introduce pov into a disambiguation page. It is obviously not needed.

<dd>Adding Israel here is not encyclopedic. This was a slanderous allegation, applied to Israel specifically with one purpose - to demonize it. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 08:01, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Some simple questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_wall.html" title="Apartheid wall">Apartheid wall</a></li>
</ul>
<p>1) Is <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Apartheid (disambiguation)">Apartheid (disambiguation)</a> a disambiguation page, intended to differentiate articles associated with the same title/word, in this case "apartheid? Yes or no?</p>
<p>2) Do the two articles in question have "apartheid" as part of their official titles (that is, they're not redirects)? Yes or no?</p>
<p>3) Are the two articles legitimate articles? Yes or no?</p>
<p>So if the answer to the above questions are all "yes", what POSSIBLE justification is there for excluding the two articles from the disambig page? Try to answer without resorting to the coy "we're part of the Zionist conspiracy ha ha" nonsense (it's an intellectually dishonest cop-out intended to make your opponents look like conspiracy nuts) or the handwaving "I don't like those articles" nonsense. And try to answer these simple questions without insulting my intelligence. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 08:45, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
From the edit summary <i>Those are not encyclopedic terms. They are slanderous allegations.</i> Sigh. Try not insult people's intelligence: are these actual encyclopedia articles? Yes? <b>Then by definition they're encyclopedic</b>. If you claim they're not, take it up with <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 08:49, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think you misunderstand the meaning of "unencyclopedic" in the context. It means it does not belong in an encyclopedia, in fact wikipedia has several unencyclopedic articles, it is not necessarily an oxymoron.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 08:52, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Calton is 100% correct. This is a disambiguation page, an index page. It must link to all the articles we have which contain the word 'apartheid'. Whether it's a slanderous term doesn't matter in the slightest - that's something to discuss in the relevant article, or AfD. From the post above you seem to be more concerned with the term itself than the mechanical function of disambiguation, and you're in the wrong place. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 11:16, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe</a>, this is not slander, though your insistence that your opponents are trying to demonise Isreal may well be slander. Please take a look at some other disambiguation pages, such as <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Allah (disambiguation)">Allah (disambiguation)</a> (which links to, among opther things, a satirical blog).</dd>
<dd>Someone should probably restore the links soon. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 15:52, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I support the reasoning of Calton and San Blanning above. I'd ask a non-involved admin to unprotect the page so that the disambiguation links can be restored. This is not the place to argue about the POV of one or more articles that are linked to in a dab page; if you have problems with the contents of those articles, discuss them on their respective talk pages, attach a cleanup or NPOV tag, bring them to AfD, or whatever, but trying to exclude them from a dab page on the grounds of being "slander" is simply against Wikipedia policy and precedent. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 16:42, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I find the arguments above flawed. In this case, terminology is intentionally misused/abused by pundits. This slanderous allegation was applied to Israel with one purpose - to demonize it. If you insist to include everyone/everything subjected to slander in disambigs, consider starting with Fascist (disambiguation). ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 19:21, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once again, you're talking about an issue that isn't relevant here. I'm not sure whether those articles should exist or not, but as long as they <i>do</i> exist and contain the word 'apartheid' in the title, they must be linked to from the relevant disambiguation page. And there is no fascist (disambiguation), so I'm not sure what you're getting at there. There is a <a href="../../../f/a/s/Template%7EFascism_225c.html" title="Template:Fascism">Template:Fascism</a>, which includes our articles on <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerical_fascism.html" title="Clerical fascism">clerical fascism</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-fascism.html" title="Neo-fascism">neo-fascism</a>, two terms which could also be seen as abusive terminology. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:34, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've read some of the discussion here, especially Abakharev's comments. My question is, do we need this disambiguation page <i>at all</i>? The term "Apartheid" refers to the South African regime. There is no ambiguity in that - even in phrases like "Israeli Apartheid" or "Basque Apartheid" or "Global Apartheid" the word "Apartheid" refers to the South African regime. I suggest that we simply put this disambiguation up for AfD. Possibly with a note in the <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> article that some has used the word "Apartheid" as a pejorative epithet, but I am not sure this is notable enough for the article. -- <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor"><font color="#000040"><b>H</b></font><font color="#400000">eptor</font></a> <a href="../../../h/e/p/User_talk%7EHeptor_c1c0.html" title="User talk:Heptor"><sub><small><font color="#400000">talk</font></small></sub></a> 09:41, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, it may be that the existence of this disambiguation page is in fact wrong. From <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a>: <i>"Lists of articles of which the disambiguated term forms only a part of the article title don't belong here. Disambiguation pages are not search indices. Do not add links that merely contain part of the page title (where there is no significant risk of confusion)."</i> This seems to apply here. Given that, I would support deletion on an AfD for this page. That doesn't mean I'm reversing my position on the Israeli links above though - as long as the article <i>is</i>, rightly or wrongly, a list of articles which contain the word 'apartheid', it should contain all of them. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 10:41, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A) that's a guideline not a policy B) Look around at some disambiguation pages and you'll see that, in fact, they do often disambiguate between articles that share only part of their title. For instance, see <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Abbey (disambiguation)">Abbey (disambiguation)</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acadian_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Acadian (disambiguation)">Acadian (disambiguation)</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achilles_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Achilles (disambiguation)">Achilles (disambiguation)</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/i/Acid_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Acid (disambiguation)">Acid (disambiguation)</a> (I'm not even finished the "A"s yet- I could probably list another 20 before getting to B).

<p>Moshe, do you know the difference between a guideline and a policy on wikipedia?Homey 02:38, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes I do, but a guideline is not supposed to be completly disregarded because you feel like it, it is clear that there is no reason to not follow it here.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 02:40, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's not disregarded because "I feel like it" but because most editors do not support it. Disagree with me? Why don't you start going to other disambig pages and removing the links that contradict the guideline? I guarantee that you won't get very far doing that before a) dozens of irate editors start "whooping your ass" and b) the guideline is changed.</p>

<dd>Yes, I do see that there is a general consensus, or at least a wide majority, here, but I still don't think that a couple of days of protection will hurt--perhaps after that time Moshe will calm down and refrain from edit-warring.

Note as well that my reversion is not an endorsement of that version (nor was my originally protecting "his" version)--I'm not involved in this dispute at all.

<dd>As I said before, I made a mistake by not more closely examining the discussion. Homeontherage approached me, stating in full confidence that there was a consensus against your opinion.

In my experience this word has expanded beyond its narrow, literal definition and this page should include a few of its more recent applications, whether rightly or wrongly. The current version seems more useful than Moshe's. Also, while it isn;t exactly what a disambiguation page is supposed to be, it is still useful, so I wouldn't delete it. Have fun warring y'all!

<dd>Homey, in response to your question about what parts of the article are not neutral, I do believe people have been clear about what parts of the article they object to. However here's another take on it: Articles "should fairly represent all significant viewpoints, in proportion to the prominence of each." The article currently describes several labels used by people with certain beliefs, but it does not describe any of the equally-inflammatory labels that the people with opposite beliefs would sling back.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've done a lot of thinking about this over the past few days, and I believe what we're all looking for is fairness. I would like to see more clear guidelines in Wikipedia about usage of epithets as article titles; it is important that everyone has equal opportuntity to make articles out of their epithets and to put epithets on disambiguation pages. I can't see a way to solve the undue-weight we're seeing here given what the titles of the articles are. The undue-weight problem is one of several reasons that I think (IMHO) Wikipedia should generally discourage having inflammatory (and, in particular, accusatory) epithets as article titles. Perhaps in order to reach consensus here Wikipedia guidelines need to be clarified, and then applied to all articles about epithets, not just the ones listed here. <a href="../../../s/u/-/User%7ESu-laine.yeo_5d6d.html" title="User:Su-laine.yeo">Su-laine.yeo</a> 09:23, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>That's really an argument for the AFD and as the AFD has failed we are left with an Israeli apartheid article and an Apartheid Wall redirect. The question is how to deal with them on a disambiguation page. As to your first point, this is a disambiguation page and not an article so there's no place for the "equally inflammatory lables that the people with opposite beliefs would sling back," all we can do is list the articles with a minimum of prose and in a neutral manner but we do have to list the article names. If the POV objection is to the names themselves then that's not really an issue for the disambig page and, as I mentioned, that issue has been dealt with (or is being dealt with) via the AFDs.Homey 00:20, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I propose a solution to the issue posed by the guideline regarding disambiguation pages (and the resulting AfD): keep the article, and simply remove "(disambiguation)" from the article title. Thus, this would become the article <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>, with a short definition and citation to the Afrikaans origin, and then links to the various usages, with <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">History of South Africa in the apartheid era</a> being the first and most prominent link, with the others following, retaining the language about usage being an analogy to South African apartheid.</p>
<p>This solves the disambiguation guideline issue. I don't believe there is a consensus to delete this article, and argued in favor of keeping it, but I acknowledge the argument that it is less of a literal/classic disambiguation page and more of a "here are some uses of the term which have Wikipedia articles" page. I believe there are a number of precedents for that type of page, where a term is discussed in different contexts, some or all of which have individual articles. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 06:21, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The primary use of the term apartheid is in regards to South African apartheid. In cases when a term and a single overriding use it is typical to have the article on the word or phrase be on that use and have a second page with "(disambiguation)" in the title.

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I know there is a lot of disagreement going on regarding the dismabiguation of this page. I've read over the discussion and the various AfDs, and having worked on disambiguation pages a bit, I thought I'd add a few outside opinions that might help with the discussion.</p>
<p>One of the issues is what entries belong on disambiguation pages. As has been stated, <a href="../../../d/_/_/WP%7ED_9a57.html#Lists" title="WP:D">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> does state that disambiguation pages should not simply be lists of all the articles containing the term being disambiguated. This is certainly true, but at the same time, it does not mean that just because an article has words other than the word being disambiguated, it should be excluded from the disambiguation page.</p>
<p>Although this seems like a tough call to make, it may not be as hard as is thought. A pretty good way to think about it is "if someone searches for this term, is it possible that they could be looking for this article?" So in this situation, "if someone searched for 'apartheid', could they really be looking for &lt;whatever article is in question&gt;?"</p>
<p>It should be noted that since this page is at <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Apartheid (disambiguation)">Apartheid (disambiguation)</a>, the primary topic has already been established. <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> redirects to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">History of South Africa in the apartheid era</a>, meaning that this disambiguation page is only accessed if someone searches for "Apartheid" and isn't looking for that article. This should relieve a lot of issues from the disagreement - there is no issue with the Apartheid in Africa being the primary topic. All the other articles listed here are ones that are much less likely to be searched for, but still may be valid.</p>
<p>I might suggest waiting until the various AfDs regarding all the articles currently liked to on this page complete, and then deciding where to go from there. Once it's determined which articles are appropriate to be articles, then it can be decided which are likely to be searched for with the term "apartheid".</p>
<p>Remember, the goal of disambiguation pages is to aid in the searching of Wikipedia. We do not want to have a myriad uneeded articles linked to from the pages, but at the same time we don't want to cause people to have to search to much to find the article they are looking for.</p>

<dd>Don't you find the circumstances of the creation of this "disambiguation" page, and the subsequent discussions regarding it and its associated articles, to be at all troubling? You can see those circumstances for yourself in the edit histories, the related articles and AfD pages and related talk pages, but just start with these:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>This disambiguation page was created only 90 minutes after the <i>same</i> editor created the "Israeli apartheid" page;</li>
<li>During those 90 minutes, the same editor's first move was to move the article about South African Apartheid to just "Apartheid" and then place on that page the following statement: <i>This article refers to apartheid as it originated in South Africa. To see an article on the term as used to describe Israeli policies see <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a>.</i> (Of course, this statement was advertisement for the "Israeli apartheid" page that the same editor had just created);</li>
<li>When this d. page was created, the <i>only</i> pages to which it referred were the South African apartheid page (to which "apartheid" had previously redirected); the just-created "Israeli apartheid" page; and the "Apartheid Wall" page;</li>
<li>Both of the non-South Africa pages to which this page originally referred are thinly-veiled propaganda attacks on Israel;</li>
<li>Over the two days after this article was created, as the controversy erupted, the <i>same</i> editor created pages on "global apartheid," "gender apartheid" and "sexual apartheid" in order to create more articles for this article to "disambiguate" to...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I could go on, and talk about the same editor's use, and in some cases abuse and misuse, of both the rules and policies of Wikipedia and of his position as an administrator, to fend off all attempts to reduce or remove the POV implications of this article and the related articles, or to redirect or delete it; his twisting of the words of other editors on talk pages (including mine); and other conduct about which others know more than I. But even apart from the conduct of the creator of these articles, I believe the most important point is that while the purpose of a disambiguation page is to <i>reduce</i> confusion, <b>the effect of this disamabiguation page is to create confusion. not reduce it.</b> I believe that the circumstances show that this is not only the effect of the page, it was its purpose, as well. It is part of a propaganda attack on Israel. I do not think Wikipedia should allow itself to be used for such a thing. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 05:03, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Natalya, thanks for stepping in. I'm glad you're here. Could you provide any examples of dab pages that have been as controversial as this one? I wouldn't be surprised if there are some controversial dab pages, but in this case people feel that they're being attacked through the page and that kind of brings it to another level. Maybe looking at a different examples would give us some ideas for getting to consensus. <a href="../../../s/u/-/User%7ESu-laine.yeo_5d6d.html" title="User:Su-laine.yeo">Su-laine.yeo</a> 05:34, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

6SJ7, you have to look at the content of the articles, not attribute motivations to the edtors. The fact remains that in today's world the word apartheid has been applied in myriad ways and has been adopted by various political interests. This was originally developed in the <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> article but there was a POV war to purge that article of any references to "Modern" usages that resulted in that article being moved to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">History of South Africa in the apartheid era</a>. This meant that any "modern" meanings were orphaned. I guess I could say that was done for POV and propaganda reasons in order to insulate Israel from any association with apartheid in wikipedia, despite the fact that in the real world the association is made by many people and thus should be referenced here. But it's not for you or me to impugn the motives of editors. All you can do is judge the articles on their merits. <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_wall.html" title="Apartheid wall">Apartheid wall</a> exists as a term in wikipedia and is redirected to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a>. <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> is an article on wikipedia and it looks like <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_apartheid.html" title="Sexual apartheid">Sexual apartheid</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_apartheid.html" title="Global apartheid">Global apartheid</a> will survive their AFDs.</p>
<p>The fact is that for anyone under 30 their exposure to the word "apartheid" is increasingly likely to be in these senses than in the original meaning. This is particularly the case on campuses where students are exposed regularly to debates about the "apartheid wall" and "Israeli apartheid" and "global apartheid" but less so to the historical qeustions of South African apartheid. That means a disambiguation page is necessary despite the resistance of a small group of pro-Israeli editors who virtually shut down the Apartheid article a year ago for POV reasons and have been fighting the creation of an article on the *phrase* Israeli apartheid tooth and nail despite the phrase having over 300,000 hits on google. You can't censor wikipedia for political reasons. Homey 10:28, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You, Homey, can't use wikipedia for political reasons. As we can see, "a small group of pro-Israeli editors" is not that powerful, so leave your conspiracy theopries for another occasion. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 10:42, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh please, there's no conspiracy theory and I never asserted any particular "power" aside from the usual advantage gained from tag-team editing. There are various circles of editors on wikipedia with common or overlapping interests. Just as there is a group of editors who are strongly pro-Serbian and will intervene in any article they think impugns Serbia, just as there is a group of editors who have a strong interest in libertarianism and will intervene in any article that they think impugns libertarianism, just as there is a small group of Muslim editors who will intervene on Muslim issues there is a small group of editors who is strongly pro-Israel and will do the same. There is no conspiracy but as in any environment there are clusters of people with interests who work together. Homey 11:03, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Look at the history and debates in the <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> article and <a href="../../../a/p/a/Talk%7EApartheid_4806.html" title="Talk:Apartheid">Talk:Apartheid</a> and tell me that it isn't completely out of whack with reality that we have no apartheid article today. Can you explain to me why that is?Homey 11:05, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Lets all please try and refrain from <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. That should make the discussion much calmer and easier. It seems that the discussion on the various apartheid pages is overflowing onto this page. A disambiguation page does not need to be a controversial article. It is one thing for the articles listed on the disambiguation page to be in dispute, but until those disputes are corrected, the disambiguation page should just be there to do its disambiguating. If an article is AfDed, then it should be removed from the page. If it is not, then it has some purpose, and should be left on (if it is appropriate from the page). It is absoultely fine to disagree with the articles listed on this disambiguation page, but those issues are more usefully addressed when brought up at the specific articles. I know that they are already being discussed at great length, but it seems like the overflow from those discussions to here is what is causing much of the issue, which does not need to happen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for previous conflicts with disambiguation pages, there certainly have been a lot, a few examples including <a href="../../../k/a/f/Kaffir.html" title="Kaffir">Kaffir</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/v/Talk%7ERavi_Shankar_0d42.html#Disambiguation" title="Talk:Ravi Shankar">Ravi Shankar</a>, and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGreenwich_University_64f1.html" title="Talk:Greenwich University">Greenwich University</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_459d.html" title="User:Natalya">Nataly</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_Esperanza_9860.html" title="User:Natalya/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a> 14:15, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nothing to lose at this point by making a new proposal. Actually this is a recycling of someone else's idea buried somewhere in an old Talk page I can no longer find. How about something along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Apartheid</b> usually refers to <b><a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">Apartheid in South Africa</a></b>, the system of racial segregation in South Africa prior to the early 1990s.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The term "apartheid" is also sometimes used as a <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">political epithet</a></b> to describe practices that segregate and discriminate against ethnic groups. For example, the term is used to describe past and current practices in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israel</a> for its treatment of the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestinian</a> population, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> for its treatment of aboriginals, <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> for...</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The "apartheid wall" is a controversial epithet to describe the <b><a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a></b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the outcome of the AfD discussions, we might need to include references to Gender, Sexual, and Global apartheid.</p>
<p>Some remarks about this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the reader's convenience, it provides a direct link to the articles. If a user is looking for "apartheid" with Israel in mind, this page will meet their needs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It does not single out one country for criticism. I hope this will satisfy those of you who feel that Israel is being unfairly singled-out. As a Canadian, I don't mind seeing Canada in a list of many countries; I would be upset if Canada was the only country other than South Africa named on the page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It does not publicize the "Israeli apartheid" epithet that many people find offensive. I find the use of offensive epithets to be offensive even if I agree with the gist of what the epithet says.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It educates the reader with the relevant fact that the analogy has been applied to many countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't expect this proposal to be perfect. In particular we can probably work on the best examples for the countries to be named. Do you think the proposal is something we can refine into something acceptable? <a href="../../../s/u/-/User%7ESu-laine.yeo_5d6d.html" title="User:Su-laine.yeo">Su-laine.yeo</a> 05:15, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>this is a great suggestion</b> just be more bold and accurate:</p>
<p>"*The term "apartheid" is also sometimes used as a <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">political epithet</a></b> to negativly portray one side ina political debate and present it's action as a refelection of the south Africa policis during Apartheid era. It is a controversial comparison, sometimes used to demonize a specific group or country and usualy based on drawing controvesial and false analogies to South Africa practices to segregate and discriminate against ethnic groups. For example, the term is used to describe past and current practices in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israel</a> for its treatment of the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestinian</a> population, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> for its treatment of aboriginals, <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> for..." <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 05:23, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>For the reader's convenience, it provides a direct link to the articles. If a user is looking for "apartheid" with Israel in mind, this page will meet their needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not really, it doesn't even mention <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> - instead it makes the user think the link is just to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>. Rather than conveniencing the reader it does quite the opposite. Why not just be straightforward and a) acknowledge that the term (and article) exist and b) acknowledge that the term is controversial and contested?</p>
<ul>
<li>It does not publicize the "Israeli apartheid" epithet that many people find offensive. I find the use of offensive epithets to be offensive even if I agree with the gist of what the epithet says.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article survived AFD, no point in trying to hide it now or pretend it doesn't exist. We have many articles for controversial phrases and words and many of them are listed on disambig pages. There's no reason to act differently here. Instead of censoring or bowlderizing simply acknowledge that the phrase *is* used and acknowledge that it is controversial. It's not like the term "apartheid state" or "Israeli apartheid" never appear in the Israeli media. Homey 05:25, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As for Zeq's suggestion it is completely POV, polemical, one-sided and inappropriate. You are writing as if you are putting together an op-ed piece or an argumentative essay. Homey 05:57, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>actually the use of the word "apartheid" is by itself polemical and designed to create negative emotional response so we need to mention this fact right at the start in order to NPOV the impression this word creats. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 06:01, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I have to say I prefer the page as it is currently, however I also think Su-laine.yeo's proposal has it's merits.

<li>The term "apartheid" is also sometimes used as a political epithet to describe practices that segregate and discriminate against ethnic groups, a controversial comparison to the practices of Aparteid era South Africa.

<dd>Finding the most-NPOV word to use would require not using "apartheid" to describe Israel in the first place. Then we wouldn't have to worry about "term" or "phrase" or "epithet" or anything else. I think the person who put "epithet" in the title was trying to balance a strongly POV word with something that would render the title, overall, somewhere in the middle.

The Apartheid was a system of racial segregation that was enforced in South Africa from 1948 to 1991.
Apartheid may also refer to:
* Apartheid outside of South Africa, a description of events compared to the South African apartheid
* Israeli apartheid, used by some to compare policies of the Israeli government to that of the South African apartheid
* Global apartheid, used by some to describe the "First World's" relationship to the "Third World"
* Gender apartheid, used by some to describe gender-based discrimination
* Sexual apartheid, used by some to describe sexual orientation discrimination
* The apartheid wall, used by some detractors as a name for the Israeli West Bank barrier

<p>It would be wrong of WP to impugn the motives of Desmond Tutu and others who've applied the word apartheid to Israel. The phrase "apartheid state" refers to a system and is applied to Israel as part of an analysis which may be right or wrong - but it's not for us to take sides or be dismissive by adding epithets like epithet. As for your desire to eliminate the Israeli apartheid article and merge it I don't think it shows a lot of respect for wikipedia to so blatantly try to circumvent the AFD on Israeli apartheid.

<p>We may not (and probably do not) agree that some of the article listed on this page are worthy articles. That doesn't mean that it should be argued over whether or not they are to be included.

<p>I've moved my suggestion from one of the above section here, with some of the suggested modifications made. There didn't seem to be too much disagreement with it, and if we can modify it so that it can appease everyone, we will have made a great deal of progress.</p>

<p>Below is a copy of a conversation I have had with Homey. He suggested that <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_459d.html" title="User:Natalya">Nataly</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_Esperanza_9860.html" title="User:Natalya/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a> comment here. I feel that adding the wall is redundant to the article, as described below, and that unless we are willing to add every example of every form of every action that has been alledged to be apartheid, it is the equivalent of "cherry-picking" a particular issue. My opinion is more fully described in the conversation below. Of course, I always reserve the right to be mistaken or convinced by reasoned and reasonable discourse 8-) . -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 19:39, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1) What does the RFA have to do with including apartheid wall in the disambig page?</p>
<p>2) I can AGF but that doesn't change the fact that no credible reason has been given for removing the link. Homey 15:49, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Isn't the entire subject of apartheid as it relates to non-SOuth-African countries under a RfAR? Also, doesn't the fact that <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> is listed on the page, and Apartheid Wall is mentioned prominently in that article, make adding it to the disamb redundant?

<p>No. Just the Israeli apartheid article and not in relation to its content. The disambig article and/or apartheid wall is not subject to the RFA. Homey 18:11, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did a) it's dealt with in passing 13 paragraphs into that article b) the main place it is dealt with is <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a> where it has its own section.

<dd>This is supposed to be a <b>disambiguation page</b>, a place that points the reader to the right place if they type in a term that can mean several things. If <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> can conceivably mean something real, then apartheid wall is definitely a political epithet. Besides, Arbcom deals with conduct not content, so it doesn't really matter whether it's redundant or not. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 19:59, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"a place that points the reader to the right place if they type in a term that can mean several things". Yes, and the "right place" for apartheid wall is the section in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a> which Natalya linked to. Homey 20:04, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This brings up another, but directly related, point. If the issue is apartheid, then the proper place for it is <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a>. The fact that the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a> is called the apartheid wall, is secondary in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a> article and should be primary in the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> article. As you say, if the “apartheidness” of the wall is primarily handled in the wrong article, doesn't it make more sense to correct the article? -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 20:33, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Avi, I agree with what you have done in moving the "Apartheid wall" material to the "Allegations of..." article, with only a small summary remaining in the "barrier" article. Since it appears that the "Allegations of..." article will (unfortunately) remain as a separate article, at least this move keeps most of the POV propaganda together in one place instead of being spread far and wide. As a result, I think the "apartheid wall" mention needs to be removed from this disambiguation page. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 20:54, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>There was a consensus in AFD on merging apartheid wall with Israel West Bank barrier. This shouldn't be overturned unilaterally and it certainly shouldn't be passed off as a minor edit. Homey 20:57, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On disambiguation pages, there does not necessarily have to be an article solely on the subject for the subject to be listed. In the suggestion above, the term is mentioned, and then the article which contains it is linked to. That way, the term is still mentioned, but the correct article is linked to. This is a frequent occurance on disambiguation pages.

<p>It is a good point that including the link to the section of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a> regarding the apartheid wall does verge on including too much information on disambiguation pages. The reason it may be valid to be there is that at one point it was a separate article, and although it's now been merged, it is still a valid use of the word. If we can decide that it is indeed not a notable enough use of the word, then it can be removed.</p>
<p>On another, and less happier note, I requested another admin to re-protect this page (since I am invloved in discussions, it's not appropriate for me to do). I'm sorry to see that it has turned back into a revert war, but since no one has taken heed of the suggestions to discuss before editing, protection will force us to do so. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_459d.html" title="User:Natalya">Nataly</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_Esperanza_9860.html" title="User:Natalya/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a> 23:18, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Apartheid wall" has 434,000 hits on google and it seems to be the preferred term used by its opponents (who should not be described in a blanket fashion as "extremists"). See, for instance <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=288845&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=14&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y" class="external text" title="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=288845&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=14&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y" rel="nofollow">this article in Ha'aretz</a>Homey 07:19, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Still, a disambiguation page is not a place to push POV. It is only a disambiguation page. all the POV needs to be elsewhere where it could NPOV. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 07:23, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A disambiguation page is definitly not a place for anything that is not <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. I don't think the term will need to be included though, and here's why. Since apartheid wall is apparently a very well-known term (as is seen by its many google hits), if someone is searching for information on it, they will be very likely to search directly for "apartheid wall", which will take them to whatever article is decided as the correct redirect. The likliness of someone searching for "apartheid" and looking for the "apartheid wall" appears to be rather low, and since disambiguation pages should only include those articles which are likely to be confused, it doesn't seem necessary. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_459d.html" title="User:Natalya">Nataly</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_Esperanza_9860.html" title="User:Natalya/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a> 11:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>I have two questions of my own:</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) Why are JayJG and FeloniousMonk suggesting that I'm acting as a proxy for a banned user, when this is clearly not the case?</li>
<li>(ii) Why is FeloniousMonk removing the "mergeto" notices that I've placed on the "Global apartheid" and "Sexual apartheid" articles? It seems obvious that there is disagreement on these points; a call for discussion seems entirely appropriate. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 23:03, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I see your explanation, but I don't find it very strong; I've responded to it. Regarding your questions:</dd>
<dd>(i) As it clearly <i>is</i> the case, the answer is quite obvious.</dd>
<dd>(ii) As the articles have already been merged by common consensus (moved by one editor, supported by at least 5 others), there is no need for a merge notice. The real question is, why suggest an article be merged when the merger has already taken place? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:10, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(i) Really? What banned editor are you speaking of?</dd>
<dd>(ii) The "common censensus" appears to represent only one side of the discussion. Since there's clearly some disagreement on this point, a "mergeto" notice seems entirely appropriate. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 23:14, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(i) I'm not playing. You know. :-)</dd>
<dd>(ii) The only one disagreeing is you, at least until you round up some more buddies (soon enough, no doubt). <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">User:Beland</a> merged the articles 3 weeks ago, and there was no objection whatsoever until the banned editor noticed it yesterday and started reverting. Then, in a completely "unexpected" turn of events, his long-term friend showed up to revert for him as well. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:23, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(i) The thought <i>has occurred to me</i> that you may be referring to someone from our previous discussions ... but he was never banned, so that can't be it. I'm at a loss as to who else it could be.</dd>
<dd>(ii) No, Jay, I'm not planning to drag in five associates to create the false appearance of consensus. There's quite enough of that on Wikipedia already. I've made my points, and we'll see what the response is. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 23:28, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(i) Disingenuous comments may not be as helpful as you think.</dd>
<dd>(ii) I hope you're not implying that <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">User:Beland</a> dragged 5 associates into this issue to back him up; that would be a completely unwarranted <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">lack of good faith</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(i) Well, if you could identify the currently-banned user you're referring to, the matter would be resolved.</dd>
<dd>(ii) I wasn't referring to this article in particular. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 23:58, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lets take a deep breath for a second, everyone. This doesn't need to be a big issue. There's nothing wrong with disagreeing with the merging of articles. However, until the disagreement is resolved, the links on the disambiguation page should reflect the current status. Since the articles in question are at the moment, still merged into <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_outside_South_Africa_fdba.html" title="Apartheid outside South Africa">Apartheid outside South Africa</a>, the links should stay as is if/until any change is made. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_459d.html" title="User:Natalya">Nataly</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_Esperanza_9860.html" title="User:Natalya/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a> 15:33, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The section heading about says it all. I am having great difficulty seeing what purpose this page serves. As some have pointed out in the past, it is not really a disambiguation page at all -- it does not clarify meanings among the same or similar terms. (So please excuse the somewhat sarcastic edit summary that I just wrote, as I know that people <i>have</i> noticed this; I wish edit summaries were edit-able.) The <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_apartheid.html" title="Allegations of apartheid">Allegations of apartheid</a> article serves the same purpose as this page, and is far preferable, since it is a substantive article. All this page really does is to proliferate the word "apartheid" on Wikipedia without adding any actual content. What does anyone else think? <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 06:06, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
