	    <p>It seems more sensible to name this article Apartheid(political epithet) and place an disambiguation page. Then every bombastic statement used to malign different cultures, countries, religions Serengetti tribes etc. can be placed in this article. The entire idea of apartheid outside South Africa sounds ridiculous. What other country inscribes the legal seperation of one ethnicity from another based on genetics and ties those people not fit based on some arbitrary norm of purity to legally to work as manorial servants and proscribes civil rights and liberties? Unless South Africa Jr. suddenly rises up, labelling other countries as having apartheid systems is a form of slander or political epithet and this article has no reason to exist for that reason. <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Montag_3a27.html" title="User:Guy Montag">Guy Montag</a> 20:07, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you aware that there is such a thing as a <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html#Apartheid_in_international_law" title="Apartheid">"crime of apartheid"</a> designated by the UN. I think you are trivializing a serious matter here and are continuing the long running edit-war/article creation war/merge war/move war. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 21:34, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I am aware that the General Assembly passed non binding resolutions establishing a vague way to describe apartheid. I am also aware that the ICC has defined it. There are several problems"</p>
<ul>
<li>when accusing someone of apartheid there is no actual Geneva Convention or international treaty that a nation is beholden to follow with regards to apartheid, especially if they are not members of the ICC.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The ICC definition is vague.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is no internationally agreed on criteria on what constitutes legal apartheid other than the offical laws passed by South Africa.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When a state is accused of apatheid, and there is no actual way to prove it, it constitutes slander or political speech promoting an agenda against a state or society, the equivelent of calling someone a Nazi.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I am not trivializing any disputes. There are certain individuals who are dead set on promoting their own agenda with regards to this subject, I am merely attempting to solve the issue by identifying the problem, all of these terms are unproven allegations made against states for political purposes and aimed against their current systems for the purpose of deligitimizing the state accused and bring about its collapse, as with apartheid in South Africa. Hence its a political epithet, and all accusations real or imagined, since there is no way to prove it one way or the other, belong here. <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Montag_3a27.html" title="User:Guy Montag">Guy Montag</a> 01:39, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would argue very strongly that this series of connections ("unproven allegations made against states for political purposes and aimed against their current systems for the purpose of deligitimizing the state accused and bring about its collapse") is a sweaping generalization. Desmond Tutu, when he described the situation in the occupied territories as being like apartheid was not scheming to bring down Israel via delegitimizing it, he was commenting on his abhorence of the way the Palestinians were being treated and trying to increase world attention in order to force a change via world pressure -- these are different things and to only see it one way is simplistic and leads to conflict. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 04:10, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would say that by the equating two separate situations, which have little to do with another, with the system of apartheid has alot to do with deligitimization of of the system it is compared to. Although I am not going to comment on Desmond's motivations, the effect is that the comparison was defamatory. 20:02, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Huh?</dd>
<dd>Anyways, I think the trick is to have an article that deals with the serious accusations from the most opportunitistic use of the term as a slogan or a simple delegitimizing term. Thus let's keep this article as the place for simple use of apartheid as a slogan and deal with more serious usage elsewhere. That sounds like the best solution from my point of view. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 21:38, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Huh? I am not sure if I have to justify myself to you -- you recently put a number of articles in this edit war up to AfD and most of them are failing into non consensus. You have a real partisan position in this fight and I do not feel I need to bend to your will. Anyways, as I have said before, I think things have progressed so far that maybe this whole set of related articles, AfD, merge proposals and moves and various <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> accusations be taken to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration</a> and be settled properly. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 21:47, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to object that calling a state an apartheid necessarily constitutes defamation, your assertion that because a definition is vague that automatically makes it defamation is laughable, that just makes the accusation <i>easier</i> to defend (see <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slander_and_libel.html" title="Slander and libel">Slander_and_libel</a>). And you do realise that this:</dd>

</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>is defence of actions deemed apartheid by the ICC, not an argument against such a classification! Finally, it seems that <i>all</i> sides in this dispute are pushing an agenda, and frankly I find it utterly impossible to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> for many of the protagonists. --Coroebus 10:40, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is the point of creating a duplicate of an existing article which is, itself, a duplicate of an existing article?Homey 02:54, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article has been speedy deleted for being a duplication of (at least) one other article. No, I wasn't the deleting editor.Homey 04:14, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Homey, you reported it, therefore you should be held responsible. What was the official reason for speedy deletion? What was the hurry? ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 23:20, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>My point is I did not actually delete the article myself. I reported it for speedy deletion and let another admin make the call. Reason for speedy deletion was "article is a cut and paste duplication of <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa_3d19.html" title="Apartheid outside of South Africa">Apartheid outside of South Africa</a> which is up for AFD." Homey 23:28, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The new article was undergoing serious editing. <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">WP:SPEEDY</a> has 8 clearcut reasons, and "content I don't like" is not one of them. In this case, you made a mistake and it seems you cannot even accept responsibility for your actions. I must note that you make it very difficult to AGF since you are acting increasingly erratically and irresponsibly. Your activism is turning WP into circus. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 00:40, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yep, he had no justification for even putting this article in speedy deletion. The speedy rules don't cover "duplicated" articles.

<p>One of the sources used in this comes from a very biased source (monabaker.com) and indeed to try and prove it;s "cliam of apartheid" it is using this as a proof "“if it walks like a duck, it is a duck.”.
