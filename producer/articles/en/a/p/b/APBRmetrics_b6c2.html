<p><b>APBRmetrics</b> is the analysis of <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> through objective evidence, especially <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_statistics.html" title="Basketball statistics">basketball statistics</a>. APBRmetrics is a cousin to the study of <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_statistics.html" title="Baseball statistics">baseball statistics</a>, known as <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabermetrics.html" title="Sabermetrics">Sabermetrics</a>, and similarly takes its name from the acronym APBR, which stands for the Association for Professional Basketball Research.</p>
<p>A key tenet for many modern basketball analysts is that basketball is best evaluated at the level of possessions.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> During a single game, both teams have approximately the same number of possessions, because they alternate possession. (A team can have slightly more if it begins and ends a quarter or half with possession.) However, over the course of the season, teams play at very different paces, which can dramatically color their points scored and points allowed per game. Therefore, these analysts favor use of points scored per 100 possessions (Offensive Rating) and points allowed per 100 possessions (Defensive Rating).</p>
<p>A second core tenet is that per-minute statistics are more useful for evaluating players than per-game statistics. From <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hollinger_9b70.html" title="John Hollinger">John Hollinger</a>'s <i>Pro Basketball Forecast</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It's a pretty simple concept, but one that has largely escaped most NBA front offices: The idea that what a player does on a per-minute basis is far more important than his per-game stats. The latter tend to be influenced more by playing time than by quality of play, yet remain the most common metric of player performance."</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/b/APBRmetrics_b6c2.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>While the use of possession stats dates back at least as far as former <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill_49d1.html" title="University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill">North Carolina</a> Coach <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_McGuire_e356.html" title="Frank McGuire">Frank McGuire</a>, modern APBRmetrics came into existence when <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_7752.html" title="Bill James">Bill James</a> gained popularity for his <i>Baseball Abstracts</i> and basketball enthusiasts borrowed some of the ideas and the overall philosophy of the importance of statistical analysis for finetuning achievement. Early APBRmetricians focused on "linear weights" statistics, which assign a value to each key statistic and add and subtract to find a player's total efficiency, usually on a per-minute basis and various brands of this were created and often became the basis for books. Among these people were Dave Heeren, Bob Bellotti, and Martin Manley.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1990s, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Oliver_bdea.html" title="Dean Oliver">Dean Oliver</a> popularized the use of possession statistics. Oliver and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hollinger_9b70.html" title="John Hollinger">John Hollinger</a> are credited with moving this use of basketball statistics into the view of more basketball fans through their websites in the late 1990s. Oliver published his book <i>Basketball On Paper</i> in 2003, while Hollinger began writing the <i>Pro Basketball Forecast</i> series in 2002.</p>
<p>Several dozen other serious basketball fans/analysts also make regular and helpful contributions to fine-tuning the methods and their usage and advancing new approaches to research questions through the active <a href="http://sonicscentral.com/apbrmetrics" class="external text" title="http://sonicscentral.com/apbrmetrics" rel="nofollow">APBRmetrics forum</a>, including the very statistically adept Ed Kupfer and Mike Goodman, the creator of the eWins method for evaluating the importance of player contributions to winning.</p>
<p>In the wake of the best-selling book <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Moneyball.html" title="Moneyball">Moneyball</a></i>, which glamorized Sabermetrics, APBRmetric approaches began to receive some attention from the media and NBA teams.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The goal was to find a method a more objective method of analyzing player performance and to find the most productive mix of players within the salary cap or budget.</p>
<p>In 2004, Oliver was hired as a full-time consultant by the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_SuperSonics_88de.html" title="Seattle SuperSonics">Seattle SuperSonics</a>, making him the first APBRmetrician to be employed by an NBA team full-time.</p>
<p>The Houston Rockets took the movement one step further in April 2006 by hiring <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daryl_Morey_5565.html" title="Daryl Morey">Daryl Morey</a> as their assistant general manager and announcing that he would replace Carroll Dawson as general manager after the 2006-07 season. Morey, previously Senior Vice President of Operations and Information for the Boston Celtics, had provided statistical analysis for the Celtics front office and wrote about advanced statistics for the Celtics Web site but had no traditional basketball experience as a player, coach or scout.</p>
<p>The website <a href="http://www.82games.com" class="external text" title="http://www.82games.com" rel="nofollow">82games.com</a>, which debuted in 2003, brought the analysis of plus-minus ratings -- how well a team fares with a certain player or lineup on the floor as opposed to on the bench -- and counterpart production into the mainstream. There is also more detail on shooting effectiveness by location on the court and time on clock. These statistics allow APBRmetricians to measure contributions not accounted for by traditional statistics, particularly at the defensive end of the court, an area underdeveloped in the first wave of new stats including PER and the initial player points allowed defensive rating (which was not based on play by play tracking of one on one defense because it was not yet available and also gave heavy weight to points allowed by the rest of the team as well as the player himself. Some now prefer the counterpart and team measures of defense at 82games which are based on written play by play records but aren't perfect either.)</p>
<p>During the 2006 NBA Playoffs, Synergy Sports Technology provided a free trial of a site that combined video of every NBA game with statistical breakdowns of player tendencies similar to those long in use amongst NBA teams -- going left vs right, being the ball handler on the pick and roll, etc. This combination of video and statistics is in the works by a few firms in the hopes that NBA teams will recognize the value.</p>

<p><b>Bob Chaikin</b> used APBRmetric principles to create a computer simulation for NBA basketball called B-BALL.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/b/APBRmetrics_b6c2.html" title="Edit section: Common statistics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Common statistics</span></h2>
<p>Among the growing list of APBRmetric basketball statistics here are some of the most important ones gaining increased usage:</p>
<p><b>Offensive Rating</b>/<b>Offensive Efficiency</b> and <b>Defensive Rating</b>/<b>Defensive Efficiency</b>, on a team level, are calculated as points scored and points allowed per 100 possessions. Possessions are usually estimated by the following formula:</p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="texhtml">Possessions = .96 * (FGA − ORb + TO + (.44 * FTA))</span></dd>
</dl>
<p>The .44 accounts for the fact that when a player scores a basket and is fouled, they shoot a free throw, which is not a possession. This is also true of flagrant fouls and technical fouls, while three free throws make up one possession when a player is fouled shooting a 3-pointer. It should also be noted that when analyzing <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Basketball_ac99.html" title="College Basketball">College Basketball</a>, APBRmetricians have used .475 as the free-throw multiplier, since college hoops' rules about the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html#Fouls" title="Basketball">team foul limit</a> differ from those in the NBA.</p>
<p>Offensive rebounds are subtracted because grabbing an offensive rebound simply extends the original possession, rather than creating a new possession. If offensive rebounds were not subtracted in this manner, opposing teams would not necessarily have the same number of possessions in a game.</p>
<p>The .96 multiplier adjusts for team rebounds. Because these are not considered offensive rebounds, the formula slightly overestimates the number of possessions per team without the multiplier.</p>
<p>Therefore, team ratings are simply calculated as:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/1/9/519138d0fd7c42efdb8e1975b27100fd.png" alt="\mathrm{Offensive Rating} = \frac{\mathrm{Points Scored*100}}{\mathrm{Possessions}}" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>and</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/5/9/05939aaac9416a7ad6ec7f7a62481d12.png" alt="\mathrm{Defensive Rating} = \frac{\mathrm{Points Allowed*100}}{\mathrm{Possessions}}" /></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Effective Field-Goal Percentage</b> (eFG%) accounts for the fact that 3-pointers are worth an extra point, something ignored by traditional field-goal percentage. The formula is:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/9/b/89bbc0684e00242f58ecda1faf96f1e2.png" alt="\mathrm{eFG\%} = (\mathrm{FGM} + \mathrm{.5*3FGM}) / \mathrm{FGA}" /></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>True Shooting Percentage</b> takes this a step further by factoring in free throws. It is essentially points scored per shooting possession, but divided by two to look like field-goal percentage -- PTS/(2*(FGA + (.44*FTA)))</p>
<p><b>Rebound Rate</b> is the estimated percentage of available rebounds a player or team grabs.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../p/l/a/Player_Efficiency_Rating_ce7d.html" title="Player Efficiency Rating">Player Efficiency Rating</a></b> is <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hollinger_9b70.html" title="John Hollinger">John Hollinger</a>'s linear-weights rating for a player's per-minute performance which reduces a player's total performance into a single number.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../p/y/t/Pythagorean_expectation.html" title="Pythagorean expectation">Pythagorean Record</a></b> is what a team's expected record is based on points scored or allowed. This can be found by PF^14/(PF^14 + PA^14)</p>
<p>There are also several versions of passing ratings, a usage rating that measures how well a player does with the possession he uses, other general and skill specific defensive ratings and many other statistics and analytic ratios to aid understanding of player and team performance.</p>
