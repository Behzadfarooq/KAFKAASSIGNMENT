<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/b/APB_%28band%29_e096.html" title="Edit section: In The Beginning">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In The Beginning</span></h2>
<p>APB formed in the small rural town of <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellon.html" title="Ellon">Ellon</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeenshire.html" title="Aberdeenshire">Aberdeenshire</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and consisted of singer/bassist Iain Slater, guitarist Glenn Roberts, and drummer George Cheyne.</p>
<p>Though living in a remote area, they took inspiration from the "DIY" spirit of the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk</a> scene, adopting a hard-working approach to writing, rehearsing and performing. Meanwhile in <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeen.html" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, a small independent record company called Oily had started to release records and they were impressed enough by the band's live shows to release a single in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>. The song was "Chain Reaction", which had long been a favourite at gigs. It was basically a two and a half minute punk/pop song with fuzzy distorted guitar and Scottish inflected vocals, but already the band was evolving with a sparser and more rhythmical sound. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootsy.html" title="Bootsy">Bootsy</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinton.html" title="Clinton">Clinton</a>, GO4, <a href="../../../e/s/g/ESG_4e14.html" title="ESG">ESG</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/z/Buzzcocks.html" title="Buzzcocks">Buzzcocks</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Clash_8395.html" title="The Clash">The Clash</a> were all filtered through three teenagers from Aberdeenshire to create a catchy, rhythmic sound. A change in their sound first became evident with their second single for Oily, "I'd Like To Shoot You Down" (1981). The single did well and sold out its first pressing, with some copies finding their way to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. Soon it was regularly played at most of NYC's underground dance clubs. Unaware of the poplularity of 'Shoot You Down' in the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a> the band and Oily were busy pushing their third seven-inch, "Palace Filled With Love" (1982). This is when the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_1_3f66.html" title="BBC Radio 1">Radio 1</a> sessions began. Peel and Jensen (and lastly Peter Powel) were playing the tunes nightly and offering sessions despite the lack of a major record deal. After recording several BBC session, APB had some success in Europe. Oily Records released the band's first singles "Chain Reaction" 1981, and the undeniably rambunctious "Shoot You Down" 1981 which made it's way across the pond to New York City. This New York radio play proved to be their launching pad. The third single "Palace Filled With Love" came in 1982. Next came the anthemic "Rainy Day" in 1982. Around this time Nick Jones joined as percussionist. The last release with Oily Records was "One Day" came in 1983. Nick Jones left at this time and was replaced by Mickey Craighead. The band did a small tour of the East Coast of America. "What Kind of Girl" followed up in 1984. The seventh and eighth singles "Summer Love" and "Something to Believe In" came out in 1985.</p>
<p>In between USA trips, the band travelled to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> to record their first BBC session for John Peel. He was full of enthusiasm for the band and gave their next single "Rainy Day" (1982) loads of plays. Nick Jones joined in 1982 playing pecussion (Later to be replaced by Mikey Craighead), adding another dimension to the proceedings. The band then went to NYC to record another single at PlazaSound on the 7th floor of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_City_Music_Hall_a17e.html" title="Radio City Music Hall">Radio City</a>.</p>
<p>The autumn of the same year Mark Beaven of AAM, New York City made contact with Oily to enquire about the availability of APB for a small tour of the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Coast_of_the_United_States_0292.html" title="East Coast of the United States">East Coast</a> of America. When they arrived in New York they heard their tracks played on college radio and in clubs such as <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danceteria.html" title="Danceteria">Danceteria</a>, Berlin and the <a href="../../../m/u/d/Mudd_Club_c655.html" title="Mudd Club">Mudd Club</a>. This was encouraging, and the tour was a great success. With the backing of Mark Beaven, this would turn out to be the first of 12 visits over the next 7 years. The band's sixth single "What Kind of Girl" (1984) came out on Albion in the UK and "Sleeping Bag Records" in the USA. It was recorded at Unique in Manhattan, home of the electro/hip-hop producers <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Baker_f7f2.html" title="Arthur Baker">Arthur Baker</a> and John Robie, and attained the no. 1 position on the Billboard dance chart. The track got lots of radio play, especially on WLIR/WDRE on Long Island. By now US tours were becoming more extensive and audiences were increasing with the Ritz in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> being a regular high point in the proceedings. APB's seventh release was "Summer Love" (1985) on their own Red River Label, quickly followed by "Something to Believe In" (1985). By now, the band had released eight singles, many of which were hard to find and were only available on import in the USA. At this point Link (NYC)released the much sought after compilation of the singles as a first LP release simply called "Something to Believe In" (1985). after this, "Cure for the Blues" was released as the first full album Then, "Open your eyes," "When I feel this way" and "Funk invective" were all released as 12 inch singles. The final release on Link records was the cd version of "Something to believe in." During the '80s, <b>APB</b> was one of the most popular underground alternative bands in the New York Tri-State area. Thanks to constant radio play on <a href="../../../w/l/i/WLIR_4e0f.html" title="WLIR">WLIR</a> 92.7 FM on Long Island and New York college radio, the Scottish band made it's mark with funky bass.</p>

<p>In 1985, "Something to Believe In" their first LP with Link Records was released. They toured and opened for the Clash and James Brown and eventually headlined at various New York clubs including NYC's The Ritz and Long Island's now defunct Club Malibu.</p>
<p>The following year in 1986 "Cure for the Blues", was released. A four-song EP, "Missing You Already", also came out that same year.</p>

<p>The group would continue to play on and off during the mid to late '80s and pretty much disappeared from the radar of the music scene. The band reverted back to its original line up of Iain, Glenn, and George.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not long after issuing the CDs, Link Records went out of business. There was a demand for APB's music in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_Disc_08eb.html" title="Compact Disc">CD format</a> but no supply. Fans searched in vain for downloads or CDs of the band's music, but to no avail as they were out of print. At one point, Amazon.com listed a used copy of "Something to Believe In" for over $200.00!</p>
<p>In February of 2006, Young American Recordings made the decision to reissue APB's debut, "Something to Believe In: 20th Anniversary Edition" which includes a 2nd CD with live and studio material that has never been available before. In March of 2006, "The Radio 1 Sessions", the complete BBC recordings was also reissued by Young American Recordings.</p>
