<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h2>
<p>Why can a man's boot kick the dust on the moon and it only fall a few inches in front of him? Wouldn't the dirt fly 6 times the distance it would have on Earth? Also if a man can kick the dirt so easily why isn't there even a little bit of dirt on the landing gear? Why if sped up 2x does the video look like a man moving in regular gravity? What about the lunar rover, wouldn't there be a cloud of dust a dirt taking 6x the length of time to fall to the ground? These questions haven't been addressed. Gravity alone would cause matter to behave quite differently on the moon with its 1/6 gravity of Earth.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Think back to your junior high school science class, when they demonstrated how a feather and a marble fall at the same rate in a vacuum. Lightweight objects such as feathers... and dust... are actually suspended in air to a notable degree by the mass of the air. The moon is not quite a vacuum, but it's close. In a vacuum or near-vacuum, you don't get a "cloud" that causes the atmosphere to slow and disperse dust. The dust would fall immediately, both faster and likely at a shorter distance, on the moon than it would on the earth. Ironically, your astute observations about the behavior of the dust lend further support to the credibility of the lunar voyage. Kudos! <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:37, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In addition, consider kicking dust in a space suit. It is more confining than ordinary clothes. Also, consider that if you rip it, you'll probably die, so the astronauts might not have been kicking the dust with their full force. Second, if you speed up the film 2X, it DOESN'T look regular. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 01:47, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeh, playing it 2X and trying to make something of it. That's a good one. It vaguely reminds me of a George Carlin line: "The Beatles' latest record, when played backwards at slow speed, says, 'Hey, dummy, you're playing it backwards at slow speed!'" As I recall, they "undercranked" the filmmaking on that first flight, at least, to conserve filmstock. Unfortunately, that unwittingly led to the "waving flag" misinterpretation, and at another speed it looks like Charlie Chaplin. On later trips, they did better with the filming. Obviously, had they known what the Kaysing looneys were going to do, they might have been more self-conscious about the way they did things. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:52, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They were runing at around 10 fps due to bandwidth limits on apollo 11 since they used the transmitter on the lander itself for that mission.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 02:17, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, they did not manage to fake the 1/6 gravity when it comes to the distance the dust flew. The driving looks at it does on earth on exactly double speed. There should be dust on the landing gear. And a lot of other detaljs. I mean, you can see the strings, people&#160;:) As Stanley Kubric named his last movie: "Eyes wide shut".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Transcript from Conspiracy supporting website</span></h2>
<p>I once copied a transcript from a webpage and I didn't record which website it came from (silly me). I can't find the webpage anymore. Does anyone know where this transcript came from and also if there is anything in the official Apollo 11 transcript that has anything close to this in it?</p>
<p>Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: Those are giant things. No, no, no - this is not an optical illusion. No one is going to believe this!</p>
<p>Houston (Christopher Craft): What ... what ... what? What the hell is happening? What's wrong with you?</p>
<p>Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: They're here under the surface.</p>
<p>Houston: What's there? (muffled noise) Emission interrupted; interference control calling 'Apollo 11'.</p>
<p>Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: We saw some visitors. They were here for a while, observing the instruments.</p>
<p>Houston: Repeat your last information!</p>
<p>Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: I say that there were other spaceships. They're lined up in the other side of the crater!</p>
<p>Houston: Repeat, repeat!</p>
<p>Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: Let us sound this orbita ... in 625 to 5 ... Automatic relay connected ... My hands are shaking so badly I can't do anything. Film it? God, if these damned cameras have picked up anything - what then?</p>
<p>Houston: Have you picked up anything?</p>
<p>Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: I didn't have any film at hand. Three shots of the saucers or whatever they were that were ruining the film</p>
<p>Houston: Control, control here. Are you on your way? What is the uproar with the UFOs over?</p>
<p>Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: They've landed here. There they are and they're watching us.</p>
<p>Houston: The mirrors, the mirrors - have you set them up?</p>
<p>Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: Yes, they're in the right place. But whoever made those spaceships surely can come tomorrow and remove them. Over and out.</p>

<dd>Awesome. Yes, that's the quote I recall. Armstrong threw the obligatory bone to the headline writers, then began the job of exploration and reporting details. And, of course, one of them took a photo of a footprint, to reinforce the verbal description. As I recall, there were some fears about how thick the dust might be. The LEM had something like footpads, but until the guys actually got there and stepped into it, no one could be sure what its consistency was. Regarding Mr. Gorsky, I'm surprised none of the moonbats has cited that... which apparently came from the fertile mind of Buddy Hackett, or someone like that. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:26, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I wonder what the moonbats have to say about <i>that?</i> Here's something I would like for the doubters to ponder, if it's within their meager capability. Their doubt seems to spring in part from the fact that they weren't around during the 50s and 60s and early 70s. It's easier to disbelieve a news event that occurred outside of one's lifetime, because there is no personal frame of reference. Now, they should think of some <i>current</i> news event, to which they have no personal connection, i.e. no verifiability, but do not doubt that it is true. I must then ask them, "How do they <i>know</i> it's true? Well, the answer is <i>common sense</i> tells them so. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 05:09, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV</span></h2>
<p>This article seems to fail to be NPOV. It is far more of a text argumenting in favor of the truth of the moon landings than on the theory of the fake moon landing itself. Hell, an entire section is dedicated to rebutting the fake moon landing's theory, mostly by attacking the weakest arguments. This article needs to be rewritten with NPOV standards and fast.</p>
<p>Also of note, the absence of the flag argument. The strongest argument in favor of the fake moon landing is often that the American flag was waving in the wind on the video, whereas there is no atmosphere on the moon. Another one is that if Armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon, then who was filming Armstrong when he was walking out of the shuttle? <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDali_bb8e.html" title="User:Dali">Dali</a> 16:23, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no "theory" about the moon landings being faked, just a bunch of questions that have already been answered but the conspiracists won't accept the logical answers. And your specific questions have been asked and answered countless times. The flag was NOT "waving in the wind", it was bouncing around while they planted it in the lunar surface, and once that task was done, the flag became motionless ever after. The video of Armstrong walking out of the lunar module was from a TV camera mounted on the lunar module itself, aimed at the ladder on the side of the lunar module. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:58, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If you look at the video, the flag is waving only when the astronauts are shaking it. Shortly after the astronauts let go of the flag, it stops "waving". Just like quoting out of context, proponents of the hoax hypothesis only show clips of the flag "waving" while the astronauts are moving it. If you look at the entire video (as I have done), which can be purchased at <a href="http://www.spaceflightnowstore.com/ww/catalog/index.php?cPath=3&amp;osCsid=bbcd0a896c926a2d2e1de07c331e81a1" class="external text" title="http://www.spaceflightnowstore.com/ww/catalog/index.php?cPath=3&amp;osCsid=bbcd0a896c926a2d2e1de07c331e81a1" rel="nofollow">Spaceflight films</a> you can see that shortly after the astronauts let go of it, the flag stops moving. At one point, the Apollo 11 flag is in the scene for more than 30 minutes, and it doesn't move a bit during that time, or any other time - except when the astronauts are handling it.</dd>

<dd>There was a TV camera mounted on the outside of the lunar module that showed Armstrong.

<p>I have a comment. If NASA really did go to the moon, why is it going to take us 16 years to do it again? We first did it in 8 years with much lower technology. If we DID go, we have blueprints for the successful Apollo missions. We should be able to build an exact Apollo copy in 2 years. If this worked before, it will work again. There would be no research/development costs, just duplicate the exact rocket/lander that was so successful before. So why is it going to take 16 years when we can do it in two years? Unless of course we never went in the first place, which I, and all my friends believe is the truth. User:195.93.21.69 01:39, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because they're going to do it <b>"for real"</b> this time.&#160;:-) At that time, there was a crash program to go to the moon. The Saturn rockets were already in development at the time it was decided to go to the moon. The old technology would be considered too dangerous today. The major funding for going back to the moon won't be available until the International Space Station is finished and the Shuttle is retired. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 02:30, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yep. I'm guessing User:195.93.21.69 and his a-none friends were born during the Disco era. I can't account for their lack of common sense, nor their ignorance of history. But I know that we went because we were in a race with the Soviets, and there was a drastic sense of urgency about it that pushed the envelope as far as it could be pushed. I wish they were old enough to have a clue of the sense of panic that hit this country when Sputnik was launched, and when the Soviets launched a man into space, and so on. JFK issued a challenge, and we met it, because <i>we believed we could</i>. Remember, that challenge was issued before Vietnam, before the rioting, and so on, before so much of our national self-doubt set in, when we believed we as a nation could do <i>anything</i> we set our minds to. Once we won the race to the Moon, all interest in lunar excursions (along with the funding) quickly evaporated, as most Americans thought the money was better spent at home, and on more "practical" uses of space, like the Shuttle program and unmanned interplanetary probes. There was, in fact, no longer any reason to go to the Moon. <i>And there still isn't.</i> The lack of urgency is giving the government plenty of time for a lengthy, expensive project with lots of employment, and we might actually get there again eventually, and then it will be like last time: we'll get there, and say, "OK, now what?" Then we'll remember why we cut the Apollo program short the first time around. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:42, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, president Kennedy set the goal when he had been in office only about four months - still quite early in his administration. The USSR had: the first satellite, the first living being in space, the first person in space, the first person to orbit, and the first person to be in space for a day, first (unmanned spacecraft to the moon), first to see the back side of the moon, first to another planet (Venus), and probably more. This was all before the US put Alan Shepard on a 15-minute sub-orbital flight. It was clear that the USSR was going to have more "firsts" before we could catch up. JFK was looking for a goal far enough off that we would probably be able to do it first, and he announced that goal shortly after Shepard's flight. Incidentally, the USSR continued to have "firsts": first woman in space, first with two manned spacecraft up at once, first space walk, first spacecraft with more than one person. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 02:56, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The old technology would be considered too dangerous today." Despite getting men to the moon and back seven times? Too dangerous?! More dangerous, say, than a shuttle that's killed the same number of people to have 'walked on the moon'?</p>

<li>I don't know what that means, but it sounds offensive. Go wash your mouth out. As usual, you and your kind miss the point. Yes, it was dangerous, <i>but it was all they had</i>.

<p>If I may just take it back to Dali's initial claim in this section, the NPOV situation in this article is, if anything, <i>too accommodating</i> to those who deny the Apollo landings. According to NPOV <b>Undue weight</b> rules (I recommend we all re-read it, friends) wikipedia is under <b>no</b> duty to find a balance in cases not far from this one, in which the minority opinion is so marginal, <i>regardless</i> of the 'truth' of the issue. To strike such a balance would give unwarranted credence to whichever crank it is out there saying nay to the mainstream's yea.</p>
<p>The problem of 'undue weight' is a serious one for any information source - such as the 'pedia - which aspires to having something authoritative to offer its reader. We do not say "The Earth is a planet, according to majority opinion" in order to accommodate those plucky few who argue that it is <i>not</i> a planet. We do not say, "The Holocaust was <i>probably</i> a historical event ..." (etc). To do so would be to tell the reader: 'We entirely lack editorial judgement - over to you'; at which point, the reader has to pay for a source written by professionals which won't waste his time on idle fancies.</p>
<p>Finally, Dali inadvertently offers further evidence in favour of the text as it stands concerning falsifiability: If you knock down the hoax proponents' argument on the evidence they put forward, they turn to other evidence or carp about the rules. This is not science - it's pool room philosophizing, and while amusing over a few beers, has no place in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 23:12, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Occams' razor</span></h3>
<p>The article as it stood claimed that Occams' razor asks 'is the alternative story more, or less, probable than the mainstream story?' That's simply wrong. Occams' Razor asks which version is simpler. 67.40.249.122 05:49, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks to me like you changed a good deal more than you describe.

How about:

<dd>I disagree. For one thing, Watergate was never a conspiracy theory - it was known to be a conspiracy from the moment the burglars were caught. Secondly, it was not a widespread conspiracy throughout the government. It wasn't started by the government, it was started by the Committee to Reelect the President.

This would require the diversion of astronomical resources to a task of uncertain scientific value. It is also unclear as to why this would be considered convincing evidence when other material items of evidence are not. There is little reason to believe that hoax believers would be convinced by images taken of a landing site.

If we're going to show how many people believe one thing, it is helpful to have a comparison of how many people believe in another as a reference point. 67.40.249.122 17:35, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're putting words in their mouth. The poll is about "non-theistic" evolution particurlary. Many people believe believe that god caused evolution.

<dd>I'm really not putting words into anyone's mouth. The poll is about non-theistic evolution, that's very clear. The evidence is considered at length in the article - this section is about public belief - it's helpful to compare belief in this with belief in other things, to get a picture of the kinds of things that have this sort of level of public belief. The claim is made that the number is so low that it can be assumed to result from people saying yes to anything that they are asked - it undermines our case to apply that criteria selectively.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you think it would help, we could put in the numbers for theistic evolution - off the top of my head they are about 40%, but I'd want to check that, we'd then be saying something like -'the number of people who believe in the moon hoax theory is vastly smaller than those who believe in mainstream theories such as evolution, although it is comparable to the number of people who beleive in non-theistic evolution.' 67.40.249.122 18:33, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The empty LM weighed 14,700kg. There was 10,150 kg of descent stage fuel (which was almost gone) and 2350 kg of ascent stage fuel plus 150kg for the crew. So the weight was down from 22,800kg to about 12,700kg or so. This is about 2,100kg on the moon. The thrust if the descent engine was 4,500kg-force. So it was throttled down to a little less than half thrust at the time of landing. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 00:32, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Strictly speaking I think it's better to speak of it's mass falling because of fuel use, it's weight is, of course, different on the moon, but for different reasons. There are two separate processes going on here, firstly that the mass is going down because of fuel use, secondly that whatever the mass was at any given time, it weighed about 1/6 of what it did on earth. 67.40.249.122 00:35, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The first line says that no blast crater is expected. I think that should be "large". Secondly, it needs to mention somehow that what you would expect on the moon is a lot different from what our experiences on Earth would indicate. Third, I think that the engine was cut off shortly after the long poles detected contact, which was a few meters above the surface. This needs to be refactored.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>1. No blast crater appeared from the landing.</p>
<ul>
<li>No large crater should be expected, based on the different physical conditions on the moon. Factors that affect the formation of a blast crater are:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The force of the downward pointing engines - the Descent Propulsion System was throttled very far down during the final stages of landing. The Lunar Module was no longer rapidly decelerating, so the descent engine only had to support the module's own weight, which by then was greatly diminished by the near exhaustion of the descent propellants. At the time of landing, the engine's thrust divided by the cross-sectional area of the engine bell is only about 1.5 PSI (By contrast, the thrust of the first stage of the Saturn V was 459 PSI, per area of the engine bell.) In addition, the Moon's lower gravity meant that only 1/6 as much thrust was needed, compared to Earth gravity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Gas pressure of the exhaust at the point it makes contact with the ground - unlike on earth, where rocket plumes can be easily seen in launches due to the atmospheric pressure (the thin out as the rocket climbs) in a vacuum, exchaust gases rapidly disburse, leaving no pressurised 'plume'. For this reason, rocket engines designed for vacuum operation have longer bells than those designed for use at the earth's surface, but they still cannot prevent this spreading. The lunar module's exhaust gases therefore expanded rapidly well beyond the landing site. Even if they hadn't, a simple calculation will show that the pressure at the end of the descent engine bell was much too low to carve out a crater.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Direction of movement of the lander immediately prior to impact - the landers were generally moving horizontally as well as vertically until right before landing, so the exhaust would not be focused on any one surface spot for very long, and the compactness of the lunar soil below a thin surface layer of dust also make it virtually impossible for the descent engine to blast out a "crater".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the descent engines did scatter a considerable amount of very fine surface dust as seen in 16mm movies of each landing, and as Neil Armstrong said as the landing neared ("...kicking up some dust..."). This significantly impaired visibility in the final stages of landing, and many mission commanders commented on it. Photographs do show slightly disturbed dust beneath the descent engine.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think that is pretty much OK, but I would like others to look at it. One thing, though, is I don't think it adequately says why the moon's 1/6 gee is important - it means that the amount of thrust would be only 1/6 as much as you might expect from our experience on Earth. I think one of the pro-hoax TV shows shows the Saturn V blasting off, and then say "why didn't the LM engine leave a big crater?" Well, the thrust was about 1,200 times less than the thurst of the Saturn V. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 02:01, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point is that the believers in the hoax haven't presented any experiment or observation that would convince them, as far as I know. I don't think the telescope proposal counts, because telescopes simply aren't anywhere near that powerful. A telescope even half the size of Hubble in orbit around the moon would be powerful enough, <s>but that isn't going to happen. For one thing, something in low orbit around the moon is moving at nearly a mile per second relative to the ground, and anything zooming in that close to the surface would have to do a very fast exposure to keep from being blurred from the motion. Secondly, it probably isn't going to happen because there is no need to study large portions of the Moon's surface in that detail.</s> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 02:19, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It doesn't matter. As a matter of fact, I don't, but that doesn't mean we should write an article that sounds like propaganda. We should avoid loaded terms, weasle words, wild unsourced speculation and putting words in people's mouths and misrepresenting them, even when we disagree with them. Perhaps especially when we disagree with them. That's not giving anything undue credence, it's just doing duediligence on writing the article. 67.40.249.122 17:26, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's hard to tell, it was pretty badly written, and unclear in many places.

<dd>You said: <i>"We should avoid ... wild unsourced speculation"</i> . It seems to me that the whole hoax allegations are the <i>wild specuation</i>.

<dd>I suppose that's why the title is 'hoax accusations'. I didn't write the article though. The source for the accusations seem to be pretty reliable. Some folks made some accusations, we reference the books and interviews etc where they made them. What's unreliable about that? We're not claiming that they're true. 67.40.249.122 18:25, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes - as above - the claim that the hoax would require the complicity of 'thosands of people'. Perhaps, but no source or calculations are given for this. Is this a random authors' guess?

<dd>I don't think that my views of the Apollo project, or my original research about how many people I think would have had to have been complicit are relevant. I don't think yours are either - we must reference the claim. To entertain this line of argument for a moment though, I think what you're saying is that if X people worked on the project, X must be complicit. It just doesn't follow. Many of the people involved worked on tiny parts - the ones who built the lander, for example, might have built what they thought was a lander, it might even have been designed to work to the best of their knowledge - it might have sat on the launch pad, or even have been launched, without depositing people on the moon. The argument would be that only a relatively small number of people would actually have to have been complicit, the rest would be doing their job, building parts for a space program that looked like it was going to the moon. Please don't ask me to defend this position, I don't believe it, I'm just pointing out why we need to source claims. 67.40.249.122 19:07, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>WP guidelines say that we don't have to source common knowledge (i.e. thousands of people worked on Apollo). However, [<a href="http://www.clavius.org/scale.html" class="external text" title="http://www.clavius.org/scale.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>], which was already in the references addresses it. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 19:44, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So we can attribute a firm number that a particular person claims would be needed - that's fine by me, just let's say where each figure comes from and give a link so people can check how it was derived. As I mention above, the fact that X number of people worked on Apollo does not mean that X were involved. Your reference does not claim that everyone who worked on it would have to be involved.

<dd>Keep your hair on, old fruit. I make no accusation of vandalism here. It was simply that, in the short time I had available for the 'pedia yesterday, I found that in answering your deluge in two small places, on both occasions I found myself referring back to previous debates with a particular hoax-booster - your edits mapped his concerns more closely than coincidence would immediately suggest. Then I realised that there were some funny regularities in the types of spelling mistake you both make. It might simply be that you are both talking sense, and thus have very similar concerns; and that you were both educated in a way that prioritised content over form. But I thought I'd check if there might not be a more intimate relationship between the two contributions. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 20:50, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Rather than re-introduce typos, factual errors and pov, just let me know which ones are offensive, and when we reach concensus, we can put them back.

<dd>That's why I listed them on the talk page - I was hoping that people who had issues might list them there, so far, little interest, and little in the way of coherence from people who did respond. Now that it's protected, I'll be certain to be slower (in fact, if anyone had asked, I would have, I didn't realise that was an issue). Why don't you have a look at the edits listed on the talk page, and tell me whether you agree with them or not, and, if not, why not? My frustration so far is that nobody has been able to explain what is wrong with the edits, simply that they want to revert them! Thanks! 67.40.249.122 22:04, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Personally, I think that my paragraph (after several edits) is ready to replace the original one. The original was factually incorrect in a couple of areas:</p>
<p>1. The accusation is simply wrong: apart from the first few seconds, in which they decided that the US-sourced feed was poor, the entire Australian broadcast came from PKS and HSK.</p>
<p>2. "Later images of the descent to the surface were normal television signals" - this is wrong, according to my reading. The entire EVA was transmitted from the moon in SSTV.</p>
<p>3. "NASA Facilities" - The Padington facility, if I read it correctly, was an ABC shop, although NASA probably took it over. Importantly, US standard television was sent to US, and the original reads like the the conversion was done in America.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why you can't rebuild Saturn rockets</span></h2>
<p>Concerning the suggestions about rebuilding Saturn, you couldn't build a Saturn class rocket today. The design calls for too many parts that were standard issue in the 1960's, but would be difficult to find or reproduce today. Replacing such items with modern equivalents would alter system interaction in difficult to foresee ways. For example, suppose you need a reel-to reel data recorder. If you try to replace it with flash ram or a hard drive, the data IO or latency might be too fast for other systems to handle. Flash ram might be damaged by voltage fluctuations that the older tech would ignore. And the reduced weight of many such substitutions could throw the rocket off balance.</p>
<p>Of course none of these issues alone are unsolvable, but if you add up thousands of them, you would have to do so much testing and redesign that you would be better off starting with a clean slate. As for the increased time, in the absence of soviet competition, the project is probably expected to be much cheaper, as well as having higher expectations of safety. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 08:40, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV petard</span></h2>
<p>This is just another example of Wikipedia getting hoisted on its own NPOV petard and being manipulated by quacks to lend legitimacy to their views. Treating patently stupid conspiracy theories as if they have legitimacy helps them gain legitimacy. Impressionable people will see these idiots' fables treated seriously and assume there is a good reason.</p>
<p>NPOV is an admirable goal, but the policy should be tempered with a COMMON SENSE clause. "If it walks like a duck..." etc... If a quack is a quack, it's not an NPOV issue to correctly and factually identify him as quack!ElectricJoe 02:41, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it is better to err on the side of respect, and let the facts do the talking. One thing we ought to mention early though is that Moon hoax proponents continue to spread even the most easily disproved "evidence" (like no-stars) without caveat years after the flaws have been presented to them. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 03:20, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ElectricJoe, This issue has been dealt with by wikipedia policy makers already. See the <b>pseudoscience</b> section of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. What we have to do is just report what they believe and note that it is definitely not the mainstream view. Worrying about 'impressionable people' isn't our concern. WP is a reporter of information, not a guardian of truth.</dd>
<dd>And more generally, I think the 'conspiracy theory' section is written in a far too condescending tone. It is written as if the reader needs to be educated on how to determine the veracity of claims in general. For instance, I think the whole first paragraph that seeks to educate the reader on how to test conspiracy theories should be removed. I think <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_1249.html" title="Protocols of the Elders of Zion">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> are good examples of how ideas that have been debunked by the mainstread can be handled well.</dd>

<dd>I couldn't agree more with Ashmoo. As the Moon Hoax article is now written it is a terrible farce of NPV standards. If the article is about the Moon Hoax then the article should explain the Moon Hoax, and nothing else.</dd>
<dd>The first time I heard about the Moon Hoax I thought, "Why on Earth would someone think that?" And that is the point of using Wikipedia, to learn what a subject is all about.</dd>
<dd>The 5 W's: Who, What, When, Where and Why are here and accounted for. Unfortunately so is a lot of other personal beliefs that clutter and confuse the article. This article can be easily and quickly streamlined to an efficent NPV article by removing all the counter claims against the Moon Hoax. This article is, after all, about the Moon Hoax, not whether it is true or not. Readers will need to form their own opinions, not have one handed to them. I plan on removing all the rebutals and streamlining the article to the 5 W's unless someone can explain why all the rebutal clutter is needed.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDartFrog_02a7.html" title="User:DartFrog">DartFrog</a> 04:23, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Nearly all interested scientists, technicians and space enthusiasts have rejected the claim as baseless. According to a 1999 Gallup poll, about 6% of the population of the U.S. has doubts that the Apollo astronauts walked on the Moon. (Plait 2002:156) "Although, if taken literally, 6% translates into millions of individuals," Gallup said of this, "it is not unusual to find about that many people in the typical poll agreeing with almost any question that is asked of them; so the best interpretation is that this particular conspiracy theory is not widespread."</p>
<p>Introduction The hoax is alternately referred to as "The Moon Landing Hoax", "The Moon Hoax", or "The Apollo Hoax". The different titles do not infer different beliefs, they are simply alternate ways in which theorists refer to the Moon &lt;/wiki/Moon&gt; landings of Apollo 11 &lt;/wiki/Apollo_11&gt; on July 20 &lt;/wiki/July_20&gt;, 1969 &lt;/wiki/1969&gt; and subsequent missions.</p>
<p>Although the different hoax accounts do not differentiate themselves with unique titles, they can be broken down into three basic, yet separate, beliefs. Each of the three theories are conspiratorial in nature and each theory holds differing views towards the official United States government’s account of the events. These three common theories are:</p>
<p>1) That N.A.S.A. faked the first moon visit, (the Apollo11 visit), but that all subsequent visits were indeed true and happened as N.A.S.A. claims. This initial fakery was to allow the U.S. beat the U.S.S.R. in the space race to the moon.</p>
<p>2) That none of the N.A.S.A. moon visits ever happened, but were instead staged and pre-filmed on Earth &lt;/wiki/Earth&gt;.</p>
<p>3) That the Apollo missions did indeed reach the moon, however, the astronauts encountered either aliens or alien structures. Therefore the actual footage was withheld from public viewing and new, staged footage, was shot to replace the original footage.</p>
<p>� History In 1969 rumors that the Apollo landings were full of trickery began to circulate soon after the Apollo 11 mission. In his book A Man on the Moon, Andrew Chaikin mentions that at the time of Apollo 8's lunar orbit mission in December 1968, such conspiratorial stories were in circulation as rumored facts.</p>
<p>The Flat Earth Society &lt;/wiki/Flat_Earth_Society&gt; lodged one of the earliest complaints about the veracity of the Apollo missions. The primary basis of their claim was that various "earthrise" photos from Apollo 8 did not square with their belief that the Earth is flat.. Also playwright Desmond Lowden wrote a play called The News-Benders in 1967 in which all major technological advances since 1945 were shown to have been simulated; the play was televised in January 1968 and showed a Moon landing faked with models.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In 1971 a brief sequence in the James Bond movie Diamonds Are Forever appears to show a Moon landing being simulated.</p>
<p>In 1974 Bill Kaysing was the first to publish such claims as factual in his self-published book with Randy Reid, We Never Went To The Moon: America’s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle. Kaysing can be considered the father of the Moon Hoax theories because of his book</p>
<p>In 1978 the idea grew significantly in popularity after the release of the movie Capricorn One , which portrays a NASA attempt to fake a landing on Mars .</p>
<p>In 1992 Ralph Rene wrote “NASA Mooned America”.</p>
<p>In 1999 “Dark Moon: Apollo and The Whistle Blowers” was written by Mary Bennet and David Percy.</p>
<p>In 2001 Fox Entertainment Group aired a program, on FOX channels, called Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?</p>
<p>Also in 2001 Bart Sibrel created and released the documentary “A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon”. He also offers DVD‘s entitled “Astronauts Gone Wild”, “Apollo 11 Monkey Business”, and “Apollo 11 Post-Flight Press Conference”.</p>
<p>In 2003 Charles T. Hawkins wrote “How America Faked The Moon Landings” and a subsequent video production of the same name followed in 2004 � Arguments In dealing with the Moon Hoax, whether supporting or attempting to debunk the Moon landings, it is not immediately possible to prove or disprove the theories. Both sides of the debate discuss complex engineering and physics &lt;/wiki/Physics&gt;concepts, such as: trigonometry &lt;/wiki/Trigonometry&gt;, quantum or statistical mathematics, rocket &lt;/wiki/Rocket&gt; propulsion, avionics &lt;/wiki/Avionics&gt;, computer engineering &lt;/wiki/Computer_engineering&gt;, general engineering as well as geology &lt;/wiki/Geology&gt; and a myriad other sciences, that are far beyond the scope of understanding for the majority of individuals, thus rendering any truly scientific debate impossible on the layman's level. But, as noted before, the landings are accepted as factual by nearly all mainstream scientists who have studied the issue.</p>
<p>The Moon Hoax argument, however, does not always rely on scientific argument or theory per-se. Instead, the Moon Hoax argument uses refusal to accept an already existing scientific argument to debunk the Moon landings on the grounds that they are non-falsifiable. The logic used is that no one, outside of the Astronauts, can know for certain if they ever walked on the moon and therefore no one else can possibly prove otherwise. The public, it is argued, is left to simply take the Astronauts ‘ and N.A.S.A.‘s word on the matter.</p>
<p>Another approach used to circumvent a lack of technical knowledge is to appeal to "common sense" logic. This approach to attacking science puts the Moon Hoax theory at a decided advantage. Hoax proponents are free to make rebuttal after rebuttal to the Moon landing's veracity, thus requiring science to go on the defense and answer the rebuttals while bogging the reader down in the difficult language and concepts of advanced science.</p>
<p>An example of the "common sense" approach to shooting down scientific evidence is the fact that Apollo missions 11, 14, and 15 left retroreflectors &lt;/wiki/Retroreflector&gt; on the Moon [1] &lt;<a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/expmoon/Apollo15/A15_Experiments_LRRR.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/expmoon/Apollo15/A15_Experiments_LRRR.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lpi.usra.edu/expmoon/Apollo15/A15_Experiments_LRRR.html</a>&gt;, which scientists can reflect lasers off of to measure the distance between Earth and the Moon (see Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment &lt;/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_Experiment&gt;). These reflectors are often offered as evidence for the landing.</p>
<p>The "common sense" issue with this evidence is that the typical person does not own a laser transmitter nor the other necessary equipment and knowledge to conduct the experiment. Hoax believers also point out that reflectors can be placed by robot missions. The Lunokhod 2 &lt;/wiki/Lunokhod_2&gt; mission, for example, left a French-built mirror on the surface of the moon. [2] <a href="http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lunaye8.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lunaye8.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lunaye8.htm</a></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Some have thought using a high powered telescope &lt;/wiki/Telescope&gt; to view the Apollo landing sites would settle the issue in a simple manner. They reason that one would be able to see if there is indeed any evidence left on the Moon's surface by the astronauts. Unfortunately, telescopes currently available lack the magnification power to perform this experiment; leaving hoax proponents free to demand evidence of actual human foot prints. Many supporters of the Moon landings fear that, even if future telescopes or missions were able to resolve footprints, these results would still be considered 'fakery'.</p>
<p>The larger issue here is that mechanical remains on the moon cannot, strictly, be used as evidence for human landing. They do demonstrate that landings took place, but fail to prove that a human was part of the landing exercise.</p>
<p>Hoax Claims, Issues, and Controversies A brief treatment of some of the arguments is given below. For more detail and discussion, including counter arguments, see the external links. [edit &lt;/w/index.php?title=Apollo_moon_landing_hoax_accusations&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5&gt;]</p>
<p>Issues of photographs Believers in the hoax have alleged various issues with photographs apparently taken on the Moon.These include: 1. Photos and video show dozens of seeming anomalies. From the placement of view finder crosshairs on the photos, to horizons that seem to disappear within 20 feet. 2. Identical backgrounds in photos that are listed as taken miles apart. 3. A lack of stars in photos that show the sky. 4. The appearance of intersecting shadows, overly bright spots on the ground, and objects, such as the Flag of the U.S.A., lighting up in pitch black shadows. 5. Film in the cameras would have been fogged by radiation or melted in the heat. 6. The lack of a blast crater under the Landing Module (LM). 7. The flag placed on the surface by the astronauts flapped despite there being no wind on the Moon. 8. On the Moon launch to return to Earth the rocket produced no visible flame and the LM appeared to pop off the moon as if on stings. 9. The computing technology and software of the 1960’s Apollo program seems tremendously insufficient to accomplish such a technical and comprehensive task. 10. The rocks brought back from the Moon are identical to rocks collected by scientific expeditions to Antarctica &lt;/wiki/Antarctica&gt;. The rocks could also have been collected by un-manned space craft. 11. N.A.S.A.’s seeming inability to return to the moon, despite the fact that technologies and N.A.S.A. have advanced significantly over the last 38 years. 12. That Russia never made a trip to the moon, despite the fact that they were in a race with the U.S.A. 13. That no country, except the U.S.A., has made a trip to the moon. 14. The belief that the astronauts could not have survived the trip because of exposure to intense radiation from the Van Allen belts &lt;/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt&gt;.</p>
<p>These are just some of the numerous, and more common, claims one will find when seeking to understand the claims that the U.S.A. never placed a man on the moon. For every claim made there seems to be a web site devoted to explaining the anomalies in scientific terms. There are numerous web sites, books, and videos that claim evidence of a hoax and cover up, as well as, ones that discount such claims. Use some of the links at the end of this article to look deeper into the issues.</p>

Deaths of key Apollo personnel In a television program about the hoax theory, &lt;/wiki/Fox_Entertainment_Group&gt; listed the deaths of 10 astronauts and of two civilians related to the manned spaceflight program as having possibly been killings as part of a coverup. Ted Freeman &lt;/wiki/Ted_Freeman&gt; (T-38 &lt;/wiki/T-38_Talon&gt; crash, 1964) Elliott See &lt;/wiki/Elliott_See&gt; and Charlie Bassett &lt;/wiki/Charles_Bassett&gt; (T-38 accident, 1966) Virgil "Gus" Grissom &lt;/wiki/Virgil_Grissom&gt; (supposedly an outspoken critic of the Space Program) (Apollo 1 &lt;/wiki/Apollo_1&gt; fire, January 1967) Ed White &lt;/wiki/Edward_Higgins_White&gt; (Apollo 1 fire, January 1967) Roger Chaffee &lt;/wiki/Roger_Chaffee&gt; (Apollo 1 fire, January 1967) Ed Givens &lt;/wiki/Edward_Givens&gt; (car accident, 1967) C. C. Williams &lt;/wiki/Clifton_Williams&gt; (T-38 accident, October 1967) X-15 &lt;/wiki/X-15&gt; pilot Mike Adams &lt;/wiki/Michael_J._Adams&gt; (the only X-15 pilot killed in November 1967 during the X-15 flight test program - not a NASA astronaut, but had flown X-15 above 50 miles). Robert Lawrence &lt;/wiki/Robert_Henry_Lawrence%2C_Jr.&gt;, scheduled to be an Air Force Manned Orbiting Laboratory &lt;/wiki/Manned_Orbiting_Laboratory&gt; pilot who died in a jet crash in December 1967, shortly after reporting for duty to that (later cancelled) program. NASA worker Thomas Baron &lt;/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Baron&amp;action=edit&gt; train crash, 1967 shortly after making accusations before Congress about the cause of the Apollo 1 fire, after which he was fired. Ruled as suicide. Lee Gelvani claims to have almost convinced James Irwin &lt;/wiki/James_Irwin&gt;, an Apollo 15 astronaut whom Gelvani referred to as an "informant", to confess about a cover-up having occurred. Irwin was supposedly going to contact Kaysing about it; however he died of a heart attack &lt;/wiki/Heart_attack&gt; in 1991, before any such telephone call occurred. Landing believers explain these deaths by pointing out that spacecraft testing and flying high performance jet aircraft can be dangerous, and all but one of the astronaut deaths (Irwin's) were directly related to their rather hazardous job. Two of the astronauts, Mike Adams and Robert Lawrence, had no connection with the civilian manned space program. Astronaut James Irwin &lt;/wiki/James_Irwin&gt; had suffered several heart attacks in the years prior to his death. There is no independent confirmation of Gelvani's claim that Irwin was about to come forward. Moreover, if there was a coverup (that the Apollo 11 and subsequent landings were faked), the coverup would logically have occurred in 1969 and subsequent years - yet all bar one of the deaths listed above occurred in 1967 or earlier. [edit &lt;/w/index.php?title=Apollo_moon_landing_hoax_accusations&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14&gt;]</p>
<p>Motives Several motives have been put forward by hoax proponents for the U.S. government &lt;/wiki/United_States_government&gt; to fake the Moon landings - some recurrent elements are: Distraction - The U.S. government sought to distract the public from the Vietnam War &lt;/wiki/Vietnam_War&gt;. Conspiracy theorists note that lunar activities stopped abruptly, with planned missions cancelled, around the same time that the U.S. ceased its involvement in the Vietnam War. Cold War &lt;/wiki/Cold_War&gt; Prestige - The U.S. government considered it vital that the U.S. win the space race &lt;/wiki/Space_race&gt; with the USSR &lt;/wiki/Soviet_Union&gt;. Going to the Moon, if it was possible, would have been risky and expensive. They argue that despite close monitoring by the Soviet Union, it would have been easier for the US to fake it and consequently guarantee success, than to actually go. Money - NASA raised approximately 30 billion dollars going to the moon. This could have been used to pay off a large number of people, providing significant motivation for complicity. Risk - The available technology at the time was such that the landing might fail if genuinely attempted. The Soviets, with their own competing moon program &lt;/wiki/Soviet_Moonshot&gt; and an intense economic, political and military rivalry with the USA, could be expected to have cried foul if the USA tried to fake a Moon landing. Conspiracy theorist Ralph Rene &lt;/wiki/Ralph_Rene&gt; argues that the USSR was bought off with secret shipments of grain. Others argue that the lack of evidence from any Communist bloc &lt;/wiki/Communist_bloc&gt; countries constitutes the single most significant argument against such a hoax. Soviet complicity might be thought to implausibly multiply the scale of the conspiracy, to include hundreds of thousands of conspirators, all of uncertain loyalty.

<p>Apollo Hoax in Pop culture On an episode of Fox TV's Family Guy &lt;/wiki/Family_Guy&gt;, a flashback shows the ending of filming the hoax, with Neil Armstrong walking out of the studio and a pedestrian seeing him. When the pedestrian asks why he is not in space, Neil Armstrong kills him. In season 1 episode 3 of Futurama &lt;/wiki/Futurama&gt;, Fry and Leela find the Lunar landing equipment on the moon. They are not the first ones to do so -- a plaque inside the lander reveals that it (either the complete lander or the capsule, as it would have blasted back into space) was (re)placed in its current position by the "Historical Sticklers Society". On an episode of Futurama, when the crew is mysteriously flung back in time to 1949, President Truman &lt;/wiki/President_Truman&gt; requests that Zoidberg &lt;/wiki/Zoidberg&gt;, an alien, be taken to Area 51 &lt;/wiki/Area_51&gt; for study. When informed that Area 51 is the location for the faked moon landing, he orders that NASA be invented and get to work. The Red Hot Chili Peppers &lt;/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers&gt; song "Californication &lt;/wiki/Californication_%28song%29&gt;" features the lyric "Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement." The video game Grand Theft Auto:Vice City &lt;/wiki/Vice_City&gt; contains a motion picture studio with a lunar landscape set. A 2006 commercial for Red Bull &lt;/wiki/Red_Bull&gt; features astronauts who, after drinking Red Bull, "have wings" and are unable to actually set foot on the moon. They are instructed by Huston to return to Earth so the scene can be shot in a studio instead. Worms 3D, a videogame by UK Software developers Team17, contains a level depicting a movie sound stage replete with moon landscape and a lunar landing module. One level in Midway's remake of the classic arcade shooter, Area 51, takes place on a moon landing set, complete with a cardboard-cutout astronaut and fake LEM. The video for the Rammstein &lt;/wiki/Rammstein&gt; song "Amerika &lt;/wiki/Amerika_%28Rammstein_song%29&gt;" depicts the band on a movie set wearing NASA suits and a heavy theme of the video is the faking of the moon landing. The book The Loony: a novella of epic proportions (published in April 2005) by Christopher WunderLee tells the story of an astrophysicist's role in assisting NASA in faking the lunar landings. The book details the implications of 'knowing the truth' and the massive coverup. On an episode of Friends &lt;/wiki/Friends&gt;, Joey asks Phoebe for a good lie, and she responds, "Okay how about the whole "man landing on the moon"-thing. I mean, you can see the strings people!!!" ""</p>

<dd>Briefly, I am against these changes. The article could be restructured. However, I think many people looking this up on Wikipedia will be trying to understand what the arguements and issues are. If all of the counterarguements are taken out, little information is given to the reader. We shouldn't have another article that gives the counterarguements because that would be a POV fork, which is against Wikipedia policy. Also, Wikipedia policy says that the majority mainstream scientific viewpoint should be given in the article. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 02:25, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am proposing only 14 mentions of hoax arguments to show what the idea of the hoax is. I have not explained any of these in detail because the article is not to prove that the landing is a hoax.Only to present the hoax. I have also not presented the scientific counter points beause, again, the article is not to prove that we did go to the moon. The point is to present the hoax. I can add a larger paragraph pointing to mainstream thoughts on the hoax, but, if we were to venture too far from the task of presenting the hoax theory we would surely be leaving the realm of informing readers and instead be engaging in a debate. Arguments that we did go to the Moon have their own forum under Apollo 11, NASA, etc. There we present that we did go to the moon. On the hoax article we report the hoax. Seems simple to me. More thoughts? I don't want this to be difficult. Any one who is adament that the hoax be thoroughly rebuked should edit the Apollo articles to reflect that we did go to the moon.</dd>

Putting it somewhere else is <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">forking</a>, which we shouldn't do. I don't think it makes sense to put the refutations of the hoax allegations in the articles you mentioned, because they would seem to come out of left field. For instance "we went to the moon because the flag isn't actually waving, there are no stars in the photos because... " This is my opinion. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>,
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't advise treating it that way either. I would deal with the landings own points if I wanted to show that the landing was real. I would not engage in an endless display of one-up-manship. The flag waving is a simple claim and does not need addressing. If you do address it you open the door for a counter rebutal. We can already see this happening in this article. I don't care if this article leaves people wondering if we went or not. I want people to understand the hoax. They can make up their own minds. (By DartFrog, I believe)</dd>

<dd>If the article just states that the flag was waving as if it was blowing in the wind and doesn't give the real reason, that it misleading. The pro-conspiracy TV programs show a short clip of the flag waving while the astronauts are putting it up. They don't show it sitting there for 30 minutes doing absolutely nothing after the astronauts leave it (which is actually in the Apollo 11 video). That is basically selective quoting. Also, they show still photographs where it appears to be waving, but you can tell that it is simply wrinkled. It was nylon, not cotton, which is stiffer. Also, the 1/6 gravity on the moon may mean that it is less likely to straighten out. Also, it isn't a standard flag pole - it has a right angle piece at the top from which the flag hangs. To leave this information out would be a mistake, in my opinion. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 16:55, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Ofcourse not. No one is over at the Flat Earth Scociety article explaining geometry and calculus and how the belief is wrong.

<dd>I agree. Listing the arguments without stating the counter-arguments is total POV, and simply spreads misinformation. This is at the core of all pseudoscience. Pseudoscience concentrates mainly on finding as many naive converts as possible, getting them to believe something, and then demonizing the opposition that has to clean up the mess. It is about scoring converts, not finding the truth. Real scientific discussions never simply ignore counterarguments - each side adapts and adjusts, finding evidence and realistic mechanisms for how things work until consensus is reached. An unbiased work must cover both sides of any discussion. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 18:08, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Common sense?</span></h2>
<p>An edit on March 27, 2006 listed the article saying that <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_sense.html" title="Common sense">common sense</a> are used against the "scientific" evidence for the moon landings. I have doubts as to whether or not "common sense" is the right term. The common sense article says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is what people in common would agree; that which they "sense" in common as their common natural understanding. Some use the phrase to refer to beliefs or propositions that in their opinion they consider would in most people's experience be prudent and of sound judgment, without dependence upon esoteric knowledge or study or research, but based upon what is believed to be knowledge held by people "in common".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The percentage of people that believe the landings were hoaxed is quite small, so how "common" is that? To me, common sense cuts the other way. The article says that "common sense" tells you that the reflectors (used as evidence of a landing) could have been put there by machines. But I think that common sense tells me that they are evidence for the landing, since no non-manned landings have taken place in those areas (except for Apollo 12, and Apollo 12 didn't leave a reflector). In the reasoning of the article, if we eventually see footprints on the moon, "common sense" would say that they could have been put there by a machine, but my common sense would say that they would be put there by people. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 03:07, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For instance, my common sense tells me something different about the reflectors than what is in the article: If they were going to fake the landings then they would not have even bothered with the reflectors. How convincing would that be to the average person - very few people can shoot a laser beam at the Moon and detect its reflection. So to me, common sense says that they would not even have bothered with the reflectors to use as a proof of a landing. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 04:31, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see what you're saying, but unsure what to do with it. The entire concept of "common sense" I think refers to easily confused and incorrect assumptions made regarding this issue, under the guise of "common sense". Perhaps we could put a caveat, one man's "common sense" is another's "common folly". But regarding the footsteps, it is a matter of what would be easier.

<dd>Please look at the photos. It is clearer in the higher resolution versions that you can get if you click on the photo. The caption for the first one from the source says that Aldrin is saluting. In the higher resolution version of it, you can clearly see two fingers of the glove of his right hand up at his helmet. In the second photo, it is clear that he has turned slightly toward the camera, and facial features of a person facing the camera are visible. If you compare the two photos, it is also clear that they are framed slightly differently.

<p>I'm not happy with the paragraph about the laser reflectors. If hoax beleivers think that they weren't carried by manned Apollo missions, then how <i>did</i> they get there? It is true that they can be put there by unmanned missions, but I know of no evidence that there were any such missions that could have put the reflectors there. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 04:32, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like to stop by now and then, and see what stage this hoax nonsense is in. Surely you must realize that no fact or set of facts is going the change the moonbats' minds. The JFK assassination-conspiracy industry has pretty well run its course, so they had to turn elsewhere for their entertainment. The argument that we might have sent a rocket to the moon (successfully, yet) to plant a laser reflector, just so we could pretend we sent men there, is one of their more desperate notions. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 09:47, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To be fair, it's not at all clear that not having evidence of unmanned missions counts as evidence of manned missions. No being able to proove B does not proove A. I agree with you, but your logic is faulty I'm afraid. For great justice. 15:41, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, but most of the evidence is not actually conclusive. The problem is not a simply 'is there more evidence for X or Y?' because the claim being made is that the evidence for X was cleverly faked. This complicates things significantly. For great justice. 17:30, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is overwhelming evidence for one and none for the other. Use common sense and Occam's razor. The only reason some people think that the reflectors were put there by robots is because they have already made up their mind that the manned landings didn't happen, regardless of the evidence. It is also "possible" that aliens put the reflectors on the Moon, but I haven't seen any evidence for that. Also, some people claim that the Germans went to the Moon in the early 1940s, even before the V2. It is possible they left the reflectors there (even though lasers hadn't been invented yet), but I don't see any evidence of that either. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 20:15, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I don't know what to tell you - you've made up your mind. That doesn't make the logical claim you're making more compelling though. The issue with complex conspiracy claims is that they can't be treated like lab experiments. Occams's razor doesn't make any sense if you think someone might be trying to cleverly trick you, because they might do something very complex. For great justice. 20:52, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Excellent... a film frame taken at the exact moment of the picture in question. It is clear that the flag's shadow, as with Aldrin's upper body, are out of frame to the right in the side shot. Here is a high angle photo of the flag <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/kippsphotos/5480.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/kippsphotos/5480.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and it reinforces what the film frame indicates, that much of the shadow of the flag's staff would be hidden by the irregular surface. The photos are all consistent with each other. As for the side shot, I'm sure if Armstrong had realized what a big deal a handful of people in Generation X were going to make, he would have taken a wider angle shot to show the flag's shadow. In fact, for all we know, <i>he might have</i>. Critics would need to study ALL the photos from the mission, not just the handful of what NASA regarded as the most photogenic examples, to reach a definitive conclusion. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:00, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>The more you study these photos, the more interesting they get. This one which I cited earlier <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/kippsphotos/5480.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/kippsphotos/5480.jpg" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> indicates that most of the staff's shadow would have been hidden on that side view, by a little ridge of dust, except for one little area, where the surface rises as the shadow of the staff is about to meet the shadow of the flag... and on the side view, you can see that little sliver of the staff's shadow near the right edge. Again, the photos are consistent with each other. And, again, look at the flags... <i>they are in identical posture</i>, just as Bubba was discussing earlier. If they were truly "waving", that would not be possible. The only difference in them is slightly different lighting due to the sun angle having shifted slightly. Awesome stuff! <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:52, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The shadows of Buzz Aldrin's legs are barely three pixels tall at some points. How thick would you therefore expect the flagpole's shadow to be? If you look carefully, you can actually see a hint of it on the extreme right side of the photo. (The shadow of the actual flag is off frame.) Also, interesting that some people think they have an intuitive sense of what moon dust ought to look like. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 16:48, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A useful comparison to odd photos.</span></h2>
<p>If we are to discuss quirks in the nasa photos, it would be appropriate to discuss photography itself - specifically the question of what sort of quirks and unexpected results would you expect to occur by accident in real photos. I notice that hoax supporters have no knowledge of photography, beyond pointing at anything they don't understand as proof of their belief. I recall seeing a news photo of two women at the airport hugging as they greeted each other. (I think one of them was Jacqueline Kennedy - it was 1960's fashions) Because of the angle of the pose, and one woman's head being exactly behind the other, it looked like one smiling head attached to two bodies! You really couldn't tell which body the head was supposed to be on! This is the sort of thing that can happen by pure chance without anyone faking anything. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 16:48, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a minor point, but the article says "Due to a malfuntion on the Lunokhod mission, its mirrors are not as accurately placed as the Apollo mirrors." Reading <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunokhod_2.html" title="Lunokhod 2">Lunokhod 2</a> and elsewhere, it seems that Lunokhod 1 never returned any laser reflections and Lunokhod 2 only returned them for a while and then quit. Lunokhod 2 seems to have suddenly failed and left the mirror in the wrong position. In the picture, the thing on the arm in front (on the left of the photo) looks like a reflector attached to the Lunokhod. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 04:44, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Time to take pictures</span></h2>
<p>What was the reason behind the speedy deletion of the counterargument to that it would have been necessary to take one picture every 15th second? Should not things that are mentioned also have the reason for rejecting that line of reasoning mentioned? It is trivial to see the error J. White does by looking at his webpage. (He does not take into acocunt that there are two, and not one, astronauts on the surface.)Mossig 17:59, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>See below. For Apollo 11, only Armstrong held the camera, which probably actually made the process go faster. Meanwhile, what is the basis for their claim about how often pictures were taken? Maybe <i>during the interval that pictures were taken</i>, it was that fast, and why couldn't it have been anyway? Get your camera out. You can take pictures at least one every 15 seconds, even if you've got heavy gloves on. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:08, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm probably not being totally clear. The point on Apollo 11 is that, although there were two astronauts, only one was taking pictures (all or most of the time), so while it is true there were two astronauts there, the implication that they were both taking lots of photos is not correct. That's the reason I deleted it. As for the 1 every 15 seconds argument, they don't offer any actual proof of that, they just expect us to take their word for it. Given the moonbats' poor track record on evaluating qualitative evidence, I certainly wouldn't trust their arithmetic. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:15, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please read J. Whites analysis. You have a point regarding Apollo 11, but he attacks all the flights i the same way. And all his calculations have the same errors. See: <a href="http://www.aulis.com/skeleton.html" class="external free" title="http://www.aulis.com/skeleton.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aulis.com/skeleton.html</a> and compare with my comments below.

<ul>
<li>I only needed to read the first paragraph or two to realize the writer is a moron. I'm going to take <i>your</i> word for it and assume that his calculations are bogus, since he starts with a false assumption. If you want to add your comments back to the article, just keep the Armstrong situation in mind, and also see if there is any info on the <i>minimum</i> time required to take a photo. Then multiply that by the number of photos and you <i>might</i> find that the total <i>minimum</i> time required is far less than the total EVA time. Or maybe not. But I have other things to do today besides chase down these bogus leads by lunatics like that one page. I'm reminded of the assertion that "Oswald could not possibly have fired 4 shots in 6 seconds". Well, they tend forget the added time up front for lining up the first shot. Actually, they don't forget it, they leave it out, because it undermines their theory.

I was also convinced from day 1 that he had a <i>part</i> in it, because of what he said to a reporter who asked him, "Did you kill the President?" He answered, "I have not been accused of that, in fact I didn't even know about it until you asked me that question." It sounded like a rehearsed answer. The first part of that, of course, refers to the fact that he was under arrest for Police Officer Tippitt's murder at that moment. I don't think we'll ever know all the facts of the JFK assassination, for the same reason we'll never know all the facts of the Lincoln conspiracy: most everyone is dead by now. Could JFK have been a Mafia hit? Most certainly it <i>could have</i> been. They certainly had reason enough to. Anyway, it's suppertime.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Photo timing</span></h2>
<p>There are some statements about the time between photos being "implausibly high", without offering any convincing evidence to that effect. However, where Apollo 11 is concerned anyway, virtually all the photos were taken by Armstrong, hence he appears in very few of them. As one user suggested, many were taken in rapid succession (the two similar side views with the flag indicate this) and the timing seems perfectly plausible to me. Armstrong holding the camera all the time presumably made the photo-taking go faster, as there was no trading off, no fumbling with it, just Armstrong clicking away. After they got back to the earth, maybe someone thought, "Gee, it would have been nice to get Neil in a few of the shots. Too late!" As <i>National Geographic</i> pointed out, "The trouble with holding the camera is that you don't get into the picture!" <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:05, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>First, you intended to write "implausable low"? And regarding Apollo 11: If one divides the time of the EVA (151 minutes) by the number of photos (121), and assumes only one camera in operation, one arrives at one picture every 74th second. The only way to arrive at the "one photo every 15th second" is to follow the calculations by J. White, in which he deducts the time spent on other matters, without taking into account that there were two astronauts available to perform these duties. This I think warrants a mention on the main page. Especially as the text now reads as if the "15th second" number is correct, as it does not have a rebuttal. (by Mossig, forgot the curlys here) 18:14, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeh, whoever you are, "implausibly low". Whatever. And the core of their argument is that it is not possible to take pictures that frequently, while offering no evidence in support of that assertion. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:19, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>They also took some panaromas - where you take a picture, change the angle slightly to the left or right, take another one, etc. This can be done fairly quickly, which increases the photo count fairly repidly. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 19:30, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do not question that. Anybody can today make a test with a digital camera (which are most often slower than mechanical ones) and see for themselves how many pictures per minute can be judged reasonable. What I wanted to add was that the main premise on the argument is built upon a fault caclulation by J. White. As a scientist I think this is interesting, and how arguments should be rebuked. But the hasty deletion by somebody who did not even bother to read up on the issue has made me decide that this article will have to live without my input.Mossig 19:59, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>J. White's reasoning doesn't make any sense to me. He doesn't know how much time was taken up by the other activities. He is implying that you couldn't take that many phtotos because of other activities. Well, there are eight shots taken while Aldrin came down the ladder, and that took maybe three minutes, during which time Armstrong's only other duty was to watch out for Aldrin coming down the ladder. There are about that many shots of Aldrin carrying and setting up an experiment package, and Armstrong had no other duty then. There are several panoramas taken, where several shots are taken in quick succession. I think on all future landings both astronauts had cameras. It isn't like every 74 seconds the astronaut stops what he is doing to take one photo - they are bunched up, with a longer time in between. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 00:06, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even if you assume White's 15 seconds per photo for the time when they were taking photos, I don't see a problem. The camera was mounted on their spacesuit so if they were looking straight forward, that is where the camera was looking too. Most cameras have continuous focusing, but the cameras they used had a simplified focusing - four focusing "stops": for near, medium distance, far, and infinity (I think it was). I think the f/stops were simplified too, so you wouldn't have to change them very often. So to take a photo, you might have to set the rough distance stop, probably rarely have to set the f/stop, look at what you want to photograh, press the shutter (<i>by squeezing a pistol grip</i>), <s>and then wind the crank to the next frame</s>. Even fifteen seconds seems like plenty of time to do that. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 03:13, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Denial? How can you deny the fact that NASA copied from the 1929 Fritz Lang film, as one of the video links points out (<i>What Happned on the Moon</i>, part 2)? Consider these facts that apply to both the Apollo program and the 1929 film:</p>
<ol>
<li>both rockets were assembled upright in a large building</li>
<li>both rockets were rolled out to the launch pad on a transporter</li>
<li>a countdown from 10 seconds was added to the film for dramatic effect - NASA also used this</li>
<li>both rockets had three stages, and dropped a stage as the fuel was used up</li>
<li>the passengers/astronauts were strapped in their seats in both</li>
<li>the film showed a liquid in zero-G, NASA films did this too</li>
<li>both showed an Earthrise</li>
</ol>
<p>Proof positive that NASA copied the 1929 film, just as the link says.

<dd>Kaysing was head of technical publishing at Rocketdyne at the time the F-1 engine was being developed. (The first stage of the Saturn V used five of these engines.) In <i>What Happened on the Moon</i>, part 2 we get a glimpse of Kaysing's technical expertise. He said that the F-1 was too unreliable to use and that a different engine (I forgot the name) which was more reliable but had lower thrust should have been used. However, critics might point out that (1) they seemed to be reliable enough on the 13 Saturn V flights, and (2) if a lower-thrust engine was used, it might not have gotten off the ground. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 03:57, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not only that, but maybe that explains his motivation - he might have been "dissed" by NASA (even though they were right and he was wrong) so he cooked up this hoax to try to get even, or at least to be a thorn in their side (more like a mosquito bite, at worst). His off-kilter take on things at both NASA and in his (possibly purposeful) mis-readings of photos and data, in the face of all evidence to the contrary, reminds me of something Will Rogers said, along the lines of, It's not what folks <i>don't know</i> that's the problem; it's what folks know for sure and which <i>ain't so!</i> <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:05, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article says "To see stars, nothing lit by sunlight could be in the viewers field of view.(Plait 2002:158-60)", although this image seems to disprove the claim. What gives? For great justice. 18:25, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure. He says that a shuttle astronaut said that you have to turn out the lights in the shuttle to see stars. I assume that those are stars and not particles floating about. If the cockpit were lit up by sunlight, you definitely wouldn't be seeing stars. However, the Earth does appear to be in sunlight. On the other hand, I can't be certain about that since it is not overexposed compared to the cockpit. It might be a relatively long exposure and the Earth is lit by moonlight, but I don't know. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 18:35, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Neil Armstrong couldn't recall if he saw stars, and Buzz Aldrin said he definetelly didn't see any stars at all. Whereas NASA current explanation about the stars is true, it doesn't solve the issue of why 30 years ago they instructed the Apollo 11 crew to say they didn't see stars. -<a href="../../../t/e/q/User%7ETequendamia_a57b.html" title="User:Tequendamia">tequendamia</a> 02:18, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, your eye has an <a href="../../../i/r/i/Iris_%28anatomy%29.html" title="Iris (anatomy)">iris</a> that opens up wide in low light and gets small in bright light. They were out in daylight, so their irises were small, not letting in much light.

<p>Yes, Tequendamia, of course they would see stars from the moon. They would look into the sky, and if the sun got in their eyes, they would turn around. A possible chapter for the moon hoax could be the statements and behavior of the astronauts after the mission. Not allowing interviews with Armstrong at his home town, and so on. (Axlalta 05:46, 18 April 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>In order to see stars, the astronauts would have to turn from the sun and hold their hands in front of their eyes so as to block the view of the ground, other sunlit objects, and possibly even the Earth in the sky. The design of the suit might have made this impossible. (But standing in the shadow of the lander would have helped.) If it could be done, it would take time for their eyes to adjust to the darkness. Then they would then see exactly the same stars that anyone could see on Earth, except without the twinkle. This is not something that could have happened by accident, they would have had to stop what they were doing for a bit and work at it. My guess is they just had better things to do. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 06:55, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed. The moonbats seem to forget that the Apollo 11 guys were on a mission, not a sightseeing trip. They had a lengthy checklist they had to get through as quickly as possible and get out of there. They were only the surface a few hours. Now, in future missions, as confidence in the equipment grew, as the lunar excursion time was lengthened, and the lunar rover was made available, they had a little more discretionary time (as with Alan Shepard and his golf ball experiment), but on the first mission the driving philosophy was "get 'er done!" <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 09:34, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that one aspect of the "stars" problem (as well as some other things) is our Earth bias. On the Earth, when the sky is black we can see stars (if it isn't overcast) - because it is nighttime then. This bias may cause people to expect stars whenever the sky is black. On the Moon and in space, the sky is black all of the time - day or night. If the Earth had no atmosphere, stars would be visible only at night. In daylight, your eyes adjust to the brightness, making it difficult or impossible to see dim objects. If you are properly exposing a photo a similar thing happens. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 15:24, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>At source material we have "Seeing stars in space". David Latchman, B.Sc. Physics, University of the West Indies, says that the astronauts can see the stars if they look away from the sun.

<dd>So, wait a minute. This is a photo, faked by NASA, and not clearly labeled, that shows stars? I think the issue of confusion around this needs a little more explanation in the article, especially given the different reports by Gagarin and the americans on the visibility. Currently, there is no very convincing explanation of why sometimes people see them, other times they don't, and why NASA chose to fake photos with stars in sometimes... For great justice. 22:19, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It seems to me that the reason for sometimes seeing stars and sometimes not depends on the conditions - are there bright things in the field of view and are your eyes adapted for the dark. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 00:48, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It just happens they didn't explain this particular photo very well. Whoever changed the caption to say "publicity photo" was right on. Now, look farther along in the sequence, at some of the EVA stuff on the actual mission (such as this one on page 11 <a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-101/hires/s101e5048.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-101/hires/s101e5048.jpg" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>) and... guess what...

They were taken on 70mm transparency film, so they're like that on the original.

<dd>Wow, awesome photo. And please note how few stars actually appear in it. As the article has noted, some photos <i>do</i> show stars, if the brightness and contrast conditions allow it, and it is typically just the brightest stars that can register on camera. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:29, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I notice that there are as many of these "stars" in front of the shuttle as around it. My old camcorder's CCD has <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed_pattern_noise.html" title="Fixed pattern noise">Fixed pattern noise</a> that looks just like stars, so I'd bet it is either that, or some kind of RF interference getting into the image.

<dd>Is my face red, or what? I think the explanation could be even simpler: those could be spots from doing a careless job of scanning, as has happened to me sometimes if I forget to dust the surface of the scanner, especially noticeable on the dark parts of the scan, of course. Some of them <i>could</i> be stars, but there's no way to know for sure unless someone spends a week or so pursuing NASA about this. Not that they have much else to do right now.

<dd>However, the bottom line turns out to be, yet again, NO STARS! Consistent with the Apollo missions. I don't hear anyone saying the shuttle flights were faked... although they might say that in the next generation, if the shuttle stays grounded, since (like the current generation of moonbats) they won't have been around when the object in question was actually flying, so they'll feel free to deny that it happened. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a></dd>

<p>AS11-40-5874 (OF300) ( 1211k or 228k ) 110:10:33 Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag. His fingertips are visible on the far side of his faceplate. Note the well-defined footprints in the foreground. Buzz is facing up-Sun. There is a reflection of the Sun in his visor. At the bottom of Buzz's faceplate, note the white 'rim' which is slightly separated from his neckring. This 'rim' is the bottom of his gold visor, which he has pulled down. We can see the LEC straps hanging down inside of the ladder strut. In the foreground, we can see the foot-grabbing loops in the TV cable. The double crater under Neil's LM window is just beyond the LM shadow. AS11-40-5875 (OF300) ( 1205k or 232k )<br />
<br />
110:10:33 Buzz and the U.S. flag. Note the well-defined footprints in the foreground. The shadows indicate that Buzz is standing with the Sun directly in front of him. There is a reflection of the Sun in his visor. We can see the LEC straps hanging down inside of the ladder strut. In the foreground, we can see the foot-grabbing loops in the TV cable. The double crater is beyond Buzz and the LM shadow. Journal Contributors Owen Merrick, Brian McInall, and Markus Mehring call attention to the fact that, in the high-resolution version, we can see Buzz peering over at Neil. In 5874 Buzz is facing the flag and saluting; but, by the time Neil takes 5875, Buzz has turned his body slightly - and his head a great deal more - to look over to see if Neil has taken the picture, possibly having lowered his right hand in the interim. Normally, the high reflectivity of the gold visor would keep us from seeing Buzz's face but, as Mehring notes, in this case "his face is directly illuminated by the sunlight from the front and at a right angle to the observer's point of view, so it literally shines through the visor, especially because he's sticking his head forward. At different viewing and illumination angles and with his head deeper inside the helmet and less brightly illuminated, reflections off of the visor that would wash out anything behind it. But in this case we're lucky." Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek has created a two-frame movie consisting of frames 5874 and 5875 which clearly shows Buzz turning his torso slightly between frames, but without moving his feet. Note, in particular, the change in his knee positions. Both the TV record and the 16--mm film show Buzz turning in Neil's direction twice during this interval.</p>

<dd>Hi, I'm the guy who firstly modified the order, until it get reverted yesterday. Currently, I am also the maintainer of the german version of this article. The photo where Aldrin let his arms hanging down has the number AS-11-40-5874, the second where Aldrin does salute has the number AS-11-40-5875. Maybe you can understand, why the photo with the greater number was shot after the one with the less number? You can also take a look onto the Wikipedia commons images, which I uploaded recently (<a href="../../../n/a/s/Image%7ENASA_AS-11-40-5874.jpg_8d67.html" title="Image:NASA AS-11-40-5874.jpg">Image:NASA_AS-11-40-5874.jpg</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/s/Image%7ENASA_AS-11-40-5875.jpg_7327.html" title="Image:NASA AS-11-40-5875.jpg">Image:NASA_AS-11-40-5875.jpg</a>).

For a reference, look in the article about the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_Society_b62d.html" title="Flat Earth Society">Flat Earth Society</a>. It makes the same assertion, and I did not add that, it was done independently, before I entered my comments in the Apollo article.

As I've said before, maybe Kaysing put forth his looney ideas just to see who would be gullible enough to buy into it.

<dd>Looking in Google for a little bit, it is easy to find references to people who recall the Flat Earthers trying to debunk the Apollo missions, such as this sermon from sometime last year <a href="http://www.firstunitedchurchbloomington.org/sundayworship/6mar05.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.firstunitedchurchbloomington.org/sundayworship/6mar05.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. What I had forgotten was that this complaint by Flat Earthers actually preceded the moon landings. The "earthrise" video and photos from Apollo 8, which circled the moon around Christmastime in 1968, was immediately denounced by the Flat Earthers, on the grounds that since the earth was flat, it had to be a fake; a classic case of (pardon the expression) circular reasoning, akin to the "logic" used by the moonbats nowadays. I saw one site in which it was reported that one of the Apollo astronauts once said during a mission, "Eureka, Houston, the world is round!" in an obvious shot at the Flat Earthers, who had gotten their names in the papers by publicizing their viewpoint. No doubt the press picked up on the Flat Earthers largely because of their entertainment value. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 20:21, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How to pull your head out of your @$#.</span></h2>
<p>How to pull your head out of your %$&amp;.</p>
<p>There needs to be some major head-from-rear-removal going on here. STOP investing your emotions into what YOU think about the moon. STOP trying to run an agenda. STOP bullying and twisting every nuance in this article because you think you are on a mission to save people from bad science.</p>
<p>This article is an atempt at reporting people, places, and events in a non-biased manner. This is not a forum to promote the moon hoax. This is also not the place to go all McCarthy-istic and see a hoax promotion around every bend. Seriously, you need to wrap your noodle around this simple point: The Moon Hoax exists as an entity, an event if you will, unto its self. True, false, or indifferent; it doesn't matter.The moment the event was "born" and took hold it became a reportable entity. Why don't you stop trying to tear down fair and accurate accounts of the moon hoax and instead work on producing a good article ABOUT THE HOAX????</p>
<p>Example of fair and unbiased: <i><b>"Jehovah's Witnessess are of a christian denomination that believes Jesus is the son of God the Father, Jehovah."</b></i> NOT fair and very biased: <i><b>"Jehovah's Witnessess are a pseudo-christian religion because they don't think Jesus is God like it clearly says He is in the bible. All major religions(like my daddies) think they are a false religeon because they added the word "a" in John 1-1. And the flag in Psalms 102-12 isn't really waving."</b></i> (Then one would need to add 3-4 times the volume of anti- Witness propaganda for every acurate description of witnesses. All this in an article that is suposed to be about Jehovah's Witnessess.)</p>
<p>The same thing is happening here in the moon hoax article: 1 sentence on the hoax = an entire paragrph on trying to prove the one sentence wrong. Another sentence on what the hoax is = another whole paragragh on how it's wrong.</p>
<p>This is no longer an article on "The Moon Hoax." This is, instead, a private web page by people who seem scared that maybe it was a hoax and they are now hell bent on proving it wasn't. What are they so afraid of??</p>
<p>Should this article promote the moon hoax? No, it shouldn't. Should this article be about how stupid the Hoax is? No, it shouldn't. Should this article be about the Moon Hoax? Uhhhhh, yeah. That's why it's named "THE MOON HOAX". Otherwise it would be something like "How the Moon Hoax is thouroughly and utterly wrong."</p>
<p>You want to hotdog on about all the counter arguments? Pick one of the debunkers, write an article on him, and go hog wild. But don't drone on about how supply side economics is a load of crap in an article that is suposed to be about supply side economics. Don't go on about how Mozart was better than Debusy in an article about Debusy or carry on about how Jews are devious little money grubbing thieves and had it coming when you write about Auschwitz and so on.

<li>OK, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Miller_e18e.html" title="Dennis Miller">Dennis</a>. The problem is that if you just report the "facts" of what the moonbats question, and leave them unchallenged, then you lend unwarranted credibility to this fringe viewpoint. I'm not scared it was a hoax. If they had any evidence that it was a hoax, I would be interested. <i>They've got nothing.</i> Their alleged documentaries are so riddled with flaws that they actually strengthen the reliability of the historical facts. Every question they ask has been answered, but you can't necessarily answer a one-line question in one line. Some explanation is needed. And if you don't answer their questions carefully, in the article, then the article becomes inherently biased and runs the risk of swaying even more of the ignorant in the direction of this "alternate religion". This is <i>not</i> the same as writing about Mozart being better than Debusy or whatever. Those are opinions about musical quality. It is also <i>not</i> "McCarthyism". McCarthyism was about suppressing political views without discussion. There is plenty of discussion about the moon flights, and the more the better. The moonbats have the right to believe what they want, and we have the right to tell them where their reasoning is flawed. The Apollo program is an established historical event, and the moonbats have provided no evidence to the contrary. To give them a forum without answering their questions with facts, which is what you seem to want, would constitute promoting a viewpoint. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 05:57, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Great post DartFrog. This page on the moon landing hoax is getting to longwinded because belivers in the official Apollo story have to use 80% of the text to convince readers that Apollo was for real. This could be done in a more fair and rational manner. The start of the article could have a "Disputed" sign. The introduction could say something like "Nearly all interested scientists, technicians and space enthusiasts have rejected the hoax-claim as baseless". Then there could be a link to a new page for rebutting the hoax allegation, perhaps "Rebuttal of the Apollo moon landing hoax accusations". Finally this article could start to present the reasons why many people belive the Appollo project was a hoax. That should make a long enough article in itself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I do not think the Apollo belivers would stand to see such an article without destroying it on the same page, preferably inside or right after each "hoax-claim sentence". The hoax view seems to be to provocative for the Apollo enthusiasts. This is truly a controverial topic. The Apollo project was either mans greatest achivement or mans greatest hoax so far. I guess this is what makes the temperature go up, and I guess this is also a facination of the topic. (Axlalta 11:04, 23 April 2006 (UTC))</p>

<li>The hoax claim does not deserve equal weight. It has no credibility whatsoever. It's fair to report that it exists, just like it's fair to report on other myths such as the Loch Ness Monster. But to give it credibility, or to relegate the factual explanations to another page, is intellectually dishonest. However, you have inadvertently hit upon the nub of the issue. Hoax proponents cling to this myth <i>because of the reaction it provokes</i>. It's just a mind-game to them. They don't really care about the facts, they just enjoy seeing us get riled. Kind of like kids in junior high school pestering their teacher with the same questions over and over, after they've already been answered. It's only controversial because of anyone having given the time of day to this hypothesis, rather than totally ignoring it which is what we ought to do; except that we have a social conscience about the ever-increasing ignorance of science and history in America. Also, your description of us as "Apollo believers" is likewise dishonest and misleading. The moon voyages are a matter of historical record, and the moonbats have yet to produce one iota of evidence to the contrary. If you think you can cite evidence to the contrary, go ahead and try. But you can't, because <i>there ain't any!</i> <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 11:19, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(1) WP policy says that we don't have to give equal weight to fringe ideas. (2) To make another article with rebuttals to the hoax theory would be <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">forking</a>, which we're not supposed to do. (3) it is easy to say "there are no stars in the photographs", but it takes a paragraph to explain why that isn't a problem. It isn't sufficient to simply reply "there shouldn't be any stars in the photos". <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 22:59, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Excellent points. I was just checking the writeup on <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> for comparison. There is a lengthy explanation of various world religions' views of the subject, along with a writeup (roughly 1/3 of the article) of science-based challenges. It is safe to say that a much larger percentage of the world believe in Creationism than believe we did not go to the moon. While I strongly disagree with the notion of Creationism, I readily concede that it is by no means a fringe idea; yet there is the rebuttal, right on the same page. Believing we did not go to the moon is more in the realm of believing in <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> or the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bermuda_Triangle_0ade.html" title="Bermuda Triangle">Bermuda Triangle</a>... in fact, it is likely that a lot more people believe in <i>those</i> oddities than that we didn't go to the moon; yet their rebuttals are also in those articles. So there's no reason to give any special preference to this fringe "moon hoax" viewpoint. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:45, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interestingly enough, the new <i>National Geographic</i> has this editorial comment: "In almost any debate that incorporates science, they [journalists] tend to give equal time to both sides of every argument, which is like giving 5 minutes to those who say the world is round and 5 minutes to those who say it's flat." <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 07:38, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article as it is gives far too much space to NASA shills who are still desparately trying to prop up this creaking hoax. There should be a couple of paragraphs tops given over to the fact that NASA and those in the pay of USG science grants still trot out the old lies, the rest should be a debunking of the NASA hoax. 165.254.38.126 20:12, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the article gives far too much space to this fringe notion that the moon voyages did not occur. No one is "desparate" at NASA, that's a fantasy on the part of the moonbats. The desparation is on the part of those like yourself who keep pushing the real hoax, the one perpetrated by Kaysing and his crowd, which has been proven over and over again to have no credibility whatsoever. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:22, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're funny! Of course NASA's desparate! The whole 'do we publish a book to try to prop it up, or would that make us look too desparate' issue is just the tip of the iceberg! 'Moonbats' is just a cheap ad hominem attack - the last resort of the intellectually bancrupt. Face facts - the landing hoax is becoming increasingly difficult to perpetuate. It's ok. You can admit it. 165.254.38.126 05:15, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Face facts: There is no evidence that the moon flights did not occur. The idea that NASA is desperate about Apollo is a moonbat fantasy. NASA couldn't care less what the moonbats think, other than the few occasions when they assault people like they did to Buzz Aldrin. The only thing NASA is desparate about is getting the shuttle flying again so they don't get their funding cut. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:58, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

EXCELLENT POINTS. This page should be removed. Total violation of a neutral point of view. Censorship is rampant. I have put up this link: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/apolloreality/" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/apolloreality/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/apolloreality/</a> many times and it keeps getting deleted for no reason at all. It is a very informative site that has pictures and arguments never before seen. It should be included in hoax allegation links.</p>
<p>Seriously this page is so laughable and it totally proves that PRO-APOLLO Nuts have something to hide. They censor links claiming that is a non-notable link. So what is a notable link if you think all hoax allegations sites are bullshit? This site <a href="http://www.geocities.com/apolloreality/" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/apolloreality/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/apolloreality/</a> makes EXCELLENT points, has evidence that Michael J. Tuttle doctored some Nasa photos in the mid-90's and has explanations how easy it is manipulate photos.</p>
<p>You guys seriously make me laugh. A lot of people that question the authencity of the Apollo record are not ignorant, paranoid, conspiracy theorists. Rather they are people who are smart enough to realize that just by taking a techno-historical perspective, it was unfeasible at that time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your idea of "neutrality" is to let the absurd claims of the moonbats stand without response. Since you remain a-none, my guess is that you are also the author of that web page you keep posting. I'm not the one deleting it, though. I would prefer it stay, since it helps underscore the moonbats' lunacy. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:09, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wahkeenah, you are a sad sad man. Since when do links need a response? That site has a page rating of 5/10 on google, which is very good and notable. Also hoax allegation links should include links with original content such as the one I posted. Also, I am not the author of that site.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are plenty of ways to artificially boost Google ratings, in case one is obsesse with the Lemming mentality. But that link doesn't need any response, nor should it be deleted; it's good entertainment, about the fantasy parallel universe the moonbats have constructed for themselves and fully believe in, despite the lack of any evidence. It's kind of like Linus talking about the Great Pumpkin. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:51, 22 May 2006 (UTC) P.S.

<li>All of a sudden the simple "we didn't go to the moon" argument seems reasoned by comparison. I especially liked that one item, earlier on this page, about how the moon doesn't really exist, it's just a holographic image projected onto the sky. There's some outside-the-box thinking for you. I wonder, when Beethoven wrote his <i>Moonlight Sonata</i> around the turn of the 19th century, if he ever suspected that it was just a hologram he was writing about. Of course, the hologram theory runs counter to the "towed into orbit" theory. Those consipiracists need to get together and get their stories straight, lest they be subjected to ridicule. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 07:12, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>1. It is an eye-witness report of someone who claims to have observed the hoax.</li>
<li>2. It is claimed on many of the hoax sites that these exist. I make no claim about it myself.</li>
<li>3. Which term? The claim is made that on the 'classic' Aldrin photo, the cross hairs are not in their usual position. Since they are etched on the glass of the camera, that means it has been cropped. But NASA claims it has not been. Demonstrating tampering. So it is claimed.</li>

When they start out with a false assertion like that, they lose me. It's like that "documentary" from 2001. The first words out of their mouths were about the supposedly "waving" flag. That was totally incorrect, and it meant that everything they said after that was highly suspect. I watched that show, or started to, with some interest.

<dd>I think they also started yapping about the near-full-earth photos not showing stars. That displayed their total ignorance about photography. So if they know nothing about obvious stuff like the behavior of objects in a vacuum, and the problems of photographing bright objects, then how likely is it that they know anything about anything else? Given the rebuttals to their various arguments, <i>not likely</i>. And posting that stuff about what somebody <i>thought</i> they saw on TV decades ago undermines the moonbats' credibility, so it's fine and dandy. I have more of a problem with assertions of "facts" that a photo is "impossible" (with no explanation of why they think that, nor any research as to how it might be possible) and also that the two C-shaped objects are identical, for which there is no evidence presented. That stuff is not neutral, its POV and should be altered to be neutral. However, you won't let me, because you will keep reverting it because its unprovable assertions match your own POV. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:32, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I actually don't have a POV on this. I am trying to write a neutral article that describes the controversy.

<dl>
<dd>Your actions belie your words. At the very least, you need to say that the conspiracists <i>claim</i> those C-shaped marks are identical, not that they absolutely <i>are</i> identical, since <i>I can't even see the bloody things in the pictures</i>. And while you're at it, explain what the devil a "prop continuity marker" is supposed to be. I would also still like to know why you think that a TV program that starts with two lies still has any credibility. Maybe "logic" is not quite the right word; it's "reasoning". <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:02, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, we can make the changes to show that the theorists claim that. People can look themselves. I'm not surprised you can't see them, since you claim not the be able to see the cross hairs either. A prop continuity marker is where pieces of scenery or props are marked with a letter or number to match up their place on the stage so that they are in the same place in every shot. I think that all of the claims need to be evaluated from a neutral perspective. I don't know why you find that such a difficult idea. For great justice. 16:02, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've zoomed in on high-resulution copies of the two photos showing the rock, and I can't see any "C" on the ground either. There is a sort of C shape that is actually on the rock, and that may be what they are talking about. But that is obviously something on the rock, not the ground. The "C" they point to is the hair or fiber that is on some of the copies. As far as using "A" through "Z" for prop markers, it looks to me like there were many more than 26 rocks out there, so they would quickly run out of letters. Also, why would a rock need to be placed in one particular spot? <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 18:29, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He was a NASA employee. We don't know who faked the photo, but it was published in a book by NASA employees, perpetrating the hoax.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Golf</span></h2>
<p>What's with the assertion that it was "impossible" to play at golf on the moon? The golf thing was well-covered at the time (which I'm guessing was well before yours); Shepard took (possibly smuggled aboard) a couple of specially-made golf balls along with a clubhead-like attachment that he could screw on to some other conventional device. As I recall, he was only able to hold the club with one hand due to the bulky suit. He took a whack at it, and exclaimed, "Miles and miles!" but the TV camera was fixed on him, so we had to take his word for it. Shepard was known as kind of a jokester, and as I recall, NASA wasn't all that happy about this extracurricular activity on their dime, but once he was there with this ersatz golf equipment, what could they do? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:39, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm researching this. I have the US hardback edition of that book, and I see the photo he is talking about. However, I'm pretty sure that the photo was <i>not</i> taken directly by an astronaut, since it isn't in the 70 mm Hasselblad photos that the astronauts took. The quality looks too good to have been taken by a TV camera, but not good enough for a Hasselblad. I think it was probably taken my an automated movie camera on the surface, but I haven't found a verification of that yet, so I haven't said anything in the article itself. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 01:43, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Excellent. And please don't damage your book on our account, for sure. It is an interesting question: Where was the camera? That's a fair question. To jump to the conclusion that it was "impossible" is ludicrous. But that's typical for the moonbats. The picture is useful for another reason, as it shows a similar relative position of the LEM and the antenna for this Apollo 14 flight as on that web page that argues about those objects in Apollo 12. In both cases, the antenna is at a 45 degree angle away from the LEM, and both the near photo and the distant photo on that website are <i>consistent with each other</i>, despite the website's claims to the contrary. The moonbats isolate on specific items as their "evidence", but the more one sees the broader picture, the more their phony arguments get shown up. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:35, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A qualified victory for the moonbats. The "impossible" photo is, in fact, a mockup. Please see the transcript at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/a14.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/a14.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> under the section "A Nice Day for a Game of Golf" and specifically the comments at 135:09:26 about how they composed this photo from bits and pieces of various Hasselblad photos, presumably so it would make a nice illustration for <i>Moonshot</i>. The article points out that the only actual photographic record of the golf shots was the TV coverage, which squares with what I remember. I can see why they pulled it from the reprint of the book. I'm guessing the primordial moonbats were all over that one, or at least the editor was once he found out it was a montage. The writeup doesn't say who cooked up the idea of the mockup. It could have been one of Shepard's little jokes. Unfortunately, this kind of tomfoolery triggers the moonbats' "told ya so" dance. However, it does point out that something that looks illogical probably is... like my first reaction to this photo... and like my general reaction to <i>most</i> of the moonbats' arguments. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 07:19, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry about the confusion. I found a site that was most interesting, maybe already mentioned somewhere here, "Who mourns for Apollo?", which made mincemeat of the 2001 hoax "documentary", and showed the mockup photo in question, and put forth the idea that the real coverup was about finding ancient artifacts on the moon. I have to say that theory is probably a fantasy, but to my mind it has more credibility than the notion that we didn't go there in the first place. I was amused that the author says NASA is quite happy with having the moonbats around, because it diverts attention from the "real" conspiracy. In short, the author thinks the moonbats are both dupes <i>and</i> dopes. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:32, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, a fake photo. The only problem with it was that they should have indicated somewhere in the book that this was artwork rather than a true photo, since that was not clear... although I had my suspicions, as it seemed to show an oversized golf ball sailing off into the distance. Tinkering with photos is nothing new. I recall seeing a baseball game-action photo from the late 1800s, a beautiful picture by standards of that day, except that someone had pained in a baseball that looked the size of a grapefruit. Anyway, the initial ambiguity of the "Moon Shots" photo contrasts with the poster that NASA produced showing Jupiter and its various satellites kind of randomly scattered, and it was made clear (for the benefit of the double-digit IQ's in the audience) that the photo was a montage. Similarly, in the early days of MTV they used some stuff from Apollo 11 implying that they had planted an MTV flag on the moon, which only a <i>true</i> moron would have thought was somehow real. I also understand about the cross-hairs now: they were intended for exact lineups of panoramic shots. Seems simple enough. That "Who Mourns for Apollo?" site made that clear to me, as I was uncertain of that aspect of the whole deal before. Meanwhile, I'm intrigued by the idea that our astronauts might have found evidence of an ancient civilization (maybe a Krell outpost?) on the moon. It reminds me of a couple of years ago when we had a rover on Mars that was running into some technical difficulties, and someone mocked up a photo indicating that the last transmission from it showed Marvin the Martian studying this intruder into his domain. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 22:46, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, that's pretty blurry, like UFO or Loch Ness monster photos - generally, blurry ones are easier to fake because you don't have to get details right. But what does this blurry photo prove?

<dd>All it proves is that when they really <i>try</i> to fake an image, they're not very good at it. Most of the images are real, some might be edited (like taking out the crosshairs so the photos "look better"). That's a widespread and sometimes questionable journalistic practice. Maybe you've seen the famous photo of <a href="../../../t/y/_/Ty_Cobb_62bb.html" title="Ty Cobb">Ty Cobb</a> sliding into third base. I always thought it looked kind of strange, until I saw the <i>uncropped</i> version in a book about Charles Conlon's photos. In that case, it's just baseball. There's no harm in editing stuff, but journalists should respect their audience enough to let them know. Obviously, in 1975 it never occurred to whoever put that mockup together (and where does it say NASA themselves did it?) that the moonbats would use it to try to make their case. As I said before, that picture looked suspicious to me. But looking suspicious and <i>being</i> suspicious are not the same thing.

<dd>Maybe a better analogy is the Holocaust, but any historical event can be questioned by those who (1) did not live through it and (2) have an agenda for not wanting to accept it. I do not inherently trust NASA or any other organization. Keep in mind, these are the guys whose bureaucratic practices have led to several disasters and near-disasters. But I do trust my sense of reason and logic, and nothing I've seen so far has led me to believe that the historical record is anything other than what it is. Nor do I buy into the more-believable notion that there was evidence of ancient astronauts on the moon. But like the "moon-flights-were-a-humbug" hypothesis, it's worth a look. The evidence for the moon flights has been given a <i>lot</i> of looks, and the moonbats have failed to make their case. If the best you could do for citing faked "evidence" is that ill-advised mockup in the Shepard book, you wouldn't last 5 minutes in a courtroom. And, by the way, where's your evidence that <i>NASA themselves</i> produced that bit of 5th grade artwork? Maybe they did, maybe they didn't, I don't know.

<dd>Independent, sceptical historians examine the evidence themselves. The mark of a scientifically or historically valid theory is that it is open to independent scrutiny and does not depend solely on trusting a government agency that has been shown to fake evidence. The documentary, eye witness, archeological, etc evidence, that they have access to. Nobody claims to have carried out the second world war entirely in-house, and produce all the evidence themselves. That is what is being claimed with the 'moon landings'. There is so much independently verifiable evidence for the second world war and the holocaust when compared to the moon landings, the comparison is ridiculous and offensive. For the sake of good taste I would advise you not to push this odious analogy any further. For great justice. 05:08, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're threatening me now? Oh, I'm shaking in my red-white-and-blue shirt. (That's a reference to a funny U.S. TV ad - I'm guessing you're British). The analogy I'm making is that once it is "safe", the conspiracists on <i>any</i> subject will go at it full steam, as they did once the Apollo mission was over. General Eisenhower reportedly took pains to try to document the Holocaust, specifically on the grounds that someday there would be those who would deny it. If NASA had thought there was any serious possibility that the facts of their mission would be seriously challenged, maybe they would have done a better job of "proving" it. I'm as suspicious of the government as anyone, but I don't question the Apollo mission because it has the ring of truth to it, reinforced by the fact that every bit of "evidence" to the contrary has been proven wanting. In any case, the allegedly large percentage of the populace who find Apollo suspicious probably also find algebra suspicious, so it's irrelevant. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 08:50, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The fact is that there is no way to independently verify the moon landings. NASA's claims do not stand up to rigorous historical method, which is there precisely to prevent this kind of hoax. NASA's 'evidence' doesn't stand up to proper analysis. Those are the facts. For great justice. 14:27, 16 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, it's not national pride. If NASA pulled off the most incredible hoax in the history of the universe, I'd like to know about it. But there is no evidence of it. Your fundamental flaw is that you start with the premise that NASA lied, and then try to construct an alternate universe that supports that premise. But it doesn't work. Every challenge you pose to the historic record has a reasonable explanation. Maybe I should ask, what evidence would you accept that the flights <i>did</i> occur? I think I already know the answer to that one, though. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:10, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I start with <i>evidence</i> that NASA lied. There is no <i>historical record</i>. There is only the NASA created one. I would accept any third party presented proof. For example, a non-NASA affiliated examination (either by landing or by telescope) of the 'landing site'. For great justice. 17:50, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is no evidence that NASA lied about the moon flights having occurred, and the historical record is plentiful, you just don't want to accept it. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:59, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You realize that the fact there is no historical record from an unbiased source is <i>not</i> evidence that NASA lied? Just to show how silly that so-called evidence is: suppose Joe thinks of a number between 1 and 10. When asked what number he's thinking of, he replies "1". No one else has any evidence this is true. Does this suggest that Joe was lying? Of course not.</dd>
<dd>Similarly, lack of collaborating evidence for the moon landing is <i>not</i> evidence they were faked — especially since no one besides NASA has had the ability to check the landing site. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 18:04, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I understand that.

<dd>Pretty damn mild evidence in this case. There is one photo which apparently has been formed from a composite (if I understand correctly) for cutesy effect.

<dd>Read the article. It says that "The Vedas state that the moon is 800,000 miles farther from the earth than the sun." This is the reason why astronauts couldn't have made it to the moon.

We certainly can test the distance to the moon, and have done so.--Thalia42 01:06, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I posted it, although, in fact, it is the shills and astro-nots who are religious about this - even in the face of evidence that NASA shills faked visual evidence of the 'landing' they cling to their beliefs. It's nothing like evolution - evolution is a scientific theory that generates predictions that have been tested by independent observers. The moon landing hoax does not - the claim that the landings took place have been constructed in a way that is entirely untestable by independent sceptics. For great justice. 00:53, 16 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is no "claim" that the landings took place. The Apollo program was a duly recorded series of historical events. The "claim" is only that these events did <i>not</i> occur, but there <i>is no evidence</i> that they did not occur. You are equating acceptance of the historical record as a "religion". You should always be skeptical of the historical record.

<dd>The media reported only what they were shown. It was the height of the cold war, and disent was not encouraged. All of the 'evidence' for the 'landings' was literally manufactured by NASA. There is evidence that you admit to that they faked visual 'evidence' of the landing. What more could you <i>possibly</i> want? Obviously they are going to choose only the best faked photos to release, so to prove that all of them are fake is going to be impossible. They have many, many experts, making the best fakes they can. The fact that any can be shown to be fakes is enough. Seriously. What evidence would you accept? In reality, you are not prepared to accept any evidence of your religion being faked. Every time new evidence is produced you find some other hole to hide in to preserve your crumbing worldview.

How could this alleged conspiracy be better controlled than the many secrets about the Vietnam War, and Watergate, and all that other stuff? Seriously. If you bother to study the history of our space program, you will see a logical flow and continuity to it all.

<dd>Hey, that reminds me... you're saying I should reject the record of the Apollo missions based on one obviously mocked-up photo. Yet you're also saying I should accept the conspiracists arguments, despite their entirely mocked-up 2001 "documentary"... that just because they made a few mistakes (ha!), that doesn't negate their whole theory. Pray tell me, where is the logic in <i>that</i>? As I said, I started watching the show with some interest. When they started going on about the "waving flag", I said "You've got to be kidding! This is their so-called 'evidence'???" And when they started talking about the photos, it was clear they had never actually either seen or taken a nighttime photo and thus had no credibility talking about it. I concluded the producers were either morons or liars... or both. Anybody who watched that "documentary" and believed what they were seeing should go back to their high school and sue them for fraud, for having allegedly provided an education. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 08:59, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Wait, wait, I've got it... that moon hoax "documentary" was <i>produced by NASA</i>, because they knew it would be so full of holes that it would invite further ridicule of the moonbats. And it fits with the current conspiracy, because Fox News has also successfully convinced the American public of the merits of the Iraq war. So it's clear that Fox is in bed with the government.

<dd>The question doesn't make much sense. There are lots of scenarios I could imagine that would change my opinion on the moon landings. Say, discovering a studio in which the landings were filmed (with suitable evidence, say, unedited films). Or if dozens of participants in the conspiracy came forward with credible stories of their involvement (including evidence). The best evidence would be if a lunar orbiter was capable of taking photos of the landing site and there was no evidence of landing there. This is a list of possible evidence that would do it. But that last element would be the most compelling. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 18:18, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I don't know why you think the question doesn't make sense - I'm trying to get W to frame a hypothesis for his faith - to think sceptically about his beliefs. So, the proof requirements are: 1. Evidence that the place claimed as the landing site is empty. 2. The remains of a NASA studio. 3. Unedited video of the hoax being film. 4. Confessions. That's progress, but, you see, none of the defenders are calling for imaging or return trips to verify, NASA would have been very foolish not to have destroyed the sets / original video, and, in any event, will claim that they are training materials, and, when Buzz Aldrin is asked to swear that it was not a conspiracy or confess, and will not swear, the astronots cheer him! They are not really interesting in evidence that shakes their beliefs. For great justice. 18:24, 16 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My last comment on this utterly off-topic digression (talk pages aren't for debates like this). *Of course* "defenders" aren't calling for return trips in order to refute what they regard as a fringe theory. A return trip is remarkably expensive and would prove nothing to the theorists anyway. After all, if NASA can send a return trip, then they can also send a trip to plant fake evidence. And no space agency (NASA or otherwise) is motivated to spend the money necessary to verify the previous moon landings. It really is not an issue.</dd>
<dd>As far as the other comments go: If NASA is stupid enough to get crosshairs wrong on faked moon landing shots, then they're stupid enough to leave behind more compelling evidence than that. Getting the crosshairs wrong seems to betray real carelessness.</dd>
<dd>As I've said, this is my last word in the debate. Talk pages are supposed to be about article quality, not editor beliefs. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 18:54, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are right - the evidence is inconclusive, and no-one is about to do the experiment that would be needed to settle the issue. For great justice. 19:18, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The press managed to uncover a lot of truths about the Vietnam War and Watergate and the Mafia and all manner of stuff, yet the bureaucrats at NASA managed to keep this from them? Gimme a break. That other writer, though, has pretty well covered it. The most conclusive would be to somehow find that the supposed landing sites had nothing there. A deathbed confession by one of the astronauts would be interesting, though less convincing, since the Van Allen Belts might have fried his brain. I don't want my tax dollars spent to prove something that is already widely known to be true. If there's a <i>different</i> reason to go back to the moon (like if they figure out that there's oil there or something), that would be OK. I do take mild issue with the complaint of the one user.

<dd>So you would question a confession, and you don't want to verify the site? You've set it up so that it's not falsifiable. You're a true believer! There's only one experiment that would prove it for you, and you would oppose doing it! For great justice. 15:00, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I said a deathbed confession would be <i>less convincing</i>, not that it would be non-credible. And I would very much like for us to be able to go back to the moon, <i>if there was a reason to</i>, and not just to <i>prove</i> something that most of us are already confident in.

It's also worth pointing out that as poor as Bush's ratings have been reported to be, the pools show he's 3 times as credible as the moon landing hoax story. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:23, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would add "landing advocates (or proponents)", and "landing skeptics" respectively, for those who advocate the NASA explanation, and are skeptical of it.

<dd>You're full of the rhetoric of evidence and science, but a core principle is that independent observers should be able to check and verify. You can't do that with the landing claims.

Unfortunately I feel on this you are pushing your own beliefs on this. The topic needs treating more delicately that this especially when you consider that the number of people who believe it was a hoax isn't a small number of people hiding in the corner somewhere but the number is extremely high for conspiracy theories. It is well known that a sizable portion of the population believes there was some kind of coverup or conspiracy regarding the landings and you making edits specifically deriding that portion is not NPOV making.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">telescopes</span></h2>
<p>Forgive me if this is a dumb question, but could a powerful enough telescope allow you to see the remains of the LEM? Would that settle this issue once and for all?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Probably not an earth-based telescope, due to atmospheric distortion. An orbiting telescope (like Hubble) with sufficient magnification might be able to do it, but I think Hubble itself is "far-sighted" to focus on distant planets and galaxies, so Hubble itself wouldn't work. Maybe some of our incredible spy satellites <i>might</i> work, but keep in mind the moon is way much farther away, and the LEM may just be too small. (Had NASA anticipated the moonbat issue, maybe they could have unfurled a large U.S. Flag visible by telescope, or at least a "Kilroy Was Here" banner.) Besides those technical issues, the lunar surveyors of the 1960s mapped the surface thoroughly, prior to the Apollo missions, so there is no particular reason to spend the money aiming a telescope at the moon to re-survey it, and certainly not to "prove" that the Apollo missions really happened. We have more important stuff to spend our tax dollars on, like preserving endangered species, such as the wolverine, and the public school system.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">No Testing of the Lunar Lander</span></h2>
<p>The most damning bit of evidence that the landings were faked is missing from this article. That is the notable absence of any unmanned moon missions or verified tests of the lunar lander. The risk of stranding astronauts on the moon, on live television, would have had dramatic PR implications. And yet the lunar lander never completed an unmanned landing and liftoff?</p>
<p>Wiki's own apollo page says that Apollo 10 tested the lunar lander to within 10 kilometers of the surface. Other sites say "orbit and return." From an engineering and risk-management standpoint, either scenario is patently unacceptable as the precursor to a manned mission. Broodlinger 02:46, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, there was <i>major</i> risk attached to these flights. That's why military men were used instead of civilians. If you study the progress of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo, you will see that everything was done step-by-step, methodically. Mercury tested orbital basics and physical reactions to space travel, first sub-orbitally and then with progressively more and more orbits. Generally, each flight was longer than the previous. Rendezvous and docking were practiced during Gemini. Apollo 8 tested the ability to get to and orbit the moon (which had already been done using unmanned craft); Apollo 9 tested separation, rendezvous and docking, in earth orbit; Apollo 10 did the same thing except in lunar orbit (with near-disastrous consequences); and finally Apollo 11 successfully landing and re-launching of the LEM. And the successive Apollo flights built on the knowledge of the previous ones. Meanwhile, there had also been plenty of testing of these vehicles on earth, using whatever methods they could get their hands on in the 1960s. Try not to judge the approach of the 60s by standards of the ultra-cautious, introspective stance of the 21st century. That was a "can-do" time, and people were willing to take the risks; high-risk, high-gain. One consequence of the aftermath of the Vietnam War was perpetual hand-wringing on the part of the USA, on any kind of enterprise. Such was not the case in the 60s. But that was before your time, so it's hard for you to relate to. Read the book, <i>The Right Stuff</i>, and you'll get some insight. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:37, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Perhaps it is because I develop software, and I cannot write software that works perfectly, I would want the engineers to prove the equipment and software works! They could start by putting animals into Earth orbit. When they figured that out they could send an unmanned rocket into moon orbit. When they got that working, they could send an unmanned rocket to land on the moon, and then the lunar lander would fly back to the earth. However, while NASA did practice putting animals and people into Earth orbit, they skipped the testing of the lunar landing and return to Earth!24.7.34.99 00:16, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not true. Apollo 9 tested the descent and re-ascent and docking of the lunar module in earth orbit. And they did a lot of ground-based testing of the maneuvering of the LEM, probably using gantries like that one article you posted. But as you well know, eventually you have to run the program in production. Maybe they could have tested this stuff with chimps, but those critters just aren't that good with slide rules. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:52, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Oh, one more news flash. The landing, at least the first one, was <i>not</i> on live TV. It was being covered on radio, where "The <i>Eagle</i> has landed" was heard. The TV coverage came a few hours later, when Armstrong and then Aldrin went down the steps after having activated the camera and done all manner of checklist items. The video you've seen of the descent was <i>film footage</i>, not television. And by the way, the craft had various thrusters on it for maneuvering, not just the main one underneath. In fact, Armstrong had to make a last-second maneuver slightly to one side, because he was about to land on the edge of a crater, which could have been disastrous. Also, as I recall, engine cutoff was at about 10 feet above ground. The struts were designed to absorb that shock, and keep in mind the acceleration is only 1/6 what it is on the earth, so it was roughly equivalent to falling only a foot or two.

<p>I had previously changed the "rebuttals" to the more neutral-sounding "responses". It occurs to me that "claims" should be neutralized also, and I'm thinking "challenges" is better. I will go ahead and do that in one shot, so if y'all don't like it, you can revert in one shot.

That term carries an automatic built-in bias, no matter which side it's applied to (and it's applied to both). "Argue" or "point out" or something along those lines would be better (I don't want to overuse "challenge"). I'm not ready to change all of those yet, though. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 10:48, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't been following this article for several days. Yes, it said "claims and rebuttals" for a long time. Then someone changed it to "claims and counter-claims". I changed it back to "rebuttal" because (if you look at the definition of "claim"), only the hoax proponents are making a claim. The other side isn't making a claim or counter-claim. I, too, thought about changing it to "rebuttal", but I didn't because that might not be neutral enough.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On another note: I think that article talk pages are for discussing changes to the article. I think there has been (1) too much discussion of the merits or lack of merits of the hoax claim on the talk page. Sometimes I see that there have been dozens of edits to the talk page. That should be in some other forum.

<dd>A voice of reason enters the fray. Maybe this page should be archived and started with a clean slate. I think the article is fairly neutral, but I have a hunch that will never be agreed upon.

I encourage other users to follow <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and remove any future distracting points NoodleBoy raises to his talkpage. Thanks. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 02:32, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>LOL at your insecurity. You are truly unbelievable. Seriously grow a thicker skin and stop censoring relevant points. This is a hoax allegations page, remember and this is evidence of a hoax. Also we are in the discussion page. You are just afraid people will swing by and see this discussion because I have so thoroughly owned you all that you used the last resort of deleting this whole discussion. LMFAO @ your lack of self confidence in your beliefs.<a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoodle_boy_ab11.html" title="User:Noodle boy">Noodle boy</a> 02:37, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, this is the talk/discussion page for <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_moon_landing_hoax_accusations.html" title="Apollo moon landing hoax accusations">Apollo moon landing hoax accusations</a> not <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_13.html" title="Apollo 13">Apollo 13</a> or <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> hoaxes. -<a href="../../../t/h/1/User%7ETh1rt3en_3ea3.html" title="User:Th1rt3en">th1rt3en</a> 02:39, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Careful, <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoodle_boy_ab11.html" title="User:Noodle boy">User:Noodle boy</a>, we have both a <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a> and a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">no personal attacks</a> policy. You're getting dangerously close to violating them. Talkpages are not for general discussion, they are for discussion about the article not the general subject. Wikipedia is not a chatroom nor a message board. If you want to debate, there are plenty of other places you can go to do this. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 02:40, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>LOL. You moved all my posts because they are threatening to your position. I have never seen such censorship. I would post my hoax allegations on the main page but they would be deleted quickly by nasa sychophants such as yourself. These actions just make me believe that much more that the Nasa missions were faked. You guys are not open about discussing the issues, you guys consistently delete valid and cogent hoax allegations links and now finally you have deleted my posts from this page. This is unbelievable.<a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoodle_boy_ab11.html" title="User:Noodle boy">Noodle boy</a> 02:47, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you are serious about wanting to write prose for the article, please present that as such. Copying and pasting, and not framing your discussion with regards to the article itself is not what the talkpage is for. Proposing items for inclusion is fine, but none of the sections that were moved to your talkpage seemed to indicate you were interested in anything of the sort. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 02:54, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
