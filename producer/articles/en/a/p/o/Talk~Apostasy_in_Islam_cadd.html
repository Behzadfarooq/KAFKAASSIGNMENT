<p>I believe this article has a horrible point of view. To give it any validity cite sources referring to the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni_Islam_4332.html" title="Sunni Islam">Sunni</a> <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madhhab.html" title="Madhhab">madhhabs</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shia.html" title="Shia">Shia</a> Imams declarations (and a link to how their power is derrived), cite views from <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_movements_within_Islam_48bd.html" title="Liberal movements within Islam">Liberal movements within Islam</a>. Also cite the Qur'an sura 2, ayat 256 "no compulsion" to make the argument as many have done that it is not a punishable offense. But, do not just make this article a laundry list of what the author thinks counts as shirk and not have any reputable source to back it up.... and please, get legitimate sources, online is not the best means for this. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 03:09, 20 Apr 2005 (GMT)</p>
<p>I disagree with this evaluation. While some sentences could be reworded, the factual content is generally correct. Citing sources in English is on the whole difficult, because much of the relevant literature has not been translated from Arabic for the simple reason that any reputed jurisprudent would have to be fluent in Arabic anyway. However, it is significant that the penalty of death for (unrecanted) apostasy is common to the four major schools of Sunni law (Shafi'i, Maliki, Hanafi and Hanbali), and to Shia law. It may be Politically Correct to disbelieve this, but no one to date has been able to provide evidence that these schools disagree on this particular issue. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 04:11, 05 Aug 2005 (GMT)</p>
<p>On further reflection, I think there is a different problem with the section on penalties. It fails to distinguish between penalties according to Sharia, and penalties according to civil/criminal codes, which practically all nation states have. The actual practice in countries which declare themselves Islamic is often a mixture, where not all legislated codes are derived from Sharia sources. The term "traditional society" in the article thus blurs the distinction seriously. Penalties according to the maddhabs, as representative of the traditional or orthodox viewpoint, are facts which can be stated and verified. So can legislation in Islamic countries. But they should probably be treated in separate paragraphs, with some material to indicate that a distinction exists. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 05:41:02, 2005-08-06 (UTC)</p>

<p>The very word, 'apostate' has a pejorative connotation. Are we falling into the language of critics of dissidents within Islam by using the word 'apostate'?</p>

<p>I think there is a danger in saying "apostasy in Islam is defined as" because, as far as I know there is no definition... and if there it it would be in the form of a Qur'anic quote. Apostasy in itself means rejecting ones faith and people have various perception on what constitutes rejection. To some it may only be when you deny it in your own words and to others it can be acting in a way deemed "incongruous with Islam". We must not portray Islam to be monolithic because there is great variance in thought... not only among different sects, but among individuals. By the same token Islam does not define sharia, people define it for certain schools... my POSC teacher talked about "sharia law says" and we must first find out which school of sharia (if any) you follow before such a statement can be made. The same goes for apostasy since it, and its consequent punishment (or lack thereof) is defined by what school of belief you follow. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 07:34, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here is the section from Keller's book (page 595):</dd>
</dl>
<p>o8.0 APOSTASY FROM ISLAM (RIDDA)</p>
<p>(O: Leaving Islam is the ugliest form of unbelief (kufr) and the worst. It may come about through sarcasm, as when someone is told, "Trim your nails, it is sunna," and he replies, "I would not do it even if it were," as opposed to when some circumstance exists which exonerates him of having committed apostasy, such as when his tongue runs away with him, or when he is quoting someone, or says it out of fear.) o8.1 When a person who has reached puberty and is sane voluntarily apostatizes from Islam, he deserves to he killed. o8.2 In such a case, it is obligatory for the caliph (A: or his representative) to ask him to repent and return to Islam. If he does, it is accepted from him, but if he refuses, he is immediately killed. o8.3 It he is a freeman, no one besides the caliph or his representative may kill him. If someone else kills him, the killer is disciplined (def: o17) (O: for arrogating the caliph's prerogative and encroaching upon his rights, as this is one of his duties). o8.4 There is no indemnity for killing an apostate (O: or any expiation, since it is killing someone who deserves to die). o8.5 If he apostatizes from Islam and returns several times, it (O: i.e. his return to Islam, which occurs when he states the two Testifications of Faith (def: o8.7(12))) is accepted from him, though he is disciplined (o17). o8.6 (A: If a spouse in a consummated marriage apostatizes from Islam, the couple are separated for a waiting period consisting of three intervals between menstruations. If the spouse returns to Islam before the waiting period ends, the marriage is not annulled but is considered to have continued the whole time (dis: m7.4).)</p>
<p>ACTS THAT ENTAIL LEAVING ISLAM</p>
<p>o8.7 (O: Among the things that entail apostasy from Islam (may Allah protect us from them) are:</p>
<p>(1) to prostrate to an idol, whether sarcastically, out of mere contrariness, or in actual conviction, like that of someone who believes the Creator to be something that has originated in time. Like idols in this respect are the sun or moon, and like prostration is bowing to other than Allah, if one intends reverence towards it like the reverence due to Allah; (2) to intend to commit unbelief, even if in the future. And like this intention is hesitating whether to do so or not: one thereby immediately commits unbelief; (3) to speak words that imply unbelief such as "Allah is the third of three," or "I am Allah <i>— unless one's tongue has run away with one, or one is quoting another, or is one of the friends of Allah Most High (wali, def: w33) in a spiritually intoxicated state of total oblivion (A: friend of Allah or not, someone totally oblivious is as if insane, and is not held legally responsible (dis: k13.1(O:))), for these latter do not entail unbelief;</i> (4) to revile Allah or His messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace); (5) to deny the existence of Allah, His beginningless eternality, His endless eternality, or to deny any of His attributes which the consensus of Muslims ascribes to Him (dis: v1); (6) to be sarcastic about Allah's name, His command, His interdiction, His promise, or His threat; (7) to deny any verse of the Koran or anything which by scholarly consensus (def: b7) belongs to it, or to add a verse that does not belong to it; (8) to mockingly say, "I don't know what faith is"; (9) to reply to someone who says, "There is no power or strength save through Allah": "Your saying 'There's no power or strength, etc.' won't save you from hunger"; (10) for a tyrant, after an oppressed person says, "This is through the decree of Allah," to reply, "I act without the decree of Allah"; (11) to say that a Muslim is an unbeliever (kafir) (dis: w47) in words that are uninterpretable as merely meaning he is an ingrate towards Allah for divinely given blessings (n: in Arabic, also "kafir"); (12) when someone asks to be taught the Testification of Faith (Ar. Shahada, the words, "La ilaha ill Allahu Muhammadun rasulu Llah" (There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah)), and a Muslim refuses to teach him it; (13) to describe a Muslim or someone who wants to become a Muslim in terms of unbelief (kufr); (14) to deny the obligatory character of something which by the consensus of Muslims (ijma', def: b7) is part of Islam, when it is well known as such, like the prayer (salat) or even one rak'a from one of the five obligatory prayers, if there is no excuse (def: u2.4); (15) to hold that any of Allah's messengers or prophets are liars, or to deny their being sent;</p>
<p>(n: 'Ala' al-Din 'Abidin adds the following:</p>
<p>(16) to revile the religion of Islam; (17) to believe that things in themselves or by their own nature have any causal influence independent of the will of Allah; (18) to deny the existence of angels or jinn (def: w22), or the heavens; (19) to be sarcastic about any ruling of the Sacred Law; (20) or to deny that Allah intended the Prophet's message (Allah bless him and give him peace) to be the religion followed by the entire world (dis: w4.3-4) (al-Hadiyya al-'Ala'iyya (y4), 423-24).)</p>
<p>There are others, for the subject is nearly limitless. May Allah Most High save us and all Muslims from it.) — <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickbee_e7e6.html" title="User:Nickbee">Nickbee</a> 05:40, 6 August 2005 (UTC)Nickbee</p>

<p>It doesn't make it clear whether apostasy itself is punishable by death in Pakistan or not.

If the law is unclear, or if there is any controversy in Pakistan, then the article should say so.</p>
<p>lets you loose sleep over it.... the laws in pakistan say nothing if some one abandons his faith (by faith i mean islam)... because its felt that such a pathology is extremely improbable.</p>
<p>however, there are those who openly claim to be atheists like dr. pervez hodhbhoy etc. and have an almost quasi-celeberity status... in these however, it is presumed that they never were Muslims at any point in their life.</p>

<p>I'm not sure it's differentiating from the disbelief (kufr as you mention) and apostasy (irtidad)... which are different. Your paragraph didn't make it clear where the Mawdudi quote came from... so it was a little confusing to me. Your quotes for the Afzal ur-Rahman section seem to be hanging... you have to start sentence quotes but don't close them off. If you could clean that up some that'd be good since I don't have the sources. It could probably be made more compact since it does go talking about just plain kafirs often. And, the hanging Qur'an quotes... are they used by the people?</p>
<p>As for "parallels in some other religious systems" -- many traditions have had apostasy laws of some sort. That is the parallel. Rreading <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy.html" title="Apostasy">apostasy</a> will show some of the parallels. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 22:04, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In all the fiqh, apostasy, blasphemy, and heresy are linked under "Kufr". Irtidad is a Hadd offence while the other two are ta'zir offences. Maududi is specifically talking about irtidad in that passage and not disblief. I have tried to clean it up according to your suggestion. Thank you for correcting some of my typos and punctuation. I have to figure out the editing here and writing first in an editor offline first. I will learn as fast as I can. I have to see how to quote the online sources and how to qoute the books. Different pages seem to have slightly different styles. The Maududi quote is from The punishment of the apostate according to Islamic Law by Abul Ala Maududi.

<dd>Simple kufr is not apostasy and that is what I was questioning. What you wrote says, <i>If they wanted to accept Islam, they could accept it and they would be forgiven. If they wanted to leave the country, they could leave</i>, which leads me to believe they weren't Muslim in the first place which just makes the unbelievers and not apostates. At the end it talks about apostasy but, it states <i>[h]ere "covenant breaking" in no way can be construed to mean "breaking of political covenants"</i> which through me off a little... is that what the book says? Only half of it is a quote. Hmm, were you "209.76.108.207" -- someone reverted that as vandalism... and, it surely wasn't vandalism. In any case, I recommend reading <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite_sources</a> which, I really need to read too... it will make any citations you do go more smoothly (and with footnotes too).

<p>Yes, I tried inserting the URL link to the copy of the translation that I found on line. The whole point of the entire quote is to show that the "convenent breaking" according to Maududi can only mean apostates.

<p>Consistency in spelling could be helpful. Mawdudi, Maudoodi and Maududi can be found on the net, and none is obviously wrong. If Google hits were a criterion, Maududi wins. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 05:17:05, 2005-08-06 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I tried making the introduction more direct and took out the verses of the Quran (although their references are still there) because 1) they are redily available and 2)they were not complete verses from recognized translations. I do have a question about the remark in the paranthesis about "whom God loves" and who love God fighting to protect their beliefs and hence punishing apostates: If this is from the Quran, then a reference would be nice. If it is not from the Quran, then it should not be given as it is and should be changed.</dd>

<p>Below is my attempt at starting the section on the Penalty for Apostasy in Islam. I would like any suggestions and ideas. This section is difficult and will need work. After this section I think another section of example of recent apostates around the world and status of different countries should do for the page. Input?</p>
<p>Penalty for Apostasy in Islam.</p>
<p>There are many scholars who have unequivocally stated that the penalty of Apostasy in Islam is death. Dr. A. Rahman I. Doi in Shariah: The Islamic Law (A.S. Noordeen, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 1998, p. 265-267) states, "The punishment by death in the case of apostasy has been unanimously agreed upon by all the four schools of Islamic jurisproudence". Alhaji Ajijola in Introduction to Islamic law ( International Islamic Publishers, New Delhi, India, 1989 p.128) states that Apostasy is a Hadd sentence and the penelty prescribed is death. Adbul Qadir Oudah, a prolific Egyptian Shari'a scholar in Criminal Law of Islam (Translated by S. Zakir Aijaz, Kitab Bhavan,New Delhi, India, 1999 (Improved edition), Volume II. p. 258-262; Volume IV. p. 19-21, ISBN: 81-7151-273-9 ) states that the view advocated by the jurists belonging to all the four madhabs of Islam is <i>"According to the Shariah taking 'murtad's' life is an impunitive act or one exempt from punishment. Hence if some one kills him, he will not be deemed as wilfully guilty."</i> The legal issue between the different schools being when a muslim can act against an apostate without the sanction of the organised state. In 'Abdurrahmani'l-Djaziri's Kitabul'l-fiqh 'ala'l-madhahibi'l-'arba'a (Vol. 5, pp.422-440) (Translated from the Arabic)First English Edition (Villach): 1997: the claim is <i>"All four imams (the founders of the four schools of Islamic law) -- may Allah have mercy upon them -- agree that the apostate whose fall from Islam is beyond doubt -- may Allah forbid it -- must be killed, and his blood must be spilled without reservation. The hypocrite and heretic (zindiq) who poses as a Muslim but has secretly remained an unbeliever must also be killed.</i></p>
<p><br />
There are liberal scholars as well who have argued that Apostasy carries no earthly punishment and that the Quran only warns the apostates of punishments in the hereafter. S.A.Rahman,a former Cheif justice of Pakistan (Punishment of apostasy in Islam," Kazi Publ., (1986) ISBN:068618551X) examined and concluded that there was no death penalty in any of the 20 instances of apostasy mentioned in the Quran. Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed (Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam,Ashgate Publishing, (March 30, 2004),ISBN: 0754630838) argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam and with the modern concept of the freedom to choose one's religion. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment. Mirza Tahir Ahmed (Murder in the name of Allah, Lutterworth Press 1989, ISBN:0718828054), the spiritual leader of the Ahamdis, a self proclaimed muslim sect, but enforced into apostasy by being declared non-muslims in many muslim countries, concludes his book by "Apostasy which is not aggravated by some other crime is not punishable in this world. This is the teaching of God. This was the teaching of the Holy Prophet. This is the view confirmed by Hanafi jurists,26 Fateh al-Kadeer27 Chalpi,28 Hafiz ibn Qayyim, Ibrahim Nakhai, Sufyan Thauri and many others. The Maududian claim of consensus, concerning the tradition they hold to be true, is a mere fiction."</p>
<p>With the exception of a few muslim countries, notably Iran and Saudi Arabia, the modern muslim states are not founded on Islamic law. They owe their existence to a combination of European colonial policies and secular nationalist ideology. The majority have a written constitution and the laws it spells out are considered to be primary and to take precedence over all other laws including Sharia, Which means, in practice, that muslim countries aim to harmonize the laws of the modern constitutions and those bequeathed by the Islamic Sharia, by no means an easy task. A consequence of this is that the death penalty is rarely carried out today in most muslim countries, but there remains an overwhelming sense of outrage among many Muslims when another leaves Islam. An example of the need to reconcile the constitutional penal code with the Islamic Sharia is the infamous blasphemy laws of Pakistan. In 1980, under President Zia-ul-Haq’s leadership, the Federal Shariat Court was created and given jurisdiction to examine any existing law to ensure it was not repugnant to Islam <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss16/khan.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss16/khan.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and in its early acts it passed ordinances included five that explicitly targeted religious minorities: a law against blasphemy; a law punishing the defiling of the Qur’an; a prohibition against insulting the wives, family, or companions of the Prophet of Islam; and two laws specifi-cally restricting the activities of Ahmadis, who were declared non-muslims.</p>
<p>Under traditional Islamic law (according to Abdurrahmani'l-Djaziri's Kitabul'l-fiqh 'ala'l-madhahibi'l-'arba'a i.e Apostasy in Islam according to the Four Schools of Islamic Law (Vol. 5, pp. 422-440) First English Edition (Villach): 1997) an apostate may be given upto three days while in incarceration to repent and accept Islam again and if not the apostate is to be killed without any reservations. There are difference between the four schools in the various details on how to deal with the various aspects of imposing the penalties with respect to the material property and holdings of the apostate and in the status and rights of the family of the apostate. A distinction is also made between "Murtad Fitri", an apostate who was born of muslim parents, and "Murtad Milli", an apostate who had converted into islam initially. Some additional penalties and considerations that are mentioned are that a divorce is automatic if either spouse apostatize, an under age apostate is imprisoned till he reaches maturity and then he is killed, and the recommended execution is beheading with a sword. As mentioned earlier that these are rarely ever carried out in toto at present as examples of Apostasy give below show and also underline the problem in harmonizing the constitutional law and Islamic law in the various countries.</p>
<p>Examples of Apostasy in the recent past</p>
<p>To be continued.....</p>
<p>Continuation: Apostasy in the recent past</p>
<p>An accurate number of muslims rejecting Islam is currently impossible to obtain because the ex-muslims are very loath to reveal their apostasy even to friends and families because of fear of retribution and retaliation even when they are living in the west. The greatest threat to apostates in the Muslim world derives from private individuals who take punishment into their own hands, and states which are complict by their silence towards these individual crimes. An example among many is the case of a Bangladeshi Murtad Fitri Christian evangelist who was stabbed while returning home from a film version of the Gospel of Luke (When Muslims Convert by Daveed Gartenstein-Ross,Friday, March 04, 2005, Commentary Magazine 2005). Bangladesh does not have a law against apostasy, but apparently some muslims felt outraged enough to kill. There are reports of 200,000 muslims who have turned away from Islam in Britan alone, ( <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1470584,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1470584,00.html" rel="nofollow">Muslim apostates cast out and at risk from faith and family by Anthony Browne</a>), and facing abuse, violence, and even murder at the hands of their previous co-religionists. There are similar reports of violent intimidation of those electing to reject Islam in other western countries <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=5031" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=5031" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Apostasy is punishable by death in the countries of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Yemen, Iran, Sudan and Mauritania at present, In 1980 Pakistan incorporated into the penal code making any disparaging remark against any personality revered in Islam as an offence. In 1986 the law was extended to specifically include “Penal Code 295-C: Use of derogatory remarks, etc., in respect of the Holy Prophet: whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representations, or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine. In October 1990, the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) ruled that “the penalty for contempt of the Holy Prophet … is death and nothing else”. In their 1996 report on Pakistan Amenesty International stated that these laws have been extensively abused to harass members of the religious minorities such as Christians and Ahmadis and that "In all the cases known to Amnesty International, these charges have been arbitrarily brought, founded solely on the individual's minority religious beliefs or on malicious accusations against individuals of the Muslim majority who advocate novel ideas. The available evidence indicates that charges were brought as a measure to intimidate and punish members of minority religious communities or non-conforming members of the majority community and that the hostility towards minority groups appeared in many cases compounded by personal enmity, professional envy or economic rivalry or a desire to gain political advantage" <a href="http://www.thepersecution.org/ai/amnst196.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thepersecution.org/ai/amnst196.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> An example of the passions and the feelings of extreme outrage that are evoked within the muslim community is provided by Amenesty international's 2005 Report on Pakistan: <i>Samuel Masih, a 27-year-old Christian, was arrested in August 2003 and charged with having thrown litter on the ground near a mosque in Lahore. This was deemed an offence under section 295 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which provides up to two years’ imprisonment for defiling a place of worship. Samuel Masih was held in a Lahore prison but transferred to hospital in May, suffering from tuberculosis. He died after his police guard attacked him in the hospital. The police officer stated that he had done his “religious duty”</i> <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/pak-summary-eng" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/pak-summary-eng" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Other examples of persecution of apostates converting to Christianity have been given by the Barnabas Fund ( <a href="http://www.barnabasfund.org/Apostasy/application.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.barnabasfund.org/Apostasy/application.htm" rel="nofollow">Barnabas Fund: The Application of the Apostasy Law in the world today</a> ) from Kuwait, Sudan, Iran, Yemen, Pakistan, Egypt, and Bangladesh. Barnabas Fund report concludes: <i>"The field of apostasy and blasphemy and related “crimes” is thus obviously a complex syndrome within all Muslim societies which touches a raw nerve and always arouses great emotional outbursts against the perceived acts of treason, betrayal and attacks on Islam and its honour. While there are a few brave dissenting voices within Muslim societies, the threat of the application of the apostasy and blasphemy laws against any who criticize its application is an efficient weapon used to intimidate opponents, silence criticism, punish rivals, reject innovations and reform, and keep non-Muslim communities in their place."</i> Similar views are expressed by the 'non-religious' International Humanist and Ethical Union (See: <a href="http://www.iheu.org/node/1540" class="external text" title="http://www.iheu.org/node/1540" rel="nofollow">The fate of Infidels and Apostates under Islam</a>).</p>

<p>Explanations for the death penalty.</p>
<p>Many of the reasons for the death penalty for apostates given by Islamic scholars are examined by Abu Ala Maududi <a href="http://answering-islam.org.uk/Hahn/Mawdudi/" class="external text" title="http://answering-islam.org.uk/Hahn/Mawdudi/" rel="nofollow">The punishment of the apostate according to Islamic law</a> and he summarises the most likely objections against the executions of the apostates as:</p>
<ul>
<li>This idea is against the freedom of conscience. How can it be right to offer an apostate the gallows when he has decided to leave Islam?</li>
<li>A faith which people maintain because of the fear of death cannot be genuine faith. This faith will be manifestly hypocritical chosen to deceive in order to save one's life.</li>
<li>If all religions approve of execution for apostasy, it will be difficult not only for Muslims to embrace another religion but also for non-muslims to embrace Islam.</li>
<li>It is contradictory to say on one hand "There is no compulsion in religion (Quran 2:256)" and "Whosoever will, let him believe and whosoever will, let him disbelieve (Quran 18:30)", and on the other to threaten to punish by death who renounces Islam and moves to reject Islam.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maududi claims that the misunderstaning and criticism arises because of a "fundamental misconception" about Islam. He states, <i>"If Islam is truly a "religion" in the sense that religion is understood at present, surely it would be absurd to prescribe the penalty of execution for those people who wish to leave it because of their dissatisfaction with its principles."</i> and <i>"It is not only a "religion" in the modern technical sense of that term but a complete order of life. It relates not only to the metaphysical but also to nature and everything in nature. It discourses not only on the salvation of life after death but also on the questions of prosperity, improvement and the true ordering of life before death."</i> Maududi is reiterating the claim of "Deen" in that Islam is a complete way of life which includes all matters relating to the functioning of a State as well as matters relating to individual conscience. It is because Islam incorporates within its realm the responsibilites of an organsied state that it treats muslims as members of an organsied state and apostates as traitors. Maududi considers the threat of execution as not forcing someone to stay within the fold of Islam but as a way of keeping those who are not truly committed, out of the community of Islam. Maududi rejects the third criticism because unlike other religions which are free to exchange beleivers, Islam is "on whose ideas and actions society and state are constructed" cannot allow "to keep open its door that would spell its own ruin, the scattering of its own structure's parts, the stripping away of the bonds of its own existence". Maududi also rejects the charge of contradiction. In his words: <i>"There is no compulsion in religion" (la ikraha fi'd din: Qur'an 2:256) means that we do not compel anyone to come into our religion.[2] And this is truly our practice. But we initially warn whoever would come and go back that this door is not open to come and go. Therefore anyone who comes should decide before coming that there is no going back.</i></p>
<p>Essentially the same arguments are skected by the Shi'i Islamic author Sayyid Muhammad Rizvi in the brief article <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/short/apostacy.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.al-islam.org/short/apostacy.htm" rel="nofollow">Apostacy (Irtidad) in Islam</a>, relying upon the opinions of some of the earlier scholars of Islam. Since the Muslims ascribing to the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_movements_within_Islam_48bd.html" title="Liberal movements within Islam">liberal movements within Islam</a> disagree that death penalty is an appropriate punishment for Apostasy, it makes little sense for them to offer reasons justifying the death penalty. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickbee_e7e6.html" title="User:Nickbee">Nickbee</a> 18:33, 11 August 2005 (UTC)Nickbee</p>

<p>Heraclius, your revision of 4:01, 16 August 2005. My statement is backed by the scholars I had quoted who said that the four fiqh agreed about the death penalty. I have cited them making that statement. What is your source for making the claim whether the different fiqh had disagreement about it. The only disagreement has been whether women apostates need be killed or imprisoned for life or till they recanted. So please provide a source that supports your claim. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickbee_e7e6.html" title="User:Nickbee">Nickbee</a> 20:11, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A better wording seems to be that there is no consensus on the issue, but the death penalty for apostacy is a majority position in all fiqh - ie, being pro/contra death penalty doesn't depend on which school a scholar belongs to. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.58.2.58 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.58.2.58_d0b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.58.2.58">contribs</a>) .</small> (October 2, 2006)</dd>

<p>Let's start with the first paragraph. Can you start by sourcing it? There needs to be a source that unambiguously states "all four fiqh agree about the death penalty punishment".<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeraclius_a3ac.html" title="User:Heraclius">Heraclius</a> 01:22, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dr. A. Rahman I. Doi in Shariah: The Islamic Law (A.S. Noordeen, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 1998, p. 265-267) states, <b>"The punishment by death in the case of apostasy has been unanimously agreed upon by all the four schools of Islamic jurisproudence".</b> Alhaji Ajijola in Introduction to Islamic law ( International Islamic Publishers, New Delhi, India, 1989 p.128) <b>states that Apostasy is a Hadd sentence and the penelty prescribed is death.</b> Adbul Qadir Oudah, a prolific Egyptian Shari'a scholar in Criminal Law of Islam (Translated by S. Zakir Aijaz, Kitab Bhavan,New Delhi, India, 1999 (Improved edition), Volume II. p. 258-262; Volume IV. p. 19-21, ISBN: 81-7151-273-9 ) <b>states that the view advocated by the jurists belonging to all the four madhabs of Islam is "According to the Shariah taking 'murtad's' life is an impunitive act or one exempt from punishment. Hence if some one kills him, he will not be deemed as wilfully guilty."</b> The legal issue between the different schools being when a muslim can act against an apostate without the sanction of the organised state. In 'Abdurrahmani'l-Djaziri's Kitabul'l-fiqh 'ala'l-madhahibi'l-'arba'a (Vol. 5, pp.422-440) (Translated from the Arabic)First English Edition (Villach): 1997: the claim is <b>"All four imams (the founders of the four schools of Islamic law) -- may Allah have mercy upon them -- agree that the apostate whose fall from Islam is beyond doubt -- may Allah forbid it -- must be killed, and his blood must be spilled without reservation. The hypocrite and heretic (zindiq) who poses as a Muslim but has secretly remained an unbeliever must also be killed.</b> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickbee_e7e6.html" title="User:Nickbee">Nickbee</a> 02:16, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, so attribute the claim to that one author. Don't just state it with no source.02:29, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Heraclius, I thought that was the summary section. It summarises what is in the page. The four references are in the page. It is the first paragraph of the penalty section. I think the references should go at the end of the page, then the reference in the summary can go in as in a footnote style, and do not have to be repeated again and again. I will work on that. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickbee_e7e6.html" title="User:Nickbee">Nickbee</a> 02:34, 17 August 2005 (UTC)Nickbee</p>

<p>Heraclius, you have commented out the following: "There is no definition and consequent punishment that span all Islamic views but the concept of how to deal with apostasy is traditionally a matter of hudd under <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">sharia</a> law and varies over the different schools of thought throughout the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Islam_572a.html" title="History of Islam">history of Islam</a>. Although there is a consensus in the four Fiqah (Schools of Jurisprudence) that an apostate should be killed, most muslim countries rarely carry out the death penalty at present. please source this"</p>
<p>Because it is not a random and large change, I am not reverting it in good faith so we can begin a conversation. This was there before I expanded and cleaned the page up. This is a summary section and hence the information should be in the rest of the page. The definition issue is dealt by showing the list of what qualified for the Shafi fiqh. These lists have changed over the years. There are different lists. At present Iran considers insult to Khomeni as blasphemy while Saudi law does not say anything about that. The jurists that I have mentioned have all said that apostasy is a matter hudd. That is how the Pakistani and Saudi Shariat Courts have defined it as well. The law books that I have quoted from Islamic jurists all state that the four Imam's agree that there should be death penalty. The rarity of the death penalty is stated by Amnesty international. So what exactly do you want sourced? <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickbee_e7e6.html" title="User:Nickbee">Nickbee</a> 01:40, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reverted Heracilius most recent changes to the "According to Quran" section, because they deleted some information that I think is important and interesting for the readers of this article. We should in my opinion not just mention the specific PoVs that important scholars have, but also why they hold these PoVs regarding this subject. To use their own words, where they explain why they hold these views, is in my opinion a excellent way to do that. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 12:11, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We are here to write an encyclopedia. That means writing in a concise, pithy way that gets to the point. I didn't delete any PoV's, I merely made them more concise and easy to understand/read.

<p>Yes, we are here to write an encyclopedia, and inform the readers about the different important PoVs that exist. But it is also equally important to make our readers understand <b>why</b> these PoVs exist and what arguments they are based on. In your version we don't get any explanation of why Mr. Maududi "argued that Sura 9 verses 11 and 12 of the Quran sanction death for apostasy." and we don't get to know why Mr. Rahman concluded "that not only is there no punishment for apostasy provided in the Book but that the Word of God clearly envisages the natural death of the apostate. He will be punished only in the Hereafter....". I really think the readers would appriciate some background information on these views. Such important information should in my opinion not be excluded just to make the article shorter. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 16:03, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>He memorized the Qur.aan in his early age and then he acquired knowledge from many of the great scholars of the Kingdom. Some of his teachers were Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abdul-Lateef Aal-Shaykh, Shaykh Saalih ibn 'Abdul-'Azeez Aal-Shaykh and the eminent Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem Aal-Shaykh who, in his time, was the Muftee of Saudi Arabia. Shaykh Ibn Baaz accompanied the eminent Shaykh and learned from him for about ten years. Thus he gained his religious education from the family of Imaam Muhammad ibn 'Abdul-Wahhaab.</p>
<p>Afterwards Shaykh Ibn Baaz was appointed as a Justice and he worked for fourteen years in the judiciary until he was deputed to the education faculty. He remained engaged in teaching for nine years at Riyadh Islaamic Law College, Riyadh Religious Institute. Then he was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the Islaamic University, al-Madeenah; but shortly afterwards, he was made the Chancellor with all the administrative powers. Later he was appointed President of the General Presidency of Islaamic Research, Ifta, Call and Propagation, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>He held the position of Grand Muftee of Saudi Arabia, the Presidency of many Islaamic Committees and Councils, the prominent among these being: Senior Scholars Committee of the Kingdom, Permanent Committee for Islaamic Research and Fataawa, the Founding Committee of Muslim World League, World Supreme Council for Mosques, Islaamic Jurisprudence Assembly Makkah; and the member of the Supreme Council of the Islaamic University at al-Madeenah, and the Supreme Committee for Islaamic Propagation, until he passed away on Thursday 27 Muharram 1420 A.H./May 13 1999 C.E.

<p>Heraclius you added: Spoken or written renunciation of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> is apostasy, however, displayed disloyalty or blasphemous acts can also be deemed apostasy. The concept has parallels in some other religious systems, particularly monotheistic ones <b>such as <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excommunication.html" title="Excommunication">Excommunication</a> in Christianity and the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">Inquisition</a></b> . What does excommunication and Inquistion have to do with Apostasy and then Apostasy in Islam? And how can they be examples of montheistic ones?

<dd>Excommunication is basically declaring someone an apostate etc. Anyways, I have added a POV tag to this page, as it quotes too much from Islamist writers and the death penalty and other sections don't give too much of the opposing view.

<dd>Heraclius, I will not remove your tag. Please look up the definition of Excommunication. How I am citing from Islamist only. I have cited S. A. Rahman, The book by the Saeed's, and I have even cited the Tahir Mirza who is considered a non-muslim by most muslims because he is an Ahamdiyya, but I have quoted him and his book? Why don't you tell me the secondary sources that have been left out? I really will appreciate that.

<p>I have no problem with that as long as it is relevant information, Heraclius. The idea is not to push a particular POV but to give accurately all the views on the subject. Which view has been left out? Why don't you find additional sources? I have read Rahman's book, and he will go into discussion of each verse. Look I did not make all those Sheiks for the last 1000 years or so say all those things.

<dd>I find Heraclius' performance over the past few days quite transparently aimed at pushing an apologist POV. His very first edit, changing "consensus" to "varies widely" with respect to the views of the major maddhabs on punishment, made the rest of his activities quite easy to understand. He will not accept quotes because they are "rambling", he will not accept summaries because they are not "sourced", he will only claim "concision" when substituting his favored misrepresentation of the facts. If S.A Rahman is the best he can do when it comes to backing up his own editorial legerdemain, as opposed to the many sources cited by Nickbee one wonders whether he has any grasp of the subject at all. Who is he to be getting involved in a subject he cannot even discuss? 70.107.107.210 02:08, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I am not personalising this at all Heraclius. I do not mind. I just wish you would discuss before you proceed to make changes. You are correct that the changes you made last time were far fewer than what they looked. Being new at editing with Wiki editor, and all that red on both sides with the right column empty, it looked an awful lot of changes. Your critique is helpful, although a bit nagging at times. It will only make the page more robust. But I do have a suggestion that we talk first about the change you want. And I promise you that I will entertain your suggestions with an open mind. But you have to first define the difference between "orignal" research and "summarising" someone else's work. You do not like any summary but you donot like quotes either. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickbee_e7e6.html" title="User:Nickbee">Nickbee</a> 04:58, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All right, so you are saying that you agree with my clean up edit? I will be making the same edit later on tomorrow, just to give you a heads up. The reason I commented out your original research was because there was no source. It's not that I don't like one or the other. Anyways, just please in the future look at my edits before reverting.

<p>Heraclius, you said "many" liberal scholars opposed the death penalty. That is not true. I have not been able to find many. S.A. Rahman, and Tahir Mirza are the exception. I have traced Mirza claim on couple of the old scholars he mentioned and they are for death penalty, but only quibble about the circumstances when it should be applied. So if you want the "many" please make a list of atleast 10 names. The names of scholars who support the death penalty is literally in the hundreds, starting with the founders of the four fiqh and the Shi'i as well. You wrote: "The views about the penalties for apostasy vary from Muslim to Muslim. There are many scholars who have unequivocally stated that the penalty of Apostasy in Islam is death, and there are many liberal scholars who have argued that apostasy carries no earthly punishment." What is accurate is "The views about the penalties for apostasy vary from Muslim to Muslim. There are many scholars who have unequivocally stated that the penalty of Apostasy in Islam is death, and there are a few liberal scholars who have argued that apostasy carries no earthly punishment."</p>
<p>If you can find more scholars who opposed the death penalty then we should definately include them and their statements. I searched hard, and have even asked many liberal muslim journalists and could not come up with any. Even S. A. Rahman does not cite any in his book! <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickbee_e7e6.html" title="User:Nickbee">Nickbee</a> 16:30, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Heraclius, you are attempting to creat a symmetry between those who state the position of the Sharia as decided by the Imams of the four fiqh and those who are arguing against the generally accepted position of the death penalty. It is not weasling with words as "few". There literally are only a few, unfortunately a very few, who have argued against the death penalty for the apostates under Islamic law. Please give me a list of more than 5 or 6 and we will not talk about a few. But any book on Islamic Law or Sharia will contain the statement of the death penalty without any supporting arguments. Rahman's book is an argument against the death penalty. So is the newer book by the two Saeeds. Do you understand the difference between "state" and "argue"? I have not reverted your changes but I urge you that try to see the difference and please revert the change on your own. As it stands, it is misleading and akin to lying. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickbee_e7e6.html" title="User:Nickbee">Nickbee</a> 18:38, 22 August 2005 (UTC)Nickbee</p>

<dd>The best way is to mention both opinions in the first sentence without any weasel words or qualifiers.

<dd>I made another change to the Qur'an section. It shouldn't be "Most Muslims believe", but instead "There are no verses that unequivocally state there is a punishment." This is the truth since there aren't any verses that say "kill an apostate". Now, there might be verses that can be interpreted that way, but the statement still stands as factual and neutral.<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeraclius_a3ac.html" title="User:Heraclius">Heraclius</a> 02:26, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How do you know there are no verses that unequivocally state anything? That by definition is original research. Where is your source for this statement? I do not want to argue whether a verse is unequivocal or not. Many Jamiat Islami memebers conside 9:11,12 to be very very unequivocal. So I think Most muslims is accurate and your introduction is biased and interpreting original sources. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickbee_e7e6.html" title="User:Nickbee">Nickbee</a> 04:39, 23 August 2005 (UTC)Nickbee</p>

<p>I find the section headings on this page unclear. It almost seems like they were vandalized so I assume there was a big rewrite that neglected to update the headings appropriately. "According to critics" doesn't indicate whether these "critics" are critical of apostasy, the death penalty for apostasy, Islam, or what. It only discusses the work of one person (Ibn Warraq) and doesn't seem critical. "Death penalty for apostasy" comes after three sections discussing the death penalty for apostasy ("According to Hadith", "According to Tafsir", and "According to critics"). "Reasons for the death penalty" also comes after these three sections which also gives reasons. <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 18:38, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This does not justify removing the Qur'anic verses, most of them have a clear meaning unless they are picked out the context. You can always add the neighbor verses, or explain their context; but one should not remove them. I am sure it is interesting for many to see the relevant qur'anic verses. Finally, if we don't want to quote any qur'anic verses, we should not also quote any biblical verses and so on. Why don't you then clear up other articles first?

<p>What's going on here? I'm new to this page. Help me understand what this dispute is about.Timothy Usher 10:49, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A brief review suggests that Aminz added some material in the wrong place, the introduction, Pecher reverted on the ground of original research, then Aminz did likewise to unrelated pages. The solution was and is to talk things over on this page. Aminz' material is not without value, nor does it clearly constitute original research, but it doesn't belong in the introduction. Feedback?Timothy Usher 11:53, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>An anonymous editor made this change: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostasy_in_Islam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=47929712" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostasy_in_Islam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=47929712" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. I checked and found it was not supported by the citation, and changed it back, keeping the citation partly to try out the template I had been working on. "No verse in the Qur'an explicitly prescribes an earthly penalty for apostasy" might be seen as original research, but I think it is narrow enough that it is not. Something like Pecher's later formulation is clearly not original research: "Most Islamic scholars, with the exception of those from the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shafi%27i.html" title="Shafi'i">Shafi'i</a> school, believe that Qur'anic verses that deal with apostasy directly do not prescribe any earthly punishment for it." The quotes that I retained and templated should go under <i>Qur'anic reference</i> rather than in the introduction.</p>
<p>Then Aminz added some good material with citations (that I haven't yet had time to look at). Pecher, maybe recognizing that the intro had got too long, set out to reorganize some things. Aminz objected to some of the changes, and because we're all on a hair trigger this month, an edit war here was only narrowly avoided when Aminz' and Pecher's good sense prevailed. Unfortunately there was some spill-over onto another page, which we should really try to not let happen. The pages are edited individually by different groups of editors.

Especially notice the image which is moved to the top and some sections removed ... For the sake of God, please let me know what was wrong with my reason for reverting his edits&#160;:"please discuss changes one by one on the talk page before making significant changes to the article". I didn't expect this to be the beginning of a revert war. But anyway, my 3RR limit was exhausted and Pecher lastly added the "original research" tag to the article even without discussing why the tag should be there. I couldn't revert it back, so I thought a little bit aiming to understand the logic behind this addition and I ended up with the following theorem:
<ul>
<li>Anyone can add tags to the articles before discussing it on the talk page.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Good!</dd>
<dd>Now, I wanted to test my theorem and get Pecher's feedback. So, I picked the "passover" article and added some tags to it. Surprisingly, I saw that Pecher reverted it back!!!! This seemed to me as a sign of dishonesty! I was even sadder when I saw Timothy's discrimination in removing the tag from one article but leaving it alone on the other one (See <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethic_of_reciprocity.html" title="Ethic of reciprocity">Golden rule</a> for further information).</dd>

<p>Aminz's additions to intro were not only misplaced, as Timothy Usher has pointed above; I don't understand this rush to stuff the intro with lots of "good news" that Islamic law does not demand death penalty for apostasy despite all the evidence to the contrary. These additions are essentially original research because even those claims that were referenced were actually sourced to extremely poor unacademic sources on the subject where lots of reliable, academic sources are available. Instead of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, we have answering-christianity.com, islamicperspectives.com, and Persian BBC with an article in Farsi (!). Sorry, Wikipedia will be an object of universal ridicule if we stuff the intro of the article with gossips scooped from random websites only to convince the reader that death penalty for apostates is not mandatory in Islam, just weeks after the whole world witnessed the <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Rahman_%28convert%29_5845.html" title="Abdul Rahman (convert)">case</a> saying quite the reverse.

<dd>I don't agree with Pecher's reading of the intro. The intro said: 1. <b>All five schools of Islamic jurisprudence</b> prescribe it. 2. The penalties imposed in Islam for apostasy is a controversial topic debated by scholars. 3. <b>A few</b> Shia jurists such ... and 4. This view is shared by <b>a few Sunni scholars</b> as well 5. No verse in the Qur'an explicitly prescribes an earthly penalty for apostasy. 6. Islamic scholars such as Dr. Ahmad Shafaat believe that ...</dd>
<dd>My understanding of the intro is that the majority of scholars believe in something but it is controversial and debated among Muslims. THIS IS THE TRUTH; not that all Muslims think apostates should be killed.</dd>
<dd>Now, regarding your second point: My references were reliable enough, to my mind. 1. BBC Persian is fine and I don't believe I need to find an English reference. 2.

<dd>Tom, I remember I saw a website that was referencing to the BBC interview with Montazari. But we will still have the same problem since one may argue that that website is not reliable either. I should say that Montazari (and his students I guess) are famous for issuing un-common <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatwa.html" title="Fatwa">fatwas</a>. I was not surprised to see that fatwa. It is a fact that all five schools of Shariah believe that apostate should be killed. But it is another fact that the issue is controversial (debated more recently). I believe that as time progresses more and more scholars will believe that the apostate should not be killed. Montazari in that interview restates the Quran only Muslims argument and adds that it is not improbable that the punishment was prescribed by Muhammad when Islam was still partial, and some Jews and Christians purposely entered Islam and deserted it later to create confusion among the Muslims as shown in the following Quranic verse "A section of the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) say: Believe in the morning what is revealed to the believers (Muslims), but reject it at the end of the day; perchance they may (themselves) turn back (from Islam).” (Quran 3:72)" Something you can also find in the answering christianity website.--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 02:21, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I had removed the statement in the intro because of use of weasel words in it. The statement is:<br />
"Although '<b>some writers'</b> have recently tried to prove that apostasy should not be punished by death in Islam, such views did not receive acceptance from '<b>mainstream Muslim scholars'</b>".<br />
According to <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words</a>:<br />
"Here are some weasel words that are often found in Wikipedia articles (but shouldn't be):</p>

<li>"'<b>Mainstream scholars'</b>/scientists/researchers..."</li>
<li>"Some feel that..."</li>
<li>"Critics/experts say that..." "</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the article on Wikipedia's policy on "weasel words" says that the following questions should be answered: "Who says that? You? Me? When did they say it? How many people think that? What kind of people think that? Where are they? What kind of bias do they have?

<dd>Yes, ideally we should avoid such words, but it's not so easy to get rid of them when you cannot easily identify those "some" or "many" as a group.

<p>Timothy, you removed the word "out of enemity" from Montazari's quote. But in his interview he emphasizes on this. As Montazari puts it, the apostates are DEFINED as those who change their religion out of hostility towards Islam, with the motivation to attack Islam. I wish the article was available in English. The title of the interview is:"Ayatollah Montazari: Every change of religion is not apostasy". As I can understand the article, it says that Montazari does believe that the apostates must be killed but does not agree with the commonly-understood definition of apostate. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 06:58, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd thought "who desert Islam out of enemity, in order to attack Islam." somewhat redundant. To say they're leaving in order to attack Islam suggests enmity, in my reading. Is there a third category of those who leave in order to attack it, but for some reason other than enmity, to whom another rule applies?</dd>

<p>It says: "A while back when the apostasy case first surfaced I did a search about apostasy and came across the Iranian cleric who is out of favor with the regime, Ayatollah Montazeri's opinions on this subject. According to him (a significant Shi'a religious authority), a simple reversion of belief when grounded in an informed and educated decision to leave Islam (and when not undertaken out of malice and enmity towards the Muslim community- essentially similar to sedition and treason) is not apostasy at all. (See "Ayatollah Montazeri: Not Every Conversion is Apostasy".) I found Chaplain Yee's comments mirroring the position taken by Ayatollah Montazeri, and I found both somewhat reassuring. Yet the case in Afghanistan has demonstrated that when conservative temperaments flare and blood needs to be spilt, there are always ways to bend the rules..."</p>

<p>Salman Rushdie is listed among notable apostates in this article, but in fact, he is not. The fatwa calling for his death penalty was issued for blasphemy, not apostasy. I have never seen reliable sources calling him an apostate; on the contrary, he considers himself a Muslim (or, at least, he writes so in his articles), although he calls for a major reform in Islam.

<dd>At some level, I agree that Answering-christianity.com is not a reliable source. But I think the reliability should depend on what we expect from the link to tell us. That website repeats the opinion of Montazari and the author is Sunni. In the BBC link provided by Tom, we can see the same reasoning again. I just wanted to add that Montazari's idea is not a pure Shia belief (not something like shia ritual purity) and it also shared by a few Sunni scholars. Finally, if answering christianity is not reliable, answering islam will also be unreliable, Ali Sina's (former Muslim and a critic of Islam) website will also be unreliable... I personally do not like to clean up all quotes from those websites since in many cases, I feel they are telling what is widespread among people and with high probability valid references could be found.</dd>

<dd>An opinion expressed in a BBC interview (even if its text is available in English, which should not be impossible) is not binding upon a scholar or his followers because it's neither a work of sharia literature describing the rules of law (<i>furu</i>), nor a response to a question relating to a specific issue (<i><a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatwa.html" title="Fatwa">fatwa</a></i>).

<dd>I disagree. The opinion (POV) of a Shia jurist reflected in any of his interviews is equivalent to his fatwa. There is one difference between Shia jurists and ordinary scholars: When an ordinary scholar says “it seems to me that this is true”, there is no binding on him to follow his POV, BUT for Shia jurists, exactly the reverse is true. According to Shia-ism, the personal opinion of Shia jurists is exactly their fatwa. Moreover, if one reads that interview in its context, Montazari is restating the Quran only Muslims argument, adding that it is not improbable that the punishment was prescribed by Muhammad when Islam was still partial, and some Jews and Christians purposely entered Islam and deserted it later to create confusion among the Muslims as shown in the following Quranic verse "A section of the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) say: Believe in the morning what is revealed to the believers (Muslims), but reject it at the end of the day; perchance they may (themselves) turn back (from Islam).” (Quran 3:72)</dd>
<dd>The context of the interview is clearly about his fatwa on apostasy. Unfortunately the book of his fatwas is not available online. I see the evidences convincing enough to prove Montazari's view--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 23:22, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What's the source for the statement "<i>The opinion (POV) of a Shia jurist reflected in any of his interviews is equivalent to his fatwa.</i>"? Anyway, we still have the problem that other editors cannot verify what Montazeri says.

<dd>Which part of the sentence? "The opinion (POV) of a Shia is his fatwa" or "his POV's reflected in any of his interviews". In any case, the BBC persian article clearly flatly that this is the fatwa of Montazeri about apostasy. Here is the persian text:"آيت الله منتظری از مراجع شيعه در پاسخ به <b>استفتا</b>يی در باره تغيير مذهب از اسلام به ديگر مذاهب گفته است که حکم ارتداد شامل کسانی که پس از تحقيق تغيير عقيده می دهند نمی شود."</dd>

As to the word humble, I still think that "being in the state of subjection" is a more accurate translation of the word as is clear from the three famous Muslim translation. This has nothing to do with having trust, according to my definition. Now here is why I felt you don't have any trust in what I say: I pointed out to the word "estefta" in the text.

2) We move the Hadith section above the Quran section - yes, I realize Quran is more important in theory, but in jurisprudence, it's often not, and such is the case in this instance. The majority opinion is really about Hadith, so these should be highlighted.</p>

<dd>I believe "I realize Quran is more important in theory, but in jurisprudence, it's often not,"is both true and untrue. I can argue for both sides. Timothy, I can reason for having the Qur'an section first; but I think will eventually lead us nowhere. Timothy, please let me ask you an honest question; my PERSONAL opinion will depend on your answer to this question. Had Qur'an prescribed death punishment for apostasy rather than Hadith, were you still making the above argument and wanted us to have the Hadith section first? If your answer is yes and you were still making the same argument in that situation, I will have no personal objection with this change. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 06:45, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>3) It should be made clear in the introduction that despite wide juridprudential agreement upon this penalty, it is nowadays very rarely undertaken in practice, in large part, perhaps, because most Muslim countries aren't ruled by the judiciary. Pecher's version might be seen as suggesting that if a Muslim living in a Muslim country leaves Islam, he'll most likely be executed, which in the main isn't true - the exclusive focus on jurisprudence makes the situation seem much worse (from a liberal perspective) than it really is - but he'd be right if he said that the solution isn't to create the illusion that there is more jurisprudential disagreement than there really is.</p>

<dd>The intro should state nowadays apostates can be executed in some countries that have implemented sharia or parts of it, like Saudi Arabia, Iran, or Afghanistan. However, regardless of the country, apostates face grave danger from their relatives and neighbors (the article talks about it briefly). In addition, apostates face other persecutions, if not necessarily execution, as the article says in the section "Apostasy in the recent past".

<dd>Guys, I am busy now and can not get into discussion now; but God of justice will judge you soon.(He will also judge me) I compromised a lot on the concern about undue weight and think that the last version of intro didn't have undue weight. But I feel you guys will never be satisfied until transform the article to what you want. You may make me tired and eventually take over the article but God will judge all of us soon. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 22:36, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>From what I can see you've used at least one very dubious source in your insertion in the introduction. More scholarly sources would be helpful for starters. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 00:06, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This was something I commented above about it. "At some level, I agree that Answering-christianity.com is not a reliable source...I just wanted to add that Montazari's idea is not a pure Shia belief (not something like shia ritual purity) and it also shared by a few Sunni scholars...That website repeats the opinion of Montazari and the author is Sunni...In any case, I'll try to find a new reference as soon as I get free from school work. Maybe Tom's BBC reference can help me find the particular sunni scholars who say that." Tom's link contains the view of other sunni scholars.</p>

<p>As it was, Montazari was the only scholar mentioned in the intro, and was given the most space, despite representing the minority opinion. This is unencyclopedic and highly POV, and I've reverted it to the previous text (still probably too long), while keeping the reference to Montazari for those who are interested.Timothy Usher 19:15, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Aminz, I see why you don't like the wording of the dissent clause, but by reverting without dealing with the very valid objections of other editors, you're guaranteeing your text won't stick. Try rewording instead, with the following principles in mind:</p>
<p>1) Don't mention any names - the rest of the intro doesn't have any. If you mention one, it makes it seem like the only one, and then we ask, well, what makes him so uniquely important? While if you mention several, you're compounding the length problem...2) Don't mke this paragraph any longer than it was in the other version - it was already too long.</p>
<p>You can't reasonably expect the introduction to give more space, and hence weight, to the rebuttal than to the mainstream view. There's a whole article in which you can place your text. Here, focus on saying what you want to say briefly.Timothy Usher 00:48, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We should be able to write, "Shafaat says." While he is not an Islamic jurist or a professional Islamic scholar (or whatever the correct term is), he is not just some random guy either. If he is articulating a position others share, it would be reasonable to point the reader there for an accesable summary of that position. On the other hand, if he's saying something that no one else is saying, it probably would not warrant inclusion, but if it did include it we would need to make clear that it is just his opinion. Depending on how heavily we rely on him as a reference, rather than as just a useful external link, we might need to describe his background and qualifications. That's my take; I hope it's helpful. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 13:29, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To tired to fight, however, the overall poor quality of Islam related articles won't improve if standards for references are that low. "<i>he is not just some random guy either</i>": Why not? So far, we know nothing about his background or qualification. "<i>If he is articulating a position others share</i>" ...we might not need him in the first place, as common viewpoints are likely to be articulated by reputable sources elsewhere.

<p>I think this Artical gives a false impression to the religion of Islam, posess a horofied picture that someone who turned away from Islam is punishable by death. This is something which totally against the Basic Principals of Islam what we learn, I think there are some confussion, becasue the openions of some misleaded so called scholars who put there own political and religious point of view in order to get something should not allow to put as a official versoin of a religion, who say for example that killing of a inocent man or women is equal to killing all mankind.

<dd>"Ibn Warraq also quotes commentaries by Baydawi (died c. 1315-1316) on 4:89 as "Whosoever turns back from his belief (irtada), openly or secretly, take him and kill him wheresoever ye find him, like any other infidel". Verse (4:89-90) reads:"</dd>

<p>This is a prime example of a quote taken out of context. Verse 4:88 clearly establishes that the subject is the Hypocrites (not Muslims, but hypocrites) and then verse 89 says that if they openly or secretly reject faith, then kill them out and out. A hypocrite's apostasy during a time of battle (verses 88-90 establish said context) is tantamount to high treason; and death is the obvious and universal treatment in such a situation.</p>

<p><br />
So... it's ok for muslims to threaten other muslims with death if they convert to another religion but these people are saved the death penalty if the people trying to convert the muslim to another religion are threatening the muslim with death.</p>
<p>Are the muslims here trying to say that threatening one with death if they don't convert to another religion is a bad thing? It's standard practice in Islam.</p>
<p>And besides they still think it's ok to threaten someone with death to 'keep them locked into the muslims faith, yet it's not ok for another religion to threaten a muslim with death if he doesn't convert. And they have the nerve to talk about double standards as applied to everything they complain about.</p>

<p>If you are confused welcome to the real world. Muslims ALWAYS use a double standard. Did you see any of them protesting the forced conversion of the 2 Fox reporters? I didn't.

<dd>But the fact is he was never a Muslim, and therefore not an apostate.

<dd>Whether bahais are apostate or muslims or completely a different religion is part of the reason for their persecution (see their article on wikipedia for a more complex answer to that point). The "crime" that they are accused of is saying that mohammed is not the KEY (last) prophet. As he was imprisioned and then killed for being a apostate, that is enough to make him an apostate in my view.<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosadist_6db5.html" title="User:Hypnosadist">Hypnosadist</a> 17:43, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, a scholar is the mantainer of the website, but a lot of the articles are not written by him.
