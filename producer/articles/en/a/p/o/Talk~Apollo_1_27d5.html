<p>Not that I think there is a malicious reason to do so, but for the sake of a grieving nation, and perhaps for the families peace-of-mind, the Board may have elected to say that the men died quickly of relatively painless smoke inhalation, rather than suffering through melting and excruciating agony while burning to death.</p>
<p>It's a kind lie.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. It is likely that the astronauts survived only a few seconds after the start of the fire; this is not long enough to die of smoke inhalation. However, a single breath of superheated gas might do it, but the cause here is massive thermal injury, not the effects of inhaled toxins in the smoke. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreacherdoc_067c.html" title="User:Preacherdoc">Preacherdoc</a> 20:29, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's possible that smoke inhalation could have rendered the men inside the cabin unconscious before they could save themselves, and the autopsy reports indicate that not enough burn damage had been done to any of the astronauts to result in immediate death (though one suffered 50% full thickness skin burns which in the 60s would have almost certainly resulted in death after several days in hospital). I don't have my source handy just now but I would imagine there should be an autopsy report on the NASA site somewhere or at least a summery. If I remember the source correctly one astronaut's suit (Chaffee?) was only 20-30% destroyed and he had very minor burn injuries. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by PhennPhawcks (<a href="../../../p/h/e/User_talk%7EPhennPhawcks_4ce8.html" title="User talk:PhennPhawcks">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PhennPhawcks_4041.html" title="Special:Contributions/PhennPhawcks">contribs</a>) 02:20, 21 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<li><i>The atmosphere would not be pressurized to two lb/inÂ² (14 kPa) above atmospheric pressure</i></li>
</ul>
<p>2 psi over sea level atmospheric pressure (1.14 atm)? Pure oxygen? What's wrong with them? I mean the cabin pressure of a typical commercial airlinear is about 0.75 atm of normal air (20% oxygen; 0.15 atm O<sub>2</sub>; FAA requirement; air pressure at 8,000 ft). Why did they use such ridiculous high pressure of pure oxygen during a simulation?</p>
<p>If they wanted to simulate a 0.14 atm positive pressure in space, they might had pumped 0.94 atm extra nitrogen to the cabin (total pressure: 0.94 atm N<sub>2</sub> + 0.2 atm O<sub>2</sub> = 1.2 atm). It would be breathable and safe. Why couldn't they do that on the ground? I mean since you were not in space, you could afford to attach some additional gas tanks and pumps.</p>
<p>What was the actual cabin pressure when they were in space? It it was 0.14 atm pure oxygen, the pressure would have been too low (only enough oxygen) but the risk of a fire was nearly zero. You could set the pressure a little higher (lowest pressure a man could handle) and still use pure oxygen. The risk of a fire increased with added oxygen pressure. But letting them breath pure oxygen saved some weight. If anything went wrong (such as the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_13.html" title="Apollo 13">Apollo 13</a> oxygen tank explosion), the remaining pure oxygen in cabin could let them survive longer. I guess it was a good choice to use pure oxygen in space. -- <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToytoy_34ee.html" title="User:Toytoy">Toytoy</a> 13:33, Apr 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can anyone confirm the figures above? I can't find good documentation of the internal cabin pressure of the capsule in space. 14kPa above absolute vacuum (0.14 atm) of pure oxygen would provide a perfectly breathable partial pressure of oxygen for the astronauts. Is that, then the actual pressure that should have been in the capsule? And did they pressure test the capsule to 1.14atm?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In space, using pure oxygen at very low pressure seems justifiable. However, I agree that pressure testing the CSM with hyperbaric oxygen was a disaster waiting to happen; like looking for a gas leak with burning matches.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreacherdoc_067c.html" title="User:Preacherdoc">Preacherdoc</a> 20:38, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Back to the original question, it would seem to be a case of NASA cutting corners on saftey in order to save time and money. They had two tests they needed to conduct - a cabin leak check, which required the high pressure, and a practice countdown, which is why the crew was inside, and there was a pure oxygen environment. --<font color="#002222"><b>GW_Simulations</b></font><sub><i><a href="../../../g/w/_/User%7EGW_Simulations_0716.html" title="User:GW Simulations">|User Page</a></i> | <i><a href="../../../g/w/_/User_talk%7EGW_Simulations_2d1d.html" title="User talk:GW Simulations">Talk</a></i> | <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GW_Simulations_8a51.html" title="Special:Contributions/GW Simulations">Contribs</a></i> | <i><a href="../../../g/w/_/User%7EGW_Simulations_Chess_3d65.html" title="User:GW Simulations/Chess">Chess</a></i> | <i><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_GW_Simulations_8882.html" title="Special:Emailuser/GW Simulations">E-mail</a></i></sub> 21:06, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those numbers sound right, based on Collins. The suit pressure was around 3.7psi (less than a modern <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Transportation_System_61e2.html" title="Space Transportation System">STS</a> suit, which is about .3atm {0.338bar)). And it was less cutting corners than a limitation on the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturn_%28rocket_family%29.html" title="Saturn (rocket family)">Saturn</a> booster. The Soviets used a safer NO<sub>2</sub> system because their lifters could throw more. I don't recall the reason for the high pressure in the plugs out test situation, but recall, NASA'd conducted pressure tests at above 1atm in pure O<sub>2</sub> routinely before without any mishaps.

<dd>Nitrogen in the cabin would have reduced the risk of fire, but would not have been risk free. Nitrogen under pressure disolves in human blood, when the pressure is released it comes out of solution and forms bubbles, just like carbon dioxide in fizzy drinks, causing <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_bends.html" title="The bends">the bends</a>. This means the astronauts would have had to undergo a decompression in order to mitigate the risks of the bends before leaving the spacecraft, and if an emergency egress was necessary the crew would be in very real danger of suffering a decompression injury. Additionally as nitrogen and oxygen have different atomic masses, it would be possible for one gas to leak and the other to be contained, thus introducing a possibility of error into leak tests. I don't know for certain if the latter was ever used as justification for pure oxygen but I do know engineers tend to like to make tests as close to the real thing as humanly possible when validating machinery, especially machinery that will be responsible for keeping people alive in a hostile environment.</dd>

<p>Among the astronauts, Grissom was the most critical of the problem-plagued Apollo program, and the main Apollo contractor, North American Aviation. Shortly before his death, Grissom had taken a large lemon and hung it around the space capsule as the press looked on.</p>
<dl>
<dd>FWIW, this is a common mistake made in countless histories -- Grissom hung the lemon on a balky Apollo <i>simulator,</i> not the actual spacecraft. And the press would likely have not been present at the time. StanislavJ 23:52, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>He had suggested publicly that the project could never be accomplished on time. The Grissom family had reason to doubt the official NASA ruling from the beginning. Even before Apollo I, Grissom had received death threats which his family believed emanated from within the space program. The threats were serious enough that he was put under Secret Service protection and had been moved from his home to a secure safe house. According to his wife, Grissom had warned her that "if there is ever a serious accident in the space program, it's likely to be me." Don't put down the facts unless you have solid evidence to back it up - the families want an independent investigation to learn of the true cause of the fire and the deaths of their love ones. What if it was your father or husband? Wouldn't you want to know the truth - I believe you would. I know the Grissom family and they are honest people and would not make anything up just for PR or any other reason. I support the family and believe that there is more to the fire than reported.

The mission would have been called "Apollo 1" if it flew, wouldn't it? I know that after the fire, at first they wanted to just call it 204 (the designation of the capsule), and then they were persuaded to keep calling it "Apollo 1".

<dd>This is true, but we don't know this - it was going to be called Apollo-Saturn 204 (or maybe Saturn-Apollo 204, in some parts of NASA... the booster people had different opinions). It's quite possible it would have ended up being called "Apollo 4", or somesuch - remember that the first Gemini mission was GT-3, Gemini 3. And the limited public attention to early Shuttle missions always used the arcane "STS-41-D" numbering system, rather than simply "STS-10", but that's another story entirely...

<dd>Before the fire, it was called "Apollo 1" in a few NASA documents and NASA approved the name Apollo 1. From the way I understand it, NASA didn't want to call it "Apollo 1" after the fire, they wanted to call it 204, or a version of that. 204 is basically the serial number of the command module. Then "Apollo 1" would either go unused or would be the name of a manned or unmanned flight. When See and Bassett were scheduled for Gemini 9, and they were killed, it was still generally called "Gemini 9", except I think it is listed as 9A in some sources. But this situation was different - they were killed in the spacecraft and the spacecraft was destroyed. NASA wanted to only call it 204, but people wanted to retain the "Apollo 1" name.This is mainly a semantic thing, I think, because the idea of calling it "Apollo 1" came up before the fire, not after (retroactively).

<dd>"Before the fire, it was called "Apollo 1" in a few NASA documents and NASA approved the name Apollo 1". This is the problem - NASA didn't <i>approve</i> the name Apollo 1, as I understand it, they merely tolerated the astronauts calling it that. Then, afterwards, Betty Grissom (and others) campaigned for NASA to change the official name; NASA, always willing to make cosmetic changes for PR, agreed, and it was termed Apollo 1 from then on.</dd>
<dd>By the way, -204 meant mission #04 on a Saturn IB booster, coded as 2 - the Saturn V flights were coded 5, so things like AS-506. It wasn't tied to the capsule, which in this case was CM-012. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 20:23, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I stand corrected on the 204. I thought that I read NASA documents approving "Apollo 1" on the patch. My concern was that "retroactive" sounds like someone thought of that name after the fire, and that wasn't the case. But NASA did officaally name it that afterwards, so I will go along with "retroactive". I probably have nothing more to say on the subject. Thanks for the good discussion.

<dd>Actually the 204 reference should probably be taken out. As Collins points out, the 204 booster was used later. And since the bird didn't fly, strictly speaking, she shouldn't be called "Apollo" anything: it should be the 012 spacecraft fire, or the <s>Pad 39A</s> (oops) Pad 37B fire, or the plugs out test fire. Don't get the idea I don't think they're heroes; if it was up to me, it would be a national holiday. I just don't think a bird that never gets off the ground should be treated like ones that fly. And I think all three of them, test pilots all, would get that. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 14:19, 20 December 2006 &amp; 09:46, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One could take this text as a base for a page "Apollo 1 Investigation" as follows:</p>
<p>First reason for the deads in Apollo 1 was that there had never been done a test of the Apollo 1 capsule without astronauts. The responsibles said there was "no time" for that. A neutral investigation by police or FBI had not been done because <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilruth.html" title="Gilruth">Gilruth</a> blocked all contacts after the accident.</p>
<p>On 12. March 1967 Washington Post reported that before the Apollo 1 fire 20.000 flaws were reported in Apollo 1 project. So the atmosphere for the apollo 1 investigation by the investigation committee was not a "polite" one when the investigation started. A sub committee under the chair of Republican Olin Teague came to Cape Canaveral for hearings. During the hearings representatives of NASA and North American Aviation (NAA) both did not want to be guilty for the fire accident and they argued one against the other. On 21. April 1967 Ex NAA Savety inspector Thomas Ronald Baron presented his 500 page report against NAA to chairman Teague and gave testimony against NAA. As a whole in all hearings about 50% of the flaws reported by Baron were confirmed.</p>
<p>One week after his hearing Baron was deadly hit. Officially it was a railway accident when a train smashed his car. Also his wife and stepdaughter - officially - died "in this railway accident" in the car. The bodies were buried immediately without autopsy, against any Florida law. The short Baron report (57 pages) about the flaws of NAA survived, the big report of 500 pages did not. If Baron and his family died by a murder of CIA or any other or if it really was a railway accident can be speculated. An exhumation and investigation of the bones of Baron and his family could be useful to find the truth but has not been done until now. THis is NOT a conspiracy theory but these are facts and missing facts until now.</p>
<p>Scott Grissom, son of Virgil Grissom, added another aspect. He meant after an inspection of the capsule (in 1999) that a little metal peace in the main switch had provoked a short-circuit, and this short-circuit had provoked the fire in the oxygen atmosphere. But - also when the metal peace is very strange and does not belong to the switch - there were many possibilities for short-circuits in the Apollo 1 capsule and there was smoke in the capsule already before the fire broke out in the capsule. So the little metal peace at the switch does not seem to be essential for the whole fire. The metal peace is only "very strange".</p>
<p>Last investigations say the fire in Apollo 1 could have been provoked in the same manner as the fire in an MD-11 of Swissair wich crashed at Halifax in 1998. So for the fire on Apollo 1 the casing and the electric cables would be one of the main causes - aside the oxygen atmosphere. For the three dead astronauts the main cause is the door which could not be opened and missing First Aid because all believed they already were dead but they did not suddenly. To investigate the dead of the Baron family with an exhumation of the bones would be useful and could reduce speculations. This is NO conspiracy theory, but these are facts and missing proofs.</p>

<p>Astronaut <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgil_Grissom_bb1a.html" title="Virgil Grissom">Virgil Grissom</a> always warned that Apollo was technically not as developed as <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemini.html" title="Gemini">Gemini</a> before. He was not loved for his critical voice because he said in public Apollo was "a basket full of screws". But Grissom was not alone: One of the most important warners that the Apollo project was full of mistakes and risks was also Thomas Ronald Baron, quality control inspector from <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Aviation_a78d.html" title="North American Aviation">North American Aviation</a> (NAA). He made a 55 page report, but NAA management refused to follow him. When Baron gave informations about heavy mistakes at ramp 34 to the press he was fired from North American Aviation on 5. January 1967.</p>

<p>Before Apollo 1 there were also about four other accidents with a pure <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen.html" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> atmosphere with injured persons and even dead victims at other <a href="../../../a/f/b/AFB_2296.html" title="AFB">AFBs</a> and test sites. So all in all the accident of Apollo 1 with the oxygen experiment in the technically not high standarded capsule could be foreseen. But NASA management did not act. In the meantime Baron wrote at home a 500 page compendium about mistakes and risks in the Apollo program. And Grissom (<a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander.html" title="Commander">commander</a> of Apollo 1) did not quit what would have been natural in this situation - for any reason we don't know.</p>

<p>Is information available about the capsule environment such as PSI, partial pressure of various gasses, temperature, etc at time of cabin rupture? Accident reports say telemetry was transmitted until 2 seconds after the rupture event, it also says that the lights were on in the capsule when they finally got the hatch off, suggesting that any local recorders that might have been installed in the space craft could also still be running as there was still electrical power. However, I've never seen any specific figures, only a few comments along the lines of the pressure was "hundreds of times greater" than normal. --G. McVey 02:41, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
