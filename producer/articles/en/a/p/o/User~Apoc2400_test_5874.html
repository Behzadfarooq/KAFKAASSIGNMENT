	    <p>the gallery in a waste treatment center</p>
<p>There is a smokestack of a waste treatment center, in the background if you look from in front of the Setagaya ward Art museum, Tokyo. Also Meguro ward has the same situation. It seems to be an extremely practical reason that a public museum is close to a waste treat center. That is not a trouble for Art. An example is an Art district in New York that used to be a part of the slum cleanup policy. However in Setagaya, the green of copper roofs used to conflict with the red and white of the smokestack piercing the sky, because the architect had designed the museum without considering the smokestack. After that, the ward camouflaged the smokestack by painting pastel colors.</p>
<p>From there to south, driving on Circle Road #8, we get to a temple-yard that prevented Road #8 from opening until the last. It had fallen behind in the move negotiation between the government and the temple. The broad road, as if it were wearied of waiting, used to have no outlet by both sides of the temple-yard on a small hill. My grandparents sleep there, so I went to the procedure about the move. I had listened to some explanation by the government staffs though, I remember I didn't sign at their document after all, when noisy was press helicopters hovering over my head. The stubborn chief priest held a grand ceremony for the move, and passed away.</p>
<p>Recently, when my Pomeranian had stopped his heart, I cremated him, at a temple for the purpose. In the channel, there is a pile of white dry fragments of animal bone shown in a common glass case. Innumerable photographs around there shows how many pets we have loved in the world. Flowers are blooming in the well-kept garden.</p>
<p>A house I lived for three years since I was born was an apartment in Setagaya, along Odakyu railway to Mt. Fuji. Living on the ground floor, in front of there I could play outside by myself in a small children's park. That were a sandbox and a concrete tube through a berm. 20 years later, I first returned there. The original landscape of my life appeared like itself, within the field where the three years old children used to be. The weather and passed years had completely washed away the dirt berm but only left the small tunnel of concrete tube. Beside there, I found a water tower. That attracted me to take photographs of the original landscape from its top. I went to a superintendent box that had been, told an old superintendent my circumstance, and asked him for a permission to climb the tower. He willingly accepted mine, saying "I see. I'll follow you up to the top." He took a bunch of keys, and lead me to the entrance into the tower. As its inside had spirited to many layers with minimal floors, we could climb changing ladders. Many short ladders made a chain upward. We climbed that layer by layer, and crested out the rooftop. Beneath, he was waiting for me. I shot my own landscape in the finder of camera, and then went back down. After we got back to the earth, I thanked him, repeatedly bowing. Without any words, he returned to his usual business. At a later date, I wrote the tenant of the apartment a letter that I would have liked to confirm my birth-home. They also so generously showed me all over the rooms, that I couldn't believe they were strangers. Would everyone treat me so well, just told this is my own birth-home, in this crowded city?</p>
<p>From the museum to north, driving on Circle Road #8, we get to another waste treatment center in Takaido. On its smokestack, several points blinks white flash out. On the top part, some holes opens, like crenels watching in four direction, whose purpose is not sure. As part of the visitor couse, watching the waste pool through the windows, below our eyes, a hall space so deeply opens. On its bottom, there is a large pile of dried grape, we see so because the waste are packed in black plastic bags. I suppose that a waste treatment center of Yokohama was made from Switzerland. Differing from Tokyo's, the waste is not packed in plastic bags, the pool realistically overwhelms us. In a space as large as a building, a slushily billowing vortex. Above, magic hands whose size and figure are like a UFO, are flying around suspended on wires. The UFO opened its bottom of petaloid iron nails, and folded waste in as much as two trucks', and approached the window for the visitors to see well. Numerous sorts of substances appear and disappear through gaps in the iron nails, steaming by decomposing heat. Glitzy trademarks of detergents and all that are barely readable in spots.</p>
<p>It would be enjoyable if an art gallery and the waste obserbatory were united. In Idemitsu gallery which views the Imperial Palace, there are ancient ceramic pieces. There are a Gogh and Seiji Togo's exhibited in an obserbatory of New Metropolis Center.</p>
<p>Turning from the window viewing vortex of waste, on that wall, What Painting exhibits?</p>
