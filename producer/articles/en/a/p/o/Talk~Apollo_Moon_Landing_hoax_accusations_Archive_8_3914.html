<h2><span class="mw-headline">This article is completely biased</span></h2>
<p>This article has literally pages and pages of hoax debunking. <i>None</i> of this debunking stuff needs to be in the article, titled APOLLO MOOX HOAX ACCUSATIONS. It's annoying, difficult to read, and completely overshadows the mostly one-line hoax arguments (which is another problem). There's already Wiki pages for NASA fans, they're titled PROJECT APOLLO and MOON LANDING. Put one link at the bottom to Clavius and be done with it.</p>
<p>The stridency of the debunkers is overwhelming. As such, I'm tempted to strip every bit of italic text out of this article. And the hoax claims need to be lengthened with photo examples added. Broodlinger 23:12, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>None of those pages specifically address the alleged issues that the hoaxsters raise. And their simplistic questions require detailed answers. To <i>leave out</i> the debunking would render the page biased. And if you start a wholesale and unilateral delete campaign, you'll be starting another edit war. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:19, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Might I suggest possibly having the page renamed to reflect the fact the page has both Accusations and Debunking Statements, rather then engaging in large scale edits and an edit-war? -<a href="../../../t/h/1/User%7ETh1rt3en_3ea3.html" title="User:Th1rt3en">th1rt3en</a> 02:46, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The idea the "none" of the debunking stuff belongs in is ridiculous, however, the instincts are sound. This article should be severely edited. But just stating the claims as if they were iron clad "unsolved mysteries" is not legitimate. The issue is that previous hoax proponent editors would not accept any language that placed the claims in an appropriate context, i.e as as a set of conspiracy theories put forth by a limited number of individuals with questionable (at best) creditentials whose claims though ill-formed, widely dismissed, and generally ignorant of basic science are neverthless well entrenched in pop culture. I'd delight in working on a much shorter draft of this article that concentrates on the conspiracy theory and follows that tack. Was that what you had in mind? <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 00:30, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indeed. We've tried to edit this page to concentrate on the moon conspiracy theories as a social phenomenon and their historical context, but every time we try the 'true believers' here revert the changes. If you can do a better job, feel free to have a go. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 01:06, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One thing I'm not really happy about the current format is the "stars" arguement is listed under Kaysing (I think). Just about all of them make the same arguements about stars, flags, shadows, blast craters, etc. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 01:41, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, that user (or his anon IP address) made the threatened mass changes, and I changed them back. Hang onto your space helmets, folks, here we go again.

<p>No actually I've made the article concise, legible, and readable. You people who put debunking arguments in an article titled "Moon Hoax Accusations" are the trolls. Broodlinger 02:13, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You have no right to unilaterally make massive changes without discussion, especially when they turn the article into a pro-hoax POV rant. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:14, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I reiterate, the article is titled "MOOX HOAX ACCUSATIONS." <b>YOU</b> have no right to litter the entire article with off-topic material. Broodlinger 02:16, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, y'all, I've used my allotment of 3 reverts for the day. Somebody else will have to take over and/or turn this guy in to one of the Admins for blockage. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:22, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It looks like "Carfiend" has been reincarnated. Or maybe his evil twin. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:25, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There have been several POV pushers from the 24. subnet, but this latest guy is much worse. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:32, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>YOURE THE POV PUSHER WAKEENAH. You're filling a hoax article with debunking statements. 10-20 lines of debunk for every line of argument. Where on Wikipedia is the Moon Hoax theory adequately laid out? Anywhere? Or have you been diligently working to bury the subject? Broodlinger 02:37, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Leaving the questions without answers leaves the false impression that they have no explanation. The user can decide whether the explanations hold water or not. Omitting them makes the article inherently POV. Meanwhile, I'm trying to figure out which of the recent ranters you're a sockpuppet of. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:40, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>No, because your debunking arguments are 10x longer than the article itself. You're SPAMMING. A person can't even read this article and get a decent idea of what the hoax theory is. And I'm sure that's your purpose, to keep this article as confusing as possible.</p>
<p>You don't get to do point-by-point rebuttals in an article, that's nonsense! "Challenges and Responses?" LOL!!! And if your debunking claims made any sense, were legible or understandable in even the most basic way, I'd have *deleted the claim itself* because it's been debunked and doesn't serve the hoax accusations. Example: Flag waving. Yes, they were twisting it with their hands. It stops moving after they leave it alone. Good job, got any others?</p>
<p>Maybe you should start an article called "Ridiculous moon hoax accusations" and focus on aliens and UFOs and things you can actually prove are false. Broodlinger 03:09, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

It is on disk 1, the chapter "TV Transmission 10:32 GET" (GET = Ground Elapse Time, time since liftoff). And true to form, the website lies again and says that it is 190 hours into the mission, not 10 hours.

<p>Dude, It says 190:01:15 - 01:30 1969 GMT for the first video clip. This means that the first clip covers the missiion on 190th day of the 1969th year at Greenwich Mean Time. 1:15 - 1:30.

<dd>Things from NASA are normally given in hours:minutes:seconds from liftoff - not that format. The 190th day of 1969 was July 9. Apollo 11 lifted off on July 16.

<dd>They are probably going to claim it was <i>recorded</i> on July 9th. However, you're onto something with the dating.

<dd>Another thing is that the video says 1:15 GMT. The TV transmission was actually 0:04. Most hoax believers think that the astronauts were actually in low Earth orbit. In fact, the claim is that video shows them looking at Earth from low Earth orbit with the round porthole making the Earth look round. And the video clearly shows that they were weightless, for the whole length of the video. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 23:14, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

I should elaborate; it was previously classified, and/or there was/is an active attempt to keep is out of the public view. I believe that until 2002, this was not part of the public domain... Until i see evidence otherwise, i will keep that view. As soon as you prove me wrong with real evidence i will gladly retract my mistakes. As the two of you have evidently demostrated, there is still an active attempt to prevent people from seeing this. <b>If you are right, why do you have to lie</b> to discredit me?

<dd>Making wild allegations that you cannot back up, and are just plain wrong, will cost you credibility. First you claim that it misrepresents hours. When i show you that it is days, you flip flop and say that it misrepresents days. If you cared to be observant and do some actual research instead of believing what you want to believe, you will see that it does not, in fact, say 190. When you found out your calculations were wrong, you didnt double check them??!@!!! Obviously, the video quality is not the best, however you can see that the numbers 0,3,6,8,9 all look alot alike. If 190 doesnt work, why not try 193?? Is that really so far beyond you? Most of the time, pro-apollo people claim to be real rocket scientists, then go on to demsonstrate complete ineptitude at even the most simple concepts involved. Maybe you actually do work for nasa, with your attention to fine detail, research skills, thoroughness.... NO WONDER NASA HAS SO MANY PROBLEMS!!!</dd>

<dd>All three of those assumptions or assertions are incorrect. There is no visual evidence whatsoever to support items 1 and 2, and item 3 suggests the hoaxsters <i>weren't listening</i>, as it was stated by the astronauts that they shot the earth through one side window while the sunlight was coming in (mostly blocked by their star chart) through the opposite side window (there were several little windows in the capsule), which also squares with the way the earth is illuminated in those shots, kind of a "waning gibbous" look as they got farther away from earth. I don't think there is any "circular hatch window" in the nose cone, but in any case, they weren't pointed on a straight line between earth and moon, they took an arc toward the moon, so the earth would easily be visible outside one of their windows. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 06:05, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, I took a chance. It again "messed with" my PC, probably setting up the flash player, and conked out Windows Explorer eventually, but I didn't have to reboot, so hopefully everything's peachy. I did get to watch it all the way through, and it's a fascinating video. It gives a realistic sense of what it was like to be in that little bitty capsule, tens of thousands of miles from the earth. This could easily go on the Apollo page itself. The hoax commentary should be good for a laugh, as it's a fairy tale. Also, <b>Bubba73 please note</b>, in looking closely at the timestamps, I observed that it's 198, not 190. It's a little fuzzy, but on the first card you can see the difference between the 8 and the 0 that's right next to it after the colon. It's a little more distinct on the other two cards. The three timestamps given are:</p>
<ul>
<li>198:01:15 - 198:01:30</li>
<li>198:23:31 - 198:23:54</li>
<li>198:23:54 - 199:00:07</li>
</ul>
<p>Day 198, leading up to midnight, would be July 17th, the second day of the mission, which they confirm at one point by zooming in on the mission clock, which is at 34 hours and 16 minutes at that point (about 5 minutes before the start of the third segment). Everything in this video squares with the conventional Apollo saga. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 05:51, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In short, the hoaxsters got everything wrong in their commentary, <i>even the datestamp.</i> Par for the course. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 06:09, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In looking at it a little more, the font used for those low-tech title cards has the middle stroke of any "bisected" character (such as E, F, 3, 5 and 8) slightly above halfway, which tends to fuzz it out for some characters; notice how the crosspieces of the E and the F are also nearly invisible. Another giveaway is the last segment, which runs 13 minutes, not eight days and 13 minutes.</p>
<p>Here's a photo <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/frame/?AS11-36-5339" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/frame/?AS11-36-5339" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> similar to (and a little clearer than) the shots in the video. Apparently their "circular hatch window" not only came equipped with an extra-worldly fisheye lens that could somehow capture half the earth from low earth orbit, it also came with a "variable terminator" feature. I want to thank whatever hoaxster led me to that site, as it's an excellent resource for Apollo mission photos. Like this video, it gives a realistic sense of what it was like to be there. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:02, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "garbage" is both their title (which is part-misleading and part-unverifiable) and their commentary, which bears no relationship to what's going on in the video.

<p>Let me get this straight. Hoax proponents (at least a subset of these) claim that WvB's Antarctica expedition collected the 380 kgs of material that Apollo supposedly brought back from the moon. Lunar meteorites are identified by comparing them to these samples. A total of 30 kgs of lunar meteoritic material has so far been found (<a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_meteorites.html" title="Lunar meteorites">Lunar meteorites</a>). Independent of whether the Apollo samples, and hence what is known as "lunar meteorites", are actually from the moon or not, this means that WvB collected samples of a very rare kind of mineral amounting to more than a dozen times the mass of what the entire geological community has achieved since. Right. Wow. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETeraBlight_e6e3.html" title="User:TeraBlight">TeraBlight</a> 02:42, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And even more amazing is that he did it something like 14 years before anyone else knew that there were any lunar meteorites on the earth. And he did it in one trip, as opposed to a number of trips over the decades. This was discussed a little before, and is probably back in an archive of the tals. Not all of the 380 kikograms are rocks, though. Some of it is dust, soil, and core samples. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 02:55, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The facts are: 2 years before the launch of the first mission to the moon, at a time when NASA was having difficulty and falling behind the Soviets, the head of rocketry goes to Antarctica. No one really knows why. Efforts on my part to find out have so far led to nothing. NASA's story is vague. The theory is that he knew that they were not going to be able to get to the moon, and so went looking for moon rocks there. It was known that lunar meteorites could be found there. He didn't need to collect 300 pounds, just a sample, the rest could be manufactured, after all, they are the reference for which 'real' moon rocks are judged. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 16:37, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, because in addition to being a rocket engineer <i>par excellence</i>, von Braun was an expert geologist. Anyone could get the Saturn development back on track, but he was the only person within NASA with the knowledge to retrieve the right rocks and the discretion to keep it quiet. Besides, the top man always goes on away missions, right? <a href="../../../c/p/w/User%7ECPWinter_f063.html" title="User:CPWinter">ChrisWinter</a> 01:29, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My comment was sarcastic; I see that didn't come across. No; you don't need to be a rocket scientist to go look for rocks. A geologist is what you need to be — and in fact von Braun wasn't. Not only did he have the wrong skills, but sending him instead of a trained geologist was wrong in the organizational sense — rather like sending Captain Kirk down to a planet to gather samples instead of sending a low-ranking crew member. <a href="../../../c/p/w/User%7ECPWinter_f063.html" title="User:CPWinter">ChrisWinter</a> 02:09, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Carfiend, two years before the first mission to the moon, the US was <b>way</b> ahead of the USSR. See the <i>Technological capability of USA compared to the USSR</i> section in the article. Also, pay close attention to particular attention to the accomplishments that were needed to get to the moon (rendezvous, docking, etc) as opposed to stunts, like the first woman in space and the first two independent flights up at the same time. Even Kaysing says that these things the US was doing must be done (Kaysing 2002:37-40). 05:21, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A second-year Geology student could not be fooled with fake moon rocks. Anyone who thinks that a fully trained geologist with years of experience could be fooled is beyond ignorant. There is absolutely no method to reproduce the properties found in moon rocks in any "oven" here on earth. Unless you assume that even the geologists are in on the hoax.

<dd>Carfiend, I accessed the article you requested in section 7 of this discussion page and summarized what it put forth about WvB's motivation for the Antarctica expedition. The story as given seems valid, reasonable and consistent (which doesn't mean that it has to be true, of course).</dd>
<dd>As to "manufacturing rock samples", I very much doubt that this is technologically possible. As far as I know, it IS possible to do this in the laboratory in minute quantities, but not on a scale anywhere near what would be required to produce half a ton in any reasonable amount of time. And even with today's equipment, the products are easily identifiable as artificial.</dd>
<dd>Manufacturing minerals is just about as hard as manufacturing gems.

<dd>He didn't get any of that stuff on tape, I would guess. But it doesn't matter, we should just trust him, because he has a reputation for detailed knowledge of science and technology, and for trustworthiness and never making anything up or distorting the obvious. This all reminds me of the tales about <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_51.html" title="Area 51">Area 51</a>, the top secret test site that everyone knows about. Maybe it's just a diversion from the real test site, just like maybe Kaysing was being paid by NASA to make the Moon landing hoax stories look so silly. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 11:06, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeees, this is beginning to make sense to me. Discredit any possible disclosures about a real conspiracy by having someone (Kaysing) present that very conspiracy in such an obnoxious and inane manner that hardly anyone will take anything along the same lines seriously ever again. Textbook reverse psychology, with a twist.

<dd>It <b>is</b> true, as you know. It doesn't make NASA false.

The title "Apollo moon landing conspiracy theories" is a little more neutral, but a little too broad. If this whole article is about the program being a hoax, the title should make reference to the hoax. (Apollo moon landing hoax conspiracy theories) The current title could be about any conspiracy theory about Apollo, such as stories of the astronauts seeing UFOs.

<dd>There are different versions of the theories which claim different things. The common thread seems to be the moon landing. I agree that to be completely and perhaps pedantically explicit perhaps the word "hoax" should be in there, but the current title meets my 'good enough' criteria, meaning it is accurate, more or less NPOV and people will know what it refers too. I don't know anything about the astronauts seeing UFOs other than having heard the reference, though I do think the qualifier 'moon landing' sort of narrows the scope sufficiently to rule out most of the <i>other</i> apollo related conspiracy theories. Who said the astronauts saw UFOs? This might clear up the 'too little fuel' thing for the hoax theorists. The alien saucer could have towed them the rest of the way to the moon.<a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 14:37, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As Canfield has tried to point out frequently, the facts have pretty much forced the hoaxsters to concede that at least <i>unmanned</i> lunar landings were not only possible, but did occur. The sticking point, or their last bastion, seems to be that <i>manned</i> travel to the moon was not possible (in their ignorance-based opinion), and when confronted with anything that suggests otherwise, they fall back on either, "NASA was the only source", or "the signals could have been originated elsewhere". In short, the lunar vehicles did everything except land actual humans on the moon, and the apparent radio reception of voice transmissions from the Apollo craft were actually transmissions emanating from close to the earth, or (possibly) by piping them <i>through</i> the "unmanned" Apollo craft. The closer you get to the nuts-and-dolts of the alternate "theories", the sillier they look. Meanwhile, the Apollo saga remains 100 percent consistent within itself, which doesn't "prove" it happened, but it's the best model that fits the observable facts. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:45, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Some thoughts:
<ul>
<li>After having a look at the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> article and related debates, I have to say that I'm beginning to lean towards keeping the term out of the title. The fact that it is frequently used in a pejorative manner implies that it would suggest a POV to some readers, which is to be avoided.</li>
<li>I gather that neither "Apollo" or "Moon landing" can be left out since there are too many other hoax theories out there to make it less specific.</li>
<li>I don't really like "hoax accusations", and I see that "hoax theories" is again problematic, so my personal favourite would be</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I claim that most anything with the word "claim" in it carries an inherent opposite point-of-view. Example: NASA claims they safely landed men on the moon. Hoax proponents claim it was a hoax. Implication: They say it, but we "know" otherwise. However, in the interim, it would be nice if somebody could figure out how to at least have the article page and the talk page for it have <i>the same title</i>. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:56, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<h3><span class="mw-headline">My suggestion</span></h3>
<p>Honestly, I feel like the name is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Too long. way too long.</li>
<li>Describes the wrong thing. If you look for the principle noun of the title it's "accusations". since we're describing this as a movement, accusations is just the wrong noun entirely. It should center around a movement name(even though there is no such unified name).</li>
<li>Presently redundant. Most people would understand "Moon landings" to refer to the apollo missions already, and some people doubt things such as the ESA probe too, so restricing it to Apollo is irrational.</li>
<li>even the "hoax" part may not be appropriate, the allegations aren't quite the same as those of a hoax, more of a conspiriacy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having considered all of these points for a while now, I reiterate my idea of <b>Moon landing skepticism</b> which I beleive addresses all of my above concerns without being POV. There are those who would disagree with the "skepticism" part on NPOV grounds, however, after considering alternatives, such as "disbeleif"(rejected because some people doubt, without disagreeing entirely with the possibility), it is my personal opinion that skepticism is the most forthright term. This may call for a straw poll, but I want to get comments first, then poll if many comments are in favor. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 15:11, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There have been several polls already, none of which expressed much desire to change the title. What's wrong with the factual, npov 'hoax accusations'?

<dl>
<dd>Spelling aside, (being one of the good reasons to list an important change on the talk page), do <i>you</i> think my assertions about the current title are unfair or factually misrepresented? I honestly think that the title should be as breif as possible while still accurately describing it's topic, except in such cases where something has an official name. The reason I beleive this is that it helps the reader grasp the notion faster and easier, which is an important mission to an encyclopedia. Additionally, NPOV wasn't listed as my concerns for the old title, and I was hoping for discussion about such things for my suggested title. I know sometimes a short answer will do in these situations, but I beleive all of the above concerns are fairly valid, and, even if no change is made, I think they should be addressed.

<dd>I share your view that it should be as long as needed to be npov, true, and capture the content of the page, no longer, but no shorter either. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 19:03, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I might misunderstand, but it seems like you dissapprove of this proposed change. If that is the case, what would you suggest is a POV issue with it? I was pretty satisfied that "skepticism" would neither diminish the perpetuators, nor give them undue credence, as well as illustrate the notion that it is a beleif(via the ism ending) rather than focus on the actual things said(per accusations). I was also, as I said above, wanting to remove the redundancy, and overrestrictiveness, of specifically calling it "Apollo", and bring the article to the wider notion that encompasses people who are skeptical of at least 1 moon landing's accuracy as recorded. As a more inclusive notion, I felt it was better because specifically against apollo is non-encyclopedic in nature.</dd>
<dd>Forgive me for being so stubborn, but I think I've cited specific enough problems with the current title, that a move is justified, and I'd like to know of specific or general problems with my new proposed title.

<p>(indenting was sucky) Your tranlator's out of whack. try this one: <i>This user has consistently demostrated an unwillingness to engage in any discussion or consensus building (and specifically in several discussions that have to do with the title) and has consistently sought ot derail the discussions through tangents, screwing with people's comments, changing headings, and, most often, complete misreadings of other's comments. Due to the consistancy and arc of these misreadings they can only be described as willfuly manipulative. Here is a recent, mild example that you may recognize: I share <b>your view</b> that it should be <b>as long</b> as needed to be npov, true, and capture the content of the page . . .</i> Correct me if I'm wrong, but that isn't what you said really. You were arguing, with thoughtful qualifiers, that the title be shortened and yet they responded, by giving undue weight to your thoughtful qualifiers, by saying you said the nearly opposite. But whatever. It's trivia. You've got your views. I understand.</p>
<p>with regard to your proposed title I think given that the focus is pretty much solely on NASA's lunar program and all significant flights in that program were Apollo flights, <i>Apollo</i> or <i>Nasa</i> should be in the title. I'd obviously prefer <i>conspiracy theory</i> as well because it is accurate and descriptive. It is unfortunate that it hurts the adherents feelings or seems to deflate their dearly held beliefs, but that point is discussed in the article and the term is widely applied to the topic (again discussed in article). Further, since we're still talking about titles the terms is 'accusation' is blatently POV (as has been discussed at length) because it carries with it the idea that those accusations have not been answered. Finaly your title and the current one are not in poular usage and thus decrease the chance that an interested reader will find this article. All of that said I prefer your suggested title to the current one. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 22:45, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> states above that "[an article about hoax theories] specifically against apollo is non-encyclopedic in nature." I don't understand why this is so, could someone explain it to me? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETeraBlight_e6e3.html" title="User:TeraBlight">TeraBlight</a> 01:08, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>IMO "Moon landing skepticism" is too broad. Such a title could refer to a discussion of the pros and cons of future moon landings, it could refer to ideas that aliens have landed on the moon, etc. I do, on the other hand, agree that "skepticism" best captures the focus of the article. I'd be happy with
<dl>
<dd>"Apollo project skepticism".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>However, the conclusion of a previous debate seemed to be that many hoax opponents felt that the term was too dignified to be entirely NPOV. "Doubts" or "Suspicions" do not have such a context, but unfortunately neither of these is "ism-able". <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETeraBlight_e6e3.html" title="User:TeraBlight">TeraBlight</a> 01:08, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I see the point about dignifying, and state, as strongly as I can, that dignity to a beleif is <b>not</b> <b>not</b> <i><b>not</b></i> POV. Look at the scientology page. The religion is dealt with dignity, in spite of being, in my personal opinion, a loony cult. I know consensus is important here, but I really feel the strong need to convince people that this consensus is perhaps in error.</li>
<li>to Tera, the exact notions of theories are unverifiable. Particularly those that address day to day concerns. The movement is far less original research based than the things the movement declares. I think I went overboard saying "inherently unencyclopedic" but, to wikipedia, theories are only as important as those that present them(being numerous, well known, or experts). I feel as though that point may have gone through some invisible wikilawyering in my head, so I wish to post scriptum state that I don't think that's quite true.</li>
<li>to the "NASA must be in the title" point. If you look in the article, several of the points address the lack of third party investigation, the mention of third parties, or their absence, demonstrates at least partially, that the contention is above and beyond just NASA, but the scientific endevour of studying the moon.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are probably some points I've failed to address(i'm trying to address them all as this is my idea, but i spent the last few hours composing music with my girlfriend, so you know). Please help, I really feel as though this is a weak point in the article.<a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 03:48, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I share <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a>'s view expressed in the first bullet point above. The question we should address is whether or not - and in which ways - the different title suggestions might influence readers on a conscious or subconscious level.</dd>
<dd>While capturing the nature of the hoax theories well, using the term "conspiracy theory" in the title might make some readers dismiss the claims made in the body text more easily - this is not a good thing, readers should come to their own conclusions based on "the merits of the case".</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, I can't imagine that the use of the term "skepticism" could make anyone think "hey, I consider myself to be a sceptic too, those hoax guys must be on to something". <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETeraBlight_e6e3.html" title="User:TeraBlight">TeraBlight</a> 07:03, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>that is close to another of his suggestions. Actully they weren't suggestions, they were "why didn't the astronauts ... ". Besides building a fire, he asks why they didn't "create a pattern with lightweight black dust" or "beam a laser to a mirror on earth". I'm not sure what good beaming a laser to a <i>mirror</i> on Earth would do, but perhaps he means some sort of detector. However, as we have already seen, if bouncing a lser off something they left there isn't enough, a laser coming from there to here wouldn't be either. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 02:05, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You have hit upon one of the core mistakes of the hoaxsters, and not for the first time: "suspect" and "should be". You might be right on this specific point, I don't know.

<dd>So what you're saying is that if NASA had an analog tape of telemetry and an analog tape of the video, it would not be feasible for them to play back both tapes at the same time and copy them onto a third 14-track analog tape, right? <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 03:15, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I can't imagine what would make you think that was what I was saying.

<dd>You said that it wouldn't be possible for them to get the video and telemetry onto one tape. Only the original tape could have that. Suppose I record something on TV with my VCR.

<dd>Sorry - I said seven hundred tapes. Of course, it is seven hundred <i>boxes</i> of tapes. The issue is that this is a huge amount of detail to fake, and I don't personally believe that it could be faked without introducing 'continuity errors'. Of course, it doesn't look like they have to fake it - saying it is lost seems just as good. The other items are pretty unconvincing. Some odd rocks, some photos, some blurry video.

<dd>Allright, I changed all occurances of "moon" to "Moon", except for "moonwalk" (composite and no capital seems to be the preferred spelling) and a single occurance of "moon" in a more general sense than "the Moon".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My reverts</span></h2>
<p>I've been attempting to undo the damage done on this page today, by essentially one pro-hoax extremist who habitually and repeatedly attacked any user and any edit that does not conform to his narrow POV. In particular since tihs mornig this user has made literally doxens of edits that amount to blatent POV pushing. Others have identifed structural problems in this article which a number of editors have attempted to address over the past week. These edits have been systematicaly rolled back by essentialy one rabid pro-hoax editor who refuses to engage in any meaningful way on these talk pages and treats this article as his own possession and labels any editor who disagrees with him as a 'nasa shill' or 'POV jihadist' (at best this eidtor has frequently reverted to even more pointed personal attacks) How in the world are we supposed to reach consensus on anything with un-ethical extremists? Read the various sections on the NPOV tags. Read the various issues on the title of the article. I'm looking for sincere advice on how to move forward with this article when essentially one extremist will do whatever it takes to maintain the status quo. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 20:22, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The easiest thing would be to, say... not call them unethical. Call those edits unethical all you want, you don't have enough context nor moral authority to decry the person as unethical.

<dd>I was giving that as source for info about the missing tapes. You say that is circumstantial evidence. However, there is no evidence - circumstantial or otherwise - for a hoax. Speaking of the tapes, the Australians talk about how the pointed their radio telescope at the Moon and had to account for Doppler shift. That proves that the TV and telemetry they were receiving was coming from the Moon. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 16:31, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, to stick to the point for a moment, the fact that the tapes are missing is suspicious to those who are not true believers. It would be like invading Iraq and finding that weapons of mass destruction were 'missing' - it's not proof of a conspiracy, but it sure smells like one. As for the australians, if you take their account at face value, it does indicate that the transmission of the video was odd, although I don't think it necessarily proves it was coming from the moon - there are other ways to introduce dopler shift into the transmission. Even if it were shown to come from the moon however, it would only show that a transmitter was on the moon - see the previous discussion about why the astros never mention current events. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 16:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You have no context on which to judge it "suspicious". Have you researched what other stuff from government projects of that era is "missing" or misplaced or whatever? Of course not. As for the other, it's the same old hoaxster trick of imposing their personal opinion of how it "should have been done". Current events???

<dd>"<i>A few</i>"? 700 boxes full, just from 11? That's a strange definition of 'a few'.

<dd>Losing stuff is easy. Somebody probably threw them away. Nobody would ever put their hand up to that though. 1000 boxes is a pile, 10 wide, 10 high and 10 deep. It's not that impressively big, it fits in a small room. Somebody may have wanted the room and just ditched it. If management wanted to get rid of it, he could arrange for them to be 'moved' and just get the movers to relocate it to a dump somewhere or an incinerator. Nobody would ever work out what happened. Or maybe it's still kicking around somewhere, but as time goes on, the chances of stuff going 'missing' goes way up.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 20:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These so-called "high quality" Apollo 11 moonwalk tapes that are missing are actually low quality. They simply would be somewhat higher quality than the recordings made at the time outside the Australia station. They are at 10 frames per second, instead of the (US) TV standard of 30. They are black and white, not color. Video of all of the later landings exists in 30 fps color - higher quality than the so-called "high quality" Apollo 11 moonwalk tapes that are missing.

<dd>It says the news of the missing tapes might give fodder to hoax theorists. It does not say that the missing tapes are evidence for a hoax. That is the distinction I'm making.

I'm not claiming these things don't deserve their own article, but what's most interesting, and most useful here, is information about the people, the channels of communication, and representation in other elements of culture. The complaints and theories and accusations and hearsay and quotes should be given fair space in the article, but the very semantics of the title give the article a totally incorrect bent for the primary article on the subject. Those of you trying to prove this point X and that point Y are really only hurting wikipedia. I've never been one for unilateral action, but everytime I try to discuss a change I consider meaningful here, someone slips in and tells me one of the following things I get told that some side(which is really quite imaginary from what I've seen) or another is going to do X, which has nothing to do with what I'm trying to do.

<dd>The "high quality" tape that is missing is simply a better copy of the same television of the Apollo 11 moonwalk that was shown around the world, and still exists. The quality is not "high" - it is 10 frames per second instead of 30 and it is black and white instead of color. Even the "high quality" tape of the Apollo 11 moonwalk is lower quality than the video of the later flights. So was Apollo 11 fake and the rest real???? All of the television transmissions exist and are available. All of the 16 mm film exists. All of the still photography exists. The only pictures that are missing is the slow-scan TV (<a href="../../../s/s/t/SSTV_9eed.html" title="SSTV">SSTV</a> version of the Apollo 11 moonwalk (before the scan conversion to standard TV). You can't view SSTV on normal TVs, so the scan conversion was required to broadcast it to the world.

<dd>Are you sure about your last statement? Considering that the conversion was done by displaying the SSTV on a screen with a sort of after-glow effect and then filming off that screen, if I understood that part correctly, I would assume that the difference in resolution and contrast would be quite considerable... <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETeraBlight_e6e3.html" title="User:TeraBlight">TeraBlight</a> 08:04, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The original raw footage of the Reagan assassination attempt was also <i>nearly</i> lost. It was found recently in some "old junk" that was about to be discarded by one of the networks. The hoaxster cons are in their element with this news story, as they have caught this red herring hook, line and sinker. Their ultimate orgasm would, of course, be for the mainstream media to demand that NASA "prove" that Apollo really happened. So far, the story is playing as simply bureaucratic fumbling, which is more to the point, although even that is out of context, since no one in the sensationalistic press has asked, "What <i>else</i> is missing?" <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 10:48, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not true. As you know, many people are annoyed, and a number of them are actually looking for the tapes. The lack of tapes is real, not a figment of anyones imagination.

<dd>Not in reference to this specific photo, presumably, but to photos taken on the moon, right? It's another example of the hoax proponents' ignorance of lighting and photography and/or willfull deception on the subject. The moon is not an especially bright object in the sky (although it appears that way to us, because we are close to it), but for someone actually standing on it, there would be a fair amount of reflected, diffuse light from the surface of the moon to illuminate <i>somewhat</i> the shady side of an object backlit by the sun. In fact, if there <i>wasn't</i>, then it could arouse suspicion.

<li>The hoaxster cons don't understand about subtleties such as light reflected from other sources such as the earth, which reflects light very well. Presumably, a photo with total darkness in the unlighted area would be a more likely sign of a single-point source of light, i.e. a fake.

<dd>while you're trying to be ammusing in this statement, the earth has an albedo 10 times that of the moon on average, meaning it reflects 10x the ammount of diffuse light the moon does, and being diffuse, larger objects would emmit more.

<dd>It depends on who you'd accept as independent, and what you'd accept as evidence. Things like long range photography are hard to come by because that stuff was almost exclusively available to governments at the time. Things like witness testimony is easier to get, but still difficult for time reasons(people died and moved, mention of who did what is lost over time, memories fade) but still fairly broadly available(but not rampantly published like <i>some</i> things are). things that are similar to what is used as evidence against NASA can be piled high. Example: "No one saw buzz alrdrin while he was in space" "the skeptics could have doctored photos too".

<dd>As I have stated before - there is much confusion about what is missing. All of the original tapes with the telemetry are missing, from all Apollo missions.

<dd>A single citation might be enough if it's considered a "reliable" (pardon the expression) moon hoax source site. The "counterpoint", if any, would be something along the lines that NASA acknowledges that the whereabouts of the tapes is unknown. I would leave out anything about NASA denying or commenting on any connection to an alleged hoax, unless someone can find a citation showing that someone actually asked them such a question (unlikely), or that they voluntarily said anything about it (<i>very</i> unlikely). <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:34, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>OK, I just Read The Freakin' Article (to semi-quote that one user). It's only an editorial laughing at NASA for misplacing the tapes. It cites no actual hoaxster sources, comments, or what-have-you. It would add nothing to this article. Citing the mere fact of the 13,000 missing tapes (assuming that's factual - how do they know how many there are if they can't be found?) <i>is</i> worth mentioning, <i>within the section on "missing" data</i>, as it's a widely-covered news story. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:55, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure how you made the leap from discussion of an appropriate source to my advocating weasel words, but whatever. <i>but that'd too much to ask for isn't it?</i> given that what your saying originates as far as I know from this talk page than yes, that is too much to ask. See [WP:NOR]. How many is "many?" Is there a single source that says explicitly this is more evidence for the moon hoax. That is what is required. The source listed says news of the missing types might make the hoax more popular.

<dd>There are numerous articles, and no one is entirely sure exactly what is missing even. They don't cite this article, but do cite that the original tapes are missing. It's unclear to me whether the 13,000 tapes are the same ones that are in the 700 boxes or not. To be honest, what belongs here is that some tapes are missing, and the hoax proponents say this is evidence of a hoax. I would take the question of which tapes, and where they might be to another article, since the scope is broader than just the hoax proponents. Many people are concerned at the loss, without believing in the hoax. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 17:48, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then the safest or most flexible approach is to chop down the minutia of that section and simply report that various original data is missing, NASA acknowledges it, and it's a widely reported news story by now... along with the one relevant citation that hoaxsters take this to mean that it never existed, without which there is no point in even having it in the article, but I think there is such a citation there already, so no problem, right? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:10, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes that article seems to implicate the impossibility of going to the moon in 1969. And they are right. Also, after watching the apollo astronots faking footage video, it should be clear to everybody why the tapes were requested back from the national archives. Nasa says the archiving was a low priority, so why was it such a priority to go through all the effort to get it back from the national archives?

<dd>Typical moon hoaxster misinterpretation. Since there is an apparent revival of interest in going back to the moon, it only makes sense to study the nuts and bolts of how it was done previously, for the sake of learning, to avoid having to totally "re-invent the wheel". If you are in the software development industry, for example, do you always write everything from scratch, or do you go back and see how someone else did a similar task, for your own knowledge and for better efficiency? Your characterization of "trying to figure out" as suggesting that they are skeptical or mystified, has no basis other than your own wishful thinking.<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:10, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm beginning to find these misreadings of articles written at 6th grade reading level pretty funny. The article is all about how present day engineers are STILL studying Nasa's Apollo era tech in an effort to bootstrap their recently renewed efforts to go back to the moon. As an indicator of the difficulty and tenor of this article, it took me less than 2 minutes to read it, grok it and find that quote. It reads to me like a pro-NASA Human interest piece, the kind of thing some NASA marketer is getting kudos for having successfully pitched it to CBS.

<p>Which means exactly nothing and proves nothing -- just like the rest of the 'evidence' offered for a hoax. However, I note that this tacitly adds these 'young engineers' (who claim to have studied the records relating to the Apollo program) to the remarkably non-conspiratorial hoax participants -- assuming that they haven't been duped as well. It's a good thing that NASA only hires gullible and/or dishonest engineers these days.

<p>"Holding on to historic footage is not rocket science — which may be exactly why Nasa officials were forced to say on Tuesday, “Houston, we have a problem”. The problem is that Nasa seems to have lost more than 13,000 original tapes recording the Apollo moon missions, including the historic 1969 Neil Armstrong-Buzz Aldrin first moonwalk. While Richard Nafzger, a senior Nasa engineer put in charge of the search-and-rescue operation, insists that the tapes are not lost (he simply “doesn’t know where they are”), there has been a sudden peak in activity among conspiracy theory circles, especially among those who maintain that the whole moon-landing business was a hoax.</p>
<p>A few years ago, matters got serious enough for Nasa to launch a point-by-point ‘explanation’ to refute claims that the moon missions were all conducted in a studio somewhere in the US." <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoodle_boy_ab11.html" title="User:Noodle boy">Noodle boy</a> 09:34, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yup, like the guardian article it connects the <b>popularity</b> of the hoax to the NASA's announcement concerning these tapes; this, apparently, is dauntingly elusive distinction for some of us. I guess the last paragraph is a reference to the aborted hoax debunking book. I note that they don't mention that is was discontinued or why. Surprising in a source as reliable and well respected as the Hindustan Times. I think this topic (meaning the recent NASA announcement that they are seriously looking for the tapes and the above described reaction to that announcement) deserves an inclusion in the section that talks about the origin and history of the hoax in media. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 11:40, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Given that the events happened nearly 40 years ago, and nobody from any of the various sides involved (NASA, Soviet Union etc) has claimed "yes there was a hoax" or even "yes, some of the details were cleaned up" - can we assume that those who won't be convinced will stay that way, and concentrate on actual happenings - eg the misplaced tapes?</p>

<li>When and if they unlock it, that is. Also, I just watched the movie to see what the fuss was about. Although the presence of the moon set does not seem to be specifically explained (other than the obvious plot device of giving James Bond a funny-looking vehicle for a chase scene), it is clear that Willard Whyte's interests (aside from sausage) include the aerospace industry, and that Whyte does contract work for the U.S. government. Hoaxsters, looking for any straw, might interpret this scene as suggesting a hoax. I would say they would be hard-pressed to find anyone <i>in 1971</i> who would have put this particular spin on it.

<dd>One thing this site illustrates is an answer to the complaint about supposedly few photos being produced. There are many that are very similar, like they were just going click-click-click with the camera, and a number that are, frankly, not very good. They wanted to take enough so that hopefully they would get a <i>few</i> useful ones. They say that the photogs at <i>National Geographic</i> take thousands, knowing only a handful will be in the magazine. I can tell you from my limited experience that you can shoot many rolls and find maybe only a few frames that are really worth reprinting. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:31, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That hoaxster red herring has been asked and answered. The nature of moon dust is such that the particles cling together when compressed, looking <i>somewhat</i> like wet sand and <i>unlike</i> dry sand. Dry sand particles are smooth and roll off each other, while moon dust particles are rough and jagged, because there is no erosive force (the ocean) to smooth them down as with sand. Thus, dry sand leaves a somewhat fuzzy outline of a footprint, whereas wet sand (with water as the binding agent) and moon dust (with the dust particles clinging to each other rather than rolling off each other) tend to look more distinct, and kind of similar. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 11:47, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found the * indentations a little difficult to read, because of the italics more than anything. There should be something to differentiate accusation from response of course. Can anyone suggest a better style?</p>
<p>By the way, I think this article is great, even if it's controversial and all. It's led me to make my own more informed conclusions. More importantly I believe that time will eventually prove or disprove the historical accuracy of the landings. After all, at the present there are either footprints on the moon or there aren't. (Or maybe there will always be conspiracy theories.)</p>
<p>A very minor point: For Number 12 below, isn't that what's in contention here? Seems odd to be listing it as supporting evidence, more like a cyclic argument.</p>

<p>Even more minor, the styling after "November 2002 Peter Jennings", toward the bottom of the article, seems to be out of whack. 59.112.36.176 19:49, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Feel free to suggest an alternative punctuation approach. The article has tried to be fair-and-balanced, but it has not been easy. It has been a tug-of-edit-war from time to time, which is why it's currently locked. The hoax proponents would readily acknowledge that the <i>official story</i> is that NASA orbitted the moon in 1968 and landed men on the moon in 1969. Some (though not all) would take issue with one or both reported events. A small minority of the small minority who think NASA bent the truth, think we landed men but that something else was going on that they wanted to hide from us (like finding moon men, or a monolith, or a "Kilroy was here", or something). I don't know about the Jennings styling. It does read a little awkwardly. Presumably, the point was to cite the news report as a reference. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 20:06, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looking over the achieves, it appears both sides of this article are acting unprofessional. Also, because it's constantly the same group of people arguing with each other, it's very difficult for people to settle in an agreement with eachother.</p>
<p>Thus, from the my viewpoint as an random wikipedia user, maybe the best thing to do at this point is to simple start from scratch. I don't mean throwing out all the information that has already been gathered, but I mean bringing in new people and settling each point one by one. Here are some of the ideas I mean:</p>
<p>1) New editors</p>
<p>The people who are for NASA's version of events should elect one or more representatives. These representatives should be new to this article in that they have not edited it or partcipated in the disputes in the talk page. The current users on this side should no longer directly edit the article nor talk page, but can ask their representative(s) to act for them.</p>
<p>The same thing should apply to the people against NASA's version of events.</p>
<p>The goal of this is to remove the current angst between editors so that edits can be more constructive and more objective.</p>
<p>2) No edits to the content/nature of the article without a consensus on both parties</p>
<p>Hopefully with cooler heads and saner edits, a consensus can be reached. I don't want it to the extreme where one stuck up person opposes and nothing ever happens to the article. However, some kind of acknowledgement or confirmation from both sides is very powerful in cooling the sides down.</p>
<p>I know both side are going to have to make some sacrifices here.</p>
<p>3) Rework the article</p>
<p>Make a TODO list of things in the article that are disputed and keep it on the top of the talk page. Fix them one by one. Once they have been fixed, state so in the TODO list. This is so that some progress will actually happen. The purpose to state that it has been settled in the TODO list is so that the issue will not be brought up over and over again. Just because you want to argue over a detail again does not mean you should.</p>
<p>Just some side notes, I'm not really a wiki writer so please pardon my poor formatting. I'm just a wiki user. Also, I've tried to be as neutral as possible and I hope I didn't offend anyone. I want to see disputes go away and a consensus come about.</p>
<p>[edit]Oh yes, and everyone please read Wikipedia:Staying_cool_when_the_editing_gets_hot :P</p>

<li>Well, for one thing, it's my experiance that wikipedia's goal is not be a repository of all knowledge, but rather give a brief overview the get the reader started on the topic. Brief and consise. Unfortantely, this article reads much more like a argument from both sides with a lengthy list of citations, specific claims and counter arguments (everything is too verbose). Since it is not wikipedia's goal to prove a point, I suggest cutting out all the claims and counter claims and simply providing one or two links for each side of this debate. This is just a suggestion and I'm open to any thoughts or ideas on this.

<li><b>Nameless One:</b> Wahkeenah, may be playing with you a bit. The very issue you identify has been the subject of debate here for the entire month or so I've been participating and is in fact the thing that draws me to this article. By way of comprimise I've advocated taking the approach outlined in <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>, i.e. describing the theories, their histories, propronents and key facets in summary and relegating much of the overbearing back and forth details to separate, but thematically and hypertextually[sic] connected pages. However, efforts in that direction have been completely shut down by a POV jihadist who has taken tacit (and not so tacit) ownership of this page. If you're interested, I'd be willing to work on just an effort as has been described above when (if, I suppose) the edit proctection has been lifted. Till then I'd suggest you read the last couple archives particularly the various abortive straw polls and discussions on NPOV. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 20:03, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

Well, maybe you could list a link or two that present both arguments well. But if that's not enough, someone will want to list the arguments for the hoax <i>in the article</i>, to "clarify" matters, which will make the the page inherently biased, and then someone will have to list the counter-arguments, and there we'll be again.

<dd>Why would you list the counter-arguments? All you have to do is write that the overwhelming majority of Americans and scientists do not believe in the theories.

This page is for documenting the social phenomena that is the moon hoax. This is not a page to enforce a certain POV. That's why we have the Apollo pages.24.7.34.99 02:40, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Attenborough quote</span></h2>
<p>I'm probably missing something here, but how could the David Attenborough quote come from a BBC special celebrating 40 years since the landings, when that's in 2009? <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillyH_002d.html" title="User:BillyH">Billy</a><a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillyH_e850.html" title="User talk:BillyH">H</a> 23:23, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>BBC's 40th, not Apollo's. The comment is a bit ambiguous. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:57, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Makes sense...what year would that be, though? The BBC was founded in 1922, so it can't be 1962 (they celebrated their 50th in 1972), although in 1986 they celebrated 50 years of the television service. Does that make it 1976? <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillyH_002d.html" title="User:BillyH">Billy</a><a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillyH_e850.html" title="User talk:BillyH">H</a> 00:06, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was afraid you would ask that. The year of that special is not given, so presumably it's 1976 or so, but arguably it's an uncited reference that should be zapped... especially given the slightly peculiar stuff about a spare spacecraft, which was not true. I think that quote might have been posted by a hoaxster trying to prove something, and I think it has gotten watered down over time and editing. If someone could find a verifiable reference to it, it could be an interesting, if not necessarily useful, quotation. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:03, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Of course, you have no evidence that it is not true. The point of the quote is to show how prevalent it was in the public's mind that there NASA had other plans in case something went wrong. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 14:51, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Since no one can seem to come up with a specific date and time of when (or if) he actually said it, it could well be a phony "quote". That's one problem with it.

<li>Even though the section's philosophy is fundamentally sound, it sounds like editorializing.

<li>I think it is very important to the article.

<li>We've discussed this before. The scientific method is a universal principle. You don't need a source to state that a universal principal applies to a specific example. If you did, you wouldn't be able to state that Phil Platt is human, or even that <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> rules apply to this article, unless you found a source first.

<dd>Well, someone added most of the items in the first section, about USSR firsts, and the bit about how the USSR was ahead at one point. I added the response, about the US later having a lot of firsts in things that are important as far as going to the Moon. Later I added more "firsts" to both lists, and make wikilinks to the specific mission/rocket/spacecraft. According to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Kaysing_d34b.html" title="Bill Kaysing">Bill Kaysing</a>, one of his arguements was that the US didn't have the technology to do it, and this may relate to that.

<p>Yah. Thanks for that. I'll read the source more carefully and make a stab at editing it to reflect what is said. I'm combing through the claims and sources trying to get a handle on what's real and what not (as a first pass). There appears to have been some some broadly interpetive paraphrasing going on to suit the aims of whomever was was writing some of this stuff (Modelers up in arms about the missing LM documentation . . sheesh . . .) as well as some good old fashioned plagarism via lack of attribution.

<p>Yes, an excellent summary. I'm fairly certain it was a hoaxster that started that section about the Soviets supposedly being so far ahead of the U.S. Perhaps the section could be trimmed a bit in the interest of brevity. It would be interesting to see what the hoaxsters think of trimming it... or maybe even deleting it. The hoaxsters bring up these false interpretations and then yelp about it when the facts go against them... like when a lawyer opens the door in direct examination, and then sits and steams when the opposing lawyer takes advantage of that open door in cross-examination (you can learn a lot by watching <i><a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_%26_Order_27ea.html" title="Law &amp; Order">Law &amp; Order</a></i>). The bottom line on this topic is the hoaxsters' erroneous spin, based on old information, that the U.S. was desperate to catch the Russians. Based on more recent information, it is clear that it was the <i>Russians</i> who were the desperate ones... to try to stay ahead (or <i>appear</i> to stay ahead) of the aggressive yet measured, methodical development by the U.S., until reality caught up with the Russians and they threw in the towel. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:14, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That makes it a candidate for the point-counterpoint list, which it's already in, of course, as it's hoaxster Sibel who makes this charge, either misreading or lying about the facts of the case, as support for his "theory" that the U.S. just couldn't have done it, <i>because he doesn't see how they could have.</i> It's one of the backbones (pardon the irony) of the hoaxsters' credo. They decide how things "should have been" (or <i>not</i> been), and any fact that disagrees with their thesis, in their mind reflects on the fact rather than on their thesis (that's a point I would like to see included in the article, but I'm not sure how to do so without it being editorializing). In any case, I expect the list could be made more succinct, but I'm not quite sure how yet. Meanwhile, the hoaxsters seem to have disappeared. Maybe they're at a Kool-Aid retreat. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:24, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The list of Soviet firsts could be cut down to the original ones by Siebel. I added a few. Also, the Siebel lists incorrectly claims that when the USSR had two spacecraft in orbit at the same time that they had a rendezvous. Actually they were in separate orbits which passed about 5 kilometers from each other. Neither did anything to rendezvous, although the USSR claim it was one at the time. When <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemini_6.html" title="Gemini 6">Gemini 6</a> actually did a rendezvous, when they got that distance from Gemini 7, the ground jokingly told them that they had rendezvoused. This can be heard on the Project Gemini DVD. It must have been a fairly big issue at the time because in the press conference afterward, Wally Schirra gives a definition of rendezvous. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 03:34, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a good idea. To really bring home the point, you could do a side-by-side of similar accomplishments (which is a much more tedious construct, I realize), which would show how the U.S. started from behind and then surpassed Russia in various ways, thus implicitly undercutting Sibel's ignorance-based theories without having to come right and say it and be accused of editorializing. It could be mentioned briefly in this article and then routed to the new article. However, this might also go back to the "content forking" issue that you've brought up before. Maybe for the point-by-point stuff, though, it makes some sense. With the photographs, for example: there could be a separate page that goes into great depth about the alleged photo issues, with again just a brief point-counterpoint here for those who don't want to wade through the minutia. I'm not necessarily arguing that there <i>should</i> be... but there <i>could</i> be separate articles. It's vaguely like articles about prolific songwriters, where there are spinoff articles about albums and then, for some songs, additional spinoff articles (unless that's something they shouldn't be doing - that's another story). <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:57, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kudos. What do you think about separating out some of the other minute details into other articles? Is there an article about how all the photographics were done in Apollo, for example? All the info in this article is a pretty good start on that one. The hoaxsters gripe that the point-counterpoint is redundant because Apollo is already well-covered. But I don't know that the <i>specific areas</i> of Apollo that the hoaxsters grouse about are necessarily well-covered. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:25, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Pathological skepticism again</span></h3>
<p>Gravitor, the reason you can't see any evidence is that you don't understand what <i>evidence</i> is. You clearly have an emotional interest in believing that the landing never happened, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Gravitor" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Gravitor" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> but no justice system on earth ever required anyone to prove a case to the opposing party! Like this discussion, such a trial would never end. In this case, the public is the judge.</p>
<p>You're side has had no difficulty stating it's case. You've had web sites, books, this article, and even a show on FOX. The size of the <i>Apollo hoax in popular culture</i> section makes it clear that the general public is well aware that some people doubt the moon landing. Polls show that the public has heard your arguments, and doesn't buy them. The only exception are a few fringe elements who have reasons to hate science, America, rational thought, or whatever. Pulling dishonest tactics like denying the existence of 'verbal assault' or insisting that 'wired' is not a source will only dig you deeper into the hole you have dug for yourself, and make people less likely to listen to you about anything.</p>
<p>I've given the hoaxers plenty of fair chances to convince me of their case, and I have seen nothing but willful ignorance of science, rationalizations, and wild accusations from them, while NASA's version of events is a much better match with my personal experience of how the world works. That's why I believe.

<dd>There is no independent verification of the moon landing. That is a fact. Whether it was fake or not remains to be seen. NASA in 2009 will crash land into the moon.

<li>There is plenty of independent evidence: Amateur astronomers around the world could see the Apollo capsule in their telescopes and could NOT see it in earth orbit as the hoaxers claim it was. Moon rocks have been analyzed by thousands of people. They can reflect lasers from mirrors placed on the moon. Nasa has an untarnished reputation for honesty, even when the truth isn't kind, such as the challenger disaster. Compare this to hoaxers who routinely lie about basic science, like how photography or the Van Allen radiation belts work. Compare this to your own recent rant about how an unidentified box must be the rover, even though the rover tracks are visible, and the rover and box are visible together in the previous photo!</li>
