Anime version of Creed</div>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>Creed Diskenth in the Manga</dt>
</dl>
<p>Creed is the leader of the Apostles of the Stars, which seeks to make revolution, not only to overthrow Chronos, but change the world's leadership by "incompetent people". Back when Train was the XIII Chrono Number and Creed was an eraser, he admired him to the point of calling him "his partner", even though their relationship was far from close. Creed captured Rinslet to make Train meet with him at Lunafort Tower, in their first encounter after many years; he wants him to join the Apostles Of The Stars. Creed has a choker that looks like Train's, which reflects his recent and disturbing obsession with him. He borders on the insane, but Creed is at his most disturbing at times when we know what he says must be the truth. When Creed was young, he was abused by his mother. It's unknown in the manga if he kills his mother or not but he ends up on the streets. There he is abused by police as a way for them to release tension.</p>
<p>Creed also possesses enigmatic and frightening powers that stem from his manipulation of Chi through Tao, which manifest themselves in his 'Imagine Blade, which was originally called the Kotetsu', which varies between four levels through the story (Lv. 1, the blue transparent balde, Lv.2, the black blade with the shark-shaped demon-head, Lv.3, the latter with the possibility to extend and retract itself countless times, and Lv. Max, the strongest form where it's not exactly a blade, but a giant cutting mutant arm implanted into Creed). His ultimate ambition is to elevate his nanomachines in his body to a level where he would become immortal and rule the world forever. Creed's Tao Power is called "Sword". His Imagine Blade is shattered by Train in his final battle (When it is in Level Max), when Train ignores all warnings from Dr. Tearju not to use his Rail Gun more than three times a day not to destabilize his electric power (Which would prevent him from using his Rail Gun ability ever again), and charges all his power in Hades to fire the most powerful bolt of electricity he could, which not just breaks Creed's blade, but also depletes most of his Ki, allowing him to barely stand. Eve then uses her powers to remove the immortality nanomachines from Creed, to turn him back into a human. Creed then flees with Echidna to a quiet place. Due to the damage taken, Creed eventually has to use a wheelchair.</p>

Creed is just as dangerous and insane in the anime, but the plot doesn't show his Imagine Blade levels (Although we see its four forms). Creed is not finished by Train's Rail Gun, as it does not appear in the Anime, but by an Orichalcon bullet given to him Sephiria which he deflects off Sephiria's Christ breaking off the tip to prevent her from stabbing Creed while shattering his Imagine Blade. In Creed's childhood, it is much more understood that he murdered his mother. When his mother was furious, he came up to her and gave her a bouquet of flowers to cheer her up, but she refused them and took them up and slapped Creed hard on the face with them. After she finished, Creed had an evil glow in his eye and he killed her. Creed then became overcome with fear and ran away to avoid the police.</p>
<p>Creed undergoes a complete reversal of personality after Eve removes the nanomachines from him. His symbol becomes a white rose instead of a red one, and he makes one last appearance during the Eden incident, entering Eden when Mason is fighting Train and Sven, taking over the fight and allowing the two to proceed to save Eve. At the end of the show Creed is seen living peacefully in the country with Echidna.</p>

</div>
<dl>
<dt>Charden Flamberg in the Manga</dt>
</dl>
<p>Charden is recognizable by his sunglasses and silk top hat (though he is very attractive, almost effeminate, when not wearing them). He wields the power to control blood, including blood drawn from his enemies. Early in the manga, he fights Belze together with Kyoko, although the battle has no outcome due to the intervention of Shiki to bring both members back to the Apostles' helicopter. Later, he sees that Durham is killed after he is taken down by Train and Sven. He leaves the Apostles of the Stars, together with Kyoko, over an ideological split with Creed, as he considers Creed's bloodlust is blinding his original sense of justice that formed the Apostles of the Stars, but continues to battle Chronos. He meets Train and Sven later in the plot. In the last chapter of the series Charden is seen coughing up blood, implying that he is dying. Charden's Tao Power is called "Blood".</p>

Same as in the manga, except the battle against Belze does not take place, and his leaving of the Apostles takes place at a different time. He makes a reappearance near the end of the anime, though his trademark sunglasses and silk top hat are no longer worn as well as him keeping his hair tied back. He decides to aid Train and the group in the cause of stopping Eden, by fighting the Zero numbers at the end, while Train and Sven head for the upper levels to save Eve.</p>

<dt>Kyoko Kirisaki in the Manga</dt>
</dl>
<p>Kyōko is an energetic, bubbly high school student who has the ability to create and control fire. She is so carefree that she will kill the enemies of the Apostles without a second thought. Kyōko likes Train from their first meeting, and Train makes her promise not to kill people. She has a crush on Train, who doesn't return her feelings. She leaves the Apostles of the Stars with Charden so he won't be lonely. Kyōko's Tao Power is called "Heat". She also makes a cameo in To-LOVE-Ru (a new series Yabuki is the illustrator for).</p>

Kyōko's primary difference in the anime is that she was never shown to have killed anybody. Even when attacking soldiers with the rest of the Apostles, she seemed to deliberately avoid actually killing people. She was also never given the ultimatum to join the Chronos Numbers (which was a test by Sephiria).Her crush on Train still remains in the anime in which she usually tries to kiss him, only to be kissing a cat used as a shield by Train. She makes a reappearance alongside Charden to help Train near the final Eden plot.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Shiki in the Manga</dt>
</dl>
<p>Shiki was one of the members of the Tao clan whose ancestors survived the war against Chronos 25 years ago (He confesses Train in their battle that if he was old enough, he would have participated in the war, though). As a Master-Level Taoshi, Shiki manipulates his Chi (His - even though his gender can't be determined in the first volumes due to his garb, later on the story he reveals his identity). Shiki's main form of offense is through the use of insect summoning, and as such, his Tao Power is called "Insect". However, besides his insects, he masters the usage of ink seals, using them for manipulating his Ki in various ways, ranging from creating a seal sword to creating an energy blast.</p>

Shiki's backstory is not revealed in the anime. He also does not fight Train or show any kind of major role in the Apostles of The Stars, as he is part of the elite team summoned by Mason to put into motion the Eden project, although he is often seen using his insects to gather information for Creed. He fights Anubis, and later appears alongside with the Zero numbers inside Eden to stop the heroes.</p>

</div>

<dl>
<dt>In the Manga</dt>
</dl>
<p>Durham is an expert gunman who can channel his Chi through his precious revolver, allowing him to fire destructive balls of energy without regard to ammunition. His mask also contains a hidden gun in case of emergencies. He heads off to face Train in a part of the story in order to find Train to duel him. He finds and beats Annette and searches her computer for Train's home address, where he finds Eve, whom he beats. He writes a message to Train on the wall, with Eve's blood, for Train to meet him at a forest near the town they are currently in. He is killed by Creed for his selfish insolence, by challenging Train to a gun duel. Durham's Tao Power is called "Shot". His death triggers the exit of Charden and Kyoko from the Apostles of The Stars.</p>

<p>Maro is a Taoshi from the Forbidden Continent, being the only Apostle of The Stars who has actually seen Shiki's face before he lifts his mask. He is not a sumo wrestler, even though he might resemble one (In the anime he confesses that to Nizer while preparing a gravity attack to shoot him). He can use his ability, "Gravity" to crush whole squads of men, when his fearsome muscles do not suffice. He greatly resents being referred to as fat, as well as people laughing (including Train &amp; River) at his Forbidden Continent traditional garb, which resembles a sumo outfit.</p>

The Doc's Tao Power is called "Warp World," and it allows him to literally create an alternate world where everything he imagines becomes reality. He can also pull memories from the minds of those trapped in the Warp World, and bring those into reality as well. He has no relation with Dr. Tearju or the creation of Eve or Eden in the manga.</p>

The Doctor appears to be the same as in the manga. He never reattached Train's arm (since that scene never happened in the anime) nor did he capture or attempt to dissect Eve. However, he plays a major role in the Eden project, as he is the one who controls Adam's actions towards uniting Eve with Eden, by simply playing cue-ball. After talking to Dr. Tearju through his computer screen, where it is revealed he was the one who retrieved Eden's data that Dr. Tearju tried to destroy, he participates in the battle between the heroes and the Zero Numbers, where he transforms himself into a monster (although only his transformation is seen in one scene, circumstancially, and is never seen in full-body).</p>

<dt>In the Manga</dt>
</dl>
<p>Although Eathes is a monkey, he understands and speaks human language. He wears a pirate's hat, and can transform into a perfect copy of anything with which his soul has previously come into contact, a power that he uses to copy Tearju Lunatique to allow the Apostles of The Stars to use her knowledge, as he can copy both the body and the mind of whoever he copies through his power. Eathes' Tao Power is suggestively called "Copy".</p>

<p>Preta was a clergyman who murdered 16 people. The Apostles broke him out of jail and through the drinking of Shinkitou (The drink that may let someone gain a Tao Power or just die), gave him the Tao Power "Decay," which allows him to rot anything he touches. He is defeated by River with his "Sonic Fist" ability, which allows him to damage Preta without touching him, therefore not exposing himself to his corrosive power.</p>

He appeared very early on in the anime, and was captured by Saya, with a brief intervention from Train. He later re-appears again on Clarken Island, and Sven fights him in Deek's turn (As Deek does not appear in the Anime). As Preta is obsessed with Saya having captured him, Sven uses Eve as a bait (Using her transformation abilities to wear a yukata similar to Saya's one) to take Preta's clothes, that are anti-acid, and wrap them around his hands to make a kind of gloves that are impervious to Preta's corrrosive powers.</p>

<p>Deek wields the power to control ice. He can attack using shards of ice, create an ice barrier around his body or even freeze his enemies with his touch. He joined the Apostles after they helped him escape from prison, where he was sentenced for 120 years for murdering four girls in his freezer. He battles Sven after the sweepers get separated after the boat's explosion, and almost kills Sylphie by attacking her with an attack that gradually freezes her body, but Sven manages to defeat him before Sylphie's body is entirely consumed in ice, saving her.</p>

<dt>In the Manga</dt>
</dl>
<p>The Shooting Star Unit is a team of bodyguards assembled by Creed to support the activities of the Apostles of the Stars. Although they cannot use "Tao" powers like the other Apostles, they are highly trained in combat, and wear special armored suits that can even absorb the impact of a hand grenade. They were used in the Apostles' attack on the World Congress, and a group of six of them supported Echidna and Eathes in their attack on Dr. Tearju Lunatique's residence.</p>
<dl>
<dt>In the Anime</dt>
</dl>
<p>Although they do appear in the anime, they are mostly cannon fodder. It is not known if they actually possess special armor, as everyone that fights them has weapons or abilities that allow them to damage them regardless of their kind of armor (Chrono Numbers' weapons, River's Sonic Fist, for example).</p>
