<h2><span class="mw-headline">This article fails to address the key issue</span></h2>
<p>Update&#160;: I added the point that currently the only direct source of evidence for the lunar landings comes from those with access to the moon, given that telescopes cannot resolve the lunar landing sites (a point which I hope is generally accepted) and was snipped out of hand, first for lack of sources, and then on a sophism. I'll leave the subject alone now since I've learned what I came here to learn about wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardsenior_3ad0.html" title="User:Richardsenior">Richard</a> 15:39, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Scientifically, one cannot say with any degree of certainty that man has ever stepped foot on the moon. One might as well say that it's is obvious that unicorns exist, because the government claims it so, and has presented unicorn ivory and a photograph of 4 soldiers removing it from a dead unicorn. IMO this article riddled with pejoratives and dripping with sarcasm, doesn't belong on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardsenior_3ad0.html" title="User:Richardsenior">Richard</a> 16:44, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>You're wrong about the "degree of certainty". It has the same "degree of certainty" that we soft-landed a vehicle on Mars recently, which I'm guessing you <i>do</i> believe happened, because it happened in <i>your</i> lifetime. Every question the doubters have asked about the Apollo program has been answered and explained over and over again, and it's like trying to teach the Chinese alphabet to a tea leaf: It's beyond hopeless. FYI, unicorns probably <i>did</i> exist, just not in the form we think. However, your last comment, that the article does not belong in wikipedia, is <b>A BIG TEN-FOUR!!!</b> <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:53, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Both the lunar landings in 69 and the recent mars missions have to be taken on faith by me. My argument holds for both. I'm more inclined to believe the mars missions occured for many reasons the greatest of which is that they're not manned. But if I bet my life on it, I'd still be betting my life on faith alone. Your point about all quiestions being answered is therefore simply untrue. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardsenior_3ad0.html" title="User:Richardsenior">Richard</a> 14:13, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>You and your fellow doubters keep (understandably) evading the issue: What specific question(s), <i>not already explained</i>, do you have about the Apollo missions? As regards "faith", how do you know that <i>anything</i> you did not personally witness or live through is true? I argue that <i>any</i> historical fact of that nature requires "faith" on your part. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 14:31, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes this seems to be the tone used in the article. It's certainly not NPOV. It's not fit for Wikipedia. You've hit the nail on the head. How DO we know what is true and what is not? I personally think it has to do with Repeatability, Empiricism, Rationalism and Skepticism. The lunar landings of 69 have to be taken on faith alone. I'm sorry but that's all there is to it. This article doesn't address this point. It is JUST a vitriolic diatribe. To insinuate that people who refuse to take a thing on faith are somehow mentally deficient is positively medieval. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardsenior_3ad0.html" title="User:Richardsenior">Richard</a> 15:19, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Well, in that case no historic event can be proven, since none are repeatable - you are just being told that certain events took place and can accept it or not. That is a general problem with any thing in the past and doesn't apply in particular to the Apollo moon landings. Afterall, we could all be brains in vats and nothing might objectively exist. This is a rather pointless discussion so I won't be chiming in any further. Cheers --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilipO_a77c.html" title="User:PhilipO">PhilipO</a> 15:30, 20 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Roger that. The event called World War II, for example, also has to be taken on "faith". You can no more "prove" that World War II occurred than you can "prove" that the Apollo missions occurred. The only proof we have of <i>any</i> historical, i.e. non-repeatable event, are documents, photos, objects and eyewitness accounts. The space program has plenty of those. The doubters have <i>nothing</i>, except ignorant misinterpretations and ego-driven fantasies. These are guys who watch the "Matrix" movies (or "Capricorn I") and think they're documentaries. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:59, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not quite. Even though I've never jumped off a high building without a parachute, I'm not likely to do this because empiricism, rationality and repeatability indicate that this action would be unwise. Not all historical events are taken on faith alone, many can be verified by at least a few of the pillars of scientific method. Where I'm asked by strangers to believe anything on faith alone, I'll be skeptical. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardsenior_3ad0.html" title="User:Richardsenior">Richard</a> 15:54, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, yeh? Fine. Let's say I refuse to accept on faith that World War II happened. How would you prove it to me? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:03, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I could use scientific methods common in Archaeology for instance. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardsenior_3ad0.html" title="User:Richardsenior">Richard</a> 16:07, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Such as what? And how would I know you weren't faking the evidence to try to prove your point? As a parallel example, a Christian fundamentalist, a guy with a college degree, in fact, once told me in all apparent seriousness that dinosaur bones might have been put in the ground by Satan to deceive us into thinking that evolution was real. That is exactly the mentality that has been demonstrated by the Apollo accusers. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:33, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree with Wahkeenah 100%. There is no REASON to believe that the moon landing is false. There is tons of evidence that it happened. If one wants to claim that this evidence is flawed, then one must give reasons why. If those reasons are invalid, then back to square one: prove that it is false. --Kmclaughlin 01:04, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Confusing paragraph. There are lots of methods use in Archaeology, Radio carbon dating for example. None of which are useful if you can't actually stand on the planet you're investigating. Your first point is a non-sequitur&#160;: The aim isn't for me to proove anything to you. Empiricism is about carrying out your own investigation. And your last point seems more typical of people who accept the lunar landings on faith alone than of people who do not? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardsenior_3ad0.html" title="User:Richardsenior">Richard</a> 16:59, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Just to put this back in context. My argument is that there is no way that one can prove that man landed on the moon in 69. You cannot investigate directly, and you cannot even investigate remotely, therefore it has to be taken on faith. Someone then suggested that all historical events have to be taken on faith, but this is not true. Historical events on earth are regularly investigated using Archaeology, Forensics and other branches of modern science, because it IS possible to investigate directly historical events on the earth.</dd>

<dd>Then there is no way anyone can "prove" <i>to your satisfaction</i> that <i>any</i> event off the earth has happened, such as the recent Mars landings which could just as easily have been video coming from the Mojave Desert. And your argument about scientific techniques for events on earth also requires "faith" that they are being used honestly and correctly and that they are demonstrably valid... which many creationist religionists (probably a lot more than the famous 6 percent) dispute vigorously and have tried to legislate against. I say again (and again and again) that the Apollo program was part of a <i>still-ongoing evolution</i> of space exploration; that there is plenty of evidence that it both <i>could have</i> happened and <i>did</i> happen; that there is <i>no</i> evidence that it didn't happen, i.e. that the accusers' challenges to the evidence does not stand up to scrutiny; and that the accusers began pushing this stuff after it was "safe", i.e. after we were no longer flying to the moon. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 10:13, 21 October 2005 (UTC) P.S.

<dd>The article fails to address the point that it is not currently possible to empiracally prove the lunar landings occured, and that therefore all discussion on the point is moot. Were we discussing <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_11.html" title="Apollo 11">This Article</a> I wouldn't complain about tacit acceptance of the landings, but this article takes the position that the landings are unequivocable and this is empirically impossible to say. Therefore this article is not fit for wikipedia. The article should read something like&#160;: Some people believe that man has never landed on the moon, and while it is empirically impossible to make a judgement, the vast majority of people disagree with this position.

<dd>I'm not avoiding it, it's just not what we're discussing. But the same applies to that misison, I cannot proove either way whether or not man has landed something on Mars.

<dd>That's a good one!&#160;:) I see you had to revert a second occurrence of that "waving flag" nonsense. That little episode is a microcosm of why trying to debate this issue is akin to spitting into the wind. No matter how many times you explain it, they ask the same questions again. By the way, Christian fundamentalists are also quick to point out that carbon-14 is unreliable because of its plus-or-minus uncertainty factor which becomes larger the farther back you go, and is thus also a tool of the anti-Christian secular-humanist conspiracists who assert that the earth is over 5,000 years old or whatever. And the user above has inadvertently raised a related issue. He doesn't have to prove anything to me, and the people who ran the Apollo program don't have to prove anything to him, either. It is the accusers who claim that this did not happen, so as with any court of law, the burden of proof is on <i>them</i>. It is they who must prove something contrary to accepted history, and they cannot, because they have no contrary evidence. But they do have their "faith" or "belief" that Apollo was a humbug, and that's all they need to keep harping on the same already-addressed issues, over and over again. Now, let me surprise you with something: I would be <i>very willing</i> to consider the possibility the moon landings were fake, <i>if you had anything</i>. I watched that show in 2001. The accusers <i>have nothing!</i> <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:32, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Does Area 51 hold any importance with this issue?</span></h2>
<p>I remember seeing some documentary talking about Area 51,stating that this is the area where the supposedely hoax landing was filmed.I'm not an American,and so I'm not aware at all about Area51,I know that even for an American it would be tough to get info on it,but the media there must have stories on it,I would appreciate it if someone would put some info on it here.I've seen many videos on the issue of hoax landing,and all of them are biased towards one side or another.Whenever I see one I'm totally convinced that one side is right.I think people should really make unbiased reports and documentaries.Just an intresting fact,just look at the image "As11-40-5886",Neil Amstrong is in a shadow region and yet you can clearly see him!!And to this even the explanation of various sources of lights is not valid.And also,somebody conveniently deleted some facts i wrote on the page.</p>

<p>During the Apollo program, there were several near-misses between the astronauts walking on the surface of the Moon and a deadly solar storm event. The Apollo 12 astronauts walked on the Moon only a few short weeks after a major solar proton flare would have bathed the astronauts in a 100 rem blast of radiation. Another major flare that occurred half way between the Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 moonwalks would have had a much more deadly outcome had it arrived while astronauts were outside their spacecraft playing golf. Within a few minutes, the astronauts would have been killed on the spot with an incredible 7000 rem blast of radiation.</p>

<dd>Oh, one more thing. The word "theory" is often used by lay persons as a derogatory way to dismiss well-established theories like evolution, saying that it is "only a theory". This is probably what you are thinking about and why you object to the use of "conspiracy theory". But the term "theory" <i>does not</i> have the meaning most people ascribe! Should we not use that term as well? "Conspiracy theory" is a widely used term for this type of thing - there was even a movie by that name which was sympathetic to at least one conspiracy being true. --mav</dd>

<p>You're right - the word 'theory' is used to point out that it is difficult to prove beyond all doubt the factual basis of a claim, and is sometimes used as a weak form of the usage of 'conspiracy theory'. Nevertheless 'theory' has an accepted technical usage, 'conspiracy theory' has no usage outside of POV judgements. There is a great difference between saying that evolution is 'only a theory' (that it has not been proven beyond all doubt) and saying that 'evolution is a conspiracy theory' ("in my opinion, only a crackpot would believe it"). I'd really like to ask you to stop simply reverting other people's attempts to reach constructive compromise on this, and try to justify the use of the word outside of judemental POV language<a href="../../../2/t/o/User%7E2toise.html" title="User:2toise">2toise</a> 22:39, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

Some so-called "conspiracy theories," at least as defended by some people, are essentially unfalsifiable because of their logical structure. Conspiracy theories usually take the form of uncircumcised existential statements, alleging the existence of some action or object without specifying the place or time at which it can be observed. Failure to observe the phenomenon can then always be the result of looking in the wrong place or looking at the wrong time. Conspiracy theorists defend their position by claiming that lying and other forms of fabrication are, in fact, a common tool of governments and other powerful players.</p>
<p>The Moon Landing Hoax clearly specify the place, people and actions that took place. Some looneys (excuse the pun) might deny the evidence, but the theory in itself would be falsifiable by finding the evidence of the landing on the moon, either by going back or by photographing it with a telescope. The Moon Landing Hoax Theory is not a conspiracy theory by Wikipedia's definition. <a href="../../../2/t/o/User%7E2toise.html" title="User:2toise">2toise</a> 16:00, 6 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd be inclined to call this page exactly what it is all about: 'The Apollo Moonlanding Hoax Conspiracy Hoax' - I see no need to be nice about this or express the "NPOV". Some issues aren't neutral and can be scientifically analyzed. This is one of them. The hoax conspiracy claims are outrageous and we shouldn't treat it with kid gloves. The hoaxers make claims, we can examine them with the light of reason and science. Fair and unbiased treatment does not have to remain "neutral". <a href="../../../j/s/c/User%7EJscotti_c140.html" title="User:Jscotti">jim</a> 07:05, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

What you fail to realise is that in some countries a movie or photograph is not admissable as evidence. The majority who beleived this incident beleived that the film was admissale for their judgement. You also fail to consider that unless the Wikipedia should be dubbed Wiki-"Anglo_centric views" that the majority of the world does not beleive in the moon landing and never did. Perpetuating a lie such as the moon landing is a dangerous thing and even the Encyclopedia Britanica attempts to appease for the moment both beleivers and non beleivers by a very sublime and almost generic writeup under the title Apollo program. It allowed them to talk about the program without mentioning anyone landing on the moon. However, Neil Armstrong gets a write up about landing on the moon. I suggest someone invent a way to burn E-Text.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Kubrik connection</span></h2>
<p>It is alleged that in early 1968 (while 2001 was in post production) NASA secretly approached Kubrick to direct the first three moon landings. He initially said he was not interested, but, apparently, NASA convinced him using a combination of carrot and stick; exclusive access to the alien artifacts and autopsy footage from the Roswell crash site, and threats to publicly reveal Raul's (Kubrick's younger brother) links with the American Communist Party.</p>
<p>Kubrick is alleged to have spent sixteen months working on the project with a special effects team led by Douglas Trumbull on a sound stage in Huntsville, Alabama, with the Apollo 11 missionbeing staged in July of 1969.</p>
<p>Allegedly a Saturn V rocket was launched into low Earth orbit with astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins remaining there while Kubrick's footage of the 'landing' was released to the press. The return to Earth and splashdown were, of course, real.</p>
<p>Several months later, the Apollo 12 mission was successfully staged in a similar manner.</p>
<p>Randall Cunningham was later recruited to direct a 'failed mission' - Apollo 13.<a href="../../../2/t/o/User%7E2toise.html" title="User:2toise">2toise</a> 12:24, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>In my pokings around on the net reading up on the Apollo program I found a document from the mid-1990s that argued the "Kubrick connection". It was a very, very deadpan gag, with such subtle bits as claiming that Kubrick was into celestial mechanics and space navigation as a hobby, and that the Moon landings ended up being shot "on location". The gags were so subtle they could go right by you -- they did the first time I read it -- and it is said this item is the source of the Kubrick myth.</p>

<li>Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee (Apollo 1 fire) (outspoken criticism of the Space Program)</li>
<li>X-15 pilot Mike Adams (the only X-15 pilot killed during the X-15 flight test program - not a NASA astronaut but had flown X-15 above 50 miles (technically he could be considered an astronaut along with a number of the other X-15 pilots).</li>
<li>Robert Lawrence, scheduled to be an Air Force Manned Orbiting Laboratory pilot who died in a jet crash shortly after reporting for duty to that program.</li>
<li>NASA worker Thomas Baron was a murder and a coverup of a 500 page report on the Apollo 1 accident.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Some facts: Freeman ran into a flock of geese while trying to land at an airport near Houston. (Possibly the geese were working for the conspiracy.) He tried to eject but he was too low, and "zero-zero" ejection seats weren't standard gear in those days.</p>
<p>Elliot See and Charlie Bassett tried to land at the airfield near the McDonnell plant in very foul weather. They were going there to get Gemini simulator time, along with Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan in another T-38. Stafford was leery about going in and banked off, only to be surprised when See, piloting the other T-38, broke away and went straight in.</p>
<p>Deke Slayton judged See at the bottom rank for flight skills; See blew the approach, throttled up to lift off for another go-round, and clipped the building where the Geminis were being put together. The T-38 flipped into the parking lot. There were over a dozen injuries to innocent bystanders, fortunately all of them minor. The T-38 might well have gone square into the building, spreading carnage and, incidentally, destroying the Gemini capsules being built there.</p>
<p>CC Williams augured in near Tallahasee in a brand-new T-38; he ejected too late. This the only one of these three incidents that could be regarded as suspicious, since the T-38 left little but a crater and metal scraps -- it hit at high speed -- and the cause was never determined. It was judged likely to be a manufacturing glitch. greg goebel</p>

<li>These deaths only appear suspicious to the conspiracy theorists. It's parallel to those who claimed there were a lot of suspiciously "early" deaths of those in some way connected to the JFK assassination, without any reference to actuarial tables of the population in general to see if there was any statistical significance, because that might have undercut their hypothesis. Test pilots die all the time. Someone should study the stats for deaths of test pilots <i>in general</i> and see if there is any statistical significance compared with those connected with the space program. By the way, everyone involved in the Lincoln assassination is now dead.

<li>This qualitative judgment about deaths being suspicious also reminds me of the so-called "Intelligent Design" hypothesis, which is based solely on the premise that evolution "couldn't have happened by accident".

<p>OK, I did some brief research on this, and it seems that the last serious effort was in 1999 with a Gallup poll which said that in 1999 about 6% of Americans believed the landings were faked. While this is small, it is also a significant number of people. We should be careful about bringing the number of people who believe in a theory aggressively into the first paragraph of an article, especially unless we want to treat all minority beliefs the same way (for example, see recent Gallup polls on evolution).<a href="../../../2/t/o/User%7E2toise.html" title="User:2toise">2toise</a> 12:32, 8 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh please. Evolution and this crackpot idea are not comparable. Evolution is a scientific theory that is held to be true beyond a reasonable doubt by scientists and has the evidence to support that claim.

<p>You can state that as often as you like, but how are they qualitatively different? What kind of falsifiable predictions does evolution produce that are any less flimsy than the moon landing?

<dd>The moon hoax idea is <i>not</i> a theory! Evolution has been proved to exist in microbes, unequivocally.

<dd>Well, I guess the comparison was an uncomfortable one, since the moon hoax is a social science theory, or a thoeory of human behaviour, and so scientific method is less easy to apply rigorously (you can't easily perform experiments on human history) but I doubt that you are really suggesting that the fields of social science and political science really don't generate theories because they can't perform experiments on their subjects?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In fact (althought I am sure you can find some moon hoax proponents who don't) the moon hoax theory does use scietific method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observations have been made about many aspects of the moon landings that throw doubt on the conventional hypothesis that NASA built a fantastically complex space program and flew people to the moon on multiple occasions over a number of years.</li>
<li>A new hypothesis was generated; that in fact, it was not necessary to invoke a complex space program to explain the current facts, and indeed, the current evidence could be explained <i>better</i> by the hypothesis that NASA faked the landings. This hypothesis could explain all the current evidence, and the evidence that is problematic for the old hypothesis.</li>
<li>Test:
<ul>
<li>Predict: The logical consequences of this predict, for example, that there should be no lander debris or footprints on the moon.</li>
<li>Experiment: This experiment has not yet been carried out, one can only speculate as to why, but the ESA has promised to use its VLT for this at some point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclude: Because this experiment has yet to be carried out, we can neither accept or refute the hypothesis at this stage (unless, of course, we have already made up our minds, and are so committed to the status quo hypothesis that we are unable to accept a new one, a common enough fault in scientists).</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but there is a major flaw in your reasoning; if the result of that experiment does not conform to the moon hoax conspiracy theorists' beliefs then they will undoubtably not accept those data as valid and will in fact say that that is part of the conspiracy. They have already done the same thing with the moon photos, moon rocks and moon reflectors. You <i>cannot</i> pretend to accept the scientific method when you only accept experimental results that conform to your pre-conceived notions.

<dd>The assertion that it's easy to get 6 percent of the people to say that something is "possible" is highly important.

He remarked, "I don't know for sure what that says, but it says <i>something</i>!" It also reminds me of a time when Garrison Keillor, ridiculing polls of that type, pointed out one that said a significant percent of the public conceded that they would "consider" eating squirrel. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:04, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I suggest that this encyclopaedia reform its content towards a propagation of truths rather than perpetuation of lies. So this is my resolution:</p>

<p>Ommit all references to a moon landing. Talk about Appollo Program, Talk about the astronauts but never mention in any way that there was such a thing as a moon landing or even space travel.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Soviet Union: no friend of America</span></h2>
<p>Barely mentioned at all is (for me) the best counter-argument to the hoax theory is: "Why didn't the Soviets even suggest it was faked?"</p>
<p>The Soviet Union had some of the greatest scientists in the world, and a space programme of its own including robotic landings on the moon. They had no interest in protecting America's propaganda coup, so why on earth didn't the Soviets disprove the moon landings?</p>
<p>They had the technology, they had the expertise, they had no motivation to lie about the moon landings. If they'd had the slightest bit of evidence the landings were faked, you can bet they'd have announced it very very loudly. Yet we didn't hear a thing about faked landings from the USSR, ever.</p>
<p>Why isn't more made of the silence from the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>Many conspiracy theories are based more on motives than proof (e.g. "The mafia must have killed Kennedy because he cracked down on them" etc), but this is one case where the motives are irrefutably against the conspiracy theory. It's almost impossible to imagine any rational motivation why the USSR would conspire with the USA to deceive the world into thinking America got to the moon first.</p>
<p><br />
Agreed -- this argument was brought forward in an edition of the Skeptical Inquirer one or two years ago, and is -- in my opinion -- the single best argument to shut up most arguments on the topic -- unless you are dealing with a hard-core conspiracy theorist who believes the Soviets were in on the hoax (don't ask, they do exist!)</p>

<p><br />
I also agree. If the moon landings were fake, one of two things would have happened. 1. The Soviets would reveal the faked landings. 2. The Soviets would go along with the fake U.S. landings, in exchange for the U.S. not debunking their own *landings* (which would be fake too, of course). Since the Soviets never claimed to land on the moon, and since they never claimed the U.S. faked their landings, I would say that's evidence enough. There's no way the world superpower that was the Soviet Union would not discover this *hoax*, especially when you consider it was *discovered* by 30-year-old virgins living in their parent's basement.</p>

<p>The page doesn't mention one very common reason people believe it may have been a hoax: that we never went back. It's a valid point. Doesn't make much sense to me that we had spacecrafts going back and forth the moon in the early 70's - almost in a trivial fashion, when technology was primitive compared to today. Yet today in 2005, it seems very difficult to get anything in orbit (space sail, chalenger, you-name-your-disaster) - not to mention the prohibitive cost. I think it would be good to include this theory in the page. <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdidas_c7b4.html" title="User:Adidas">Adidas</a> 11:48, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not difficult to get things in orbit, it's done all the time. Granted it's expensive. The ones who raise the question "Why don't we go back?" obviously weren't around at the time. The explanation is simple: <i>There was no reason to.</i> And definitely no funding. Once we did the very first moon landing, i.e. "proving we could do it", public interest dropped like a rock. In fact, there was much public skepticism during the 1960s... not whether it could be done, but the simple question "WHY? Why spend the money?" As <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Lehrer_f6ba.html" title="Tom Lehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> said in his comments about Werher von Braun in 1965, "What is it that will make it possible to spend billions of dollars of your money to put some clown on the moon? Good old American know-how!" Lehrer's ridiculing of the space program reflected the opinion of a sizable number of Americans. There was no discernible gain from it other than national pride and advancement of pure science. It soon became clear that there was nothing on the moon that was of any practical use to us. As soon as the shuttle was proposed, doing something that was conceived as actually being practical and useful, the Apollo program was history. The final 3 or 4 Apollo missions were scrapped, and NASA focused totally on the theoretically lower-risk/higher-gain projects connected with the shuttle. And with the invention of robotics and such, "trips" to Mars are routine. So why aren't these skeptics questioning whether we are actually putting robots on Mars today? My guess is that it's because they are alive while it's happening, so they don't question it. They only question things they weren't a part of in some way. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 29 June 2005 18:43 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Going Back: Proposition</span></h2>
<p>Today, a brilliant thought occured to me when I watched the Space Shuttle take off again after a two years' interval.</p>
<p>Now that the Bush administration and NASA have expressed their desire to go back to the moon, and since this is not possible with the Space Shuttle, which today finally, after a lot of problems and huge investments, is able to only put itself into earth orbit again, here's the following proposition: dump the entire ramshackle Shuttle program, get out the old drawings and technique from more than 35 years ago, forget progress and modern computing, and just exactly rebuild the whole Apollo program. It will save huge research and development costs and guarantee that before this decade is over we have people on the moon again.</p>
<p>Apollo had a success-rate of more than 85% and took us to the moon and back. And that with the technique of more than 35 years ago. Compared to this, the Space Shuttle, with all its modern technical achievements, is a lame vehicle. It cannot take us beyond earth orbit and it cannot take us more safely back to earth.</p>
<p>In short, if everything went so brilliantly during those marvellous early seventies: drop that lame Shuttle and bring back Apollo. Sometimes life can be so simple... <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnon2_85e5.html" title="User:Anon2">Anon2</a> 19:38, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You might be onto something. The only thing lacking in your argument is a reason to go there... the very same question that ultimately truncated the Apollo program once we had landed there a few times and had only a few rocks and nice photos to show for it. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:04, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with that plan is that you just can't fire up the production lines and be off again. For starters the production lines no longer exist.

Keep in mind that these claims surfaced in the wake of the 1960s assassinations, Vietnam War and Watergate, so there was a lot of distrust of the government (unlike now - ha!) and it definitely appeals to a certain type of mind... the kind that is always trying to find hidden meanings in things, or different realities. In fact, it's similar to what was going on at the time, of going over every scrap of evidence about the JFK assassination, trying to figure out who "really" did it (the government, of course!) and denying the obvious. Someone cooked up this idea, based largely on ignorance, and it took on a life of its own. It falls into the same category as stuff like ancient astronauts, bigfoot, the Bermuda triangle... taking a few observations, leaving out obvious contradictions and logical explanations of those observations, and weaving an alternate reality. It's like starting a new religion or some such. It's basically anti-scientific. And it's no accident that believers in these alternate realities are often Luddites. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:36, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Neutral Point Of View</span></h2>
<p>It has been asserted that the policy of Neutral Point Of View is “absolute and non-negotiable”. This article is in contravention to that policy in a number of respects. Firstly it places the Apollo Moon Landing Hoax Accusations in a category of ‘cranky conspiracy theories’. This has the effect of discouraging a fair consideration of the arguments of those who have analysed the data and concluded that Apollo 11 and subsequent manned missions to the moon cannot have taken place. The author(s) asserts that “Nearly all interested scientists have rejected the claim, considering it to be baseless. In short they consider this claim (that the moon landings did not occur) to be the actual hoax.” If by ‘interested scientists’ the author(s) refers to the vested interests of those who seek to discourage a fair and impartial evaluation of the data, the statement is accurate, but if, as one assumes, ‘interested scientists’ refers to members of the scientific community who take an interest in this matter, then the author’s claims are pure rhetoric and propaganda designed to support his or her own partially veiled views. There are, in fact, many highly trained scientists among those people who question the reality of the Apollo missions as well as experts in photography, filmmaking and, dare one say it, ordinary laypersons of average intelligence. The general problem is that the emotional and psychological investment that the average American citizen has in the reality of the Moon landings and the prospect for America’s loss of dignity and self-confidence should the hoax accusations be found to be true dissuades objective and impartial analysis. However, the facts remain and will not go away. The most elementary truth which stands behind the video and photographic anomalies, the silence of the astronauts etc - and not mentioned in this article - is that any serious rocket scientist knows that the performance specifications of the Saturn V rocket are utterly incommensurable with the proposed journey of 480 000 miles which it is supposed to have journeyed to and from the moon. The figures simply do not add up. One does not need a PhD to do these simple calculations. Any American schoolboy can work it out for himself. But rather like the people in Hans Christian Anderson’s story ‘The Emperor’s New Clothes’ we are terrified to speak what is so clearly obvious to our own eyes and our own minds. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELangdell_f9fb.html" title="User:Langdell">User:Langdell</a></p>

<dd>I'm guessing you weren't around at the time. You probably question the Nazi Holocaust as well. The stark reality is that every one of the claims of the conspiracy buffs has been explained by people who actually know something about the facts. The characters who cooked up this conspiracy theory were post-Watergate paranoids and looneys. The "Intelligent Design" hypothesis has more credibility than than the "We never went to the Moon" hypothesis... which is to say, less than none.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV issues</span></h2>
<p>I do not have a view about whether there are POV problems with this article, but it is disruptive of Wikipedia to just remove POV flags without addressing any problems the person who placed it may have. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 23:37, 2005 September 3 (UTC)</p>
<p>The original POV flag was posted by an anonymous (for obvious reasons) user who thinks the article is too tilted towards characterizing the conspiracists as crackpots. If you read the words of guys like Bill Kaysing, it is clear that they <i>are</i> crackpots. There is not one shred of evidence that the Apollo missions were fraudulent. All the conspiracy theorists have is the fertile imagination of Bill Kaysing and others like him, coupled with a broad-based ignorance of subjects like rocket science, astronomy and photography. The mere presence of this article in this so-called "encyclopedia" demeans the latter's credibility considerably. Not that there's anything unusual about that. The fact that anons are allowed to put whatever they feel like on these pages makes this so-called "encyclopedia" nothing more than a pretentious bulletin board system. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:06, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If we look at the article on <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> (an article somewhat similar to the Apollo hoax), we see statements such as:
<dl>
<dd>"Critics have been outspoken in denouncing those who espouse such views of Holocaust history as falsifiers of the historical record."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And there are no POV notices on that article. And as Wahkeenah said, the POV notice was added by someone who very clearly states their POV, which would suggest they would want <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Apollo_b4b9.html" title="Project Apollo">Project Apollo</a> to begin "Project Apollo was the alleged series of human spaceflight…". <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Monkey_6b08.html" title="User:Evil Monkey">Evil Monkey</a>∴<a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvil_Monkey_65b0.html" title="User talk:Evil Monkey">Hello</a> 00:29, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There you go. In fact, I think I will remove the POV flag and see if Ann objects. Here's the logic these conspiracists use, which, if you look closely, is the same kind of logic that scriptural literalists use, and that's why I argue that conspiracy theorism has a religious quality (pardon the expression) about it. That is, they start with a premise that they consider absolute, and anything that contradicts it must therefore be false, even if it appears to be true. Here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The government is lying to us.</li>
<li>I have a question about something the government has said.</li>
<li>An expert on a subject has answered my question.</li>
<li>The expert's answer supports the government's position.</li>
<li>That means the "expert" is either a dupe or an active part of the conspiracy, because...</li>
<li>...the government is lying to us.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Philosophy 101, that was called "circular reasoning": A is true because A is true. Of course, I learned that at a public university, so that simple definition must be part of the conspiracy also. &gt;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:29, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Holocaust denialists are typically Jew-haters and Hitler supporters. So while they deny that the Holocaust happened, they also approve of it. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:24, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Intering how you use Ad hominem attacks against people with questions. I think stalin and hilter were found users of that type logic. Funny how you turn into your worst enemy over time Look at Israel and the U.S. today for a great example. Talk about historical revisionism some people still call Native Americans, Indians, Which is a lie they are not from the west indies they are more american than americans. Sometimes you got to look back and find the truth for your self. Do not get me start on zionism right now I get more angry the more I read about it. Just because you got hurt in the past does not give you the right to hurt people and take thier land the have had for generations. The new Isreal could have been formed anywhere but zionist must have it their way sorry history will expose the truth.--24.206.193.170 03:55, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The point is that the questions have demonstrable answers which the questioners won't accept because the answers go against their premise. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 05:17, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>How do you hit something you can see with a beem of light. Those mirrors being put on the moon by anything seem strange seeing the the whole moon is a reflective surface not only that but radio ranging is easier and cheeper ham radio operators hit the moon all the time they use it to get radio waves over the horizon. The mirror thing sounds like some thing you would to get average person to shut up because the average person does not the equipment to see if they are there or not. The goverment thing is what gets me they sould have sent scientists from differnt countries not U.S. Airforce flyboys who typical have to be able to keep secrets because of their job. I think It would have at least made it look more legit and less like a U.S. pride thing.--24.206.193.170 15:47, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your style is like the popes of old I have the bible the word of god from god what I say is word that goes a long way to making lasting converts. Then of course people actualy read the bible and see the facts and then reason maybe you have authority, maybe not. If not those people lose interest in you and what you have to say. Keep persucuting the unbelievers maybe thet will convert to your side after all it worked for the popes, for a while.--24.206.193.170 16:19, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's funny you're equating me with the Pope, given that I'm non-religious. The problem with your premise, aside from being in almost-unreadable English, is that it implicitly claims there is evidence that the Apollo flights did not occur, when, in fact, there is <i>no such evidence</i>. Every question the doubters have raised has been answered. The doubters won't accept the answers, because those answers disagree with the circular reasoning of their premise. There are also many people who believe the earth is flat, but that doesn't make it flat. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:38, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Religion - Western civilization historically has a religious basis. This past or present religious background of the people and countries that have led in space exploration has some similarity. Religion provides support for people personally but also binds people in other sectors for example in politics, entertainment, and media.

<dd>I am sorry but I cannot understand when you say I have added this information on Wikipedia before and it was removed. This is not a factual or accurate comment. Thus your opinion on that basis is also void. I will put some references to show the links between Western secret service agencies and Western religious bodies - this will show you as the possible link to the moon hoax. You would not have a NPOV if you reject these references that show that religion can also be a motive for the hoax.--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiencyc_1f60.html" title="User:Wikiencyc">Wikiencyc</a> 19:20, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the Article if you do a search on the CIA, there is mention of their involvement. Take this hypothetical example - you have a train station called 'the CIA,' on his station there is track (#1) called 'CIA involvement in moon hoax' - now in the external links you have mention in Mother Jones and Rick Ross, commonly known sources, mentioning "common agendas" between CIA, The Pentagon and religious bodies - Vatican and Opus Dei. So you have the track (#2) 'CIA, The Pentagon, Vatican, and Opus Dei.'</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please tell me why you cannot have both tracks (#1 and #2) on the CIA station? I am saying because both tracks are not only related to CIA but more importantly because of "common agendas" - anything can go into the agendas including the moon hoax because they are of "broad scope." You are implying by saying that these "common agendas" are of "narrow scope" and limiting and not extending to the moon hoax - this is not NPOV and is against the evidence seen in Mother Jones and Rick Ross.</dd>

<li>Oddly enough, as I recall from actually having lived through that era, fundamental religionists tended to <i>oppose</i> the Apollo program because of the Tower-of-Babel thing, i.e. that we were reaching into "God's domain" as it were. I recall one bumper sticker that said something like, "Moon Day is a sign of the coming Dooms Day".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My two cents on questioning of the apollo program</span></h2>
<p>I used to believe without doubt that that the U.S.A. landed on the moon. Now after reading both sides. The people that believe unquestioning that we landed on the moon seem like the crowd that would belive that a carpenter that walked the 2000 years ago is God. Not to say all of them are, but it just seems like you are blaspeming to say something is fishy about the apollo program. Why did the soviets just stop pursuing it and build a spacestation? Also, Why so many problems with the shuttle? Why will it take till 2018 to go back when technology today is superior? Why is it harder now, than go to the moon in the sixties and seventies?</p>
<p>Do not give me politcal or money reasons thier was almost the same lack of interest back then. Yes, There was hype but it was gone by the the third flight and a lot of people questioned the race in the first place, and do not forget that this was done during the upheavol and the economic times of the sixties and seventies.</p>
<p>The apollo program is just starting to sound to more and more people like the mythical thing it's named after. Because of that you will see more and more people question it like they question other unlikely things. Just like the the 2000 year old carpenter that is God. Don't forget a billion people still believe that the carpenter existed and is God without questioning a thing about it. I wish more people would ask questions like this one it will hopefuly bring the truth to a undeniable point.</p>
<p>BTW, If this seems out of place it is I just felt like trolling today. Oh, and I think this sould be theory, not accusations, and sorry for the poor grammar.</p>

Grissom doubted it at the time so much he put a lemon in the window of the capule to draw media attention to the problems of the program. The biggest critic dies on the pad after saying the he did not see how we will go to the moon on time. Amazing that he is one of the only three that died in the entire apollo program. Seems like he questioned it. Are you saying grissom was a nut as well--24.206.193.170 15:47, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Next thing you'll be saying is that Christa McAuliffe was killed because she threatened to expose that the shuttle flights were a hoax. Oh, but you don't think the shuttle flights were a hoax, do you, because you saw them happen, and therefore that makes them truer than something you were too young to have witnessed.

<p>Sorry about the above comment I did not try to wiki before I made it. Anyway this shows a problem in the the current program. Which nasa knew could happen but did nothing about it. I think scientific method will end the end prove one side or not. If we keep have difficulty and finding new hazzards to going back then it depite new and better technology. If we can't duplicate the the process then it is obivious that we did not go in the first place.</p>
<p>your ad hominem attacks keep holding you back man. I have not insulted your inteligence.</p>
<p>I'm not insulting your intelligence, I'm pointing out your apparent <i>education level</i>. If you're that poor with English, you probably don't know much about science or history either... which makes you a typical member of the doubters "community". I say again, there is plenty of evidence that the moon landings occurred, and none that they did not occur. Every question has been answered, but the doubters won't accept the answers because they can't own up to the fact that their circular reasoning is flawed. Besides, there is money to be made: books to sell, videos to make; and, ironically, a lack of public will to further fund the moon program is the reason the moon programs were cut short, and space-program funding was instead directed to the shuttle development program, since it seemed to have practical use while the moon program did not. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:01, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wakeenah...I came to this "discussion" page to find out why the Apollo moon "hoax" page was protected and was quite surprised at the uncalled-for viciousness with which you attack the point of view and questions set forth by other users. This portion of the discussion page is a good example. The user who started this portion of the discussion page was simply setting forth his view of the Apollo mission and you attack the user on a personal level. It is obvious that you feel passionately about the article, but there is no excuse for your personal attack of the user. Moreover, it certainly shows that you are not being very objective. In addition, your blanket statement (that those who question the veracity of the Apollo program are simply out to make a quick buck) is an unsupported and ridiculous assertion. The whole issue with this article, and the main line of discussion, appears to be whether the veiled and unveiled negative point of views should be scaled back or eliminated. If you are going to accept the requirements of wikipedia (that articles should be supported by independent citation to sources, and that there should only be a neutral point of view when writing articles) then the negativity and "loaded" statements in the article should be eliminated. The internet is a wide, and seemingly limitless, world of information and there is enough room outside Wikipedia to set forth points of view that are not slanted to either side of the debate. Even though most people may believe that the Apollo "hoax" theorists are crazy and delusional, the article should remain neutral. This article should be amended and edited heavily in order to conform to wikipedia standards and I would request that an independent and seasoned Wikipedia editor take a look at this page, remove all statements without a neutral point of view and then keep the page protected. User:Karel12345 <small>Edit actually by anonymous user at User: 67.125.141.198</small></p>
<p>The problem I have with the "neutrality" on this issue is that it legitimizes and dignifies a totally bogus claim. I recall watching the TV show in 2001 or so that talked about this. I was interested to see what they had. The answer is that they had <i>nothing</i>. I could tell right away that the "evidence" put forth by the accusers was thoroughly fraudelent, based on either willfull or ignorant misinterpretations. This hoax <i>does not deserve neutrality</i>. Every question they have raised has been answered, but <i>they won't accept the answers</i> due to their circular reasoning and, I suspect, their unwillingness to be real men and admit they were wrong. Hopefully this stupid issue will someday go the way of "cold fusion" and of the nonexistent Bermuda Triangle mystery, but I'm not so sure, as so many who have no idea what they are talking about keep asking the same already-answered questions over and over. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:04, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>Again, wikipedia is a forum for exchange of ideas and it is absolutely ridiculous to claim that the "hoax story" does not "deserve" neutrality. First of all Wahkeenah (see above), who are YOU to decide what stories deserve neutrality and which don't?!?! If the idea or issue is so outlandish then the evidence to support that should be set forth. Do I believe that the Apollo moon landings were a hoax?? No, I don't. However, the issue can be presented without reverting to character attacks and a skewed presentation of the issues. The way to approach this article is quite simple: (1) Present the ideas and "support" or "evidence" for the hoax ideas. Therafter, a person can simply insert their "two cents" and the evidence and support for their "two cents" in the article.</p>
<p>For example, the hoax theorists claim that the pictures allegedly taken on the moon are a hoax because they claim the radiation from Earth to the moon (and on the moon for certain periods of time) was too intense and the film would have melted or shriveled up. Ergo, the pictures could not have been taken on the moon. That is as "dry" and as neutral a way as the article can be presented. The rebuttal, or evidence in rebuttal should be presented in the same neutral and "dry" manner. Thus, in the article, the rebuttal should be presented as follows: "Claims of a hoax relating to the Apollo pictures have been denied as follows: Scientists have denied that the film would have been affected by the radiation because it was (1) well protected inside the moon cameras, and/or (2) the radiation levels were not high enough or intense enough to have affected the film as the hoax claimants allege."</p>
<p>DO YOU SEE!!!! That is the way that the article should read. Instead, people claiming to be scientists or science students have taken to drafting the article in a manner that displays a lack of neutrality that leaves a reader with a bad taste in their mouth. I for one, came to the article to look for the arguments for and against the claims of an Apollo hoax. Instead of coming away with a clear understanding of the issues, I felt as though certain contributors were desperately trying to deny the rumors with vitriolic edits and character attacks. Quite simply, that is what needs to be eliminated in the article. karelroc123</p>

<p>It is obvious from your nonsensical replies that you truly are an idiot Wahkeenah (and since this is the discussion page, I need not keep a neutral position on that subject). No point debating you on the issue of neutrality since you seem to have your own ridiculous opinions on the subject. If we applied your logic to every article in Wikipedia then we would have to rely on polls to decide which stories are credible and which ones are not. Again, I don't advocate that the Apollo moon landing hoax stories are true, but the way the whole issue is portrayed in the article is absolutely one sided and non-neutral. Your "Plan 9" argument is simply non-persuasive. ALL STORIES in Wikipedia deserve a neutral portrayal. karelroc123 2:29, October 13, 2005</p>
<p>I don't care what you call me, since I know I'm right. Is it your contention that every crackpot challenge to every proven fact is to be treated as though it's legitimate?

<p>It is claimed in the article that 'On the other hand the Apollo retroreflectors are more accurate and more precisely placed than the Lunokhod mirror.' Is there any evidence for this? Who claims it? If we can't reference it, we should remove it. Astronaught 14:05, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>By Occam's razor, the scientific and technological challenge of travel to and from the Moon may be thought to weigh in favour of the hoax, while the social and political challenge of containing the 'secret' (in a project at times involving 250,000 people) will weigh against.</li>

<dd>Actually, I think it is a perfectly valid entry in this artcile. I disagree with your view of NPOV in this article.

<p>I am disturbed by your assertion that there is no doubt about this event. There is clearly doubt, 6% of Americans say they have doubt about it, ten times more than say they believe in Buddhism.

I see no reason to bend over backwards recasting this article in language more favorable to those who believe the landing was a hoax. The moon landing is well-documented history. This is not a matter about which reasonable people disagree.

<p>I removed this unsourced editorializing. Obviously there are a range of beliefs on this. By each of these respective criteria, the Moon hoax accusation faces some heavy challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>By Occam's razor, an elaborate hoax and coverup involving the collusion and lying of thousands of individuals is less probable than the evidence (including materials, machines, designs, and lunar rock samples) being part and parcel to an actual event.</li>
<li>Many moon landing hoax enthusiasts are believers in other outside the mainstream conspiracy theories.</li>
<li>The evidence is available that falsifies the idea.</li>
<li>Depending on how 'high' the conspiracy is claimed to reach, a large number of disparate individuals around the world are required to be 'in on' the secret.</li>

<p>Beyonf whether <b>Joshuaschroeder</b> thinks they are or not, what are the criteria for refering to someone as a 'scientist' in this context? There is a danger that 'scientists' are people who agree with our POV, and 'cranks' are people who do not. Astronaught 19:43, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Generally speaking, a scientists is someone who is a member of the scientific community. This usually means they work in a technical aspect for a research group interested in scientific research. Getting an opinion of a scientist also means that they are giving a "scientific opinion", based on their own expertise in the area they study. Bill Wood, to my knowledge, does not satisfy these criteria. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 19:46, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem with this is that to be a member of the 'scientific community' limits what one can research. All you are saying is that all of the people who agree, agree. Astronaught 19:51, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
