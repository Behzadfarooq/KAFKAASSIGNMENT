<p>The way the introduction is written, it implies this creed does not appear "often" in, say, Catholic masses or the Lutheran litrugy. Is this correct? If it's peculiar to the Anglican communion, I wasn't aware of that. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 20:23, 5 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Years ago, it played a central part in my Lutheran catechism, which was I think at least based on Martin Luther's catechism. This was in an LCA (Lutheran Church of America) church in the Midwest of the United States. The Apostle's Creed was recited nearly every Sunday; it was on page 85 in the Lutheran Book of Worship. Occasionally our church would substitute the Nicene Creed. As far as the Catholic Mass goes, I think they normally, if not exclusively, use the Nicene Creed instead. Again I can't be very sure, but I think the Apostle's Creed is widely used in a number of different Protestant denominations, not just in the Lutheran and Anglican churches. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 04:14, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for replying, Wesley.&#160;:-) Is the sentence "The Apostles' Creed is widely used by a number of Protestant denominations for both services and theological education, most visibly by the Lutheran, Anglican, and Episcopalian churches" the right tone for this article? If not, how could it be improved? Obviously something needs to replace the current Anglican-centric sentence. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 15:47, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have tried to edit the page to make it way more NPOV. The opening paragraph contains a much more comprehensive list of ecclesial communities which make use of the creed and makes note of the common derivation of their tradition. All western liturgical denominations make persistent use of the creed as far as I know, because it is part of the ritual of Baptism. There is not reason to make this protestant-centric. A note has been placed under a section on liturgical use that Catholics use this creed specifically for liturgies with children. Also, canonical sources have been cited for the text of the creed and translations. The Latin text which appeared before my edit ommited <i>Credo in Spiritum...</i> on for no apparent reason, so it has been added. Also, the article previously implied that the plurality of the creed as expressed in the Mass is <i>the</i> Catholic version, which as evidenced by the Catechism, its not. The creed is expressed in the first person plural in the context of the liturgy only, presumably as an emphasis on community arising from the <i>spirit</i> of the Second Vatican Council. Note that the ICEL and Vox Clara are working on new liturgical translations now of the third typical edition of the Roman Missal (2000), and the last draft which was publicly available (was being the operative word in that phrase - in the interest of secrecy, all drafts are no longer available), the translators appear to have revereted to the singularity expressed in the Latin.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> explicitly addresses this issue (no. 167): <i>"I believe" (</i>Apostles' Creed<i>) is the faith of the Church professed personally by each believer, principally during Baptism. "We believe" (</i>Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed<i>) is the faith of the Church confessed by the bishops assembled in council or more generally by the liturgical assembly of believers. "I believe" is also the Church, our mother, responding to God by faith as she teaches us to say both "I believe" and "We believe".</i>--<a href="../../../m/m/3/User%7EMm35173_8826.html" title="User:Mm35173">Mm35173</a> 18:57, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The last paragraph indicates that the Nicene Creed was formulated *after* the Apostles' Creed. Isn't the truth the other way around? I was always under the impression that the Apostles' Creed was formulated sometime between AD 700 and 900.

<li><a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">User:Noitall</a>, your inclusion of the entire creed as used in Methodist churches is redundant. The only important difference is the exclusion of "he descended into hell". Please support the removal of redundant material.</li>
<li>What are your sources for writing: " It has been noted that had the Apostles' Creed been in existance prior to the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Nicea_d0cb.html" title="Council of Nicea">Council of Nicea</a>, the Council would likely have been unnecessary." This is not correct if what you mean is that it settles the Trinitarian doctrine, and orthodox Christology. There is nothing in the Apostles' Creed to which non-trinitarians could not apply, <b>except</b>, "I believe in ... the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints ...".

<dd>As you likely are aware, the <b>creeds were likely written in response to heresies</b>. It took a while for a hierarchy to emerge that could command other teachings (even Gnosticism) as heresy - and <b>parts seem to be about heresies later than Gnosticism - if it had been in place earlier, there'd have been more clarity of doctrine to preclude such heresies</b> &amp; there'd have been less disagreement over the Holy Ghost, the Trinity, the holy <i>catholic</i> church, the communion of saints, the virgin birth.

<dd>The earliest written version of the creed is perhaps the Interrogatory Creed of Hippolytus (ca. A.D. 215). The current form is first found in the writings of Caesarius of Arles (d 542).</dd>

<dd>It's also unclear whether it was a precursor to other creeds, a later simplification for children, or something that grew up alongside the others. The Nicene Creed is too complex for kids or those "just learning". Anyway, dating it - even as "likely" - is probably an inconclusive task.</dd>

<dd>What you write does not support what you are reading. Your quote speculates that if the Apostle's creed would have been in place earlier, in its modern form, it would have provided clarity against the Gnostic heresiesm. And, he speculates, perhaps it would have helped to give earlier clarity to some of the more divisive issues, including the Nicean controversy <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a> <a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn"><small>(Talk)</small></a> \</dd>

<dd>However, tt does not provide much clarity with regard to the issues of Nicea - centrally, the pre-existence of Christ, and subordinationist views of eternal generation. There is nothing remarkable about it in that regard; it simply repeats biblical material. An Arian could agree with it. That's what Jim is saying when you quote him, "it is, I suppose, compatible with <b>pre-Nicene</b> teachings". <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a> <a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn"><small>(Talk)</small></a> \</dd>

<dd>You make the simple so difficult. The Apostle's Creed is very similar to the Nicene Creed, but shorter. If the Apostle's Creed had been around and agreed to by all, there would have been no need to have the big meeting simply to come up the a slightly different Creed, the Nicene Creed. And you mistake my edit (again), the edit begins by stating it could be earlier, but it is more likely later (change the words "more likely" if you wish). Finally, sigh, I would never cite <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> as a source.

<dd>The two creeds deal with different issues. If the Apostles' Creed had preceded Nicea, it would have fit in rather unremarkably along with other views that were rejected by Nicea. Because the Apostles' Creed does not refute Arianism, it is not supportable, reasonable, or logical to assert that it "likely would have made Nicea unnecessary" if it had been written earlier.</dd>

<dd>For example, Christadelphians, an anti-Nicean group, says "The beliefs and practices of the Christadelphians can be traced from the New Testament to the earliest Christians of the 1st and 2nd Centuries in documents such as the Epistle of Clement, The Didache and <b>The Apostles' Creed</b>." They interpret the Apostles' creed in a unitarian, rather than a trinitarian fashion. This is an example of how unreasonable it is to state that the Apostles creed most likely would have made Nicea unnecessary (which is intended to exclude a non-trinitarian interpretation). <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a> <a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 05:13, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They got together to combat a whole range of heretical beliefs and practices, Arianism being only one of them. Maybe they would still have gotten together, but it would not have been such a big deal if they already had agreed to much of the fundamental beliefs. Hey, it's a reasonable hypothosis, not a conclusion.

<dd>I have tried earnestly to appeal to you. Let others judge whether I've been unreasonable. Your unlikely speculation, that Nicea might have been unnecessary if the Apostles Creed had been written earlier, does not belong. I have removed it. I have also removed the unnecessary duplication of the Creed as used in Methodism.

<p>In all this, we shouldn't forget that the Emperor called the Council of Nicaea, and the Great Council conceived its main charter to be, to say what the Church's belief <i>always had been</i>, not to come up with new doctrines, or even (although this inevitably happened) with new wordings for the old doctrines — one theory being that if the Church had the same doctrines in England and Persia and Africa and Greece, the only historically adequate explanation would be that those doctrines had come down from the Apostles. <a href="../../../f/r/j/User%7EFrjwoolley_64f8.html" title="User:Frjwoolley">Frjwoolley</a> 15:22, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I think Irenaeus put forth that theory, among others. One of the problems or tasks of the Nicene Council was to come up with a creed that said what the Church's belief had always been, but said it so explicitly that the Arians couldn't agree with it while redefining or reinterpreting its words. This is what the Arians did with all the Bible references that declare the Trinity, and the eternity of Jesus. So for the purpose of refuting the Arians conclusively, to the point that even the Arians would admit they couldn't endorse it, the Nicene Creed's explicit language was necessary; both the Bible alone and the Apostle's Creed were inadequate for this purpose. Noitall, I believe this is why Mkmcconn says that the Apostle's Creed would not have made the Council of Nicaea unnecessary.

<li>Contrary to what you say, the differences are extensive, to quote from the link that I provided, "Perhaps the most vital element of sound in poetry is rhythm. Often the rhythm of each line is arranged in a particular meter. Different types of meter played key roles in Classical, Early European, Eastern and Modern poetry. In the case of free verse, the rhythm of lines is often organised into looser units of cadence. Alliteration played a key role in structuring early Germanic and English forms of poetry (called alliterative verse), akin to the role of rhyme in later European poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry and the rhyme schemes of Modern European poetry alike both include meter as a key part of their structure, which determines when the listener expects instances of rhyme or alliteration to occur. In this sense, both alliteration and rhyme, when used in poetic structures, help to emphasise and define a rhythmic pattern. By contrast, the chief device of Biblical poetry in ancient Hebrew was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three; a verse form that lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance. In addition to the forms of rhyme, alliteration and rhythm that structure much poetry, sound plays a more subtle role in even free verse poetry in creating pleasing, varied patterns and emphasising or sometimes even illustrating semantic elements of the poem. Devices such as alliteration, assonance, consonance, dissonance and internal rhyme are among the ways poets use sound. Euphony refers to the <b>musical, flowing quality of words arranged in an aesthetically pleasing way</b>.</li>

<p>It's also worth noting that the Nicene Creed, so called, is more accurately known as the "Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed", since it is based on the formulations of both the First Nicene and First Constantinopolitan Councils. Although I Nicea was a signal victory against the Arians, the debate over the divinity of the Son continued and expanded into the debate over the divinity of the Holy Spirit, thus necessitating an additional council to help clear things up. An excellent book about the second ecumenical council is <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_of_Nazianzus_fc20.html" title="Gregory of Nazianzus">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>: An Intellectual Biography</i> by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Anthony_McGuckin_0e3a.html" title="John Anthony McGuckin">John Anthony McGuckin</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-88141-222-8</a>), which gives an excellent summary of the events leading up to and surrounding the council, seen through the perspective of the life of one of the most important theologians of the period. <a href="../../../j/h/c/User%7EJHCC_e2b8.html" title="User:JHCC">JHCC</a> <a href="../../../j/h/c/User_talk%7EJHCC_a93f.html" title="User talk:JHCC">(talk)</a> 17:25, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for requesting my opinion <a href="../../../j/h/c/User%7EJHCC_e2b8.html" title="User:JHCC">JHCC</a>. I try not to do anything on a reactionary basis, so I have been thinking the issue over. On the one hand, it is not a bad proposal. On the other, the Methodist hymnal and the version used are broadly used across Protestant religions and, in fact, used outside of Protestantism. I believe the version cited is the most widely used single version. Also, there is some benefit to having the words, cadence and hymnotic appeal of the Methodist version. It is sort of the equivalent of maintaining the words of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_bible_66b3.html" title="King James bible">King James bible</a> even though there are many other versions.

If you ask, What can reason do in religion? I answer, It can do exceeding much, both with regard to the foundation of it, and the superstructure. <b>The foundation of true religion stands upon the oracles of God</b>. It is built upon the Prophets and Apostles, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone. Now, of what excellent use is reason, if we would either understand ourselves, or explain to others, those living oracles! And how is it possible without it to understand the <b>essential truths</b> contained therein? <b>a beautiful summary of which we have in that which is called the Apostles' Creed</b>. Is it not reason (assisted by the Holy Ghost) which enables us to understand what the Holy Scriptures declare concerning the being and attributes of God? -- concerning his eternity and immensity; his power, wisdom, and holiness? It is by reason that God enables us in some measure to comprehend his method of dealing with the children of men; the nature of his various dispensations, of the old and new covenant, of the law and the gospel. It is by this we understand (his Spirit opening and enlightening the eyes of our understanding) what that repentance is, not to be repented of; what is that faith whereby we are saved; what is the nature and the condition of justification; what are the immediate and what the subsequent fruits of it. By reason we learn what is that new birth, without which we cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven; and what that holiness is without which no man shall see the Lord. By the due use of reason we come to know what are the tempers implied in inward holiness; and what it is to be outwardly holy -- holy in all manner of conversation: In other words, what is the mind that was in Christ; and what it is to walk as Christ walked.</i></li>

<p>JHCC asked me to weigh in on this, but I've been on break for several days. Since I'm not particularly up on Methodism, I don't really have an opinion. As most who know me are aware, my particular area is Roman Catholicism, and in my experience, the Apostles Creed is usually relegated to secondary status in the RCC in favor of the Nicene Creed. As far as I'm concerned JHCC's proposal makes sense and unless someone raises legit concerns, it should be implemented straight away. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 12:44, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I also hail from a Roman Catholic background, and I'm sorry that this has gotten so out of hand. The Latin definitely has to stay because it is <i>the</i> Apostles' Creed. The modern ecumenical translation needs to stay because the typical reader of the English-lanuguage Wikipedia does not read Latin. Its purpose is to inform the reader of the typically accepted meaning of the Latin Creed in English diction.</p>
<p>I authored the bit about the questioning form of the creed used in the Catholic Rite of Baptism. I now think it, and the nitpicky stuff about variations in liturgical use among denominations needs to be restructured. Here's how I propose we do this:</p>
<p>1. The section titled Variations in Liturgical Use should be renamed Use and Variations and should have two subsections. One subsection should explain the contexts in which the creed is used: personal prayer (a note should be made about the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosary.html" title="Rosary">Rosary</a>), ecclesial liturgies derived from the Latin Mass, and the various rrites of baptism used in Western Christianity. Another subsection should cover theological differences in the creed which are manifested in different dictions, notably the treatment of <i>infernos</i>, including the Methodist treatment.</p>
<p>2. There should be a new subsection under History titled Translations. This section should address the variety of translations which have occurred in the various denominations, including the Greek text, Cranmer's (Anglican), the Methodist one, the ELLC text, and any other noteworthy translations. The notes on each translation should include notable qualities of each, including that the Methodist translation and Cranmer's translation are considered by some to be "poetic".</p>
<p>3. This article should not be a collection of translations of the creed. Period. I have counted no less than 9 translations from various sources thus far. We should have objective criteria for which one(s) we include here. The Latin should be included for the above-mentioned reason. There needs to be an English translation included for understanding; IMHO the ELLC text wins right now becuase it is written in clear prose and is literal. If we were going to include more, which I don't think we need to, the Greek text is probably the most important from a worldwide perspective, followed by Cranmer's (perhaps the second-most-noteable English text), followed by the translations of the Reformed traditions (Weslyan, Moravian, Baptist, etc.), simply due to the commonality of usage. We can note all of these and their qualities without including verbatim copies. --<a href="../../../m/m/3/User%7EMm35173_8826.html" title="User:Mm35173">Mm35173</a> 17:00, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not going to argue that the Latin version was an early version, but how is it "the" Creed? Was Latin the original language? If so, I accept that argument. The Wesleyan version is the next most notable, as the foundation of the Protestantism in America, the largest group of denominiations. It would probably due to have a good write-up with a citation, so I do not disagree if the original was in Latin. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 21:46, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The original may have been in Greek, but the earliest known record of its existence lends evidence that it was at that time in Latin form (see the Catholic Encylopedia article). I have found no statements of the Eastern churches regarding it's origin. There is little argument about it because the theological principles of the creed are easily represented in both languages, and there does not persist a theological debate about its precise diction (as there does with the NC creed).</dd>
<dd>I reject your argument about Wesleyan influence in the US. This is not a US-centric encyclopedia, nor is it a Protestant-centric encyclopedia. The largest denomination of English-speakers in the world (outside of Catholicism and Orthodoxy) is without a doubt Anglicanism (~300 million), whose liturgy is of Cranmer's heritage (Book of Common Prayer). Also, without doubt, the ELLC text is the most used English text... considering it is used by present-day English-speaking Catholics, Orthodox, Anglicans, Lutherans, and many others, including Methodists.

<p>OK, an anonymous author decided to add an outline of the US Episcopalian Rite of Baptism and presumably accidentally subordinated the Catholic and Lutheran stuff to a sub sub section...</p>
<p>I renamed the section Rites of Baptism in Western Christianity and subordinated all the stuff about particular churches to it, adding an explanatory blurb.</p>
<p>I fear that this section is gradually going to turn into a place where everyone wants to make sure that his or her denomination gets named with all of its particular nuances pertinent to Baptism. This is not the <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">Baptism</a> article. A lot of the Anglican stuff was redundant to the Catholic and Lutheran stuff, mostly because the current Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran rituals are all derived from the same ancient Roman Catholic ritual.</p>
<p>A rite of Baptism has particular common features to all of these groups (let's call them western liturgical Christians). Intent is established (either by asking the catechumen or parents what is desired, etc). A scrutiny follows, which may or may not include the creed in its entirety. If the creed is not worded into the questions or responses, it is then recited. In all cases, the creed is a symbol of the faith into which the person is being baptized, and its profession is covenental. In some cases, sponsors (godparents) may enter into the covenent with or on behalf of the catechumen.</p>
<p>I do not think we need to necessarily regurgitate this sequence for every particular ritual which is derivative of the ancient Roman ritual. Maybe there needs to be a unitfied article on Western Christian ritual, but this is outside the scope of Apostles' Creed.</p>
<p>So, how do all of you propose we trim this section down and keep it NPOV? Inclusion of the ancient Roman liturgy in Latin is way NPOV but not very helpful to those who don't understand Latin... any thoughts? --<a href="../../../m/m/3/User%7EMm35173_8826.html" title="User:Mm35173">Mm35173</a> 16:42, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The dating issue seems weird in this article. Britannica seems to basically say that the content of the creed dates back to perhaps third century Roman baptismal creeds, but that its current form derives from France in the late 6th century. Shouldn't we state this, rather than the odd mishmash we currently have? Also, should perhaps the traditional view (that it was written by the 12 Apostles after Pentecost) be mentioned in the intro as well? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 19:44, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not know what was removed. If it was the text in Maltese, I think it should indeed have been removed. This article isn't the place for a collection of translations into all the languages of the world. It is surely enough to give English translations used in several (i.e. more than just one) English-speaking countries, together with the original text in Latin (and Greek) from which these translations were made. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 16:33, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, it was not text in Maltese, I am afraid. There was written that instead of he descended into hell, the Maltese version is somewhat different, by stating that "he descended into the limbo".Unsigned:Maltesedog</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wherever that statement was removed from, which is not clear to me, more important for understanding Maltesedog's complaint is the question: What is meant by "the Maltese version"? Maltesedog says it is not in the Maltese language. If it refers to the text of the Catholic Mass when celebrated in English in Malta, surely that must be the same text used by the Catholic Church in English-speaking countries in general. If a different text is used, it would seem to be an unapproved alteration (like the feminist "God's only Son" in place of "his only Son" and possibly dozens of other such alterations) and so does not deserve mention here.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In any case, if Maltesedog's mention of an alleged "Maltese version" is to be allowed in Wikipedia, Maltesedog must quote a verifiable source for it. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 09:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I give up. My previous comments were based on the assumption that Maltesedog wanted something inserted in the article. In view of the contradiction between what Maltesedog said earlier ("it was not text in Maltese") and what he says now ("the text is in Maltese"), I think he only wanted to make some comment here on the Talk page. Let him make whatever comment he likes. Nobody has disputed the interpretation of "hell" in the Apostles' Creed as a a reference to the "Limbo Patrum". I suppose nobody will. I certainly will not.

<dd>What 68.102.26.204 presents as "the common text, which is the same in all of Christianity" is in fact the <i>form</i> in which the same identical text (except for the former mistaken spelling of "caeli/cæli" as "coeli/cœli") <i>was</i> presented in the <i>Roman Missal</i>, used in the <i>Latin Rite</i> of the <i>Roman Catholic Church</i> from about 1760 to about 1960 (two centuries that ended some half a century ago). Before that, non-final /s/ was written and printed as /ſ/ (this character is not /f/), so that "incarnatus est" appeared as "incarnatus eſt". To help people with insufficient knowledge of Latin to read the text correctly <i>aloud</i>, the present Roman Missal does add accent marks, but only if the accent does <i>not</i> fall on the penultimate syllable (so, for example, it has "omnipotentem", not "omnipoténtem"); it does use the letter /v/ and prints /ae/ as a ligature, but it does not use the letter /j/. Not everyone is Catholic; not everyone uses the Roman Missal; not everyone still lives in the 1760-1960 period. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 04:37, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
