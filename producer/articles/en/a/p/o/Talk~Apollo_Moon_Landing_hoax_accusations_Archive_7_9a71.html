<p>One or two of the main "theories" state that the landings <i>did</i> occur, so there is clearly no consensus among the hoaxsters. So, how about this, or something like it, as this article's title? <b>Apollo program alternative theories</b>. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:26, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, pedantically speaking, I believe the guy who claims the landings did occur but that gravity was four times higher than accepted claims that the video footage of the landing was faked to pretend that gravity wasn't any higher than we thought. BTW, it might be worth pointing out that many (if not most) of these people have had to self-publish, presumably because no publisher would touch it... I believe he's a case in point. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 23:35, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks to the Internet (and especially to this page) any yahoo can self-publish... up to a point. Anyway, that title came to me as being neutral and non-inflammatory. "hoax accusations" and "conspiracy theories" and "Apollo shills" and "Bill Kaysing shills" just don't quite cut it. Maybe someone will go for this one, or something like it; or at least maybe everyone will disagree with it, so they'll have <i>some</i> common ground. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:43, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The next time someone wants to publish a pro-hoax book, I wish they would pay me to be the fact checker. That is a job that certainly doesn't do any work. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 23:40, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe the title, <b>Apollo program alternative theories,</b>is an example of false balance as it implies parity between the generally accepted historical record and the conspiracy theories. As far as sources go, I agree with Mark. We should point out the various issues with all of the sources. Since the treatment of evidence seems to be a central argument, I think there should be a blanket statement about the veracity of the sources briefly explaining the POVs of 'both' sides. i.e. NASA faked the evidence vs. the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historiography.html" title="Historiography">Historiography</a>. See the&#160;::introduction of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> for an excellent treatment of a similar problem of evidence. I think this statement should be added to the skanty introduction and the 'Burden of proof' section removed entirely.</p>
<p>Look at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> as well as a good way to structure the 'top' of this article to make for a good short introduction to the topic. Then we can trail off into the swamp if you want. 70.160.231.246 00:02, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You've got an excellent point, the article title gives more legitimacy to the "Apollo skeptics" than it deserves, but at least it doesn't contain any "pejorative" words, I don't think. Although there are some comparisons to be made, Holocaust denial is largely confined to neo-Nazis, and there are few (even the Apollo skeptics) who would argue that Holocaust denial is anything other than patently offensive. This is more of an argument about whether the government, which couldn't even hide a third-rate burglary, could somehow pull off faking the space program. As I said, maybe there could be a better title... maybe "<i>Challenges</i> to the official Apollo history", or something hopefully less wordy. "Apollo denial" is very succinct, but I don't think they would buy into it. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:07, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>the term conspiracy theory is not inherently perjorative. it is simply descriptive in the case of this topic. 70.160.231.246 02:28, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To the hoax proponents, it is a hot-button issue. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:40, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>understood and beside the point. This is not a soapboax or a vanity page. it is widely understood as a conspiracy theory and should be labeled as such 70.160.48.35 11:45, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Theoretically it's beside the point, but in practice it will unleash further edit wars. Read all the junk on this page and you might see what I'm getting at. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:43, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Wahkeenah's entirely correct, except that the point runs even deeper than the title. The problem here is not going to be solved by clever naming; it'll be solved by getting the <i>editorial framing</i> of the content structured in a way which acknowledges the inevitable onslaught of opinion it will always attract - not always from the most patient or 'housetrained' wikipedians. Hence my 'stuck record' insistence that we consider how other touchy issues are handled <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">elsewhere</a> on the 'pedia, to see how other editors maintain articles which might suffer as this one has.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm proposing we should keep this article to an account of the accusations in <i>one dimension only</i> - the <b>fact</b> of their existence, as a cultural phenomenon: That's the only aspect of them that is accepted as common ground between Apollo deniers and Apollo defenders - that they are out there, and have a certain history, key individuals, popular resonances, etc. We can join together to tell that story entirely neutrally. Put the substance of the arguments elsewhere, and make it VERY clear in a top-note to the discussion page that contributors wishing to engage in the specific arguments should do so under the "Examination of the claims ... " article. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 20:46, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I tend to agree, and it seems to be the format used in articles about similar hoax claims (e.g. holocaust denial and 9/11 denial). But I think you'll find that any attempt to treat this as a 'social phenomenon' will immediately be rejected by the Apollo-deniers. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 20:51, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Right. "social phenomenon" is effectively another way to say "conspiracy theory". <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 21:22, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, hang on a minute. Let's let <i>them</i> do their <i>own</i> objecting. Many of them may be quite happy for one article to focus on the history of their story, and another to delve into the arguments internal to it. And as far as I can see, there's no other common ground on which to base a neutral article. There <b>is</b> the fact that these notions are 'out there' - this much we all agree on. They have been out there in ways we can report neutrally on. All pro and anti arguments can be catered for in an 'Examination of ...' What could be wrong with that? <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 18:42, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, how about we treat the odd case of why so many people still believe NASA as a sociological phenomenon? No? Quite. The point here is that hoax deniers are frightened that actually presenting the evidence on this page will expose the truth. The only person who could object to presenting what accusers say (and the responses by landing believers) is someone afraid of the truth. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 21:17, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No-one is 'frightened by the evidence' because there isn't any. We're just tired of being expected to debunk the increasingly bizarre claims that are posted here, and particularly when they've already been debunked numerous times on the web. There's no reason whatsoever to have yet another list of 'why the Apollo-deniers are wrong' arguments on this page when there are so many sites devoted to that. Or do you think that the 'holocaust denial' page should have a similar list of rebuttals of holocaust denial 'evidence'? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 21:37, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>People tend to accept recorded history unless there is proof to the contrary. A better question is, at what point did you decide the historical record was suspect? Was there any one defining moment, like the "waving flag" or some such? Or was it a gradual process? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 21:22, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Carfiend, I think that black and white idea of what kind of person could object (fearful self-deceivers) is unlikely to prove constructive, and very likely to lead to charges that you're not engaging here on the assumption of <i>good faith</i>. To clarify: I'm delighted to have each and every new mental pabulum chewed over by denier of the week exposed for what it is. There's no question of <i>censoring</i> such stuff, and so no relevancy to posing as the voice of free speech. My only concern here is with the <b>credibility</b> - wikipedia recently scored reasonably favourably in a like-for-like comparison with Britannica. What Britannica has and we don't is the luxury of editorial decisions being final. So Britannica doesn't have to handle topics better suited to a medium like Usenet. Here, there's no such thing as final, and the trick is to work out a way to handle the endless flow of new, would-be contributors, in ways which preserve the credibility of the pedia. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 18:52, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do we have to endlessly have this conversation? You already conceded defeat on this issue - there is no historical record aside from NASA propoganda. No independent witnesses, no engineering data to back up the models in the museums. There is no historical record. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 21:25, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How about trying to answer the question? You weren't born doubting the historical record, you arrived at that conclusion somehow. I'm just trying to figure out what you're seeing that I'm not seeing, or vice versa. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 21:26, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It's not that I doubt it, there ISN'T ONE. I'm finding it hard to see what evidence for you are seeing. When I see that the only evidence for the landings are some photos of a dubious nature, with none of the backup documentation, high quality video, telemetry etc that you would expect, along with issues with cameras, radiation, etc etc, what other conclusions can you come to? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 21:29, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you think there isn't a historical record, you haven't looked very far. You still haven't answered my question, though. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 21:33, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Where is it? I think we should have a section in the page of independent evidence for the Apollo landings. It would include all the data, witnesses etc. The good thing is it would not take up much space! I arrived at the conclusion because I was really interested in the landings, they seemed such a phenomenal achievement, on reading more and more, it just seemed more and more fishy. So many inconsistencies, so little real evidence. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 21:37, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The apparent inconsistencies are all explainable, and <i>have been</i> explained on the page. I'd be interested in seeing your point-by-point of which explanations don't hold water. And don't say "because NASA is the source". That's circular reasoning. Explain why the explanations don't make sense to you <i>on their face</i>. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 21:40, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Your logic is faulty out of the gate. Of course you can't prove that NASA is telling the truth by reference to NASA. I'm not going to get into a point-by-point with you, because I don't think you have a very good grasp of logic, but most of the 'explanations' are a matter of opinion 'the flag is waving because Buzz is shaking it' vs 'Buzz is trying to stop the flag from waving', but since the video is NASA anyway, and we don't have the original hi-res, we can't really know. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 21:43, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's hopeless. As I have said many times, the basic premise is that NASA is lying. So anything that apparently contradicts that notion must be rejected. Now, getting back to basics, what do <i>you</i> think the title of the article should be? Do you like my ultra-neutral title idea? Or is <i>too</i> neutral? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 21:48, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see what's wrong with the title, from the vote above, nobody else seems to either. You don't like it? I'm not sure why. My premise is not that NASA is lying, my premise is to look at the problem from the point of view that we don't know whether NASA is lying, so we have to look at the evidence from a skepitical point of view. When you discount NASA's stuff, there is NO EVIDENCE to speak of. Unless you assume that NASA is telling the truth (the opposite of what you are accusing me of) you can't conclude the landings happened. It's an act of faith. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 21:51, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As long as everyone (except that one user who had renamed the article for a day or so) is OK with the title, they might as well archive this section also, since it's moot. The primary reason I don't accept the Apollo denial is that all manner of government conspiracies and secrets from that era were exposed, some at the time and some later, and I just don't think the government was smart enough to have pulled off such an elaborate hoax without someone finding out about it. Also, the explanations are consistent with the observations. The burden of proof is on the accusers, and I keep waiting for them to come up with something, but they haven't done it so far. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 21:56, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It's also easy for people who did not live through an era to start questioning the validity of the historical record. That's fine, if there is proof to the contrary. I'm sure the Holocaust deniars (sp?) are convinced that they are right also. The comparison between the two stories is very similar. Those who deny the historical record look at it through a specific lens, with a pre-judgment that the authors of the historical record fabricated it. Obviously, the Holocaust denial is a quantum leap more noxious and offensive than the Apollo denial, but the <i>approach</i> to the subject matter is similar. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 22:07, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once again, there is a HUGE difference between Holocaust Denial and landing skepticism. Imagine if only one US government agency had produced any eye-witnesses, or evidence for the holocaust. That would be similar. It isn't the case though. There are thousands of independent individuals with first hand testamony and evidence. The two ideas are not remotely similar. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 22:13, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but in order to believe that you have to believe that almost everyone in the world alive at that time is lying. It's a dozewn orders of magnitude more difficult than some people in one US govt agency.

<dd>Not everyone in the world, just the "Jewish conspiracy", along with the U.S. Army. The Holocaust deniars don't say the camps didn't exist, just that they were mischaracterized and exaggerated.

<dd>Right, but the hoax proponents suggest a conspiracy simply within one govt agency. Not involving some huge 'Jewish conspiracy' or whatever.

<dd>Again, who witnessed the landings, aside from NASA? What you are talking about is the tracking of some object. It's possible that the tracking is real, but it still doesn't prove human landing.

<dd>Well, it doesn't seem to me that NASA's account is more consistent than any give theory. One logical error you make is lumping all the theorists together. Each one is internally consistent, and even if some of them are not, only one has to be. The task is to see which theory (NASA's, or one of the hoax theorists) best fits the data. Given that NASA is the only agency that has ever claimed to get to the moon, you'd think some kind of evidence was in order, right? There are several nations that have tech for soft-landing on other planets, so that's not so difficult, but the one piece that is unique, human landing, there is no independent evidence for.

<dd>The theory of the planets revolving about the sun within crystalline spheres was also "consistent", given sufficient tinkering, sub-spheres, etc., but turned out not to be the best fit for the observable facts. The hoax theories also fail on that account, because they have to keep adjusting them to fit the facts, whereas NASA does not, because their story is consistent; and the hard reality is that the hoaxsters have never been able to produce any actual evidence that the flights did <i>not</i> occur; no testimony, no secret film studio, no nothin'. Man being physically on the moon is not a problem. They had plenty of experience with men operating in the vacuum of space, thanks to the space-walks in Gemini, etc., so they had that technology down. In terms of <i>getting there</i>, they skirted the Van Allen belts, so that's not a problem either. Everything is accounted for. The fact that Kaysing might think it's a problem doesn't mean anything, since he couldn't even get his facts right about the rockets. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:22, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, you've misread my argument (seemingly as a convenience given your rhetoric that surronds this misreading ) and thrown in the Nazi card to boot. That's offensive.

<dd>Ironic, ain't it? The hoaxsters are relying on NASA evidence to demonstrate that Von Braun went to Antarctica, without any apparent independent verification.

<dd>It says he was exploring. Is there a law against that? Where's your evidence to the contrary? Sarcasm aside (which ain't easy), the hoaxsters have implied something sinister in his trip to the south pole, but they have no actual evidence there was anything sinister about it. They simply decided that was the reason for his trip (i.e. to gather ersatz moon rocks), so it became another false piece in their false puzzle. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:33, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since the hoaxsters are the ones questioning it, they are the ones who need to prove something sinister. Were ex-Nazis not allowed to either have hobbies or take vacations?

<dd>It's a genuine interest, I'm not debating it with you, since I don't have any evidence about what he did there, I'm just intrigued, since it wasn't a hobby or a vacation, he was there on NASA time. They give no explanation, there's nothing to explain what he did there, or why he went, beyond the fact that he was intrigued.

<dd>Moon rocks are not found only in Antartica, but it is easier to find them there. They are meteorites that are blasted off the Moon by large impacts.

<dd>Yes, but again, your logic is weak. "<i>Chemical compositions, isotope ratios, minerals, and textures of the lunar meteorites are all similar to those of samples collected on the Moon during the Apollo missions.</i>" you're using circular logic. We know they come from space, because NASA brought them back from space. 1982? Erm? No, you're wrong on that, it was 1912 iirc. In the 1960s, Antarctica was the place to go. You argue from circular logic - you only know what 'moon rocks' look like because NASA shows you what it claims are moon rocks.

<dd>Sure, so go where it's easiest to find them. Rather than supervising the rocket program.

<dd>A good point, but one that I have an answer for. Much of the evidence for a hoax or cover up comes from inconsistencies in NASA's account. When you have a big lie, sooner or later the details drift out of sync with each other. Von Braun spending time in Antarctica while he should have been in Houston is only one. To be fair, your point is well made. All that the hoax proponents can ever really show without unfettered access to NASA is that NASA is lying. The specific truth will not emerge until a full investigation is allowed. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 16:21, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The hoaxsters have never demonstrated that NASA has lied about the Apollo program, and the assertion that Von Braun "should have been in Houston" is Kaysing's personal opinion. Speaking of which, what were the circumstances of Kaysing's 1963 departure? I have wondered whether he was canned (probably for incompetence), and whether his moon hoax fables were a way of getting revenge? That might give him more credit than he deserves, since the preponderance of evidence merely suggests that he doesn't know what he's talking about, technologically and otherwise. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:27, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ron Miller claims Kaysing left Rocketdyne because of 'personal reasons'... which could be euphemism for anything, but probably nothing good. I'd guess, though, that Rocketdyne would be somewhat embarassed to employ someone who believed that the Apollo program was a hoax. And, as pointed out here on Wikipedia, he was apparently a graduate in English with no technical or scientific training.

<dd>I think it would be out of scope, unless he ever said something suggesting that Apollo was a hoax. He was mostly making points about the expenditure, and about Von Braun's WWII role. Listening to that record is a nice window into what was going on politically in 1965. He talked about LBJ practicing "escallatio" on the Vietnamese. If only he knew how much worse it would get. Then there's one song where he mentions <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Gahagan_df40.html" title="Helen Gahagan">Helen Gahagan</a> and... <i><a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a></i>???

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Moon hoax / holocaust denial parallels</span></h2>
<p>I see these movements as basically identical:</p>
<p><b>1) Only one source - lack of skeptical review:</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Only the Jews and Nasa saw what really happened. Moon rocks, mass graves, and records can all be fakes. (Okay, the bodies were real, but you had thousands of people who could have made the bones of dead Nazis look Jewish and bury them.) The Jews were found by battle weary solders who were willing to believe anything bad about the Nazis, similarly the US public didn't want to disbelieve Nasa during the cold war.
<dl>
<dd>Yeah. Everyone in the world, masses of independent groups, or part of one relatively small US govt agency. The same. Oh, that's right, not the same at all! The second world war happened in Europe. There were many, many independent witnesses. The moon hoax apparently happened in space. No witnesses. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 20:07, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The difference here is that NASA is the only one to supply all this evidence. During and after the holocaust hundreds of thousands of people saw the carnage. The Germans themselves documented it. There are no similarities. Actually, the German documentaion of the holocaust is much more convincing than NASAs. Much less seems to have been 'lost'. The only way to make it similar is if the US army had 'discovered' concentration camps that no-one else did, not let anyone else see anything except some photos and a bit of video, 'lost' most of the data, but insists that it was real. Then I'd see the parallels, but in the real world? No. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 20:27, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>2) Thousands of people can keep a secret:</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>The events alleged in both cases would have required the cooperation of thousands of people under difficult conditions. The footage of the moon landings is far more convincing then movies that took hundreds of skilled people to create, and the number of effect shots is hundreds of times greater then what appeared in the 2001 movie. How many people would it take to produce all this footage, and wouldn't they all recognize their work if they were all "fooled"?

<dd>Right, more absurd speculation. It's not 'convincing', it's blurred and grainy. The original hi res has been conveniently 'lost'.

Nothing he ever says again will be accepted by the scientific community, and his whole university has lost respect over it. The works of holocaust and Moon hoax deniers are filled with invented evidence and testimony, misquotations, misrepresentations of fact, painful logical fallacies, and proposals that they know have been discredited. Nevertheless, they demand to be treated as scientific equals, and cry censorship when they aren't. They call for mistrust of Nasa, Allied and even German records without any similar verified history of lying.

<p><b>4) Divergent standards of evidence:</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Anyone can put up a web site claiming that Buzz Aldrin was an android or Hitler was secretly a Jewish pawn working to help build Israel, and if the site gets enough hits, Wikipedia will list the accusation. Only responses to these inventions must be held to the rules for the treatment of evidence. Despite claims of censorship and bias, I'm not aware of any hoax accusation that was ever removed from the article. But the comparison of the Moon hoax to Watergate was swiftly pulled, and <b>not answered.</b> Indeed almost every response present has been contested on technical grounds at some point.
<dl>
<dd>The same standards of evidence are used by the hoax proponents. Only NASA wants to be excused from the requirement for independent evidence. They <b>have no</b> independent evidence of the landing. That on it's own is enough to raise serious questions. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 20:07, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>5) Why do it?</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Holocaust denial is a way to attack Jews. Apollo denial has the same effect on science. No one contests the Roman Empire or Christopher Columbus's voyages because doing so won't make anyone angry. When Buzz Aldrin punched Bart Sibrel in the face, Sibrel reacted like someone who had just achieved his lifelong ambition. His first thought was to excitedly make sure that their had been video coverage. Here on Wikipedia, hoax proponent FGJ flat out admitted that he did not believe what he was saying. This is the central fact of both articles, and belongs in the first paragraph.</dd>

<p>OK, I can see we won't be allowed to hold the mooted higher level <i>editorial</i> conversation, until the case for having that conversation has been thrashed out. Carfiend tells us that the only basis he can see for any proposed comparison between the two sets of sceptics is entirely in the imagination of Apollo boosters. Then he asserts that "the two groups share nothing in common", and offers us his account of their different beliefs as proof of that. Five scene setters I'd appreciate Carfiend's considered thoughts on:</p>

<li>The parallel that is being drawn is purely the methodological one: that species of scepticism which expresses itself in a more-or-less random and <i>potentially infinite</i> series of objections to whichever mainstream story it scrutinises. Such scepticism is essentially impossible to disprove. No matter what the object of scrutiny is, it is always possible to invent another unanswered question, or to find a way to discount the answers already given. This was well known to Greek philosophers - it shouldn't be news here.</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with your characterization. The Apollo sceptics are not random and infinate, they are in response to specific problems with NASA's story, and are limited pretty much by the number of errors in the narative that NASA presents. It would be easy to disprove if NASA had the evidence that it should have, for example, the original telemetry, hi res video, design documentation etc. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 01:06, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure I follow, here. Is it your case that the series of empirical errors Holocaust deniers 'discover' in the Holocaust story are of a different <i>sort</i> to those errors Apollo sceptics are interested in, and <i>that's</i> what differentiates their methods? <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 19:42, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This one? The HDs clearly start from the position of a racial hate ideology. Their whole story is built around a much bigger story of massive zionist conspiracy (as far as I can tell). On the other hand, there is no a priori axe to grind with the landing hoax. The theory stems from problems with NASA's 'evidence', such that it is. There is no underlying ideology, no a priori assumption of hoax, no global super-conspiracy (at least, not in the same sense). The two are unrelated except in the sense that all theories share certain superficial resemblances. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 21:58, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have often thought that the Holocaust deniers argued that there was no proof of a program of extermination, while at the same time seeming to approve of the <i>idea</i> of it. That aspect is obviously different from Apollo denial. However, too little attention has been paid to the motives of Kaysing and the other Apollo-skeptic writers. Until someone does such a study (and maybe someone has, I don't know), to say that there "is no underlying ideology" behind the Apollo denial is a questionable and premature assertion. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 22:21, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Carfiend, it is clear to us both that Holocaust deniers have ulterior motives, stated or unstated. I won't go into what I think Apollo deniers' ulterior motives might be, as we would clearly disagree, but you'll want to account for their passion, somehow, if you want to claim they bring no agenda of their own to the material. Be that as it may, in terms of their <b>behaviour</b> - not their alleged <b>beliefs</b> - both sets of sceptics apply what looks to me like an identical method: niggling away at any detail of the story that captures their attention until they find an angle from which to cast doubt on it. When one doubt is proven baseless, they move on to another. Do you refuse to acknowledge that parallel? So far your argument for a methodological distinction between the two amounts to 'Holocaust deniers are snivelling liars, whereas Apollo deniers are Truth Seekers' - a POV it seems to me that Holocaust deniers could just as easily assert with the terms reversed.

<dd>Asserting that the claim is not true doesn't prove it so - some proof is really wanting.

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Conspiracy theory features</span></h4>
<p>OK, let's deal with this one once and for all. Again. These 'features' are so broad, that most theories meet at least some. Let's see how NASA and the whistleblowers do.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Initiated on the basis of limited, partial or circumstantial evidence;<br />
<i>Conceived in reaction to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media</a> reports and images, as opposed to, for example, thorough knowledge of the relevant <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forensics.html" title="Forensics">forensic</a> evidence</i>.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Addresses an event or process that has broad historical or emotional impact;<br />
<i>Seeks to interpret a phenomenon which has near-universal interest and emotional significance, a story that may thus be of some compelling interest to a wide audience</i>.
<dl>
<dd>Yep, both meet this one. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 20:11, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. Reduces morally complex social phenomena to simple, immoral actions;<br />
<i>Impersonal, institutional processes, especially errors and oversights, interpreted as malign, consciously intended and designed by immoral individuals</i>.
<dl>
<dd>No, neither really meet this one. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 20:11, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wait , please expand on why the hoaxers don't meet this one. Don't they claim that the data <i>Nasa</i> claims is missing, in fact never existed? Don't they claim that various percieved oddities with the historical record are evidence of a plot, while Nasa claims that they are misinterpretations? <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 22:43, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, to have lost the entire telemetry and hi quality video for what is claimed to be the first trip outside earth orbit does strain credability, so sure, there might be a bit of that. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 23:22, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That assertion is an <i>opinion</i>, not an absolute. NASA is a bureaucracy, and they weren't flying the Apollo program any more, so there was <i>not</i> necessarily an urgent need to keep track of that stuff. Yes, they <i>should have</i> kept better track... and if they knew someone was going to make a big deal out of it, <i>maybe</i> (though not necessarily) they <i>would</i> have. You should maybe do some research to find out how much <i>other</i> engineering stuff from totally unrelated government agencies from 40 years ago is <i>also</i> missing, before drawing any inference about whether there is anything unusual about NASA having misplaced their own stuff that was, after all, <i>obsolete</i> by then. For a sort-of comparison, I saw a news story recently that one of the major networks had just uncovered a tape of raw footage of the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan in 1981. Interesting stuff. And it had been thrown in a box somewhere and nearly forgotten about. Someone happened to find it, before it was about to be tossed. And this is a private, <i>profit-driven organization</i>; obviously a valuable piece of footage, yet they treated it like yesterday's newspaper. So it is not necessarily reasonable to argue that the way a moon hoaxster <i>thinks</i> NASA should have preserved and protected this info squares with the <i>realities</i> of the way old stuff is often (mis)handled. For another example, you sometimes hear about evidence in criminal trials having been lost after some years have passed. It's a reality. It happens. The hoaxsters have presented no statistical backing for their claim that there is anything unusual or mysterious about it. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:34, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But you'd agree that that is precisely what 'pro-NASA' people say, that the hoax gets more complicated. NASA does claim to produce evidencee, even if you don't accept it? Wouldn't you agree that part of the assertation is true?</dd>
<dd><b>It does get more complicated</b>. To every response, they have to come up with a further flight of fantasy to try to explain it away. To use a simple example, they start talking about the "waving flag". When that is demonstrated to be false, they say, "Maybe the film was doctored." They say there is no independent evidence of the flights. When that is demonstrated to be untrue, their next step is to say, "Maybe they launched unmanned vehicles with phony signals coming from them." All of these "maybes" presented without any actual evidence in support of them. It reminds me of creationists who explain the dinosaurs by saying "Maybe Satan put the bones in the ground to deceive us." In fact, the existence of <i>several</i> moon hoax "theories" are a symptom of this situation. When you start with false assumptions, you can end up with many conflicting "reality constructs". If you accept the historical record of the Apollo program, there <i>is no inconsistency, nor can the hoaxsters demonstrate that there is any.</i> Maybe the whole thing <i>was</i> a gigantic hoax. But the hoaxsters have presented <i>no evidence</i> of it <i>whatsoever</i>. I keep waiting.

<dd>I don't think so. The 'film was doctored' claim is not in response to a response about the flag. Those are two separate issues arrising from issues in NASA's evidence. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 16:44, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>13. The conspiracy is claimed to involve just about anybody;<br />
<i>Conspiracy tales grow in the telling, and can swell to world-spanning proportions. As the adherents struggle to explain counter-arguments, the conspiracy grows even more (see preceding item). Conspiracy theories that have been around for a few decades typically encompass the whole world and huge portions of history.</i>

<dd>14. The conspiracy centers on the "usual suspects";<br />
<i>Classical conspiracy theories feature people, groups or organizations that are discriminated against in the culture where the story is told. Jews and foreigners are a common target. Likewise, organizations with a bad or colorful reputation feature prominently, such as the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Templars.html" title="Templars">Templars</a>, the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Reich_a799.html" title="Third Reich">Nazis</a> and just about any <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_service.html" title="Secret service">secret service</a>.</i>

<dd>I understand that your patience is sorely tested, here. But please note I specified which of the features undeniably apply to at least some examples of Apollo scepticism. Your ripostes would be an answer <i>of sorts</i> to a point I am neither making nor interested in making (that the methodologies of Apollo deniers and Apollo boosters are incomparable).

Such things <i>certainly</i> apply also to Holocaust denial. That has to be relevant to a discussion of methodological similarities."

<dl>
<dd>That bit of hyperbole wasn't responsive, re 'vast conspiracy to slur science.' So your contention is that, following the atomic bomb, there was no anti-science lietmotif in populer media and that this non-existent motiff therefore could not be construed as a positvie indicator towards point 14 on part of the hoax theorists? What about the flying saucer scares? Couldn't they too be part of a broader anti-science sentiment?</dd>

<p>It seems like there needs to be a distinction made between comparing Holocaust denial with Apollo denial, which I can't disagree is, in fact, offensive; vs. comparing the <i>article</i> about Holocaust denial with this <i>article</i>. It should be possible to model one <i>article</i> on the other without drawing any direct comparison between Nazis and Apollo questioners. However, maybe you would want to post a proposed article on that subject here first, and see if it flies. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:33, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I appreciate that this would be a concern. But consider - if we can frame the topic in a way which is acceptable to all parties, and reserve empirical disputes to a summary page, the blizzard of reverts here will dramatically fall - as it can be demonstrated has occurred in the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">example</a> which dares not speak its name - and we can, I think, move up to a new level of refinement of the content here. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 21:47, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that's a good idea, it sounds like a way for the NASA camp to wriggle out of trying to answer difficult questions.

<dd>Actually, the idea was to give the <i>moon hoaxsters</i> some "wriggle room", as it is they who keep whining about how this page is too "biased". If they had a page of "their own", they could put write it in a way they consider unbiased. Then a separate page could carry the challenges and responses/explanations. Perhaps that approach would indeed give too much credence to the hoaxster side. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:02, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>1. One of their senior staff was an SS Officer, and was involved in slave labor camps. 2. Neo Nazis have no independent evidnce for their claim, neither does NASA. 3.

<dd>Some wiki writers are touchier than others here. I've occasionally had some of them run to "mommy" when my own comments went over the line. That's something I typically won't do; I would rather settle it face-to-face (or technically keyboard to keyboard), if possible, unless someone gets into an obnoxious revert war, which does happen here from time to time, but it's been far worse on some other pages. However, be very careful about labeling someone a sockpuppet, as that is apparently considered a very offensive charge on this website, unless you can prove it. I don't take it personally, but many do. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:25, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't know that <a href="../../../w/e/r/Wernher_Von_Braun_0734.html" title="Wernher Von Braun">Wernher Von Braun</a> was ever accused of war crimes (that peculiar distinction between "fair" and "unfair" killing in wartime), he was just doing what he was told to do, flying his <i>Vergeltungswaffe</i> rockets (a.k.a V-rockets; ya gotta love them German words). He and his cohorts were both snapped up by the Americans and the Soviets, so those countries were being just as "expedient" as those men were. In reviewing the article, it occurred to me that his death at a relatively young age, apparently following a vehicular accident, is something the hoaxsters overlooked. Given their tendency to read between the lines, I'm surprised they missed the chance to claim he was threatening to speak out. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:25, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is, perhaps, unfair to treat him as a NAZI, since he was, in many ways just doing his job. However, he was involved with slave labor camps, and his apparent willingness to work for the NAZIs and then the west shows what I think is a chillingly mercenary streak (just my opinion). He was never accused of war crimes. He designed weapons that could only really be used to attack large civilian populations, but did not make the decision to use them, and in any case, was far more useful as a scientist alive and free. Re his death, it is mentioned by some theorists, I just don't think anyone has got around to writing about it here. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 01:57, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>von Braun was a remarkable person. Fifteen years before anyone knew that there were lunar meteorites on Earth, he made a trip to Antarctica and gathered over 1,000 pounds of them - even though only about 90 such stones have been found since! And the ones he found <b>did not</b> show signs of a fiery trip through our atmosphere, unlike the others. And unlike the others, the surfaces of his <b>did</b> show signs of being exposed to space for billions of years. And he was able to fool geologists all over the world. Or else all of the geologists are in on the conspiracy. Just like all of the astronomers and physicists have to be in on the conspiracy with that change in the surface gravity of the moon they had to pull off. All of the encyclopediasts have to be in on it too. And I just realized that I'm part of the conspiracy, and I shot JFK too.</dd>

<dd>I can access the paper. It does indeed shed light on WvB's motivation for the trip. Simultaneous with the space program, an Antarctic program was taking place, and it was thought that the two could learn from each other. The South Pole was the closest thing to Outer Space in terms of hostility towards human survival. Albert Crary, NSF’s chief scientist, 1962: "the choicest test ground [for space exploration] on the planet is the land and water surrounding the southern pole."</dd>
<dd>WvB seems to have been especially interested in using experience with polar stations to design a lunar station, both in terms of technology and in dealing with medical and psychological problems in isolated conditions. One Antarctic researcher (not named) is quoted as saying "von Braun flew in to see our moon station". <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETeraBlight_e6e3.html" title="User:TeraBlight">TeraBlight</a> 05:04, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How <i>dare</i> Dr. von Braun go to the south pole for a legitimate scientific purpose? Nah, he only wanted the hoaxsters to <i>think</i> he was going to Antarctica to collect fake moon rocks, whereas he was actually in the U.K., working with Stanley Kubrick, et al, to create those rocks artificially, from the same materials Stanley was using to build the <i>2001</i> set which, as we all know, looks exactly like the Apollo footage of the lunar surface. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 05:29, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was also thinking of the JFK situation, in lieu of the hot-button topic of the Holocaust. Again, though, the parallels are debatable, because there was <i>immediate</i> suspicion of a plot by the Soviets, and the government went to great pains to paint it as a lone act in order to downplay anything that could trigger an international incident. The family also did their best to keep a lid on things, and all the secrecy fed the conspiracists. At the time, few openly discussed the possible Mafia connection, which sounds more plausible than most of the theories. However, after all this time, despite boatloads of suspicions in all manner of contradictory directions, posed by endless theorists trying to sell books, nothing substantive has emerged to definitively demonstrate that it was anyone other than Oswald. So, in that sense, it does make a good parallel: tons of questions, and ultimately you go back to the original and realize that that's the way it was. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:20, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There are so many, and contradictory, it's hard for a debunker to know where to begin. I used to wonder about it also, although I was convinced from Day 1 that Oswald was involved, due to the attitude he copped to the press while under custody (can you believe they allowed a brief, live interview with the accused assassin? Things were different then) and I remain convinced that he was <i>a</i> triggerman if not necessarily <i>the only</i> triggerman. But the parallel with the Apollo hoax story is not all that parallel, although I'm fairly certain that a fair number of JFK conspiracists turned their attention to Apollo once the JFK story began to run out of steam. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:31, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, as with most cover-ups, many theories are proposed - without full access to the information, th truth may never be known. In the case of the JFK killing, things like the 'magic bullet' indicate something is wrong, but not who perpetrated the killing. It's similar with the NASA hoax - the evidence points to a cover-up, but the details cannot be known without more information. Obviously that will not be forthcoming until a full and independent review can be undertaken. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 02:02, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the JFK conspiracy page you often see a point razed in one section, and a counter argument many paragraphs away. I think we already have a better structure, with each issue dealt with to its conclusion. Another difference is that the JFK conspiracy proponents have far stronger arguments, with no insulting ones like <i>Nasa doesn't know better then to shield the film from radiation.</i> I think it is a good idea to have a section comparing the moon hoax to other conspiracies, including real ones like Watergate and Piltdown Man. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 17:39, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You mean association with the skepticism movement? That doesn't bother me too much because they are the originators of the phrase "extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof".

While I agree that there is obstinance among people with these views, which I must confess I personally beleive to be ridiculous, <i>calling</i> them obstinant is opinion and NPOV 100%. Now, if you had a quote from a respected member of the science community regarding obstinence(I beleive there may have been something like that in popular science), that could be included on a section about how they are viewed by a certain subset of people. It is best not to include any inherent attack in the <i>name</i> given to the beleivers, and I don't see skeptics carrying sufficienct positive connotations to be undue and inherent praise of someone. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 20:43, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That was me. I changed the title to something like 'Apollo Moon hoax conspiracy Theories' it stayed that wway for about 45 seconds. before it was changed back AND I was accused of being a POV jihadist for daring to make that change without having it vetted by the moon hoaxers. My point in making the change is that I think conspiracy theories was more accurate. The discussion above on conpsiracy theories would seem to bear that out. I vote let's change it back. to 'Apollo Moon Hoax Conspiracy Theories' unless we can find acceptable evidence that:</dd>
</dl>

<ol>
<li>The hoax actually occurred. Then we can delete the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_program.html" title="Apollo program">Apollo program</a> page and put this one in its place.</li>
<li>It turns out the hoax theorists bleive that the hoax perpetrated by only one person or by a group of people acting separately without communicating with each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know some people who don't believe in the hoax think that calling the hoax idea a 'theory' is glorifying it, because, in part, hoaxers don't present an idea of what actually happened but instead, what didn't happen. I think the theory is that the hoax occured as a result of a conspiracy. That makes the title a good one. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a></p>
<p>The current title: "Apollo Moon landing hoax accusations" is accurate and clear. I vote for it. People are making accusations, but not presenting a theory of what happened instead. (Denying a theory is not a theory in itself.) I don't recall that anyone is denying the Apollo program, just the parts that happened outside the radiation belts. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 21:18, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The idea that the hoax happened is a theory: 'NASA faked all or part of the moon landings.' The landings themselves, in the event they happened, are not theories but historical facts, RE: 'Denying a theory is not a theory in itself'. If they didn't happen, then they are hoaxes, still not theories. I don't believe that 'accusations' is as precise or a desrcriptive as 'theories' because the latter doesn't take into account the respnses to those accusations in the same way as the former does. Also using the phrase 'conspiracy theory' links the hoax phenom to the larger social entity, as is appropriate given the discussion above on conspiracy theories. 70.160.231.187 22:11, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I argue that they <i>are</i> accusations, as opposed to the normal concept of a "theory". They are not a true "theory", more of a "hypothesis". However, "conspiracy theory" fits.

<dd>It's not a <i>scientific</i> theory, which involves making observations and hypotheses, then conducting repeatable experiments and/or making further observations to confirm or adjust or disprove the developing principles of the theory. It <i>might</i> be a "theory" in the layman's way of using the term (hence the false statement about evolution that "it's only a theory";; they think a "theory" is a "hypothesis"). The Apollo flights were not a "theory", either; they were a technology and engineering achievement. Nor were the reported events a "theory", they were well-documented and well-covered historical events.

<dd>Two things. 1. Yes, it is a theory which makes observations and hypotheses, and 2. NASA's 'theory' does not meet this criteria. The theory is that NASA faked the landings. This generates testable hypotheses like: "If the landings are fake, we should not be able to find detailed, hard to fake evidence like the telemetry data." If we can find the telemetry data, we can reject the hypothesis that the mission was faked. "If the landings are correct, we should not find inconsistencies in the photographic and video presented".

<dd>As I said, the Apollo saga is not a "theory", it's a set of events. The converse of the first "If", which you would like to use to imply fakery due to their absence, is not logically valid. The second "If" does not preclude fakery (or allegations thereof). To put it a little more tartly, they can't even tell if a flag is waving, so how easy would it be to fake some data for them? Therefore, the presence or absence of such data is irrelevant. The third "If" implies inconsistencies, which have been alleged but not demonstrated beyond doubt.

<dd>Point of clarification. Data doesn't get peer reviewed, published research does. So when you ask for peer reviwed data, you're demonstrating a lack of background on the subject that would seem fundamental to the discussion at hand. The bulk of published research generated by NASA will have been peer reviewed. That is how academic publishing works. You're likely wanting independantly generated data -- another matter entirely. The fact every scrap of this data doesn't exist (or has been lost) and that this lack is interpreted without rational support as being proof positive of a fraud on the part of NASA makes this discussion meaningless. You might as well be arguing over the socialogical impact of the diaspora of tree-ents from mirk wood to the shire. The thing over which you argue does not exist. The individuals with which you are arguing are not serious. They see this talk page as their soapbox. They aren't trying to improve the quality of this article, but to validate their extremist POV here on the talk page. Some sort of intervention is wanting, so that meaningful progress can be made. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 13:45, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, the "<i>hundreds of thousands of documents, videos, films, testimonies, financial records, engineering data and personal experiences of the Apollo program</i>" would be very convincing, if they wern't conveniently "<i>missing</i>".

<dd>Well, I think the blueprints and the development information is key. The testing and design work is a big part of it. That's the test between a mock-up for a movie, that has to look right, and a machine that really has to work. Examining how it was designed, and the itterative testing would be powerful proof. I'd say that testamony under oath from the people claiming to be on the moon would help, a sealed video unit and camera examined by a third party without tampering would help. Full telemetry data, and the hi-res video would be good.

<p>Pro-apollo people often mistakenly refer to photographic evidence as proof. The fact that photos can be doctored or shot in a studio is more than enough reasonable doubt to poke holes in the photographic evidence. Many of the photos have glaring discrepencies that can only be explained if they were fake. We know that they had the capabilities, and the facilities to make fake photos. For some reason they spent a lot of time and money building big hollywood sets and testing special FX. How does that help get them to the moon? The photos are not proof. There is no proof. There is a distinct difference between evidence and proof! My criteria for proving that we went to the moon are; Full transparency, third party independent auditors like ISO and ANSI and any world record organization, multiple onboard 24/7 live webcams (one pointed at earth, one pointed at moon, multiple inside capsule) that are inspected and sealed by independent third party auditors, a tracking beacon emitting on a special frequency that is installed and sealed by independent third party auditors, Quantum Entanglement experiments conducted in cooperation with numerous universities and science orgs during voyage, a sealed box (which nobody except independent third party auditors know the contents of) with various colored flares and lasers that can be seen from earth when set off on the moon, a volunteer news reporter chosen at random by independent third party auditors to tag along and report the voyage live, etc etc etc... There are a number of reasonable things NASA could have done to verify it, but they didnt. Any time somebody claims to make a huge accomplishment, you dont just take their word for it. If i claim to run a 3 minute mile, do you put that in the record books? or do you get an independent third party auditor (like Guiness book of World Records) to verify it?

<p>High quality video would have required hundreds of pounds for a Quad format VTR and tapes on the lander - but they brought back movie film that was of even higher quality, not to mention 70 mm stills.</p>

<dd>The "high quality" video they are talking about is simply somewhat higher quality than what was broadcast. And it is for the Apollo 11 moonwalk only - nothing else. If you read the links about it, you can see some Polaroid shots of that video. The contrast and detail is better. However, due to technical reasons (the antenna used), the actual video from Apollo 11 moon walk was transmitted at 10 frames per second. Normal television in most of the world uses 30 frames per second. 10 frames per second is very jerky. They put the 10 fps video on a monitor with long-persestance phosphors and used another TV camera to capture that monitor, at 30 fps to be broadcast, a live scan conversion (and recorded). The original 10 fps was also recorded on telemetry tapes (1 inch, 14 track analog tape). If that 10 fps tape is found, and can be played back, with modern technology a better quality video can be made than the old copy after the live scan conversion that we currently have. I contacted one of the people involved, and they are looking for the tape. If it turns up, will that convince you? <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 15:09, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From the beginning of the Apollo program there was some skepticism of it. In his book A Man on the Moon, Andrew Chaikin mentions that at the time of Apollo 8's lunar orbit mission in December 1968, such conspiratorial stories were in circulation. Several public media reports and artworks are believed to have helped to fuel the growth of the hoax accusations:</p>
<p>In 1967, British playwright Desmond Lowden wrote a play called The News-Benders, in which all major technological advances since 1945 were shown to have been simulated; the play was televised in January 1968 and showed a Moon landing faked with models.</p>
<p>Around the time of Project Apollo, while not asking about whether the landings were faked specifically, soon after the missions, Knight Newspapers (later to become Knight-Ridder) found that more than 30 percent of respondents to their poll were suspicious of NASA's trips to the moon.</p>

<p>The fact that these ideas were out there, in <i>some</i> circles, does not mean there was any notable or widespread consciousness of them in the minds of the <i>general</i> public. Very, very few would have seen that movie and said, "Oh, yeh, that looks like the moon hoax everybody's talking about." Because <i>very few were talking about it.</i> If it were the late 1970s, <i>maybe</i>. But not in 1971, while Apollo was still ongoing. Such an idea put out to the mainstream would have been met with peals of laughter. No, the hoaxsters waited until it was over to really push the idea... when it was "safe", because they knew there would be no more moon voyages to prove what morons they were. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 05:52, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm having trouble picking out good sources to use, which is why i'm not just being bold and making the change, but I think a section on the relationship of these accusations to the modern space program. Things like:</p>

<li>the quite public take offs and landings of the space shuttles.</li>

<dd>Yes, we need more controversy in this article. The hoaxsters have not had much to say about the shuttle, because it's an <i>ongoing</i> event. If they were to mothball it, then it wouldn't be too many more years before the hoaxsters would say that the shuttle, also, was fake; just as they did with Apollo, where they did not publish until they knew it was "safe" to make their accusations. They would further add that the apparent deaths from shuttle explosions were actually murders to silence potential whistleblowers. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:38, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>since this is apparently going to become a slightly POV talk, I'll go ahead an tell you that a great many of the people who beleive this stuff find the shuttle program much harder to refute because some of the results of the shuttle program are actually used by normal people(things like gps and sattelite TV, which simply could not work from the ground(while groundwave has a maximum range of 10 miles, it can't be used to determine direction, LOS is usually needed for that)) and most of the shuttle disbeleivers start getting into crazy super-disbeleivers who refute a good many commonly accepted scientific principles to prove their point. they are also far less common than the moon landing deniers.</dd>
<dd>however arguing over semantics which should be properly cited and explained is something that should be left to being presented by the more authoritative decriers and supporters of the relative subjects from properly cited sources. So, back to my original request, if you know any published information by skeptics or supporters alike that refer to the modern space program, i'd like to get a skeleton of this section started with proper citation. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 16:48, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Few people doubt the existance of the shuttle, but the reason is fairly obvious - there's no lie about it landing on the moon - NASA dare not try to pull a hoax like that these days, and is stuck with what it can actually <i>do</i>, not what it would like to <i>fake</i>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 01:37, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>please please please leave your arguments at the door(or metaphorical equivelants) you know quite well what you are saying is not defined fact. Many(might be pushing it, probably about the same number as the flat earthers) people DO beleive the shuttle missions are fake, just because you think they are wakko doesn't mean that they don't deserve mention as well. This proposed section isn't to harm your personal beleifs it's to discuss their connection with another set of beleifs, and also to bring up some issues given our modern capabilities with regard to space travel.

<p>Well, the fact that I haven't written anything on the topic of the space shuttle might be a tiny clue that you should polish up your reading comprehension skills. But, of course, you're not serious. You're simply being disruptive in hopes of maintaininig the status quo. your posts, as a whole, lack a quality called 'cohesion', meaning your responses don't address what came before them except in the most cursory way. Cohesion is required for true discourse. It is the ante. without it coversations don't happen. Exchanges that lack this quality of cohesion can not be deemed discussions in any meaningful way; without cohesion you have two primates barking at each other. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 13:14, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed. I'm afraid that I don't see any evidence whatsoever that Carfiend has any interest in improving Wikipedia, only in pushing their own agenda: this is rather strongly backed up by the fact that almost all of their edits are on this article. Since I haven't been here for long, I'm not sure what people are expected to do about someone who's impeding the improvment of an article, if they're too nice to get into a stupid edit war. But until and unless Carfiend stops preventing those improvements the page will continue to be a horrible mutant mess that benefits no-one who's actually interested in the truth. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 14:28, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I apologise - it was one of the other pro-NASA folks who said that. Still, no questioning of his nonsense from the pro-NASA camp. Anything, no matter how wrong seems to be fair game if it's from 'your' side. I can only reflect your accusations, and say that I have seen no evidence from you that you are doing anything but pushing your POV at all costs. You so rarely address issues of fact, so rarely present any practical change that would improve the article. Please. Show some good faith, address some issues of fact, or suggest some changes that imprvoe the article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 15:50, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>ok. First, <i>I</i> was the one who said that said that "many people" beleive that the shuttles are faked too. That isn't something I'd put into an article(weasel words) but the only person I've met in real life who beleived the shuttle landings were faked also beleived that the shuttles are equally fake. However, people I personally know aren't encyclopedic. Thus, I was trying to find out if anyone knew any potential source material of opinions. Secondly, if all arguments are given from the perspective of those who beleive them, there is no point of view. "Commonly accepted fact" isn't sufficiently FACT to be used in an article about what is, essentially, people disagreeing with commonly accepted fact.(2-5% dissent isn't very much). You can(and should) argue about who is a reliable source of opinions on these subjects, but it's not an attack or POV by wikipedia when an argument is attributed. Two diferent worlds. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 17:45, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A starting point could be to try to find a poll on the subject. This article cites various polls that claim that up to 30 percent have "some doubts" about Apollo. That doesn't mean that anywhere near 30 percent firmly believe it didn't happen, only that they have questions. It reminds me of when Garrison Keillor said a poll showed that something like 50 percent of the public "would 'consider' eating squirrel." It doesn't mean that 50 percent <i>actually would</i>. Anyway, maybe there's a poll lying around someplace about the shuttle program. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:18, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we were 'pushing our POV at all costs', there would be no conspiracy theorist claims on the page, just a big banner saying 'We went to the moon, dude'. In reality, we're merely trying to ensure the page gives a balanced view of the subject, and have tried to get to you discuss how to improve this page on a number of occasions. Currently the page is basically a long laundry-list of claims mostly from random web-sites and self-published books: that's not what Wikipedia is intended to be, nor is it your soap-box. We've pointed out that the page should be rewritten in a similar style to other conspiracy theory pages, but when people have tried to make a start on rewriting it, you delete their changes, even though the majority view here seems to be that it should be rewritten. As I said, I see no evidence whatsoever that you have any interest in improving this page. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 17:57, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A reliable and verifyable poll I cited in the article (I assume it is still there) says that 5% of Americans believe in the hoax, 89&amp; believe in the landing, and 6% aren't sure. An interesting thing is that this seems to be primarily an American phenomenon. A guy in Germany (sorry, I don't have a reference) estimated that fewer than 1% of the people in Europe believe in the hoax. It would be interesting to find such a poll. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 18:29, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The idea that we shouldn't care whether an article is factually correct or not is offensive. We should have a good intuitive sense of the veracity of something we write about. The problem on this page, and which is the usual starting point of these lengthy diatribes on the talk page, is that the hoaxsters claim the article is not "neutral". But their idea of "neutral" is to present <i>only their side</i> and take away the counterarguments, thus leaving the reader with the false impression that the questions the hoaxsters raise don't have reasonable explanations. Thus they hope to use this page as just one more recruiting tool for their little league of hoaxster conspiracists. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:29, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

How would I realistically verify a claim posted here saying that 'Joe Bloggs claimed that NASA never flew to the Moon because it's the land of pixies' in his self-published book 'Shut up, we never went to the moon, OK!'? At best you end up with 'On geocities.com/moonpixies.html, John Smith said that Joe Bloggs claimed that NASA never went to the Moon because it's the land of pixies', which is getting a bit silly. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a></dd>

<dd>Now the question of "verifiable" comes into play. OK. As you are suggesting, virtually everything the hoaxsters put forth is based on <i>their opinion</i> about whether the flights were "possible" or not, combined with their inability to interpret photographs and other evidence. The article then would come down to every line beginning with "Kaysing says this" or "Sibel says that". In short, the article would be about <i>those guys</i> rather than about the issue. Which might be a good thing, as those charlatans need some exposure for what they are (or were, Kaysing now being dead). <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:56, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, it means that you can verify that when someone posts 'Joe Bloggs says that NASA never went to the Moon because it's the land of pixies', that they actually did say that. It doesn't mean that you can verify that the Moon really is the land of pixies or that NASA never went there. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 19:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The next issue, then is the one of <i>notability</i>. Anyone can say anything, especially on the internet, so you can fully verify that, "Joe Bloggs says this", and then someone will say, "But he's not notable." Why? Because he has no expertise, no background on which to base an opinion... arguably, the same status as Kaysing, Sibel, etc.? No, because he's "not well known". The only reason those two yokels are considered "notable" is because they are famous... circular reasoning, ultimately. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:35, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe what Jim is saying is that the undue weight section of NPOV applies to this article as it currently stands. In that the article is almost completely made up of pro-hoax arguments. In particular, sections 5,6 and 8 constitutes the bulk of the article with minimal weight given to differing opinions. Especially given that the Apollo hoax claims are pseudoscience, the NPOV section on pseudoscience also applies. For these reasons, this article violates NPOV. And Wahkeenah, there is no need to use all caps. Please remain civil. Thanks. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:18, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you'll read the archives, you'll see that I was here before. But that's of no importance: you see, if I remember correctly, Wikipedia is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit, thus, if I stumble across an article that I think violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, I have every right to tag it. So, before your dudgeon gets too high, let's try to remember that <i><b>nothing</b></i> trumps NPOV -- not even some tenuous consensus you might have reached on the page. Whetever the pro-hoax people might think, the fact that theirs is a minority view (very much a minority view) means that the article cannot be a 50-50 split (or as it currently is, a 90-10 pro-hoax split).

<dd>Now, rather than squabble with me, why not try to make this article meet the various NPOV criteria.

<dd>Yes, and as others have said, you should read <i>undue weight</i> before you form your "beliefs", and consider the fact that there is no "historical record" aside from NASA's record. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 23:45, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've commented on your notion that there isn't a historical record a number of times, so you must know that I disagree with you. Simply repeating your mantra that there isn't one when faced with it is patently irrational. I accept that you don't believe it exists. Accept that I do. I've considered what you asked but am not convinced that you and I share enough common ground to discuss the matter. Please seriously consider my position as recorded above.

<dd>Yes, you've 'commented', but not, unfortunately, presented any independent evidence of human landing by non-NASA source. You can disagree all you like, but until you provide some evidence, you're pissing in the wind. It's not a matter of belief for me, it's a matter of evidence. There isn't any independent evidence of humans on the moon. You know that though. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 23:56, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Go to the library and read the magazines and newspapers from that era. There is a huge historical record. Your next comment will be, "NASA is the only source."

<p>I do not agree that the article gives undue weight to the hoaxster cons. There is a degree of editorializing against them, which I happen to agree with, but that doesn't matter; and every argument they put forth is clearly based on nothing except their imaginations. The article effectively shoots down everything the hoaxsters put forth. That's why many of them here (though not Canfield) have argued that the article is biased <i>the other way</i>. Putting the NPOV tag there accomplishes nothing except to invite further Edit Wars. The banner on the talk page says it's controversial, and that's true.

<p>I beleive the article gives the impression that there the idea of a moon hoax is an open question and that there is some sort of controversy surrounding it. In all candor, the article should clearly state that the hoax is the belief of a fringe group, headed by random intellectual/academic/media lightweights, and backed by souly by roundly debunked assertations by zealots who simply do not accept significant parts of what most people considered reality and the likely product of cold war big science paranoia. Every sentence should reflect that that. Other than that is should be all about the conpsiracy theories. See my talk page for the beginnig of just such a revision. 00:22, 2 August 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 00:27, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Carfiend, I've read undue weight. You seem to be taking the bits you quote out of context. Please stop that. Here are the partos of the policy that most specifically apply to the issue. This, by the way, is likely what tripped the Admin.&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents;</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(this includes the bit you decided wasn't quote worthy) <i>None of this is to say that tiny-minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can give them on pages specifically devoted to them. Wikipedia is not paper. But even on such pages, though a view may be spelled out in great detail, <b>it should not be represented as the truth.</b></i></li>
<li>(look how this sentence paraphrases my take on the moon hoax) <i>We should not attempt to represent a dispute as if a view held by a small minority deserved as much attention as a majority view, and views that are held by a tiny minority should not be represented except in articles devoted to those views.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing you've said addresses my position in any meaningful way. Further, the appropriate title ( and topic) for this article is Apollo Program Moon Hoax Conpiracy Theories. the term 'accusations' is less desirable for reasons I've stated clearly and repeatedly above. 00:40, 2 August 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 00:41, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It seems like your argument, essentially, is that although every one of the hoaxsters' ideas is shot down, the article still "dignifies" their claims somehow just by addressing them in such detail. Thus, the page could be editorially slanted against the hoaxsters, and yet give them undue weight, at the same time? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:45, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Wahkeenah, the article as it stands gives undue wieght to the hoaxsters because it presents their theories as somehow on par with the accepted historical record and fails to sufficiently contextuallize the hoax's adherents. This question: <i>the page could be editorially slanted against the hoaxsters, and yet give them undue weight, at the same time?</i> is probably true in an absolute sense but as a practical matter I beleive that it is the context of the laundry list and the false impression of balance it gives that damage the neutrality and validity of this article <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 00:56, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wahkeenah wrote: <i>Putting the NPOV tag there accomplishes nothing except to invite further Edit Wars. The banner on the talk page says it's controversial, and that's true.

The controversial tag, by comparison, does not display on the article itself. I honestly beleive the revision is more about an appropriate context via changes to structure and tone(see 'on methodologies' and 'conspiracy theories' above) rather that of radical changes to the content(though some subscetions may be warranted to cull donw the length of the article). <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 02:11, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Part of the problem here is that Pro-NASA people keep trotting out the same nonsense long after it has been de-bunked. They keep on trying to portray the controversy as a fringe, which it is not, they never admit the evidence against them (see above, and the discussion about whether there is independent evidence for a human landing - there clearly is not, but the Pro-NASA camp will never admit that), and they keep trying to wriggle out of addressing the issue on the page. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 15:04, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some thoughts</span></h2>
<p>Contrary to the comments that I dropped in here out of nowhere, I reiterate what I said in early June:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Every believer in any hoax theory I've ever run across has been woefully ignorant of basic science (especially that science disputed by the conspiracy theorists), math, politics, economics, etc. Were they not, they'd not make such glaring mistakes in developing their "proofs" of a hoax. -- For example, one of the earliest boners in the Apollo hoax theory was, "there are no stars in the background!" Duh, it's daytime! (Besides, given even the modest special effects used on Star Trek, the assumption that NASA would have been too dumb to put stars in the picture, <i>if they were supposed to be there</i> argues against a hoax as one cannot say, "they were too dumb to do a simple thing" and "they were really smart and could pull the wool over everyone's eyes".)</dd>
<dd>Re the former USSR of course adds another nail (or twenty) in the coffin of this conspiracy theory. As they were able to track, via radar, the entire mission, one thinks they'd've noticed, and commented upon, anything that was at variance with the Apollo missions landing on the moon. After all, this battle to land a man on the moon was a competition betwen the two countries, with national pride at stake. To think that they would just clam up if they knew that the mission was bogus (as they would have known) is to show a complete misunderstanding of the dynamic between the two nations. (As would including them in an ever-widening conspiracy).</dd>
<dd>Expected rejoinder: "But that they tracked the spacecraft to the moon doesn't mean humans were on board, so there!". Alas, the Russians also tracked the conversations between mission control and the men on the moon, and could very easily determine whence the source of those radio signals (it's a simple matter of triangulation).</dd>
<dd>Finally, all of the other nonsensical "evidence", if it were true, would have been noticed and pounced upon by the Russians. Alas, that they did not is an excellent indication that the "evidence" purporting to "prove" that man did not land on the moon, is bogus. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 21:26, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, it is you that has made the claim that no one in the history of the universe who believes the moon flights were a hoax has ever described it as a "conspiracy theory".

<dd>No, stating that there is no evidence for something obviously can' t be documented. So a statement like "There is no evidence that any major hoax proponent has ever used the term about themselves", or "there is no independent evidence that NASA ever went to the moon" are always shorthand for 'there is no known evidence.

<p><b>Answer:</b> You can <i>prove within reason</i> a negative by demonstrating that someone has performed a good-faith search to the extent that if the item in question existed, they would have a very high probability of finding it. For example, you can't just look at an unknown house and say "there is no evidence of people inside." But if you look in every room, and examine every area where a person might hide, then you could reasonably say so, and can document a failed search as evidence for a negative. This is labor intensive, and can never be perfect, (did you check for babies in the air ducts?) so the Burden of Proof is important. If someone wants to say "No one ever said..." then they must prove that real research failed to turn up an example. However "XXX seldom says..." requires proof that at least some XXXes did say it. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I had reworded it to say "the hoax accusers themselves typically do not use that label". If that one user still has a problem with it, I don't know what to do. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 08:51, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>However, consider the larger issue: That user has been insisting that every pro-Apollo generalization be backed up by a citation. Yet here he tries to impose a blanket statement which he asserts is true and which is clearly based on <i>his own experience</i>. This is technically called a "double standard". <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 09:10, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Furthermore, as I think about it, this is all a typical hoaxster red herring. The fact that they don't call it a "conspiracy theory" doesn't mean that it isn't one.

<dd>here's why I'd consider a distinction, one group is one <i>we</i> as encylopedists are identifying as important, specifically for their beleifs, and who is in that group is a fuzzy line(such as people who aren't sure either way). Their completeness cannot be defined therefore, so making any statements about all of them that aren't specifically about why we seperated them as that group are almost impossible, asside from those can can go without saying (e.g. they all live on earth). The other declaration, is that exact sort, they defend hold a certain poitn of view, because we've selected a subset of people based on <i>those that defend that view</i>. even making the claim that they defend it is pointless without going into how.<a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 16:29, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>of course, summary: "NASA proponents typically do not admit to the hoax." is self-defined. They would not admit to it because they <i>are</i> the proponents. The moment they say there's a hoax, they are no longer within that group. It's circular reasoning, unlike some random person somewhere calling themselves a conspiriacy theorist.

<dd>1. Hoax proponents typically do not use the phrase.</dd>
<dd>2. NASA staff typically do not admit to the hoax.</dd>
<dd>Now, let's look at the point, which is that you are applying a double standard. Obviously no one can prove that a person did not say something.

<dd>You're accusing others of not having a grip on logic? Are you kidding? The first statement may be a logical statement <i>assuming it's true</i>. The second statement is the picture-perfect example of <i>petitio principii</i> and <i>circulus in probando</i>. It's like saying "Mel Gibson has not admitted to being gay" -- duh, probably because he isn't (although in the wording, the accuser clearly asserts, absent any proof, that he is). <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 22:00, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both statements are true, except that the second statement contains a logical phallacy, in that it presupposes there is a hoax, which has not been proven.

<li>Wahkeenah, whether it <i>is</i> a conspiracy theory is not what's under question right now.</li>
<li>he did not make the point i was trying to. I was figuring you'd change it to "NASA staff". this again is different. because 1 is a group of people selected based on their opinion, an ephemeral and hard to determine concept. There is no grand list of them, and even if you queried all the known people who fit into that category, another could arrive who would call themselves a conspiracy theorist. What people are a member of NASA's staff is a determined finite set of people, who <i>can</i> be individually checked for quotes on file. Sadly, in my opinion, this means your comparison is still not valid. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 18:32, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I wouldn't assume that everything NASA ever did has been put online yet, so finding these tapes would mean going to an archive somewhere. You said you "have looked, and continue to look, for" the info. So tell us where you looked so far. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 05:51, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV part II</span></h2>
<p>Since the original discussion is getting bloated and heading off topic, let me elaborate on what I think is the issue here: Carfiend says that the page is neutral because both points of view are treated equally. The people claiming that the page violates NPOV believe it does so for precisely the same reason: by Wiki policy, Apollo-denial should be treated as a minority view that contradicts the scientific consensus. Hopefully someone will correct me if I'm wrong. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a></p>
<p>Mark's summary fits my understanding. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 16:43, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>WP policy does not say that minority views should not be given respect <i>on pages devoted to them</i> - the misunderstanding is about a piece in the NPOV policy that refers to minority views on main pages, for example, if the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Program_1d6c.html" title="Apollo Program">Apollo Program</a> page was predominantly about the hoax theory. It isn't. This page is about the hoax theory, and the policy people keep rolling out does not apply. Both points of view are represented here, but in many places it is stated that the hoax proponents are in a minority and have virtually no support in the scientific establishment. Since this page is about the hoax accusations, it is only natural that they are featured. NASA's POV is also represented. The POV warriors on that side think that this page, like <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Apollo_b4b9.html" title="Project Apollo">Project Apollo</a> should only present NASA's view. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 17:04, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm forced to agree with carefiend here. This is a topic where the minority view is the main point. It should still be painted as a minority(and scientifically unaccepted) view, and if that isn't the case, then it does indeed have an NPOV problem.</dd>
<dd>carfiend, I'm going to have to jump on you before(or even if) you jump on the "scientifically unaccepted" part of my comment. It's generally pretty well established as a precendent on wikipedia and elsewhere that scientifically accpted means peer reviewed science journal of a related field. There's all sorts of journals on this subject many of which support NASA's view on this matter, if you can find any articles suggesting otherwise from credible science journals, then we'll have a whole new flamewar on our hands that will just be deadly. to see what i mean, and research for yourself <a href="http://highwire.stanford.edu/lists/topic_dir/3007428/3007429/focus.dtl" class="external text" title="http://highwire.stanford.edu/lists/topic_dir/3007428/3007429/focus.dtl" rel="nofollow">check stanfords journals on space exploration</a>.</dd>
<dd>None of that means that the views of the minority should not be fully addressed and listed in the article about them, it only refers to the light in which portrayls should be made. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 18:39, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. This article should be about Apollo-denial as a cultural phenomenon, not a laundry list of arguments treated as the equal of the accepted scientific viewpoint. Compare it to other articles on similar topics. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 22:17, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Carfiend's summary does not entirely fit my understanding. Mark's is closer. The answer I am sensing a consensus developing around is to put the <i>examination of the arguments</i> within its own article, and leave this one clearly demarcated as a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metanarrative.html" title="Metanarrative">metanarrative</a>, describing the history of the story's existence and key events in its exposition (as exhaustively explored above). This has the advantage that, as for other <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">controversial items</a> on the 'pedia, we can accommodate passionate would-be contributors in an appropriate place, without adding to the credibility issues constantly faced by the 'pedia. This should suit editors on both sides - what purpose could it serve to maintain your views in a medium that's universally dismissed as lacking all credibility?</p>
<p>May I now take a straw poll on who would assent / object to my making such a split? If you are all at least open to the suggestion, I could then draw up a draft of the two emerging articles for you all to review. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 18:42, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I oppose this. It is an act of desparation by a group who cannot win their argument with facts. Please, I am appealing to any of you who are in good faith to work on issues of fact, like the telemetry above, instead of trying to undermine Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 18:47, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Strong oppose</b> It is agaisnt wikipedia NPOV policy to have a POV fork, where one POV is given it's own article and others are given another. I'd much rather see their claims and everything remain in this article, but present that this is not credible science under the most standard criteria for credible science(peer reviewed journals, experimentation, provable hypotheses). even a subsection that <i>is</i> a laundry list of claims would be ok, just not as a lead in to the article. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 18:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I obviously disagree that the issues are simply those of style for reasons I've given above. I don't think a weasel worded disclaimor at the beginning of the article 'fixes' the NPOV issue. With regards to the propsed fork,Doesn't this rule, <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>, apply? I assumed that a summary style (with attendant global fixes to the psychophrenic POV, oddly contorted phrasing, etc)was more in line with Adhib's proposal than the POV fork and would give space ( forgive the pun) to the airing of minutia. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 20:19, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, to address your factual error, SS is a guideline, not a rule. It's existance does not mean that every article needs to follow it. Secondly, what is 'weasel'y about the statement
<dl>
<dd>It is stated in the first paragraph that "<i>Nearly all interested scientists, technicians and space enthusiasts who have commented on the hoax accusations have rejected them as baseless.</i>"? It is a clear statement of fact. The kind of clear facts that the pro-NASA camp seem to loath. A POV fork will be against policy, and not help. Let's focus on making the article more factually correct.

<dd>I, too, am frustrated with this endless wrangling, which is why I am suggesting that as a way forward we focus on questions of fact, like, above, where are the telemetry tapes? I find it revealing that there is no interest in this question, while plenty of interest in arguing about pointless, inflamatory things. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 20:59, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I guess I need to know the magic words to ask the question. Do you think this guideline, <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a> might apply to Adhib's suggestion. It seems to apply to me and has the advantages I mentioned above. Here is a revision of the sentence I called weasel worded: ""<i>The mainstream scientific community have rejected the hoax theories as baseless,a view shared by the overwelming majortiy of the pulbic.</i>"" I prefer this one becuase it does not give the impression that disinterested scientists or those who have not commented have a good chance of accepting the hoax theories. I think much of the article is rife with gems just like the example. The rules, guildlines, and/or sky-writing on pseudoscience would seem to support the approach i've taken. Oh, and the telemetry tapes are missing and presumed lost as I understand it from the article. What else is there to say about it. They're lost. we can't analyze them. They don't support anyone's claim. And aren't we supposed to be discussing ways to improve the article in this space, not trying to prove one truth or the other? <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 21:09, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Oh, and the telemetry tapes are missing and presumed lost as I understand it from the article.</i> - per one of the people involved in the search, right now they're still expected to turn up: but there's still a possibility they really were re-used rather than stored in an unexpected place. Either way, it won't make a difference to the Apollo-deniers, because they'll just claim the tapes are fake when and if they do turn up. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 22:14, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, a failure to read the article and the comment in question. The article deals with Apollo 11, the status of the other tapes is unknown.

<dd>Carfiend, as is your habit, you completely ignored my first question <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>, which was my main one and most applicable to the topic under discussion, for reasons I don't care to guess at. on the other stuff: As you may remember, I was talking about weasel words and the sentence in question. I sought to remove them while keeping the sense of the sentence. I gave my rationale in brief above. Your opinion on the merits of either are your own, though I do think given the wikipedia take on pseudoscience my version makes sense and certainly reads better (minus the typoes of course)and will make more sense to the average reader(again see my rationale above concerning the spectre of all those disinterested, commentless hoax theory scientists and technications out there). As far as the tapes go, that discussion is best carried out in a section devoted to it, not in the current discussion about problems with the NPOV in this article. I suggest you start one and I'll, to the best of my ability, respond directly to as many of your questions as I have time and patience for -- a courtesy you have not afforded anyone here I'd remind you. Still, unless you have evidence that NASA made the tapes go missing for the reasons you are guessing at you're just dealing with an absence of available information not a evidence that proves the hoax theories. Again others have argued this fundamental point with you and you've rejected it. I've no expectation, given your behavior here, that my saying it again will sway you. You've got all the proof you need to convince yourself and you have [convinced yourself]. You should write a book on the topic or, as I've suggested before and as is echoed in some wikipolicies, guidelines, or informal praxis on bias and unbridled POV, perhaps a blog. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 22:29, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm still waiting for two answers from him: (1) if he were head of NASA on July 20, 1969, and knew for a fact that the Apollo program was for real and that men were on the moon, how would he prove it? and (2) where are the results of his research on the topics that interest him so much, such as the missing tapes? I heard they were recycled, and that the 2001 Fox program was inadvertently taped on one of them.

<dd>It's been archived somewhere by the looks of it. Off the top of my head, I suggested that ways to do this would be stratgies like: 1. Having the astronauts respond to some third party generated information, like a major newspaper headline (something that could not have been predicted days or weeks in advance, when the footage would have been filmed. 2. Taking a third party sealed camera, that could not be tampered with easily. 3. Have another arbitrary object like a newspaper appear in the moon footage that was given to the crew by a third party just before the launch, again, to avoid the footage having been filmed in advance.</dd>
<dd>As I say, these are off the top of my head, so I don't want to go into whether or not each could be faked too, obviously that's a fruitless discussion - the point is that there would be some third party coroboration of NASA's story with these approaches. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 02:52, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see. And if it had ever occurred to them that people would be debating this 37 years later, maybe they would have. At the time, there seemed no need to. Just like there is no apparent need to do that for the shuttle. However, maybe someone could go through the transcripts and see if they <i>actually did</i> make reference to current events. Not that that would prove anything, as they could be doing it live on a soundstage, vacuum-sealed to ensure that the flag never moves (which it didn't, once they planted it firmly). <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:17, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's an interesting hypothesis! The hoax theory says the landings were filmed, probably weeks in advance. That would predict that there would be no mention of events that occured after the filming. If they <i>did</i> mention something that happened after the launch, it would be powerful evidence for the launch. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 03:29, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just assumed that's what you were driving it. But the theory of filming weeks in advance is based on nothing, so it is just as plausible to suppose that the "simulated" moonwalks were done <i>live</i> in a studio. Keep in mind that what we saw initially was TV video, not film. So it could very easily have been done live. It also just occurred to me that the first thing Armstrong said when he stepped off the LM was "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind", flubbing his line by failing to say "for <b>a</b> man", and with static almost drowning out the last part of the sentence.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Positive Evidence for the hoax</span></h2>
<p>The 'evidence' on this page seems to focus on perceived gaps in the historical record and bits of unconnected trivia that seek to negate the 'truth' around the various Apollo landings. My question is this: Is there any evidence that actually points to the hoax? Any evidence of action/actors taking part in a cover-up? Any evidence of a conspiracy? I'm not asking for 'questions' about the completenesss of NASA's records or uninformed speculation on various pieces of hair or bits of dust in the photos, or the ridiculous questions about why stars don't show up in the photos -- we've seen enough of that. I'm asking for a single piece of semi-credible evidence that indicates, directly or indirectly, the conspiracy occured.

<p>His answer is exactly what I expected: NASA is the only source (which is untrue on its face) and the burden of proof is somehow on NASA, despite the fact that the hoaxsters have yet to present <i>any</i> evidence contradicting the conventional history of the Apollo program. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:51, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Talk about beating a dead horse - we just had this discussion in the "Independent confirmation" topic above, and everything you suggested might convince you already exists. Then you redefined your requests into impossibility, and started blanket-denying the existence of all sorts of stuff without evidence, and generally started saying that Nasa ought to be treated like known criminals. The hoaxers endlessly lie about evidence and credentials. (see Bart Sibrel stalking astronauts) When did Nasa ever lie about anything?

<dd>it has been noted above that no 'independant' evidence, that the hoaxers would find credible, does or can exist -- possibly due to the fact that NASA didn't see the need for it and partly becuase of the practical problems associated with getting independant evidence from the moon --but that evidence that most people find credible and convincing does -- again, see above. We can argue about whether that evidence 'proves' anything till the cows come home to no good effect -- that is the very nature of debates surrounding conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. I'll remind you that NASA is not a monolith and information from that organization comes from a host of individuals, who in their role as scientists and academics, do have a sort of intellectual independance built into the context academic/research institution --another point that you have at least tactily dismissed, but that seems reasonably compelling to others. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 15:32, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe a good way to summarize this argument would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The evidence supporting the Apollo flights is <i>incomplete</i>.</li>
<li>The evidence contradicting the Apollo flights is <b>nonexistent</b>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I think a better way to characterize it would be:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The evidence supporting the Apollo human landing is incomplete and comes from only one source.</li>
<li>The evidence contradiciting the Apollo human landing is suggestive and circumstantial.</li>

<p>There are many citations here and in the article of other sources besides NASA tracking the flights. To keep saying NASA is the only source is untrue and typical hoaxster dis-information. The only "evidence" appearing to contradict the Apollo chronology is from a combination of ignorance and willful deception practiced by guys like Kaysing. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:05, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So what is the hoaxster response to the idea (which seems true on it's face) that NASA isn't a hive mind or that a swarm of sub-contractors and academics also contributed to the program? This question certainly goes to the intent of independant verification misconception, and should, as a practical matter, have implications on the way the evidence is presented in the article itself. Thus, the question would seem to have a direct bearing on the topic at hand and the required scope of such a conspiracy, as is pointed out in several anti-hoax sources, would seem prohibitive and its long-term success unlikely.

<li>The answer is: <b>None of the above!</b> It was a <i>trick question</i>. In his book, Kaysing said that he decided <i>beforehand</i> that no one was going to the moon. All of this "evidence" came afterward. Kaysing seemed to know about <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">truthiness</a> more than 35 years ago!

<ul>
<li>Why am I not the least bit surprised? This confirms my suspicions about Kaysing. He probably hatched this plan the day he was canned. He waited until it was "safe", when he knew there would be no more flights, and also rode the crest of the wave of conspiracy theory stuff published in the mid-1970s, centering on JFK, Vietnam, Watergate, etc. -- a context which the young hoaxster cons are unaware of because they were mere infants then, if anything. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:47, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Surely the subject of the article is (very simplified) "there are some people who believe that the 1969 Apollo landing was a hoax; these are the reasons they present; here are the counter arguments."

Surely it would have been much easier for NASA to have said that "for technical reasons we are sending an inhabited rocket to the moon to place a number of locator/marker beacons before the 1960s are out, and actual men on the moon by (say) mid 1972 using those beacons" - would remain within the spirit of <a href="../../../j/f/k/JFK_e817.html" title="JFK">JFKs</a> remark, and would involve far less hassle than a global cover-up. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackiespeel_edf5.html" title="User:Jackiespeel">Jackiespeel</a> 17:04, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The hoaxsters cite various alleged "anomolies" in photos in support of their argument. The bulk of their argument against the flights stems from Kaysing's pre-judgment that it "wasn't possible". They start with that premise and look for "clues" in support of that judgment. That's the basis and the essence of the hoaxster conspiracists' "theory". Lacking any direct evidence, they also throw red herrings out there, such as arguing that somehow NASA needs to "prove" what those of us who lived through that era already feel satisfied is true. Their arguments don't stand up to logic. To film the walking on the moon, they would have to have been working in an airless environment to keep the flags motionless, as they remain through the entirety of the moonwalks on the films. They would also have to have launched all manner of orbiting and soft-landing craft to the moon, which the hoaxster cons do not deny they did, as a total ruse. They also knew how to do rendezvous and docking. They planned the flights around the Van Allen belts to keep exposure to a minimum. Everything they needed to do to go to the moon, land, and return, they knew how to do. Kaysing's original premise, that it wasn't possible, is false, and therefore his entire argument has no logical basis. But the hoaxsters continue down that garden path, and that's why there are constant wranglings over the wording of this article. They want to present <i>only their side</i>, with no response, leaving the false impression that there really is something to their argument. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:26, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To answer your question "has anyone come up with even a photograph that has been tidied up?" Yes - there is one. The only one to my knowledge that has been tidied up is the famous one of Buzz Aldrin, in the "photographs" section of the main article. It was tidied up by adding black area at the top because the original frame cut off at the top of his helmet. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 04:37, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My suggestion to follow a model for article structure, deployed with some success <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">elsewhere</a> on wikipedia, in the spirit of the guideline <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">Summary style</a>, has got somewhat lost. I'm proposing we do this in order to de-escalate the endless warfare this topic attracts, to stabilise the common ground (which is that the idea exists, has a particular history, and some notable characters), and place the 'examination of the arguments' piece in its own space, with ample room for perpetual fisticuffs. I'm not seeking permission to make wholesale changes - just asking if you'd mind me drafting what such a model would look like in this case, for consensus-gathering. So: Can I request further comments on this motion <b>and this motion only</b> in this new section - otherwise they'll get lost? So far I have -</p>

<li>Carfiend opposes - seems to him to be a desperate measure I'm resorting to to evade his mastery of <b>facts</b>.</li>

<p>Maybe the following observation will help placate some hoax proponents who feel strongly about the repeated use of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> article as a reference: If you take a look at the entries for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Apollo_b4b9.html" title="Project Apollo">Project Apollo</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, you will notice that these DO follow broadly the same pattern, apart from a different ordering.</p>

<p>In no way does this imply that NASA and Nazis have anything in common, it merely mirrors the fact that Apollo and the Holocaust are the same type of thing at a superficial level - namely projects.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A difficulty of this article in particular</span></h2>
<p>This talk page repeatedly has subsections where someone says "Side X does not address claim Y." I have noticed no helpful article development resulting from these sorts of subsections. Particularly, there have been no true documented debates on this issue, which makes specific oppurtunities for anyone to address those concerns specifically as those concerns quite rare. The article, as it stands, expects a format where all claims are expected to be addressed. As I mentioned, there is no NPOV way of managing that. This is where I think all the "undue weight" concerns stem from. My reconmendation is the "complete list of claims" type sections be changed into "characteristic" or "common" claims, to help address the <i>Notion</i> of types of concerns, which would give the reader a more concise and clear understanding of the objections. I'm basing this off the fact that Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information, and this article should focus on helping clarify things from a <i>reader's</i> perspective. I'd like some feedback on whether this would actually address the tension found in the article and whether it would improve the quality of wikipedia(and keep in the spirit of the wikipedia project). This would result in some NPOV concerns if done blindly so careful examination of the article should be done first. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 20:14, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually, considering the inflammatory and condescending attitude of many of the other pages on <i>both</i> sides, from Sibel to Plait, this article is one of the <i>least</i> offensive writeups on the net, as I see it.

<dd>As has been discussed ad naseum above it is the structure, composition and tone of the article that violate NPOV and quality standards. The tags are useful because they bring new eyes to these issues. Seemingly naive questions like these make the idea of never archiving anything on these pages relatively appealing. Please consult any one of the three or four discussions labeled NPOV.<i>n</i> <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 02:06, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Parallax argument</span></h2>
<p>One of the rebukes in section 6.4.3 claimed that stellar parallax is undetectable with an Earth-Moon baseline. While this is most likely true for the technology in question, it is not true in principle. I tentatively changed the paragraph to incorporate this. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETeraBlight_e6e3.html" title="User:TeraBlight">TeraBlight</a> 08:00, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. No evidence is presented for the inability to make parallax deteriminations, as usual. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 14:49, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you look closely at the posting, it does not contradict the practical answer given. No human is going to be able to just look at the photos and see a difference in parallax. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:04, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But the claim that is made is that an astronomer could detect the parallax mistakes. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 15:26, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No one - not even astronomers - would be able to detect that tiny parallax in the Apollo photos. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 00:49, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The resolution of camera lenses are more than a factor of 1,000 from what is needed to capture a parallax that small, and film has considerably less resolving power than the lenses. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 00:58, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To put it in perspective (no pun intended), suppose you were taking a photo of something one mile away, in front of very distant objects. Now you move the camera 1/100,000,000 of a mile to the side (about 6/10,000 of an inch) and took another photo. Would you be able to that the position of the object one mile away had shifted? And that is for the nearest star, and almost all stars are much farther away than that. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 01:03, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And this is also assuming that the astronauts are rock steady when taking the photos. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 02:20, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article has gone to the dogs</span></h2>
<p>This article right now is horrendous because it is bending over backwards spoonfeeding hoax believers mumbo-jumbo with no attempt to actually describe the main subject which is the hoax accusations and their context. Detailed arguments have no place in Wikipedia and the tit-for-tat call-and-response is out-of-line. There is no other article on Wikipedia that has this sort of writing style for good reason: it is editorially quite poor. Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> policy does not mean equal time, nor does it mean that we need to give each perspective a "sounding board". I recommend trashing the entire article and starting from scratch describing the moon hoax conspiracy theories with the notable proponents and the plain facts regarding the general incompetence of the proponents and the fact that their ideas are not taken seriously. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 22:37, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I started trying to do that by revising this page, but things got busy at work and I lost enthusiasm after a few hours of trying to make sense of Apollo-denial nonsense: if anyone wants to take over what I started, it's at <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_HoaxRe-Edit_4bac.html" title="User:Mark Grant/HoaxRe-Edit">User:Mark_Grant/HoaxRe-Edit</a>. One of the big issues with the current page is that the nonsense is spread across the article so you never get a sense of just how nutty these people are or how little sense their 'theories' make: concentrating their arguments into one place makes it far more obvious and demonstrates the huge inconsistencies even between different Apollo-deniers, let alone between them and reality. At an absolute minimum some of them must be wrong because they can't all be right. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 22:55, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the article has gone down hill in the past several days with the general trend of edits leaning towards the hoax proponents. I believe, Adhib, was going to attempt a draft (see the tow straw polls above) that would have addressed the issues raised about but that seems to have petered out. I've begun two separate wholesale revisions as well. one shot down in POV jihad flames, the other remains dead on my talk page. Maybe we could start with an outline and break up the work. Failing that, calling attention to the issues seems to be a good start. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 23:28, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nonsense. The general trend is towards less editorializing, and more referenced facts. Your problem is that the facts do not favor your beliefs. I cannot help you with that. The article, however, is gradually getting better. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 23:34, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Your problem is that the facts do not favor your beliefs.</i> Exactly, your claimed 'facts' do not: which is precisely why it's NPOV, as we've discussed before. Apollo-denial is minority pseudoscience, and should be treated as such. As I pointed out above, the only thing we can safely say about the Apollo-deniers is that at least some of them <i>have to be wrong</i>, because their own claims contradict each other. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 23:42, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I won't speculate on the nature of her <i>problem,</i> though I will point out that, in the event that she is human like the rest of us, her 'beliefs' are not infallible and thus, as I've suggested above, perhaps it wouldn't hurt for her to consider her own bias before posting attacks like the one above. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 23:48, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, I've made a first pass at re-ordering things into what I think is a more rational format.

<dd>You've hit upon something important, that the various "theories" are the products of the imaginations (or "connecting the dots", to be more charitable) of these individual writers.

<p>Right, but I definitely think the minutia -- various pieces of disputed or missing evidence should be retained too, perhaps in the context of who says what. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 01:34, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
