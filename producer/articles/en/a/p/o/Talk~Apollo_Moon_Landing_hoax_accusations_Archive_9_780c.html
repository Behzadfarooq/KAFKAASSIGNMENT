<h2><span class="mw-headline">A note to new users</span></h2>
<p>Wikipedia is not a soapbox for your idea. You do not have a right to post here without inconvenient facts compromising your vision. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. Its articles are required to have a neutral point of view. This does NOT mean that we are supposed to make every idea sound equally plausible - it means that different explanations of events must be treated with equal scrutiny. Simply posting the hoaxers claims would turn the article into its own subject. It would be the same as an article on 'Alice in Wonderland' that did nothing but repost Louis Carroll's original text. that is not what an encyclopedia does.</p>
<p>There is no hoax theory. Search the web, and you will only find endless imagined "flaws in Nasa's evidence" that do not hold up to scrutiny. Despite requests by other editors, the many hoax proponents here have yet to produce any complete narrative of what they think happened. That is a central fact of the article, and is why this article is not titled "hoax theory", but Hoax Accusations. This article is therefore about a belief, and those who advocate it. We question the belief. The article on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> questions him too, so that is not unusual. A coherent "story of Jesus" exists, and can be referenced and discussed, but no one has found a similar "story of the hoax" anywhere, so there is nothing to write about here but shooting down hoax claims, and reporting on the tactics of hoax proponents.</p>
<p>Many of the discussions here tend to repeat themselves, which makes "assuming good faith" difficult. (But still we try.) We asked a previous hoax proponent what would satisfy him that a moon landing did occur, and after some difficulty understanding the question he produced a list of items that did, in fact exist, but he refused to acknowledge. Requests for non-nasa evidence have been answered multiple times. Before you start a new subject, please read through the archives to see if the answers to your questions have been posted before.</p>

<dd><i>There is no hoax theory.</i> Indeed. When I was trying to rewrite the article to meet NPOV and be less cluttered with pointless argument/counter-argument, the biggest single problem was that there is no consistent theory that makes any sense which can be discussed in the article. Even the different accusations from different Apollo-deniers are fundamentally incompatible (e.g. their claims vary from the Apollo astronauts never going into space at all up to them landing on the Moon but the footage being faked). It's incredibly difficult to make a sensible article out of something that makes no sense. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 12:09, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Awesome photo. I just downloaded it for my wallpaper. It also serves an educational purpose, as it mentions the issues with trying to photograph bright objects (such as the earth, the moon, and rocket scientists) and dim objects (such as stars and hoaxsters) in the same photo (if that was a personal attack on anyone reading this, I'll issue an apology at a later date). <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 06:19, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The latest hoaxer lunacy</span></h2>
<p>Broodlinger has created this: <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon_Hoax_Theory_0ab9.html" title="Moon Hoax Theory">Moon Hoax Theory</a>. It is simply this article with anything critical of the hoax removed, and a few new made-up ideas, like the notion that "setting the exposure to a few seconds" IN BROAD DAYLIGHT would somehow produce a usable image with stars and astronauts together. (Has no hoax proponent ever used a camera?) Speedy delete? Or should we go through the regular process? <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 21:00, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I had wondered what happened to that character. Among his rants there was actually one key bit of useful information: That he did not "understand" the explanations. Aside from affirming what I have always suspected about hoaxsters, i.e. that they have an inherent lack of understanding of how things actually work, it makes me wonder if there should, in fact, be a separate page that goes into lengthy detail about each issue for those who want to feel enlightened, and on the current page maybe a single-line response to each of the questions, that a 4-year-old child and/or hoax believer could understand. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:31, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Quoting from that talk page <i>meant to differentiate from "Apollo Moon Landing Hoax Accusations," which is heavily monitored by NASA officials</i> .

<dd>I think we should seriously consider that <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon_Hoax_Theory_0ab9.html" title="Moon Hoax Theory">Moon Hoax Theory</a> is intended as a joke. For instance <i>This UV photo taken from the moon is of poor quality and seems a token effort to disprove the star theory.</i> This photo taken by Apollo 16 astronauts <i>from the Moon</i> is supposed to disprove that astronauts went to the moon. If today were <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Fool%27s_Day_5641.html" title="April Fool's Day">April Fool's Day</a>, I'd be sure that it was an intentional joke. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 04:32, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hard to tell if it's an <i>intentional</i> joke. Keep in mind, Ed Wood was <i>sincere</i> about <i>Plan 9 from Outer Space</i>. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:45, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>This raises a dilemma. It should probably be deleted as unencyclopedic and a POV rant, yet it also provides a place for the hoaxsters to go and post their lunacy (kind of like having a compost heap some distance from the house)... and if it's as silly and self-contradictory as you say (it's not on <i>my</i> watch list, so I don't know), maybe it serves to undercut itself.</dd>
<dd>OK, I went to that page, and I see that another user added a link about the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Moon_Hoax_d6df.html" title="Great Moon Hoax">Great Moon Hoax</a> of the 1830s. That's an entertaining bit of reading that nicely complements the absurdity of that new page.</dd>
<dd>By the way, I have to confess that I am not only a NASA official, I actually operate NASA, from my shack disguised as an ice-fishing hut, here in the Frozen North. This is where we faked all the moon photos. Those hills in the background of the various photos are actually heaps of snow. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 06:34, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What do you call a common belief with no evidence to back it up? A myth.</span></h2>
<p>A <a href="../../../m/y/t/Myth.html" title="Myth">myth</a>, in popular use, is something that is widely believed but false. Wiktionary defines it as "<i>A person or thing existing only in imagination, or whose actual existence is not verifiable.</i>" One of the characteristics of some of the well known ones is that they are widely believed, usually on the basis of some dubiouis photos or other 'evidence' that cannot be corroborated by independent third parties.

<p>Gravitor, the reason you can't see any evidence is that you don't understand what <i>evidence</i> is. You clearly have an emotional interest in believing that the landing never happened, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Gravitor" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Gravitor" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> but no justice system on earth ever required anyone to prove a case to the opposing party! Like this discussion, such a trial would never end. In this case, the public is the judge.</p>
<p>Your side has had no difficulty stating its case. You've had web sites, books, this article, and even a show on FOX. The size of the <i>Apollo hoax in popular culture</i> section makes it clear that the general public is well aware that some people doubt the moon landing. Polls show that the public has heard your arguments, and doesn't buy them. The only exception are a few fringe elements who have reasons to hate science, America, rational thought, or whatever. Pulling dishonest tactics like denying the existence of 'verbal assault' or insisting that 'wired' is not a source will only dig you deeper into the hole you have dug for yourself, and make people less likely to listen to you about anything.</p>
<p>I've given the hoaxers plenty of fair chances to convince me of their case, and I have seen nothing but willful ignorance of science, rationalizations, and wild accusations from them, while NASA's version of events is a much better match with my personal experience of how the world works. That's why I believe.

<dd>There is no independent verification of the moon landing. That is a fact. Whether it was fake or not remains to be seen. NASA in 2009 will crash land into the moon.

<li>There is plenty of independent evidence: Amateur astronomers around the world could see the Apollo capsule in their telescopes and could NOT see it in earth orbit as the hoaxers claim it was. Moon rocks have been analyzed by thousands of people. They can reflect lasers from mirrors placed on the moon. Nasa has an untarnished reputation for honesty, even when the truth isn't kind, such as the challenger disaster. Compare this to hoaxers who routinely lie about basic science, like how photography or the Van Allen radiation belts work.

<dd>1. <i>Amateur astronomers around the world could see the Apollo capsule in their telescopes and could NOT see it in earth orbit as the hoaxers claim it was.</i> I can find one account of an amateur astronomer who saw an unidentified object where NASA said the capsule should be. No evidence has been presented that anyone looked for it in earth orbit. This is not proof of human landing.</dd>
<dd>2. <i>Moon rocks have been analyzed by thousands of people.</i> NASA controls all the moon rocks, and no one has anything to compare them to. In adition, this is not proof of human landing.</dd>
<dd>3. <i>They can reflect lasers from mirrors placed on the moon.</i> This old saw! You know that mirrors on the moon are <b>not</b> proof of human landing!</dd>
<dd>4. <i>Nasa has an untarnished reputation for honesty, even when the truth isn't kind, such as the challenger disaster.

<p>There are people who think that the 1969 landing was a hoax, and present a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>Remember the saying "don't assume malice when stupidity or forgetfullness will suffice" - and this applies as much to NASA as anyone else.

<p>Sorry for my poor tactic with the reverts. I was hasty. I agree that there needs to be copy editing, though was concerned when several of the edits seemed to follow a familar pattern -- I was likely mistaken. In particular though, changes to the wording on the introduction and the removal of the NPOV tag seemed unsatisfactory. I'm not sure what else needs to be said other then looking at the various and lengthy discussions on the talk pages -- we talk through this every other week. Not much has changed. Go read about it. If your sincerely interested in improving the article, I'd be glad to participate in a thorugh going attempt. I advocate looking at wp:ss for direction in that regard.

"These claims are widely dismissed as baseless by NASA and interested members of the mainstream scientific and technical communities." back to "Members of the mainstream scientific and technical communities who have commented reject the claims as baseless."?

<dd>Stages? More space program metaphors. Kudos. OK, at the risk of sounding like the Hoaxster Club, what citations do we have to support <i>either</i> of those statements, or are they simply our home-grown summary/conclusion based on the details of the article? As I recall, this opening line has been debated before, due to that same general question. It's a given that NASA would dismiss the hoax story as baseless, so that part is not really informative, although it's certainly verifiable. "Interested members" vs. "Members... who have commented" was a sticking point before. How do we determine for sure who is "interested"? The answer would seem to be, <i>by citing those who have commented</i>. So while I think calling the first one POV is overstating it, the second one is arguably on "safer" ground because it at least implies citations which presumably are elaborated upon in the article or its footnotes. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:51, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If someone has not spoken up against the conventional history, then the legal maxim of "silence implies consent" would seem to apply. Logically, though, you can't draw any conclusions about someone who does not speak up, so I don't think it implies that they support the hoax. However, now that you've pointed this possible dilemma out, it's time for Guinnog to weigh in. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:43, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Carfiend, This is weasel wording. there are two implications in this sentence that you can not make without references:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) Everyone supporting NASA is "interested" or in some way tied to NASA.</dd>
<dd>2) "who have commented" implies that those who have NOT commented might have different things to say. (Implied suppression of decent, as opposed to not wanting to waste time on crackpots.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You must supply references to these statements if you want language that implies this.</p>
<p>Of course, both of these are plainly false. Russia, China, Europe and Japan all have space programs. Bush less popular then Bin-Laden even in Europe, and his "science" on global warming is the laughing stock of the scientific world. The idea that these same scientists would be afraid to question NASA is ludicrous. If real evidence of a hoax came up, they would have nothing to loose by exposing it. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 21:37, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the term "interested" was originally intended to mean "interested in the subject", not financially or politically invested in it. That discussion was floated some months back, before the user called Carfiend made himself known under that name. But if it's confusing or ambiguous, then it should be reworded. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 21:53, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There was a totally pro NASA version up there. I edited to one that is arguable more neutral. See my comments above for my objections to the version floated here. The sentence should say something like most/many scientists reject the claims out of hand. That's the truth. Find one reputable qualified person that says otherwise. Wakeenah, yeah, I work and started going back to school (Ph.D in hoaxology)so I had to concetrate on some of those details<a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 00:16, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ixnay of the "who-have-commented" -fay[?]. Are you really asking me or just messing around? I ask because I addressed the 'who have commented' above at YOUR prompting.

<p>Can you propose an alternative wording you would be happier with then? "who have commented" (no hyphens) seems NPOV to me.

<p>The present version seems OK to me. What about it don't you like? "The hoax claims are generally dismissed as baseless by knowledgable scientists, technicans and engineers." Generaly is weaker than widely. "Knowledable" isn't the precisely right adjective, but i couldn't think of another and it seems to need one. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 01:26, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I said at the top what the problem with "who have commented" is. Why did we loose "worldwide"? Are their non-US hoax proponents published? "Orthodox" is a bit strange - applying a religious term to science, but I can live with it. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I don't like "Orthodox", as it does carry a religious implication with it. If anything, it's the hoaxsters' conspiracy theory that has a "religious" aspect to it. It's probably also untrue. "Mainstream" or "conventional" might be better. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 09:54, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd be ok with "The hoax claims are generally dismissed as baseless by mainstream scientists, technicans and engineers." I got rid of "world-wide" when I added the quotes back to the gallup "overwhelimnig majority" quote. I thought that "world-wide" combined with univerally made it sound as if we all knew that every single scientist everywhere had dismissed it. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 14:27, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Erm, no. What right do you have to speak for people who have not commented? Also, what is your definition of 'mainstream'? Presumably, those who agree with you.

<p>I think the headers are part of a larger problem that those sections have. That problem is bloat. I'd like to see each of the major sections pared down to a paragraph of two which summarize the basis of the tit for tat laundry lists currently in those sections. -- maybe a 'tit' paragraph followed by a 'tat' paragraph for each of the major sections.

<p>Hi, I'm a third party who came into this with no opinion on the subject. After reading it, I don't believe their was any conspiracy or large scale hoax. However, one thing I didn't like was that some of the examinations were placed in italics, which gives them an unfair stylistic "authority." You should keep the claims and the italic examinations in the same paragraphs. Aside from that, good job.</p>

<p><b>Until sunstantial changes are made to the article, please refer on appropriatley directed questions related to the NPOV tag to the text below.</b></p>
<p>I think the NPOV tag is helpful. The tit-for-tat structure of the article doesn't properly contextualize the hoax as a social phenom and variously gives <b>undue weight to one extreme or the other.</b> Perhaps you can see it this way: the tits and the tats, taken together, result in some bizarre chimera of fact, fiction and fantasy that is sure to (snd seems to be designed to) frustrate, confuse, and mislead the casual reader. I've said as much in various ways a half dozen times on this very talk page and, in fact, on more than one occasion to the very editor who posed the question. I believe the content and tenor of these talk pages, in those rare places that they actually reference the article, bears this out. There you have an answer as to why I think the NPOV tag is valid that is both civil and direct. Let's talk about <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a> and how it can help us out of this mire. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 01:59, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't agree with you about the NPOV tag, though I do agree that there are some problems with the way the article is presently structured. I tend not to like the tit-for-tat approach myself and I would rather it was written more concisely in ordinary prose. You're always going to have the problem on an article like this, as with the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loch_Ness_Monster_861a.html" title="Loch Ness Monster">Loch Ness Monster</a>, that beyond, as you say, its existence as a social phenomenon, the article is going to largely consist of information that debunks the subject of the article. That isn't a failure of NPOV, but a failure of the subject of the article to demonstrate verifiable evidence of its existence. People who <b>believe</b> in the phenomenon are maybe going to be disappointed in the balance the article takes, but the undue weight bit of the NPOV policy applies here.</dd>

<dd>Smith Jones, while I agree in principal that the article has NPOV issues, you might look over the various requests for pro-center-con <b>independant evidence</b> on the talk pages (yep, there is eight pages of them. Your best bet is to scan them for words like <i>independant evidence</i> and <i>proof</i>) and the <b>burden of proof</b> section in the article itelf. Basically, you seem to be asking to prove a negative. That has not been done (perhaps about anything ever) in an absolute sense. You might as well ask if Santa Claus has been <b>proven</b> to be imaginary. We can debunk the physics behind flying reindeer, point to the cultural forces that formed the santa claus myth, draw back the curtain and show that other actors, parents, are in fact manufacturing evidence of Santa Claus and, finally, even look at the north poll in vain hope of finding evidence of Santa's workshop, but all of that doesn't <b>prove</b> that Santa does not exist. Same with the moon hoax. One way out of this quagmire would be to present positive evidence that a hoax does exist. Such evidence would, by its very nature, blow the debunkers out of the water. This evidence has also <b>not</b> been produced. The proving a negative question set aside however, if you have other things which you think should be included in the article by way of obviating the "magnificent job" you believe this article does "of ignoring the opinions of many people -- both laymen and scientists" by all means present it. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 11:28, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Funny! Yes, you might look at the requests for <b>independant evidence</b>, and notice that none has been presented! The Santa Claus thing is relevant, but you have it the wrong way roudn. NASA has claimed something fantastic, but offered no independent verification. The hoax allegations are most like those emails that go around that say that if Santa existed, his speed would cause him to catch fire - they point out what's ridiculous about the myth. By the way - Santa's workshop is area 51&#160;! <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 15:37, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, it has been proven by any rational standard that the hoax accusations have no merit. The only reason this article even exists is that hoax proponents set themselves up as both prosecutor and judge. You only need to look at Carfiend for an example. We have given him plenty of <b>independent evidence</b>, and he dismisses it out of hand - it seems he will be satisfied with nothing short of people standing on the moon watching Apollo come down! We once asked him what HE would accept as evidence, and he really couldn't come up with any ideas about how to make a moon landing provable - he listed requests for things, and when we showed him that what he wanted already existed, he dismissed it anyway. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations/Archive_7#Independent_confirmation" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations/Archive_7#Independent_confirmation" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations/Archive_7#Independent_Evidence_for_NASA.27s_human_landing" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations/Archive_7#Independent_Evidence_for_NASA.27s_human_landing" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<p>When it comes to pro-hoax accusations, his bias is equally absurd. Recently, he found a NASA photo of an unidentified box near the moon lander, decided that the box could only be the rover, and then insisted that this was hoax evidence because there were rover tracks that did not lead to the box. In the previous photo, the box was visible, but you could see the rover tracks leading to ... the real rover! You can't argue with logic like this - it is like trying to talk someone out of their religion.</p>
<p>BTW,&#160;:: What 'opinion' has not been expressed in the article? I'm confident that every accusation ever made has been addressed. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 16:57, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not at all Wahkeenah. We can't prove the Santa thing either way without more moon rocks from the North poll and with Bush fading from power its unlikely we'll ever get [back] there. Seriously though, I'd amend Algr's statement to say that the hoax theories have been debunked by any <i>practically</i> rational standards.

<dd>But it is not "typically", it is "invariably". At one point we directly solicited complete narratives, and came up empty. No one has ever even IMAGINED how a hoax would work in any detail.

<dd>The problem gets to be that if you say "always" or "never", certain users (you know who) will call it POV-pushing or whatever and continue the edit wars over specific words. I don't know if it's true that there there isn't a coherent "theory", i.e. an assertion that "this is what happened" (or didn't happen). Those "theories" are summarized in the article. The fact that they are contradictory is a source of amusement, of course. But I suspect that Kaysing's book (which I have never read) <i>might</i> lay out a theory of some kind. If that's not the kays, er, case, though, then the hoaxsters really do have nothing. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:40, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Basically taking out the "typically", which is good even though I admit it's one of my favorite "weasel words". I do wonder, though, whether Kaysing or Sibel or any of those guys actually has presented something that resembles a more fleshed-out theory. The slippery slope there, of course, is that their "theory" likely consists mainly of "connecting the dots" to match their pre-determined notions. However, that would still constitute a "theory", even if it's poppycock. I wonder if anyone who has deigned to read those books could throw a word or two in.

<dd>The problem here is that the hoax proponents are sticklers for the facts. Because nearly all of the 'facts' originate from NASA, few can be trusted.

<dd>I can't, of course, speak for your experience, but the point I was making concerned the lack of narratives, which stems from a lack of independent evidence, and the desire not to make assumptions without any evidence about what really happened.

<p>Actually, it occurs to me that Carfiend is effectively using us to do his research for him. He makes up one wild accusation after another and we do the research to shoot it down. If the facts aren't on the internet, or can't be boiled down to a 20 second attention span, then he has found something he can use to win converts. His tracks/lander-isn't-unpacked accusation fits this. He wanted to see how long it would take us to find the adjacent photo where the real lander is visible. Since our side actually WANTS things to make sense, we invent order to the accusations that Carfiend himself isn't capable of.</p>

<p>launch -72 hours: B-1 rocket engines placed within the F-1 combustion chambers and fuel is switched</p>
<p>launch -1 hour: astronauts shown entering the Apollo capsule</p>

<p>launch: appears normal</p>
<p>launch +23 minutes, mock J-2 second stage and mock J-2 third stage put apollo in orbit. Astronauts are flown to Moon set in Nevada by high-altitude jet. Phantom Apollo communicates to the Deep Space Network</p>
<p>Launch + 2 hours: Apollo is jettisoned into South Polar Sea. The astronauts are in well-equipped underground mockup of capsule, with a few of the shapeliest Los Vegas showgirls</p>
<p>Other than occasional checks with Mission Control, the astronauts are free to wander about, play slot machines, and use the 24-hour buffet at the Dunes.</p>
<p>+72 hours: Moon set is ready</p>
<p>+74 hours: astronauts get in position and fake exciting scenes of the moon landing. The moonwalk is faked 90 miles north of Los Vegas.</p>
<p>The rest is an anti-climax. For simulated landing, astronauts are flown to a small atoll south of Hawaii, they enter the module and are dropped by a <a href="../../../c/-/5/C-5_Galaxy_a168.html" title="C-5 Galaxy">C5A</a> just out of sight of the recovery aircraft carrier. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 21:33, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, it is one coherent theory to acknowledge in the introduction to the theory versions section. I especially like the part where they switch out the engines in three days. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 23:44, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually they put the smaller (but imaginary) B-1 engines inside the F-1 engines, according to him. However, close up pictures of the engines don't show a smaller engine within them - the exhaust seems to be coming out from the entire engine bell. Maybe the theory is "coherent", but it seems to be inconsistent with the facts. If the astronauts were in the Dunes, why didn't anyone spot them? Also, it is a pretty big feat to drop the Apollo in the south polar sea, given its orbit. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 01:27, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the term "coherent" in this case means fleshed-out enough to present a narrative; not necessarily a <i>factual</i> narrative, but a theoretical chronology of events. Ugh. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:01, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A complete narrative would include a beginning, like where did the B-1 engines come from. Also: How many people are required to: 1) Install the B-1 engines, 2) Build this high speed elevator that leads to an apollo duplicate, 3) Fly the astronauts to the moon set, 4) Build the moon set, 5) Run visual effects like lunar jump timing. (If they were filmed in slow motion, then how did they respond to mission control in real time? You have to FINISH the shot before replaying it slowly.) And finally, what happened to all of these people after it was over?</p>
<p>What do the B-1 engines have do do with anything anyway? No one has questioned NASA's ability to launch an unmanned rocket into lunar orbit, have they? <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 07:03, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The hoaxers claim the other engines were more reliable but not powerful enough to get to the moon. So they switched them in order to be able to pull off the hoax, rather than risk the engines failing on the launch pad. Beyond that, I think you've set the 'theory' and 'coherent [not complete] narrative' bars too high. This is is a sequence of events with a beginning, a middle and an end that expresses the idea of how the hoax might have occurred -- that meets my pop culture criteria for both terms. What more do you want? Independent evidence? (just teasing . . . )<a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 11:26, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As with all conspiracy theories, the way it works is to invent an alternative conclusion, and then invent an alternative narrative to fit it. Where facts are unknown, substitute "could have beens" and then insert them as if they <i>were</i> fact (leaving out the "could have" part of the statement). Before long the speculation takes on the aura of fact to those who assume (or want to believe) that Kaysing somehow knew what he was talking about. The article has a question-and-answer section. To be totally fair, a question-and-answer session about Kaysing's theory would need to be included. Every statement he makes could have a [FACT] label slapped on it. I think there you have the reason why the hoaxster's <i>don't</i> enter a fleshed out narrative, because they know it would crumble under close scrutiny. So they spend their time distracting the reader with "what about this" in connection with the actual evidence. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:34, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Kaysing said that the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-1.html" title="F-1">F-1</a> engine was too unreliable. It did have problems early on. According to K., B-1 engines were reliable but produced only half the thrust of the F-1 (therefore unable to send Apollo to the Moon). They also used a different fuel from the F-1, but Kaysing has it backwards in his book - the F1 used RP-1 (kerosene) and liquid oxygen. As far as I can tell, the B-1 is a figment of K's imagination. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 19:52, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please see my rationale on this very talk page about the NPOV tag. I personally don't believe that much has changed. I see it bas a POV issue because there are scores of weird little constructs that have been twisted to one side or the other and mis-use of sources seems to be common (whether intentional or through drift caused by unwise edits). I am, in my own way, at a pace I can manage, and on a scale the various stakeholders can manage working on what I see as the NPOV issue. If you believe it is more of a clean up issue than I'll agree with that. But not including a "caution" or "fixer-upper" tag on the article itelf (not the talk page) while the article is in anything like its present shape would seem to me to be a diservice to the casual reader.

<dd>If I recall, it was the hoax proponent(s) that objected to "conspiracy theory", as they found it pejorative. I was going to argue that it wasn't. (Watergate is a conspiracy theory that happened to be true.)

<dd>I agree, but there was a lot of heated discussion about it on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> (I think it was) about a year ago. I think "consipracy theory" is mild. Things like "Crackpot theory" could be considered pejorative. Believers in a conspiracy theory don't like their theory called a C.T., just like believers in a <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> don't like thier topic called "pseudoscience (a lot of heated discussion of that too). <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 13:46, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, the problem has been that the hoax believers constantly delete or rephrase attempts to characterize this subject as a conspiracy theory, on the grounds that the term "conspiracy theory" is an insult and thus a "POV violation". My own POV is that they regard it as an insult simply because it "hits too close to home". <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 13:49, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As a contributor to the formulation Poki quotes above from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">Conspiracy theory</a>, I should additionally point out that Watergate was <b>not, ever</b>, a <i>conspiracy theory</i>. It was a tip from a source which was methodically investigated, applying rules of evidence hard won in any serious newsroom, until enough verifiable evidences from enough independent sources stacked up into sufficient evidence to defend the newspaper against litigation. As I recall, when we had those debates last December over the question (whether or not there was an overlap between "conspiracy theory" and methodical investigations of true conspiracies), no-one met my challenge, to cite <i>a single</i> case of a methodical investigator being dismissed as a conspiracy theorist. And there were some real nuts in the room at the time ... Anyway, the point is that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">Conspiracy theory</a> certainly refers to a narrative of dubious validity. If that's pejorative, some things are <i>rightly</i> pejored against. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 22:03, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If that tip had led nowhere, Watergate could have died as a story, or it could have become a typical "conspiracy theory". And that's the rub where the moon hoax tale is concerned: there <i>is no insider tip</i>, no actual evidence, just oddities that some have tried to "connect the dots" for. Watergate started slowly and built up to a major political event. The moon hoax stuff started slow and built up too... not much. The problem with it is, there's nowhere to go with it, unless someone in-the-know were to make a startling confession. As I've said many times here, <i>even if it's true</i> that the landings were faked, <i>there's no evidence</i>; and no "oddities" that can't be explained by the conventional story and/or by pointing out how the "oddities" are merely misinterpretations. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 22:13, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problem Sections</span></h2>
<p>per Wahkeenah's suggestion let's list issues we have with the article. Maybe in one master list. It would be good to sign each item (unless it breaks something). Here is me starting that list:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Predominant hoax claims:</b> 1 is not sourced. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 14:24, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Suggested motives for a hoax:</b> None of these are sourced. 1 is questionable as to whether it should be included at all.<a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 14:24, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Hoax accusations as 'conspiracy theories:</b> the dueling excuses seems to be definitive trait of conpsiracy theories. The items that need cited seem more reflective of debates onnthe talk page than the absent sources.<a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 14:24, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>The burden of proof</b> This section seems to have drifted from its source ( and intent) via progressive edits. Content of this whole section, "Critics' comments," could/should be reworked.<a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 14:24, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>The scientific method</b> This section seems to have drifted from its source ( and intent) via progressive edits. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 14:24, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Hoax claims examined</b> condense tit-for-tat down to a couple of paragrpahs per topic. Read back through sources to verfiy that that are fairly represented. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 14:24, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Technological capability of USA compared to the USSR</b> This section should either be placed into context of the hoax or traced back to its source and cited directly.</li>

<p>That's as much as i've time for just now. Will try to return to it a bit later. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 14:24, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>My quick assessment: <b>Predominant hoax claims</b> could be better, but it's fair. <b>Suggested motives for a hoax</b> surely must be enunciated somewhere, such as maybe in Kaysing's book. <b>Hoax accusations as conspiracy theories</b> could be reduced to a single sentence citing the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> page, and let the reader decide. <b>The burden of proof</b> and <b>The scientific method</b> are the parts that strike me as editorializing, patronizing, and "thou doth protesteth too much"; I would drop them altogether, or restrict them to what other sources have to say about them (not what <i>we</i> have to say about them). I think <b>Hoax claims examined</b> is one of the most valuable parts of the article, because it is vital to the casual reader to understand that the so-called "anomolies" have a reasonable explanation, while dispassionate enough to allow the readers to judge for themselves whether the explanations make sense; few if any moon hoax pages do that, they are usually slanted one way or another. <b>Technological capability of USA compared to the USSR</b> is another possible overkill except that it addresses an issue raised by conspiracists that somehow if the USSR couldn't do it, neither could we. It could be reduced to a pair of sentences like the other point-counterpoints, with a separate in-depth article... or link to an existing article that might already cover the space race in great depth, and make the comparison sufficiently. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 22:21, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that <b>Hoax claims examined</b> is the meat of the article - perhaps it should be moved nearer the top. <b>The burden of proof</b> and <b>The scientific method</b>, should be at the end, and needs to be fixed to show that NASA does indeed have obligations here, (just not to every last kook who won't except basic science about how a camera works.) <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 21:11, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a good thought. We could pre-empt a few of the hoaxsters' complaints by showing more clearly and explicitly (1) independent observations during the Apollo flights and (2) NASA's efforts to recover old data. We're unlikely to win the hoaxsters over. The target audience should be the casual reader who wants to learn more about it without being propagandized or misled from any particular side of this so-called issue. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 22:06, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">One second delay?</span></h2>
<p>"<i>Mission control would hear the astronauts words ONE second after they spoke (one way travel time) and then could respond immediately. The astronauts would similarly hear mission control's words one second after they were spoken, and they too could respond as soon as they'd heard what mission control said - or even before mission control had stopped talking. So any recording would have only a one second delay from the remote side, and no delay at all from the side where the recorder was. A two second delay would occur only if one side was echoing the other's transmissions back to it.</i>"</p>
<p>The above logic is flawed (even if the first sentance is true). If recording at point A, it would take 1 second for a message to be relayed to point B, whereupon the response would be uttered, and a further 1 second for the response to be returned and thus recorded at point A, resulting in a cumulative delay of 2 seconds. The converse is also true. The above logic would only work if a single recorder was <i>simultaneously</i> recording <i>both</i> points, with no delay in the information getting to the recorder, which of course is not physically possible (a similar effect would happen if the recording was made exactly half way between the points). If nobody can argue otherwise, I'm going to remove this part. <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinness2702_d731.html" title="User:Guinness2702">Guinness</a> 14:37, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That's a good point. The author got the first part of it right (you omitted the first sentence) and then said a little too much and got it wrong:
<ul>
<li><b>The round trip light travel time of more than 2 seconds is apparent in all the real-time recordings of the lunar audio</b>, but this does not always appear as expected. Mission control would hear the astronauts words ONE second after they spoke (one way travel time) and then could respond immediately. The astronauts would similarly hear mission control's words one second after they were spoken, and they too could respond as soon as they'd heard what mission control said - or even before mission control had stopped talking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So far, so good. Then the author seems to have added his own "original research" to the facts, which does not appear to be correct, and which should be removed as being not clearly thought through, due to a long day at the office or whatever:
<ul>
<li>So any recording would have only a one second delay from the remote side, and no delay at all from the side where the recorder was. A two second delay would occur only if one side was echoing the other's transmissions back to it. (not a useful arrangement for communication.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then the writer gets back on track, to the main point that the hoaxster was complaining about, and this is the actual answer to the question:
<ul>
<li>There may be some documentary films where the delay has been edited out. Principal motivations for editing the audio would likely come in response to time constraints or in the interest of clarity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is some Eggs Benedict on our faces for not catching the obvious, as you did. Here's the scoop: From whichever side the recording is occurring, there could be an immediate response to an incoming transmission, or 0 seconds delay. But that immediate response would take about 1 second to get to the vicinity of the moon, and even if the astronauts just said "Yo!" there would be 1 <i>more</i> second before that response got back to Houston where the recorder presumably was. 1 + 1 still equals 2. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:04, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>- Yeah, I was planning to leave the first and last two sentances in, as they are perfectly reasonable (although a slight rephrase may be necessary with the chunk above taken out). <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinness2702_d731.html" title="User:Guinness2702">Guinness</a> 15:12, 1 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Some rewording is probably needed, because even though the second sentence is factually correct, it is also sort of a lead-in to the flawed logic. It would probably suffice to say that there would normally be a two-second delay, and explain <i>why</i> that is so, to the casual reader, and then say that it was indeed apparent in the orginal recordings, and was edited out of some documentaries (for obvious reasons of making the documentary flow better for the viewer). The hoaxsters are always reading things into editing. They must enjoy sitting through raw footage. What would it be like if ESPN's highlights programs played the entire game rather than a 15-to-30 second cut of the scoring? For that matter, just try watching someone else's home movies. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:39, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Proposed revision:-</p>
<p><i>The round trip light travel time of more than 2 seconds is apparent in all the real-time recordings of the lunar audio, but this does not always appear as expected. There may be some documentary films where the delay has been edited out. Principal motivations for editing the audio would likely come in response to time constraints or in the interest of clarity.</i></p>
<p>Acutally, I've only chopped out the middle bit, and the above reads ok. Agree? <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinness2702_d731.html" title="User:Guinness2702">Guinness</a> 16:21, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It seems OK. It leaves out the nuts-and-bolts explanation of why there is a two-second delay, but maybe that would be overkill. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:24, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>No that whole thing is accurate. Nothing stops mission control from speaking as soon as they hear what the astronauts say, so recordings made at mission control will show no lag at all from them. If the astronaut says something out of the blue - "Hey look at this," mission control will hear it one second later. If mission control asks the astronaut to do something, and the astronaut responds, only then would the delays add and produce a two second delay - but it is natural to pause before responding to a question anyway, so that will just sound like the astronaut was thinking about it before responding.</p>
<p>Digital cell phones can have about a 1/3 second delay, so you can experience what this is like by calling someone who is standing right next to you. You only really notice the delay if you can also hear the original sound. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 18:29, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You're talking about "stepping on each other", which certainly could have happened. I think the hoaxsters' complaint is that there is "normal" dialogue with no discernible delays at all, hence they are arguing that the transmissions took place from nearby the earth... being either ignorant or deliberating misleading about editing done later so that it plays better. Delays in any kind of electronic transmissions are common, due to the signal being routed through boosters, cable systems, etc. I used to try to watch baseball on TV with the sound down and the radio on... and there was a split-second's delay between the two. It was kind of spooky to hear the crack of the bat and <i>then</i> see the guy swing and hit it. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:57, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The delay is actually about 1.3 seconds in each direction, depending on the distance to the moon at the time. In many cases you can hear Mission Control say something and then hear it echoed back, which should be about 2.6 seconds later. I don't know of any instance where the delay is less than it should be, unless the delay has been edited out. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 20:57, 1 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Right, at 250,000 miles vs. 186,000 miles per second, it max out at about 1.3 seconds each way, halfway would be about .6-.7 seconds, and so on. My guess would be that some hoaxster was watching a documentary (where only selected bits of the dialogue would be used) and said, "Hey, that should be 2-3 seconds delay!" and it never occurred to them that the difference would be edited to make a better presentation. In contrast, you have the famous "One small step fr'a man, one giant leap for mankind." I see where someone took that and played it through a speech recognition analyzer and declared it to be "one small step for A man" after all. Make of that what you will. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 21:20, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do we actually have any samples of what the hoaxers say is suspect? It could be editing, or it could be them assuming that the delay has to apply to mission control too. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 21:34, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Walking in low g</span></h2>
<p>Sorry if this has been gone over before - I am a newbie on this page. I can't see that the page mentions what I think is one of the interesting pieces of evidence, but no doubt the hoax-theorists will say it cuts both ways. It concerns walking in low gravity. I believe that dimensional analysis shows that the non-dimensional group <span class="texhtml"><i>v</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>g</i><i>L</i></span> is the controlling factor (call it the "gait number", it is called the Froude number in fluid mechanics). What it comes down to is this. A person of a certain size L can walk with a speed V on earth, where the acceleration due to gravity is G. On the moon, where the acceleration due to gravity is g, that same person, same size L, can walk with speed v. We expect the "gait number" to be the same in both cases so that</p>

</dl>
<p>Since the moon's gravity is 1/6 of earth's the walking speed on the moon is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/1/4/714852af3df6a3be279f8bc255526821.png" alt="\sqrt{1/6} = 0.4" /> of the walking speed on earth. Hence if we speed up the film of the moon walking by a factor 1/0.4 = 2.5 (we run the film 2.5 times faster) the moon walking looks "natural". Of course, NASA scientist knew this so, say the hoax-theorists, NASA could have released slow-motion films of the astronauts walking on earth, to simulate what it should look like when the same astronauts walk on the moon. NASA thought of everything! <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 06:11, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sadly my friend, there is a stumbling block... Someone must be documented indicating this point. It's a perfectly valid objection, but it's not one I'm aware of being documented as an argument. Completely bogus claims "supporting" the "accusations" can be included because just about every peice of material that can be reasonably and unreasonably used tends to be published by the primary proponents of this idea. If you can find a published example of someone using this argument, then please, by all means, add a cited subsection to an appropriate location. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 06:37, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, they couldn't walk at a normal gait in any case, due to the amount of stuff they had to wear and carry on their backs. They learned to develop sort of a "hop" technique. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 10:08, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've seen the video speeded up by a factor of 2, and it doesn't look "natural" that way. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 15:08, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, as natural as one can walk in the big clumsy space-suit. The point is Fox News showed the videos speeded-up and it did look a bit as though it was a film taken on earth. They implied that that was how NASA made the films. They did not say what they thought a real video of walking on the moon (in the clumsy suit) would look like. The influence of the Froude number on walking is fairly well known (google will quickly find an article in Nature about it) but who would bother to publish a paper in a serious journal answering Fox News on this point? So I doubt one can be found. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 01:06, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have the Apollo 16 DVD (and others). In there, in quite a few cases you can see the astronauts fling something away. None of that is consistant with a film being slowed down by a factor of 2 or 2.5. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 01:19, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know exactly what you mean (since I haven't seen the video you refer to) but if there is a film of something dropping from the astronaut's hand it would take longer to hit the surface of the planent by a factor of <img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/4/4/b449f37d2433b04654609df65c77396a.png" alt="\sqrt{6} = 2.45" /> (because of the 1/6 gravity). So for vertically dropping only it should look exactly like an Earth film slowed down by a factor of 2.45. But if an object is thrown sideways, the horizontal distance travelled before it hits the surface should be 2.45 times further than on Earth (even ignoring air resistance) because the time of flight is 2.45 times longer. So, as you say, the film could well prove the object was thrown in 1/6 gravity and is not a slowed down film of motion in earth gravity. <a href="../../../e/4/m/User%7EE4mmacro_69ce.html" title="User:E4mmacro">E4mmacro</a> 02:21, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
