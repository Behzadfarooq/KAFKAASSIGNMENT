<p>A couple of months ago, I suggested that some material written by Benwig which had been temporarily lodged at what is now <a href="../../../i/n/d/Talk%7EIndo-European_ablaut_5d83.html#Arabic" title="Talk:Indo-European ablaut">Talk:Indo-European ablaut#Arabic</a> should be worked into the Apophony article.

<li><b>Oppose</b>: The most inclusive common definition of 'ablaut' is limited to vowel gradation whereas this article is much more inclusive than that, including consonant alternation and tone alternation. Besides it would be confusing if Germanic umlaut were included in the article called 'Ablaut' when it is explicitly excluded from the Indo-European definition of 'ablaut.' I can see that 'Apophony' may not be an ideal title either, but 'Ablaut' is worse. --<a href="../../../t/e/b/User%7ETEB728_acd5.html" title="User:TEB728">teb728</a> 06:16, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>hi. I think that these are good objections. The information about tonal &amp; consonantal alternation could be moved somewhere else, of course. It is also questionable that we use the term <i>apophony</i> in a more inclusive sense. Anyway, this hasnt been worked out yet, so maybe this Move is a bit hasty (I apologize). Re confusion of Germanic umlaut: this is a confusion that is not our fault. The term <i>umlaut</i> is used in 2 different senses: (1) <i>historical umlaut</i> and (2) <i>synchronic umlaut</i>. This is unfortunate, but an objection to an ablaut-named article because of this is not so convincing. thanks – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 06:36, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>True, but it's not more common than "gradation" - and like TEB728, I would not be against a move - just not to <i>Ablaut</i>. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoric_Loon_2383.html" title="User:Doric Loon">Doric Loon</a> 14:36, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b> Ablaut is primarily the Indo-European phenomenon and, as such, deserves its own article rather than redirecting here.

<p>To summarise, we have two articles, currently at <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apophony.html" title="Apophony">apophony</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-European_ablaut_94da.html" title="Indo-European ablaut">Indo-European ablaut</a></i>, and three talk pages.</p>
<p>The entry currently at <i><a href="../../../a/b/l/Ablaut.html" title="Ablaut">ablaut</a></i> has no significant history... it has always been a redirect <b>somewhere</b> (let's keep it that way). Its talk page could be preserved by cut-and-paste as the talk page history is contained in the signatures. So there's no technical problem with the proposed move.</p>
<p>ISTM that there are <b>many</b> <i>right</i> answers here. We're in an area where there is ongoing research and controversy, and the terminology of various authorities is a suspect (wait for it) various. The example given of ablaut in a non-Indo-European language was only published in 2003. It's exciting to me (as a former linguistics student, SIL Melbourne) that we have a cadre of Wikipedians capable of sustaining these discussions, and interested in doing so. I think that the suggestion above that we need to distinguish <i>current</i> from <i>historical</i> usage is a good observation, but it's not the whole answer, as what is current usage and what historic is itself controversial.</p>
<p>And you all seem well aware of the dangers of straying into <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. I mention that mainly to caution any newcomers to this discussion.</p>
<p>I would however caution that some of the comments in the three talk pages could be seen as <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attacks</a>. Attack the <b>statement</b>, not the <b>person</b>. But I also note that these heated comments seem to have been taken with admirable understanding and a sense of humour. Hang in there!</p>
<p>I look forward to this discussion coming to a consensus, and despite my desire to clean up the backlog of proposed moves, my suggestion is that this remain <i>proposed</i> for a while longer while this consensus is sought. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 18:20, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can I just point out that it is not true to say that the distinction between ablaut and umlaut (in the original senses of the words) is ONLY diachronic. I do grant you that the distinction is primarily thought of as diachronic, because it is of fundamental importance for diachronic studies and only has limited usefulness to synchronic studies. But the fact remains that scholars HAVE made a synchronic distinction, and this distinction is useful in the modern languages classroom. Take foot and feet. We know that historically this is vowel harmony - oo gets dragged to ee to harmonize with a suffix which once existed. But the suffix no longer exists, and yet the alternation is systematic. What we see in the modern language is not harmony but fronting. ALL Germanic nouns which form their plurals by vowel alternation do it by fronting: the vowel of the plural is a fronted version of the vowel of the singular. Man-men, German Buch-Bücher, Gott-Götter - they are all moving in the same direction. The same is true of all adjectives forming their comparatives by alternation (hoch-höher), and all weak verbs forming their present stems by alternation (providing you know to take the past tense form as the starting point: bought-buy). However the alternation in Germanic strong verbs does not follow this system: the vowel changes appear to be random. Even if we knew nothing about the history of the forms, we would be able to see from the modern languages that there are two phenomena, and since one of them is regular enough to be useful for language-teaching, the distinction has practical value as well as theoretical interest.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoric_Loon_2383.html" title="User:Doric Loon">Doric Loon</a> 20:05, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>hi. my response is: yes &amp; no. there is a difference in the vowel alternations, and it would be a poor description of Germanic langs if this was not noted. however, the reason that one alternation type is termed <i>umlaut</i> is based on a diachronic perspective. to use the term <i>umlaut</i> to describe a vowel alternation that is morpho-syntactically governed (as opposed to phonologically governed, i.e. <i>synchronic umlaut</i>) is confusing. a more consistent usage of terminology could call this something like <i>fronting-ablaut</i> or some other term. several reference works (on morphology &amp; general linguistics) have pointed out the inconsistent/misleading usage of the traditional term <i>umlaut</i> to refer to ablaut phenomena. perhaps it is useful to continue this practice in language-teaching (i wont comment on this). it is less useful to maintain this usage in a general linguistic context. (e.g., one could imagine a language that had fronting-ablaut and backing-ablaut in addition to other ablaut patterns: we hopefully would want a terminology that could appropriately name these alternations.) peace – <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> &#160;<a href="../../../i/s/h/User_talk%7EIsh_ishwar_3bed.html" title="User talk:Ish ishwar"><small>(speak)</small></a> 06:00, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
