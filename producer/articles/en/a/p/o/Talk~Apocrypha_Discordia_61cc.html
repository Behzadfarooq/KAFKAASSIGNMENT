<p>Hi. I'm the Rev.DrJon. I'm glad to see the entry for the <i>Apocrypha</i> has been reinstated as a separate one!</p>

<p>I don't want anybody to misunderstand my edits and think I don't respect DrJon because I do! We owe him a lot for finding, compiling and releasing some great Discordian material. Hail DrJon!</p>
<p>But he didn't begin <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i>. It was mentioned as a concept in Steve Jackson Games edition of <i>Principia Discordia</i> published in 1994 (this is currently in this article, but I'm putting it here too because these articles change so fast). Reverend Loveshade submitted some writings, but the book was never published. So BloodStar posted stuff by Reverend Loveshade and others including Rev. Ivan Stang of the Church of the SubGenius as the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_links.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_links.html" rel="nofollow">non-existent Apocrypha Discordia</a> in 1995. This was copied onto several Discordian sites.</p>
<p>When Rev. Loveshade learned of DrJon's book, which was produced years later, he voluntarily changed the name of his book to <a href="../../../e/k/-/Ek-sen-trik-kuh_Discordia_089b.html" title="Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia">Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</a>, which is still evolving.</p>
<p>So the concept was first mentioned by somebody online in the 1990s, picked up and later dropped by Steve Jackson Games beginning in 1994, then created online by Reverend Loveshade in 1995, then compiled as a book finished in 2001 or 2002 (I've seen conflicting dates--does anyone, including DrJon, know the actual year?) <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinky_The_WonderSkull_365b.html" title="User:Binky The WonderSkull">Binky The WonderSkull</a> 02:41, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no problem with the way you've phrased the current set of links. I'd make comment on your outline now, but that can wait for another day when I've the time to provide sources and extensive reasoning. I've changed the linktitle of the external link to the Apocrypha Discordia to "Homepage", because it's the Homepage of the book this wikipedia article is discussing. Please don't change it, unless you can provide good supported <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> reasoning. I'd suggest that you create the <a href="../../../e/k/-/Ek-sen-trik-kuh_Discordia_089b.html" title="Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia">Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</a> page and include your take on all of this. Keep in mind that the wikipedia's watchword is <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>, and much of what's been added to the wikipedia recently regards this matter could be seen as being <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. Note also that I'm not accusing you of this, merely making the observation that it could be seen as such. Cheers! <a href="../../../d/r/j/User%7EDrjon_0697.html" title="User:Drjon">Drjon</a> 00:11, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(I'm aware that my use of <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> there isn't strictly speaking accurate according to the wikipedia def, but in the interest of harmony I thought it the best neutral word of choice.) <a href="../../../d/r/j/User%7EDrjon_0697.html" title="User:Drjon">Drjon</a> 01:25, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A little more. The <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha_Discordia_0ade.html" title="Apocrypha Discordia">Apocrypha Discordia</a> was created independently to what's now known as the <a href="../../../e/k/-/Ek-sen-trik-kuh_Discordia_089b.html" title="Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia">Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</a>. The title was influenced by the mention by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Jackson_e31d.html" title="Steve Jackson">Steve Jackson</a> (who himself got it off Russel Dalenberg), not by the previous name of the (subsequent) Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia, and the research for the work itself stretched back to the 1970s. Although one of the extant three short pieces from Rev.Loveshade's work was included, that piece shares space in the book with over a hundred other works - the <i>primary</i> ones being "apocryphal" but genuine contemperary passages omitted from the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principia_Discordia_be68.html" title="Principia Discordia">Principia Discordia</a> (for which the Apocrypha was named) -- including a piece by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Anton_Wilson_96e8.html" title="Robert Anton Wilson">Robert Anton Wilson</a> which is also an adaption of the <i>X blind men and an elephant</i> story, and which dates from the 60s. But for whimsy, Rev. Loveshade's piece would not have been included at all. Please keep in mind also that three short pieces do not a book make (no offense - the defining feature of his "non-existent Apocrypha Discordia" was its <i>non-existence</i>: if it <i>had</i> existed, I would have chosen a different name, as indeed Rev. Loveshade eventually did). So yes, in fact, <b>this</b> <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> was both begun and finished by me. The Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia (although no doubt a worthy work) is entirely incidental and wholly separate to <i>this</i> Apocrypha Discordia, which is the only <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> to have ever actually been published. Which (since you asked) happened in 2001. Cheers, <a href="../../../d/r/j/User%7EDrjon_0697.html" title="User:Drjon">Drjon</a> 14:37, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> is a whole lot better than a lot of the Discordian **** that's out there. It's one of the three best 21st Century Discordians reads with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Ek-sen-trik-kuh_Discordia%7E_The_Tales_of_Shamlicht_119d.html" title="Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia: The Tales of Shamlicht">Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia: The Tales of Shamlicht</a>, and The Book of Eris. But this article has been marked stub since September 11 2005 for Goddess sake!

<p>Or perhaps to flesh it out a bit, instead? I'd be happy to do that, but somehow I doubt that would be acceptable. <a href="../../../d/r/j/User%7EDrjon_0697.html" title="User:Drjon">Drjon</a> 11:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yep I doubt they'd go for that. Still I think after a year and a half, if it was going to happen it would have happened. And it looks like <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discordian_Works_4b05.html" title="Discordian Works">Discordian Works</a> is gonna be kept. There's a couple so-so arguments about editing it, but not a single even reasonable sounding argument to delete it.<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamthatIam_66be.html" title="User:IamthatIam">IamthatIam</a> 19:53, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> I think Apocryphas great but so are some of the others! And a year and a half I think it should merge. The vote for <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discordian_Works_4b05.html" title="Discordian Works">Discordian Works</a> is Keep! <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinky_The_WonderSkull_365b.html" title="User:Binky The WonderSkull">Binky The WonderSkull</a> 05:24, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>...and the vote on the Apocrypha last time was to *keep*, not merge. The article needs expanding, not merging. What we need is someone who knows enough about the work to expand the entry, who isn't me. Don't suppose you'd care to volunteer?

<p><b>I Merged it.</b> There were three votes for Merge and the only one opposed was the book's author DrJon. It's a good read but been a stub since 2005 Terrorist Attack Day. <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamthatIam_66be.html" title="User:IamthatIam">IamthatIam</a> 17:11, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, you didn't follow due process, and I'd argue that there's a fairly weighty bias happening here, but I could care less. <a href="../../../d/r/j/User%7EDrjon_0697.html" title="User:Drjon">Drjon</a> 00:13, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
