<p>Koreans don't really hate him because he is of Japanese descent. They are mad at him for his "hollywood action," pretending to be pushed. Jamesdakrn 07:43, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>shouldn't there be mention that part of the Korean's hatred for him is attributable not only to their anti-American viewpoints, but to their racist attitudes against the Japanese and mixed-raced individuals of Asian decent?</p>
<p>First, the Japanese and Koreans are genetically close races. This is an issue of seemingly poor sportsmanship on Ohno's part as well as his Japanese heritage, which is quite obvious given the tv time of his father. Korea's view of mixed-raced individuals is the same throughout the world, i.e. it is looked down upon by some and accepted by others. However, as stated, this mixed-race issue is easily trumped by the greater issues of sportsmanship and the Japanese occupation. All the other competitors believed that he did a pure acting job but I guess this first matter is too subjective. The Japanese occupation is a bit more factual. The elders of Korea still remember the Japanese occupation and all of it's human rights abuses of rape, torture, and murder (see <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comfort_Women_734a.html" title="Comfort Women">Comfort Women</a>). Obviously, Ohno did not participate in any of those violations, but to acuse the Koreans of being "racist", i.e. <b>ignorantly</b> discriminating against a people, is walking a fine line. Yes, Koreans should not hold Ohno accountable to the actions of his ancestors. But the Koreans are justified in maintaining malcontent for the years of unthinkable torture which they endured not so long ago. It's not like the anti-French sentiment in the U.S., where the French never came close to the human rights violations of the Japanese.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I call you on your statement that "All the other competitors believed that he did a pure acting job." If I remember right, at least one competitor stated that the South Korean skater had been cross-tracking throughout the entire competition and he was glad that the South Korean skater was finally called on it. If that's true, then who's the truly poor sportsman in the incident in question? Nevertheless, this debate isn't appropriate for this article. It should be in a separate article titled something like, "2002 1500 meter speedskating controversy" or something like that. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 13:45, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not believe that I was the one who wrote that statement. Someone else must have edited that in.

As for adding an entire new article, it would not be inappropriate assuming that the new article was linked from this one. --Bakphp 00:58, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is not a place to discuss any (percieved) anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea. It is an article about a sportsman from the USA.</p>
<p>There have been several anonymous edits (myself included), so I think it's better if anyone who wants to contribute gets an account.</p>
<p>I will revert the page back to my last edit, basically talking only about the races, and I think if people want to discuss the percieved Japanese treatment of Koreans during WWII they should do it on the appropriate pages. If anyone disagrees they should discuss here first.</p>
<p>I didn't think the entry was very neutral, so I've changed it to be more neutral. Any discussion as to historical tensions between South Korea and the US and Japan should only be briefly mentioned here, and then more fully explained in the different, appropriate entry. 28 Mar 06, ca</p>

<p>I agree with many of your edits (especially with word choice), however it is fact that 1)The Japanese did mistreat the Koreans during the occupation (pre-WWII and during WWII) 2)The expected anti-Japanese sentiment due to the occupation is still very much alive, especially amongst the older generations who remember the mistreatments. 3)Many, but not all, Koreans will openly admit their dislike of Japanese decendents and claim that any innately negative impressions upon such people are justified.</p>
<p>Thus, in mentioning the negative response by the Korean fans, a maximal explanation of the motives behind this negative response seems very pertinent, especially given the unusual degree of the response. Such an extreme response (i.e., e-mails flooding and crashing the Olympic Committee's account server, formal complaints continuing during the 2004 Summer Olympics, etc.) by the Korean fans deserves an explanation beyond what happened in the race itself.</p>
<p>I hope you can understand why it is very relevant and neutral to mention the full motivations of the Korean response.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It'd be better to have a separate article on Korean anti-Japanese sentiment, rather than trying to explain it in an article on Ohno. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 00:31, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Seems we're coming to a concensus here.The anti-Japanese mention would be relevant if it was occuring in all Japanese-Korean sports encounters, but it isn't. This kind of thing doesn't seem to happen when Japan and Korea play in soccer or baseball. Also, Ohno is not Japanese, he is a citizen of the USA. There are of course other articles where it should be mentioned, but I still think it's irrelevant to this article.--Dnheff 02:47, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the anti-Japanese sentiment does clearly occur in other sports. For example, in the 2002 World Cup which was held in Korea and Japan, the two teams were placed in separate groups and both managed to qualify for the single-elimination rounds. Immediately, a huge debate ensued in regards to which team had the more difficult schedule to get to that point. The coach of Korea at the time (Dutchman Gus Hiddink) was surprised to have to answer to so many questions juxtaposing the two sides. And, yes, Ohno is a U.S. citizen, but as mentioned, the anti-Japanese sentiment applies for all those of Japanese decent. I agree that this issue should not be elaborated upon, but the mentioning of its existence and relevance is an integral part of the explanation to perhaps the most controversial event in Ohno's career.--Bakphp 20:11, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, not relevant. South Korea and Japan didn't play each other in the 2002 World Cup. This was just both teams trying to talk themselves up. It certainly didn't result in any major riots as far as I'm aware, and I don't think they have hundreds of riot police standing guard when the Japanese soccer team travels to South Korea.--Dnheff 02:47, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As an avid soccer fan, the fact that they didn't play eachother but still had a heated debate is quite amazing and shows the significance of their rivalry. And the lack of rioting over sporting events is not part of their culture. The infamous soccer riots are localized to Europe and South America. Back to the issue, anti-Japanese sentiment is prevelant across the board, even beyond sports. If you look up disputes in regards to <a href="../../../d/o/k/Dokdo_Island_5f96.html" title="Dokdo Island">Dokdo Island</a> and the hundred appologies that Japan has made in regards to the Japanese Occupation and all of them being rejected by Korea, then this issue should seem a bit more clear. I found a nice article <a href="http://www.korea-is-one.org/article.php3?id_article=1422" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.korea-is-one.org/article.php3?id_article=1422" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> that ties together the ongoing disputes between Japan and the Koreas in relation with a soccer match. --Bakphp 21:35, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am Korean American and live in Seoul, Korea. So, let me offer my perspective on how I see things. From what I understand, the dislike of Ohno is not based so much on anti-Japanese sentiment as it is on the fact that Koreans think Ohno is a whiner and a cheater. LOL. And I think they see Ohno as more of American than Japanese. A lot of Koreans think Americans tend to get an unfair advantage at the Olympics due to the commercial power of the USA for the games. Thus, mentioning anti-Japanese sentiment isn't really relevant here, in my opinion.--Mapo 05:04, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I too am Korean American and my parents and extended family in Korea always fill me in on these popular issues. For them, Ohno is seen as both of Japanese decent and as a U.S. citizen. Somebody already talked about the anti-japanese sentiment, and the anti-Americanism is related to the ongoing presence of U.S. troops in Korea which has resulted in an accidental death of a little girl as well as several crimes on the part of the U.S. troops. So, I think both the anti-Japanese and anti-American sentiments are both relevant. After all, the reaction by Korea was quite amazing.</dd>

<p>Maybe we should make a small seperate section about the anti-ohno attitude in Korea. So it would seperate the controverseries and his achievement, which would help the reader to understand the about Ohno little bit better. --Stevefis 08:19, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I still don't really think it's releveant, but this idea is definitely better than merging them together like they are. At least it will cool the arguments for a while.--Dnheff 02:47, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>not to spread rumors. I've applied the (not verified) tag to the material that seems to cause the most dispute; if it cannot be cited to a <a href="../../../r/d/_/WP%7ERD_c7a5.html" title="WP:RD">reliable source</a> then it must be removed. The lack of <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">references</a> is already a problem on any article of this size; let's not make it worse by broadening the scope of the article to include <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">baseless speculation</a> on what "many Koreans" think. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 08:46, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added the sources as requested. Please feel free to remove the 'not verified' tag. I'll leave it up for someone else to verify my work. Kimathi 23:17, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you, Kimathi! I see you've also helped out at a couple of politician's pages; perhaps we need more political veterans to take a look at popular-interest disputes such as this one!</dd>
<dd>As for removing the tag, I'm not sure the work is done. The current reference on Ohno's absence in 2003 speaks only of "cyber terrorism", and the next reference explains anti-Ohno sentiment at the time as due only to his 2002 performance. None of the references mention death threats, and more importantly, none of them actually link general anti-American or anti-Japanese sentiment to Ohno. So while the current revision of the article is <i>reasonable</i> speculation, and infinitely better than before, it still makes a few too many guesses. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 00:22, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a Korean-American, I guess I wrote this info thinking it was all common knowledge. My mistake...I'm sure most people don't have Korean newspapers and family members discussing the latest ongoings in the Korean general public. I hope these citations clarify things.

<dd>Thanks Hodori11 for adding more sources.

I don't want to add more links to the article because it may become overwhelming. Feel free to add it though. As an important part of Ohno's career, I think this section of the article has been greatly improved. Kimathi 03:28, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Three things. Firstly, thanks to Melchoir for the help here. Much needed and I appreciate the effort. Second - sorry too for being a pain here and not throwing in the towel - but I'm still not satisfied. I'm not convinced that the Time article is a <a href="../../../r/d/_/WP%7ERD_c7a5.html" title="WP:RD">reliable source</a>. The article says "had Ohno been, say, Italian, his disputed victory might have made him a target of mere outrage ..." implying that the anger was more than "mere outrage" <i>because</i> Ohno is a US citizen and of Japanese descent. This is still only opinion (albeit external opinion). Where does the Time author get this info from? The burden of proof in this case lies with the people making these claims. If you think Ohno's citizenship and ethnicity were responsible for exacerbating the reaction against him, over and above what would have been expected from causing the disqualification of a SK athlete, then <i>proove</i> it. Thirdly, I've been editing without logging in. Edits for KiwiDave and Dnheff are all mine. Sorry for the confusion.KiwiDave 14:31, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You make good points. I'll try to edit the section to conform to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. What would be really useful here is even more sources discussing reasons for the anger towards Ohno. Perhaps one of them could offer evidence either for or against an ethnicity explanation. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 21:16, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Essentially, KiwiDave is asking that the motives behind the Korean people's reactions be <b>proven</b> to involve anti-American and anti-Japanese sentiment. I could ask a thousand Koreans that protested, why they were upset and took action. If they all said it's because Ohno is of Japanese decent and American, then would that 'prove' the link to be true? I guess that's the only way to prove the claim if a TIME article does not suffice, but who knows, those Koreans may be lying or exagerating for whatever reason. Even the 3rd external link of this article includes a clear,strong indication that the upset Koreans did indeed act out of anti-American sentiment. But again, we could say that this is not a reliable source. If the 'motivation of action' is going to be questioned to such a degree, then the only way to sufficiently prove the 'why' of peoples actions would be to have lie detector tests for at least a thousand korean protesters. Obviously, that would be ridiculous. If the problem is that a Korean voice needs to be cited, then one could just blog search anti-ohno sites and you'll get plenty of angry Koreans ripping on Ohno's Japanese or American background. But then again, it's just a blog...a very informal source. My point is that we have to go with the citations when it comes to proving something as abstract as one's thoughts and motivations for action. --Bakphp 06:25, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the TIME article might have been enough, but it uses really weak language: "might have made him", "was hardly ameliorated by". The article references a survey elsewhere, but it doesn't seem to have any survey data for this point. If they'd taken a more authoritative tone, or offered some evidence, I might feel comfortable taking their point at face value. That doesn't mean it's not possible to find a better source. In fact, <i>any</i> source independently using the ethnic explanation would help; two are better than one. As for Korean voices on blogs, it is sometimes acceptable to use a blog as a source, but only to verify what the writer of the blog thinks; see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. So if you know of a demonstratably influential blogger, it might be appropriate to quote one. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 07:00, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. If you do a survey of "a thousand Koreans that protested" and half of them said that</dd>
<dd>1) nationality and ethnicity were major factors, and</dd>
<dd>2) if an American athlete not of Japanese ancestry had play acted a miss and gotten a South Koren athlete disqualified then they wouldn't care,</dd>
<dd>then I would be satisfied. Alternatively if the TIMEAsia article was a bit more authoritive and had the results of their survey then that would be fine too. I just want something solid - anything solid - as evidence. Without it this is still just opinion along the lines of "someone I spoke to thinks it might have been a factor."

<p>Is this section about Apolo Anton Ohno or is it about Koreans hating Japanese and their decendant to this day in age. Ohno is an American. Koreans should stop with this childish attitude. If Korean want to talk about Japanese/Korean issue, they should go to a talk site. Not here.</p>

<p>Everytime I visit this article someone has added anti-Ohno, biased opinion verbiage to it. I edit the stuff out, but it reappears again. If it contiues, I'm going to ask that the page be frozen and the IP addresses of the offenders blocked. I'm serious, stop being so childish whoever you are. It reflects poorly on whatever agenda you have. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 12:40, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have no idea who has been causing the reappearance of the material you editted out in the past, but I am reinserting the edit this time around (I have openly been responsible for a good portion of this paragraph). This controversy was closely followed and is well documented and is the event for which people around the world know him best. The reactions after the race were extreme and unique with clear motivations that many journalists have exposed. Thus, the paragraph is very relevant. I wouldn't categorize any of this as "anti-ohno" propaganda, as it is all well cited thanks to the criticisms and contributions of other users. If you see any info as not factual, please share. --Bakphp 00:34, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think there's any overt anti-Ohno verbiage in the article, currently (there definitely was before). However, I don't agree with you that the paragraph detailing some South Korean's reactions to the the race belongs in this article. I think it should be discussed in a separate article called "2002 Olympic 1500 meter short-track controversy" or something like that. But, I won't edit that paragraph out of the Ohno article anymore. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 20:01, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
