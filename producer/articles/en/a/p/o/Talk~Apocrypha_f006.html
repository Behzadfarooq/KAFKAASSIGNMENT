<p>The page says "In 1546 the Catholic Council of Trent adopted the canon of Augustine." The Catholic cannon was first proposed in 382 by Pope Damasus, followed by ratification by the Councils of Hippo (393 A.D.) and Carthage (397 A.D.). Pope St. Innocent approved the 73 book canon and closed the cannon of the Bible. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuraidragon_b920.html" title="User:Samuraidragon">Samuraidragon</a> 20:38, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a lot of information found in this article, some of it quite esoteric. I added (yet another) section near the top of this article to give greater promenance to what I think most people will be looking for when they are directed here: the books found in the Apocrypha section of a modern printed Bible. -rwflammang</p>

<p>Article says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches regard the apocrypha as deuterocanonical, belonging to second-level biblical canon; they are deemed to be divinely inspired, but are of a lesser authority than the rest of the Bible.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd like to see some evidence that they view them as being of lesser authority. AFAIK, Catholics at least view them as equally authoritative, although they recognize they have been subject to more dispute/controversy over the years than most books have. Secondly, I detect in this article Protestant bias, especially in regard to its frequent use of Protestant terminology without its qualification as Protestant. -- <a href="../../../s/j/k/SJK_88ad.html" title="SJK">SJK</a></p>
<p><br />
Ok, this will be addressed. I don't think that there is a Protestant bias, as the person who wrote that paragraph was Jewish (me), and regards the apocrypha as interesting Jewish historical and religious literature, but not divinely inspired. I had read a bit on this topic, including a little material written by clergy in the Catholic Chruch, but it still it could be in error. I will check this issue out in the New Catholic Encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../r/k/_/RK_87c6.html" title="RK">RK</a></p>
<p>RK: The terminology you are using, at least among Christians, is used mainly by Protestants, not Catholics. As for Jews, I don't know (but since they agree with Protestants on the OT/Tanakh canon, it would not suprise me if they also use Protestant terminology) -- <a href="../../../s/j/k/SJK_88ad.html" title="SJK">SJK</a></p>

<p>No. None of the contested works (or parts thereof) is in the New Testament. While I realize that the Wiki article needs to be neutral, as a Catholic I was taught that Protestants dropped books and parts of books that "really were" in the Bible. I'm not trying to start a fight, but rather to question the notion that Catholics find these books of lesser quality. In fact, some of the dropped passages support Catholic interpretations of Christianity better than Protestant versions, so it would make no sense for Catholics to downgrade them. (Notably Luther's dislike of the following quote: 'It is a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead that they may be loosed from their sins' (2 Macc. 12:46). Catholics who call those works 'deuterocanonical' are not so much downgrading them from 'canonical' as upgrading them from 'apocryphal'. Church history is full of quotes from these works, which were included in the Septuagint and Vulgate. --DGJ According to the Catholic Encyclopedia (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03267a.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03267a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03267a.htm</a>) the term Deutero is not at all derogatory, and these books are considered just as canonical as the rest. (I have just made some changes to the <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deuterocanonical_books.html" title="Deuterocanonical books">Deuterocanonical books</a> page to clarify this as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>Many of the apocryphal books listed are shown as nonexistent articles, but I think I may have found them. I don't know enough about this topic to actually change the links, but FWTW here they are: <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Revelation_4ea8.html" title="Book of Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Acts of the Apostles and Book of Revelation (the Apocalypse) are not deuterocanonical, but rather canonical. I think that at least one of them was the subject of a political compromise when the Catholic bishops drew up the canon list at one of those councils -- I think (or at least have read) that there was some political bartering about which books to stick in as canon, and the east and west traded off a bit. But in any case, they both got in, and are not the subject of this article (Apocrypha/Deuterocanonical).</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
The term "Deuterocanonical" is used with extreme caution by Catholic theologians as it suggests that there are Protocanonical books and Deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament, when there is absolutely no such thing outside of hypothetical consideration. It is important to note that these theologians also had absolutely no authority to canonize the bible. These terms are nothing more than personal opinions. Martin Luther was the first Christian outside of the RCC to claim that he had the authority to canonize the bible when he rejected books of the OT as a solution to his own personal problem of dealing with purgatorial subjects when it was shown to him in his own Vulgate. He concluded that a post-crucifixion Jewish canon semi-fixed at the Council of Jamnia in 90AD would fit the bill and went with it. I believe most Orthodox Jews today would point out that the Jewish Canon is not closed because the messiah has yet to come. The actual bible canon was fixed by the RCC in 397 at the III Council of Carthage. [Cpt|Kirk 17:58, 23 March 2006 (UTC)]</p>

<p>The article mentions that Martin Luther dropped some (or all, I forget) of the Deuterocanonical/Apocryphal books, but, didn't he also drop the canonical epistle of James, so perhaps quoting him introduces some complication (the canon of Martin Luther) that belongs elsewhere&#160;?</p>
<hr />
<p>Why is Book of Enoch among NT Apocrypha? Why aren't apocalypses among the apocrypha? for example Apocalypse of Peter?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Luther created the 'Apocrypha' by moving books from the Old Testament into this newly created section. He also divided up the New Testament by creating a section for 'The Capital Books' and then a lesser section of the NT called the 'Oecolampadius' for Rev., Jas., Jude, 1 Pet, and 2-3 John. The Book of Enoch was not found in the LXX (Septuagint) and so did not appear in the Christian OT. The Apocalypse of Peter is apocrypha, but not Protestant apocrypha but Catholic apocrypha which can be found in a larger group of Early Christian Writings (200+ books).

<p>In refactoring the Old Testament section, I made the particularly questionable edits below, which others should review:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Not all books from the Septuagint are accepted by the Roman Catholic church as canonical. The <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prayer_of_Manasseh_c1e5.html" title="Prayer of Manasseh">Prayer of Manasseh</a>, <a href="../../../3/_/e/3_Esdras_45ea.html" title="3 Esdras">3 Esdras</a>, <a href="../../../4/_/e/4_Esdras_793f.html" title="4 Esdras">4 Esdras</a>, <a href="../../../3/_/m/3_Maccabees_7f37.html" title="3 Maccabees">3 Maccabees</a>, <a href="../../../4/_/m/4_Maccabees_4be1.html" title="4 Maccabees">4 Maccabees</a>, and <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalm_151.html" title="Psalm 151">Psalm 151</a> are not considered to be canonical, and are not included in the canon, although some Protestants include these books in the Apocrypha. In the <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulgate.html" title="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>, these books are found in an appendix. &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>I couldn't find these in the appendix to the Vulgate on the Vatican's site, but it was in Latin, so I had a hard time deciphering it. Other than that, this paragraph is mostly redundant, so I dropped it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Nova Vulgata at the Vatican site is one of the modern editions that omit the Apocrypha. The old Clementine <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulgate.html" title="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> contained them. -rwflammang 13 April 2006</dd>
</dl>
<p>&gt;&gt; Among the Oriental Orthodox, all the deuterocanonical books are accepted &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>I disambiguated this from "the Apocrypha is accepted", but I am not sure that is what was meant. The article on "Oriental Orthodox" doesn't help.</p>

<p>More questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the Jewish section says "apocrypha", does it refer only to the Apocrypha of the Old Testament, or does it include the entirety of the New Testament, too? Is there a better term with which to disambiguate, perhaps a Hebrew one?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is it <i>the</i> apocrypha, and it is capitalized or not? Is there a semantic difference?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The word apocryphon is a common noun, plural apocrypha. "The apocrypha" refers to a given set of apocrypha, e.g., those apocrypha found in a given edition of the Bible. When those apocrypha are gathered into a dedicated section, the section title is usually capitalized: "the Apocrypha", following the style of "the Old Testament" and "the New Testament".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The word apocryphon is rarely used in the singular, because there is no such thing as a generic apocryphon, only particular apocrypha, which are typically referred to by name, e.g., the Proto-evangelion of James, or the Prayer of Manasseh. Rwflammang 20 April 2006</dd>

<p>The "Four Criteria for Canonicity" section seems self-contradictory. If these criteria have not been applied consistently and objectively (which they clearly have not), then other factors must also have influenced historical decisions on canonical status. So why is there this neat and tidy list?</p>
<p>Is there some historical group which has claimed these principles as ideals? If so they should be identified and some edits made to preserve NPOV.</p>
<p>The article shouldn't just admonish authors of book-specific articles to do good book-specific histories. It should link to a good general history or collection of histories of canonicalization. The rest of the article tries to present some of that history, but it's terribly incomplete and rather choppy. I'm not sure such a history exists on the Wikipedia yet.</p>

<p>As a point of neutrality, the contemporary BCE/CE nomenclature is, I believe, appropriate. Wikipedia terminology should reflect contemporary usage rather than obsolete symantic forms. --RubberNeckHawaii 21:01, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>

<p>The section titled "Latter Day Saint views", describes LDS views on apocrypha as previously described.</p>
<p>Concerning the paragraph in this section beging with "Catholics and Protestants": Catholic and Protestant views of The Book of Mormon, don't quite belong in this secton of this article. Yet I tried to keep the most relevant ideas see bottom of entry. On a side note, the veracity of any scripture is rarely without one form of controversy or another.</p>
<p>Also, my fellow Mormons, are apocryphal texts only to be revealed <i>before</i> the second coming? Not after or durring? I generalized the sentence to allow for this.</p>
<p>Here's what I did</p>
<dl>
<dd>Latter Day Saints, and most Mormon sects in the wider sense, believe the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_f6c8.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a> to be of apocryphal (hidden) origin.

<p>From Apocrypha in Judaism through a large portion of the rest of the article, it reads more like, to be honest, a bad novel than Wikipedia. It relies overly much on elaborate prose and a storytelling angle - this is an encylopedia, and beginning at this point, the article, stylistically, becomes distinctly un-encylopedic. The writing quality would be decent for, example, a high school essay on the Apocrypha, but it is not sufficient for Wikipedia, due to disorganization. Beginning with Apocrypha in Christianity, the article begins bordering on breaking NPOV - while it's possible to read the whole thing and come away with a sense of NPOV, I had to brush aside my first interpretations of the section to do so - not something which should be present. Also, "We have remarked above..." breaks encylopedic style as well - the encylopedia is not a We. It's not even an I, or an It. Similar effect could be gotten by saying 'As shown above...' or equivalent, and similar errors show up in several places later in the article. There's also too much transition between subsections - if you're going to place a subsection header, treat the contents of it as independent of the other subsections. This article shouldn't run on chronological order - at least not in a storytelling sense. The only significant problem with this article is a large stylistic break. Go read other wiki articles (preferrably those which are held to be of high quality, such as the Featured Articles) and take note of the stylistic decisions they make. The elaborate prose and bad style need to be eliminated. In fact, the first parts of the article - up until Apocrypha in Judaism - is quality in style and substance. I'm not qualified to make the edits this article needs (or else I would do it myself) but I felt like this was a nastier bit of stylistic break than usual so I have no choice but to comment. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarr_2b4b.html" title="User:Rarr">Rarr</a> 06:18, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the article needs a re-write as well.

Looking at it it looks like parts of the article come from some ancient and out of date encyclopedia (e.g. Encyclopedia Brittania 1911) - one that doesn't know about the discoveries at <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nag_Hammadi_7cf7.html" title="Nag Hammadi">Nag Hammadi</a> for example. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClinkophonist_b598.html" title="User:Clinkophonist">Clinkophonist</a> 21:07, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This section currently reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The first King James Bible published without the Apocrypha appeared in 1640. By 1826, the British and Foreign Bible Society decided to refuse to distribute Bibles containing the Apocrypha. Since then most modern editions of the Bible, even most modern re-printings of the King James, Vulgate, and Douay-Rheims versions, omit the Apocrypha section. This trend reflects the increasing importance of dogmatism relative to tradition in modern Christianity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are some exceptions to this trend, however. Some editions of the Revised Standard Version of the King James Bible include not only the Apocrypha listed above, but also the third and fourth books of the Maccabees, and Psalm 151. The Stuttgart edition of the Vulgate (the printed edition, not most of the on-line editions) contains the Clementine Apocrypha as well as the Epistle to the Laodiceans and Psalm 151.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I can't tell if this is Protestant-centric or just wrong; the Vulgate is in Latin and Douay-Rheims in English, but both are Catholic—thus they don't have a section labelled "Apocrypha", but do include all that material. It is at least misleading, and it makes me wonder about the accuracy of the second paragraph as well. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahedo_918c.html" title="User:Blahedo">blahedo</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlahedo_0498.html" title="User talk:Blahedo">t</a>) 05:07, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The 16th century editions of both the Douay Bible and the Clementine Vulgate did have an appendix labelled <i>Apocrypha</i>; it contained three books: <i>The Prayer of Manasses</i>, <i>3 Esdras</i>, and <i>4 Esdras</i>. See <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Latin_Vulgate_2c88.html" title="Books of the Latin Vulgate">Books of the Latin Vulgate</a> for details. These books are omitted from practically all Catholic bibles today; even reprints of the Douay and the Vulgate. Some Protestant bibles, those with <i>Apocrypha</i> sections, still contain them. This is a simple statement of fact, not of bias.</dd>

<p>Every time I went at trying to clean up the main article, I found myself at a loss as to where even to start. So I took a deep breath, figured out what the major fault lines were, and split the article. I created <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_apocrypha.html" title="Jewish apocrypha">Jewish apocrypha</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_apocrypha.html" title="Biblical apocrypha">Biblical apocrypha</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_apocrypha_b74e.html" title="New Testament apocrypha">New Testament apocrypha</a> already existed but I'm inclined to switch it to Christian apocrypha though I haven't done that yet.</p>
<p>Both new articles contain considerable material from the original article, and not contiguous chunks, either; this should hopefully make it a lot easier to spot duplicate or contradictory information and merge or reconcile as appropriate. The split is far from a done deal—a lot of cleanup work is still required. Among other things, not all the info in the sections of this page is contained in the "main article" that they refer to, which should be fixed. And the references I did <i>nothing</i> with, so some of the refs on this page should be farmed out to the subpages.</p>
<p>I'll keep working on this, but I wanted to let any watchers know what was going on first.

There's still a lot of work to be done, and stuff to be moved between the apocrypha articles and to related ones like <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">Biblical canon</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deuterocanonical_books.html" title="Deuterocanonical books">deuterocanonical books</a>. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahedo_918c.html" title="User:Blahedo">blahedo</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlahedo_0498.html" title="User talk:Blahedo">t</a>) 18:17, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMO, <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_apocrypha.html" title="Biblical apocrypha">Biblical apocrypha</a> should be, say, Old Testament apocrypha. <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_apocrypha_b74e.html" title="New Testament apocrypha">New Testament apocrypha</a> covers, obviously, the New Testament books, and all of the books in Biblcal apographa are Old Testament books. This split was done very nicely, by the way - I'd thought before that <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha.html" title="Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a> would be very difficult to split but you found a nice way to do it. The article's been much improved by its trimming and your editing in general - are you an expert on this subject or just very good at copyediting? There's definitely work to be done in terms of a couple of style edits but it's a lot better. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarr_2b4b.html" title="User:Rarr">Rarr</a> 20:01, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I'm not deeply attached to this nomenclature, I do prefer the title "Biblical apocrypha" because it highlights the fact that of all the many and varied "apocrypha", these are the ones that are frequently printed in Bibles. The reason I don't like the extant "NT apocrypha" is that, while their subject matter is contemporary with that of the NT, nobody (that I know of) actually considers them to be part of the NT. I don't like the term "OT apocrypha" for a similar reason: the people that consider them to be apocrypha don't consider them part of the OT, and vice versa. (Oh, and I'm just an armchair expert on this—I knew a bit about it, and have learned quite a bit more from WP and elsewhere in the course of performing the split!) /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahedo_918c.html" title="User:Blahedo">blahedo</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlahedo_0498.html" title="User talk:Blahedo">t</a>) 21:41, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm scratching my head over what to do with the parenthetical citations scattered throughout the text. These appear to be cut-n-pasted in from the text of the 1911 Britannica (or wherever), and cleave to that antique style rather than contemporary, wiki-friendly links &amp; footnote citations.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of passages like these: <i>Thus Origen distinguishes between writings which were read by the churches and apocryphal writings; γραφη μη φερομενη μεν εν τοις κοινοις και δεδημοσιευμενοις βιβλιοις εικος δ ὁτι εν αποκρυφοις φερομενη (Origen's Comm. in Matt., x. 18, on Matt. xiii. 57, ed. Lommatzsch iii. 49 sqq.). Cf. Epist. ad Africam, ix. (Lommatzsch xvii. 31): Euseb. H.E. ii. 23, 25; iii. 3, 6. See Zahn, Gesch. Kanons, i. 126 sqq. Thus the meaning of αποκρυφος is here practically equivalent to "excluded from the public use of the church", and prepares the way for an even less favourable use of the word.</i></p>
<p>Evidently, the old writer was citing a commentary made by Origen on the Book of Matthew as presented by an editor named Lommatzsch. I have no idea who Lommatzch was, or what book this is -- but I'm uncomfortable simply deleting this reference, since it's putting words in Origen's mouth and needs to be sourced. Should this simply be cited to the Brittanica? Should I (or someone more motivated) actually look up the Lommatzch or some other source for Origen's commentaries, add that to the references and link to that? --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrantb_5c9c.html" title="User:Grantb">grant</a> 16:01, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since it's saved on the talk page, feel free to just cite the Britannica. If somebody discovers that the references weren't preserved from the wholesale Britannica-ization, we can research it. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarr_2b4b.html" title="User:Rarr">Rarr</a> 19:45, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Done -- although now, there are a few chunks of Latin and Greek wandering around the page untranslated. I've cited the Britannica all over the place, and linked at least once to a page with a source text from one of the early Christian commentators on it. <b>Greek and Latin translators! Come clean up this page!</b> -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrantb_5c9c.html" title="User:Grantb">grant</a> 17:35, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
