<p>During the three day explorations of the Moon by Scott and Irwin, Worden had a busy schedule of observations. <i>Apollo 15</i> was the first mission to carry the SIM bay, which contained a <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panoramic.html" title="Panoramic">panoramic</a> camera, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamma_ray_spectrometer.html" title="Gamma ray spectrometer">gamma ray spectrometer</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/p/Mapping.html" title="Mapping">mapping</a> camera, <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">laser</a> <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altimeter.html" title="Altimeter">altimeter</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrometer.html" title="Mass spectrometer">mass spectrometer</a>.

<p>Many of his observations were of far side features that had not been seen in great detail. The panoramic camera was a modified version of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Air_Force_e341.html" title="U.S. Air Force">U.S. Air Force</a>'s KA-80A camera for its <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy_satellite.html" title="Spy satellite">spy satellites</a>, using a 610&#160;mm f/3.5 lens. This particular camera was similar to those used by the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_U-2_ae78.html" title="Lockheed U-2">Lockheed U-2</a>, <a href="../../../a/-/1/A-12_Oxcart_975e.html" title="A-12 Oxcart">A-12 <i>Oxcart</i></a> and <a href="../../../s/r/-/SR-71_Blackbird_d4d3.html" title="SR-71 Blackbird">SR-71 <i>Blackbird</i></a>. It could see features as small as 3&#160;ft (1&#160;m) across on the lunar surface. It would take long strips, 205 by 13&#160;mi (330 by 21&#160;km) of the surface, on 3.8&#160;foot by 4.5&#160;inch (114.8 by 11.4&#160;cm) strips of film. Over the course of the mission it would take 1,529 usable images, exposing 2 km of film. The film cassette weighed 55&#160;lb (25&#160;kg).</p>
<p>The other camera in the SIM bay was the Mapping Camera. This consisted of two cameras, the Metric Camera and the Stellar Camera. The Metric Camera took square frames of film, covering about 27,000 km² of the lunar surface, with a resolution of about 20 m. Using <a href="../../../r/e/s/Reseau_plate.html" title="Reseau plate">Reseau plates</a> (which added the familiar crosses to Apollo photographs) and other data provided by the laser altimeter, it was possible to identify the exact position on the lunar surface of the photograph taken. A total of 2,240 usable photographs were produced.</p>
<p>The Laser Altimeter could measure the height of the CSM above the lunar surface to within one meter. It used a pulsed <a href="../../../r/u/b/Ruby.html" title="Ruby">ruby</a> <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">laser</a> operating at 694.3 nanometers and 200 <a href="../../../j/o/u/Joule.html" title="Joule">millijoule</a> pulses of 10 nanoseconds duration. The Stellar Camera was used during the runs of the Laser Altimeter on the night side of the Moon. It would show the exact position of the laser beam, for calibration the altimeter's results.</p>
<p>During his first pass over the landing site, after landing, Worden attempted to see <i>Falcon</i> using the 28 times magnification <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sextant.html" title="Sextant">sextant</a>. He was successful, refining the position of the site. This was of great help to mission planners as it would help them further refine the planning of the traverses by Scott and Irwin, and also help with photographic interpretation from the surface.</p>
<p>Another experiment performed on <i>Apollo 15</i> involved using the radio signal of <i>Endeavour</i> and was termed the Downlink Bistatic Radar Experiment to find the <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dielectric_constant.html" title="Dielectric constant">dielectric constant</a> of the surface material. During the 17th near side pass, while Worden was eating his dinner, the spacecraft was oriented so that its radio signal would reflect off the Moon and be received by the Earth. The strength of this signal varies with the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angle_of_incidence.html" title="Angle of incidence">angle of incidence</a>. The <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brewster%27s_angle.html" title="Brewster's angle">Brewster's angle</a> is when the signal is the weakest and is a function of the dielectric constant.</p>
<p>Before going to sleep, Worden orientated the spacecraft best for the various experiments of the SIM bay, specifically the spectrometers.</p>
<p>The Gamma-ray Spectrometer detected radiation with energies of 1 <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronvolt.html" title="Electronvolt">MeV</a> to 10 MeV. As the gamma ray passed through a cylinder of <a href="../../../d/o/p/Doping_%28semiconductors%29.html" title="Doping (semiconductors)">doped</a> <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodium.html" title="Sodium">sodium</a> <a href="../../../i/o/d/Iodide.html" title="Iodide">iodide</a>, it would emit light that would be detected by a <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photomultiplier.html" title="Photomultiplier">photomultiplier</a> tube. Another photomultiplier tube detected charged particles that passed through a plastic shield around the cylinder. All of this was on the end of a 25 ft (7.6 m) boom that would be deployed and retracted periodically during the mission. It sat at the end of the boom so that it would not be contaminated by the spacecraft.</p>
<p>The Alpha Particle Spectrometer measured the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_particle.html" title="Alpha particle">alpha particles</a> emitted by the surface, specifically by the <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas.html" title="Gas">gaseous</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radon.html" title="Radon">radon</a>-222 and radon-220. It was optimized to detect particles of energies of 4.7 to 9.1 MeV. It was built into the same casing as the X-ray Spectrometer.</p>
<p>The X-ray Spectrometer was used to investigate the properties of the upper layers of the lunar surface. As solar <a href="../../../x/-/r/X-ray.html" title="X-ray">X-rays</a> strike the surface, they cause the elements to <a href="../../../f/l/u/Fluorescence.html" title="Fluorescence">fluoresce</a> X-rays with well defined energies. The spectrometer could measure these and determine the composition of the lunar surface.</p>

<p>Worden's first full day of solo operations was much the same as the previous day. He spent much of his time switching various experiments on and off and acquiring photographs of targets of interest on the lunar surface.</p>

<p>Even after one day in orbit, mission scientists were extremely pleased with the data returned by the spectrometers. However due to orbital mechanics, they would only get data from one part of the Moon. During the six days in lunar orbit, the Moon only <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotate.html" title="Rotate">rotated</a> about 20% and the spacecraft's orbit was only inclined by 26°. So only a small amount of the lunar surface was actually covered. Ideally for scientists, a mission would be placed in a polar orbit for a month, from where it could observe the entire lunar surface.</p>
<p>Lunar scientists were particularly interested in rocks that had higher concentrations of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samarium.html" title="Samarium">samarium</a>, <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranium.html" title="Uranium">uranium</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thorium.html" title="Thorium">thorium</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potassium.html" title="Potassium">potassium</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosphorus.html" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a>. They gave these rocks the <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym.html" title="Acronym">acronym</a> <a href="../../../k/r/e/KREEP_2388.html" title="KREEP">KREEP</a> (potassium (atomic symbol K), rare earth elements (REE), and phosphorus (P)). The gamma-ray spectrometer was designed to detect these types of rocks. They had been found at the <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_12.html" title="Apollo 12">Apollo 12</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_14.html" title="Apollo 14">Apollo 14</a></i> landing sites but not at the <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_11.html" title="Apollo 11">Apollo 11</a></i> site, which was about 1,000 km to the east. At the time of the <i>Apollo 15</i> scientists were interested in whether KREEP rocks were found all over the Moon or just in the region around <i>12</i> and <i>14</i>. It is believed that KREEPs represent the last chemical remnants of that magma ocean after the lunar crust formed. KREEPs floated to the surface because their component elements are "incompatible", that is, they did not incorporate into compact crystal structures. Results from <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_Prospector_f449.html" title="Lunar Prospector">Lunar Prospector</a>'s gamma ray <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spectrometer.html" title="Spectrometer">spectrometer</a> shows that KREEP-containing rocks are concentrated in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mare_Imbrium_9ed1.html" title="Mare Imbrium">Mare Imbrium</a> rim, the near side <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_mare.html" title="Lunar mare">maria</a> and highlands near Imbrium and the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mare_Ingenii_3ece.html" title="Mare Ingenii">Mare Ingenii</a> <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Pole-Aitken_basin_e7a0.html" title="South Pole-Aitken basin">South Pole-Aitken basin</a> and are distributed at a lower level in the highlands. The distribution seen by Lunar Prospector supports the idea that the impact which formed Mare Imbrium excavated KREEP-rich rocks and ejected them over the Moon and the South Pole-Aitkin basin impact also exposed KREEP-rich material.</p>
<p>One of the more personal things that Worden did during the mission was how he greeted Mission Control after reappearing from behind the Moon on each orbit. He and Farouk El-Baz had decided to use the phrase "Hello Earth; Greetings from <i>Endeavour</i>" but in different languages, ranging from <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>.</p>
<p>Problems developed with the Panoramic Camera. It used what was called a "V-over-H" sensor to measure the motion of the surface beneath it, from which is worked out how to move the camera to compensate for this motion. From the beginning this sensor had begun to play up, with only about 80% of images being without some blurring. It would not affect the camera greatly but was an annoyance.</p>

<p>One of the targets of particular interest was the crater <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristarchus_%28crater%29.html" title="Aristarchus (crater)">Aristarchus</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, Jim Greenacre saw a reddish glow in the region. This was confirmed by four other observers including the then-director of the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowell_Observatory_7824.html" title="Lowell Observatory">Lowell Observatory</a>. <i>Apollo 15</i> was the first manned spacecraft to pass over the site. At the time it was not in direct sunlight but was illuminated by light reflected off the Earth — <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthshine.html" title="Earthshine">Earthshine</a>. Worden did not see any glows, even though he described it as being "so bright in Earthshine, it's almost as bright, it seems like, as it is in sunshine. Very, very bright crater."</p>
<p>A regular task for the crew was <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exercise.html" title="Exercise">exercise</a>. It had been found on even the short duration flights, the crews became weakened due to the lack of gravity. The Exergym was a <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bungee_cord.html" title="Bungee cord">bungee cord</a> that the crew would pull on to keep their shoulders and arms strong. Worden would also fold away the center couch and <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running.html" title="Running">jog</a> on the stop. Other exercises the crew found that they could do, was to position themselves between the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulkhead_%28partition%29.html" title="Bulkhead (partition)">bulkhead</a> and the couches and to kneebends against their arms. During the Technical Debrief at the end of the mission, the crew said that although it was planned for all of them to do equal amounts of exercise, Worden did twice as much, as he was in <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weightlessness.html" title="Weightlessness">weightlessness</a> for the entire mission, while the other two would spend three days in the one-sixth gravity of the Moon.</p>
<p>During a pass over the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Littrow_%28crater%29.html" title="Littrow (crater)">Littrow</a> region, Worden reported seeing "small, almost irregular shaped cones", which he said looked like <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volcanic_cone.html" title="Volcanic cone">cinder cones</a>. This observation would become one of the main reasons for there on <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_17.html" title="Apollo 17">Apollo 17</a></i>. It would turn out that one of these 'cinder cones' was just an impact crater, when visited by the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Cernan_2791.html" title="Gene Cernan">Gene Cernan</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrison_Schmitt_ca42.html" title="Harrison Schmitt">Harrison Schmitt</a> on <i>17</i> and that what in fact he was seeing were young craters with dark <a href="../../../e/j/e/Ejecta.html" title="Ejecta">ejecta</a> blankets. Evidence did emerge for volcanic activity at Shorty when orange soil was found there. This was composed of orange glass beads which were sprayed while molten from a <a href="../../../f/u/m/Fumarole.html" title="Fumarole">fumarole</a> or "fire fountain" 3.64 billion years ago.</p>

<p>During the third day solo in lunar orbit, Worden began to have some problems with the Mass Spectrometer. This was located on the end of a <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boom.html" title="Boom">boom</a> that is deployed and retracted periodically throughout the mission. Frequently instruments in the CM were indicating that it had failed to retract. To get it to retract properly he had to cycle the retract/deploy switch several times. During the EVA on the return to Earth, he inspected the housing and found that guide pins were barely coming through the guide slot. Further it was found that the problems with retraction always occurred after the housing had been in the shadow of the spacecraft, but would retract fully after being in sunlight. This was caused by the motor stalling. To stop this occurring, several modifications were made to the instruments used on <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_16.html" title="Apollo 16">Apollo 16</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_17.html" title="Apollo 17">Apollo 17</a></i>.</p>
<p>146 hours after launch, Worden position the spacecraft so that he could take photographs of the region of the '<a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky.html" title="Sky">sky</a>' opposite the Sun, in hopes of seeing the <a href="../../../g/e/g/Gegenschein.html" title="Gegenschein">gegenschein</a>. This faint glow is thought to be caused by tiny particles in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interplanetary_medium.html" title="Interplanetary medium">interplanetary medium</a> reflecting light back at the observer. Due to aiming errors, no useful data was returned. Other non-lunar targets were the <a href="../../../z/o/d/Zodiacal_light.html" title="Zodiacal light">zodiacal light</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corona.html" title="Corona">corona</a> of the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_15%2C_Solo_operations_612f.html" title="Edit section: Day 4">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Day 4</span></h3>
<p>The fourth solo day was an extremely busy one, for both crews. Scott and Irwin had a five hour LEVA and for liftoff from the Moon. Worden would then have to perform a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_rendezvous.html" title="Space rendezvous">rendzvous and docking</a> with the LM.</p>
<p>Before all of this, Worden had to perform a plane change burn. During the three days, the orbital path of <i>Endeavour</i> had drifted so that it no longer passed over the landing site. As such, without this burn, rendezvous would have been complicated. This was an 18 second burn of the SPS, coming just after <i>Endeavour</i> reappeared from behind the Moon on its 45th orbit.</p>
<p>Worden then attempted to make a sighting of <i>Falcon</i> on the surface. This was done to provide accurate information of the new orbit of the CSM, to help with the upcoming rendezvous. However he had difficulty due to the Sun having risen higher, making the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relief.html" title="Relief">relief</a> much less and the surface much brighter.</p>
