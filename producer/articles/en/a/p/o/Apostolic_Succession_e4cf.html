In Catholic and Orthodox theology, the "College of Apostles" received the sacrament of Holy Orders from Christ, making them the first bishops, and the bishops of the world today, as a group (the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_Bishops_42d8.html" title="College of Bishops">College of Bishops</a>) have the same role within the church as the College of Apostles did immediately after Christ's ministry (the Catholic Church additionally holds that within the College of Apotsles, Peter was picked out for the unique role of leadership and to serve as the source of unity among the apostles, a role among the bishops and within the church inherited by the pope as Peter's successor today).</p>
<p>These churches hold that Christ entrusted the leadership of the community of believers, and the obligation to transmit and preserve the "deposit of faith" (the experience of Christ and his teachings contained in the doctrinal "tradition" handed down from the time of the apostles, the written portion of which is Scripture) to the apostles, and the apostles passed on this role by ordaining bishops after them.</p>
<p>Catholic and Orthodox theology additionally hold that the power and authority to confect the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacraments.html" title="Sacraments">sacraments</a>, or at least all of the sacraments aside from baptism and matrimony (the first of which may be administered by anyone, the second of which is administered by the couple to each other) is passed on only through the sacrament of Holy Orders, and an unbroken line of ordination of bishops to the apostles is necessary for the valid celebration of the sacraments today. Catholics recognize the validity of the apostolic successions of the bishops, and therefore the rest of the clergy, of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian, Old Catholic, and some Independent Catholic Churches. The Eastern Orthodox do not recognize Roman Catholics nor any other group as having Apostolic Succession, examples of <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economia.html" title="Economia">economia</a> such as the reception of Catholic priests by "vesting" rather than by re-ordination, notwithstanding. Neither the Catholic nor the Orthodox Church recognize the validity of the apostolic succession of the clergy of the Anglican or other Protestant churches, in large measure because of their theology of the Eucharist.</p>
<p>The unbrokenness of apostolic succession is also significant because of Jesus Christ's promise that the "gates of hell" <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> would not prevail against the Church, and his promise that he himself would be with the apostles to "the end of the age".<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> According to this interpretation, a complete disruption or end of such apostolic succession would mean that these promises were not kept as would an apostolic succession which, while formally intact, completely abandoned the teachings of the Apostles and their immediate successors; as, for example, if all the bishops of the world agreed to abrogate the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene_Creed_e8a2.html" title="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creed</a> or to repudiate the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>.</p>

<p>Bishops in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Methodist_Church_6a72.html" title="United Methodist Church">United Methodist Church</a> do not claim to be within the historic episcopate in the same way as Catholic, Anglican, and Orthodox bishops. They do, however, claim a corporate ("connectional") and theological form of Apostolic succession, and are not adverse to ecumenical acts which would further establish their ministry within the historic episcopate, though such would have to be accomplished without repudiating or otherwise questioning the validity of their current orders and ministries. Methodist episcopal succession derives from John Wesley, who was an ordained presbyter of the Church of England but not himself a bishop and thus not officially authorized to consecrate others. Wesley justified his practice of ordaining bishops (which he called "general superintendents") and elders (i.e., presbyters) for the methodists in the new United States of America in 1784 by appealing to a perceived need and by citing a minority opinion among the early Church Fathers (and an ancient precedent from the Church of Alexandria) which held that presbyters ("priests" or "elders") could, at least collectively, indeed ordain other such presbyters and even consecrate, or "set apart" bishops in certain emergency situations. Based upon this argument, the United Methodist Church understands all of its Elders, not just its Bishops, as being part of an Apostolic succession of the entire body (or "conference") of ministers: "In ordination, the church affirms and continues the apostolic ministry through persons empowered by the Holy Spirit." (Book of Discipline paragraph 303). In other words, they understand apostolic succession as being rooted within the Presbyterate. This does not mean, however, that all elders may ordain; quite the contrary, only those elders who have been elected and consecrated as bishops can further the apostolic succession through the ordination of bishops, elders, and deacons within the United Methodist Church. In this way, the United Methodist episcopacy functions as if it were within the historic episcopate.</p>
<p>Accepting, but moving beyond, this position a few Methodists do affirm that their bishops stand in a form of the historic, as well as theological, Apostolic Succession (i.e., in the Anglican fashion); their argument is that Wesley's ordinations, and therefore the subsequent line of Methodist bishops, are legitimate due to the critical nature of the circumstances extant at that time. Some Methodists even make an appeal to the "Legend of Erasmus," which asserts that, while on a visit to London in 1763, the Greek Orthodox bishop of the Diocese of Arcadia, Crete, secretly consecrated Wesley to the episcopacy. That Wesley actually met with Bishop Erasmus during the bishop's visit to London is not questioned; what is questioned is that Erasmus did more than simply "confirm Wesley in his ministry among the methodists in England and America." When Wesley was asked if Erasmus had made him a bishop, he offered no personal response but, rather, took the unusual course of authorizing a representative to reply that he had not requested episcopal consecration within the Greek Orthodox line. Many take this as a sufficient denial, and it was enough to keep Wesley out of jail, but those who believe that Wesley was actually consecrated make the following arguments to the contrary: (1) Wesley personally remained silent on the subject, (2) Wesley took the unusual step of having someone to speak on his behalf, and (3) Wesley <i>never actually denied being consecrated a bishop,</i> what he denied was <i>requesting</i> consecration from Erasmus. This distinction may seem meaningless to us today, but it is actually quite substantive given the circumstances of the 1700s. Were Wesley <i>actually</i> consecrated a bishop by Erasmus, he would not have been able to publicly affirm such without falling prey to the stipulations of the English <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_Supremacy_7014.html" title="Acts of Supremacy">Acts of Supremacy</a> (1534 &amp; 1559). To keep from being charged with treason, and to keep his head, it is argued that Wesley skirted the question altogether by offering a "non-denial denial." Given the circumstances, the argument actually makes some sense: Wesley was asked if he had been made a bishop by Erasmus; his response was that he had not requested consecration ... which actually doesn't answer the original question! After all, episcopal consecration could have been Erasmus' idea, not Wesley's. If Wesley had affirmed that he had been made a bishop, or even if he had just confessed that he had requested consecration, he would have been placing himself in jeopardy of treason against the crown! Wesley was a self-professed Whig and a faithful "son of the English Church," to publicly violate the Oaths of Supremacy would have been entirely repugnant to him on both political and theological grounds ... not to mention that he was understandably fond of his own neck. Hence, the argument concludes that Wesley obfuscated the entire issue by distancing himself from the question and by answering in such a way as to deflect further inquiry. Despite the beliefs of many Methodists and other Anglicans -- beliefs which were finally articulated after Wesley's death -- it worked; while the question never died out entirely, Wesley remained a presbyter of the Church of England until the day he died. Contrary to the "Legend of Erasmus" stands the undeniable fact that, beginning with the American Revolution in the 1770s, Wesley did request episcopal consecration for several of his preachers and, indeed, for himself, so as to provide sacramental ministry for the Methodists in the break-away colonies. Had Wesley already been consecrated a bishop by Erasmus, why would he have requested such consecrations for others or for himself? Nevertheless, the "Legend of Erasmus" remained a very popular argument throughout much of the 1800s and, while still garnering a following among some proponents today, it is not accepted by a vast majority of Methodists nor even by most of those who affirm a form of Apostolicity for their bishops.

<p>Most Protestant churches would deny that the apostolicity of the Church rests on an unbroken episcopacy. They generally hold that one important qualification of the apostles was that they were chosen directly by <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> and that they witnessed the resurrected Christ. According to this understanding, the work of these twelve (and the Apostle <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">Paul</a>), together with the prophets of the twelve tribes of Israel, provide the doctrinal foundation for the whole church of subsequent history through the Scriptures of the Bible. To share with the apostles the same faith, to believe their word as found in the Scriptures, to receive the same Holy Spirit, is the only sense in which apostolic succession is meaningful, because it is in this sense only that men have fellowship with God in the truth (an extension of the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> doctrines of <i><a href="../../../s/o/l/Sola_fide.html" title="Sola fide">sola fide</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/o/l/Sola_scriptura.html" title="Sola scriptura">sola scriptura</a></i>). The most meaningful <i>apostolic succession</i> for most Protestants, then, is the faithful succession of apostolic <b>teaching</b>. There is, of course, much disagreement among various Protestant churches about the exact content of apostolic teaching.</p>
<p>It is worth noting, however, that some Protestant <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic_movement.html" title="Charismatic movement">charismatic</a> churches include "apostles" among the offices that should be evident into modern times in a true church, though they never trace an historical line of succession.</p>
<p>Those who hold to the importance of episcopal apostolic succession would counter the above by appealing to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, which, they say, implies a personal apostolic succession (from <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">Paul</a> to <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy.html" title="Timothy">Timothy</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle_Titus_abd1.html" title="Apostle Titus">Titus</a>, for example) and which states that Jesus gave the Apostles a "blank cheque" to lead the Church as they saw fit under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> They appeal as well to other documents of the very early Church, especially the Epistle of St. Clement to the Church at Corinth, written around 96 AD. In it, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Clement_I_9a32.html" title="Pope Clement I">Clement</a> defends the authority and prerogatives of a group of "<a href="../../../e/l/d/Elder_%28religious%29.html" title="Elder (religious)">elders</a>" or "<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishops</a>" in the Corinthian Church which had, apparently, been deposed and replaced by the congregation on its own initiative. In this context, Clement explicitly states that the apostles both appointed bishops as successors and had directed that these bishops should in turn appoint their own successors; given this, such leaders of the Church were not to be removed without cause and not in this way. Further, proponents of the necessity of the personal apostolic succession of bishops within the Church point to the universal practice of the undivided early Church (up to 431 AD), from which, as organizations, the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox (at that point in time one Church until 1054, see Great Schism), as well Oriental Orthodox and the Assyrian Churches have all directly descended.</p>
<p>At the same time, no defender of the personal apostolic succession of bishops would deny the importance of doctrinal continuity in the Church. As stated above, Irenaeus explicitly ties the two together.</p>

An example of what The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints calls church-wide apostolic revelation can be found in <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28King_James%29/Acts#10:1" class="extiw" title="s:Bible_(King_James)/Acts">Acts 10:1-48</a> where Peter had prayed and received revelation from God that the gospel could now go forward to the Gentiles as well as the Jews. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> Hence, the scripture where Christ says "upon this rock I will build my church" is interpreted by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a reference to <i>revelation</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."<br />
<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28King_James%29/Matthew#16:13" class="extiw" title="s:Bible_(King_James)/Matthew">Matthew 16:13-18</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that when Christ asked his disciples who they think he is, Peter had the right answer because he prayed and received revelation: "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, <i>but my Father which is in heaven.</i>" They believe that when Christ said "upon this rock I will build my church", the rock of which he was speaking was <i>revelation</i>. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that certain aspects of the church will change over time. For example, at one time Christ said not to preach to the Gentiles, and later Peter was given a revelation when it was time to start.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that the need for constant ongoing revelation is critical to conduct the affairs of the church.</p>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that Christ chose apostles and gave them the authority to receive revelation for the church by the laying on of hands. It further teaches that the apostles passed this authority onto others by choosing and ordaining new apostles by the laying on of hands (such as Paul and Matthias). Those individuals then had the appropriate authority to receive revelation for and officiate over the church in that office at that time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles."<br />
<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28King_James%29/Acts#1:24" class="extiw" title="s:Bible_(King_James)/Acts">Acts 1:24-26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that an apostasy occurred, where the apostolic authority was taken from the earth at some time after the original apostles. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints refers to the resultant loss of revelation and falling away from the teachings of Jesus Christ as the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Apostasy_abfd.html#The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" title="Great Apostasy">Great Apostasy</a>. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that this was predicted when Amos said that there would be a "famine of hearing the words of the Lord" in <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28King_James%29/Amos#8:11" class="extiw" title="s:Bible_(King_James)/Amos">Amos 8:11</a>, and by Paul when he was talking about the second coming "that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first" in <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28King_James%29/2_Thessalonians#2:3" class="extiw" title="s:Bible_(King_James)/2_Thessalonians">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>.</p>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints maintains that the authority from God needed to be restored to the earth, which took place when God the Father and His son, Jesus Christ, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Vision_3dfc.html" title="First Vision">appeared</a> to <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._b262.html" title="Joseph Smith, Jr.">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a> near <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmyra%2C_New_York_93c1.html" title="Palmyra, New York">Palmyra, New York</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1820.html" title="1820">1820</a> and called Joseph as a prophet to restore Christ's church to the earth with correct doctrines and practices. [This has caused a major furor among all other mainstream church denominations who do not accept "latter day revelations" as authoritative.]</p>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that near the time that Joseph formally organized The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1830.html" title="1830">1830</a>, the apostles Peter, James and John appeared to Joseph, laid their hands on Joseph and restored to him the apostolic authority to govern the church.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup>, and that Joseph was visited by other heavenly messengers at different times, each one conferring upon him the particular authority or keys for which they had stewardship. For example, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints maintains that John the Baptist restored the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaronic_Priesthood_2eef.html" title="Aaronic Priesthood">Aaronic Priesthood</a>, Peter James and John restored the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melchizedek_priesthood_%28Mormonism%29_6708.html" title="Melchizedek priesthood (Mormonism)">Melchizedek Priesthood</a>, with other heavenly messengers such as Moses and Elijah restoring the keys to the gathering of Israel and the sealing power of Elijah. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that Joseph was given the authority like the apostles of old, to confer to others specific priesthood authority by the laying on of hands. It further believes that all of the various keys of this authority have been and are passed on to worthy, male members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints according to their particular offices. In this way, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claims that apostolic authority was <i>restored</i> to the earth through the original twelve apostles and apostolic succession continues today through the ordination of new apostles as the older apostles pass away.</p>

<p><a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> teach that apostolic succession is an erroneous doctrine. They base this teaching on several lines of reasoning. Four of which are:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Peter was not the "rock" the 'church' was built on.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>2. There is no evidence Peter was in Rome.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>3. The claimed line of successors from Peter to the Pope is questionable.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>4. They contrast the replacement of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_Iscariot_cdd5.html" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> and the death of the apostle James.
