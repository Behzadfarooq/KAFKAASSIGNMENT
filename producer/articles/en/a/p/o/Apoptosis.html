<p><b>Apoptosis</b> (<a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <i>apo</i> - from, <i>ptosis</i> - falling; commonly pronounced with a silent second p<sup id="_ref-aboutapop_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aboutapop" title="">[1]</a></sup>) is a process of deliberate life relinquishment by a <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_%28biology%29.html" title="Cell (biology)">cell</a> in a <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multicellular_organism.html" title="Multicellular organism">multicellular organism</a>. It is one of the main types of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programmed_cell_death.html" title="Programmed cell death">programmed cell death</a> (PCD), and involves an orchestrated series of biochemical events leading to a characteristic cell <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morphology_%28biology%29.html" title="Morphology (biology)">morphology</a> and death. The apoptotic process is executed in such a way as to safely dispose of cell corpses and fragments.</p>
<p>In contrast to <a href="../../../n/e/c/Necrosis.html" title="Necrosis">necrosis</a>, which is a form of <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_%28biology%29.html" title="Cell (biology)">cell</a> death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis is carried out in an orderly process that generally confers advantages during an organism's life cycle. For example, the differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing human <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryo.html" title="Embryo">embryo</a> requires cells between the fingers to initiate apoptosis so that the digits can separate.</p>
<p>Research on apoptosis has increased substantially since the early 1990s. In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon, defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in an extensive variety of diseases. Excessive apoptosis causes <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hypotrophy" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:hypotrophy">hypotrophy</a>, such as in <a href="../../../i/s/c/Ischemic.html" title="Ischemic">ischemic</a> damage, whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation, such as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a>.</p>
<p>Between 50 billion and 70 billion <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_%28biology%29.html" title="Cell (biology)">cells</a> die each day due to apoptosis in the average human adult. In a year, this amounts to the proliferation and subsequent destruction of a mass of cells equal to an individual's body weight.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apoptosis.html" title="Edit section: Cell damage or infection">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cell damage or infection</span></h3>
<p>Apoptosis can occur when a cell is damaged beyond repair, infected with a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virus_%28biology%29.html" title="Virus (biology)">virus</a>, or undergoing stress conditions such as starvation. DNA damage from <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionizing_radiation.html" title="Ionizing radiation">ionizing radiation</a> or toxic chemicals can also induce apoptosis via the actions of the tumour-suppressing gene <i><a href="../../../p/5/3/P53.html" title="P53">p53</a></i>. The "decision" for apoptosis can come from the cell itself, from the surrounding tissue, or from a cell that is part of the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immune_system.html" title="Immune system">immune system</a>. In these cases apoptosis functions to remove the damaged cell, preventing it from sapping further nutrients from the organism, or to prevent the spread of viral infection.</p>
<p>Apoptosis also plays a role in preventing <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a>; if a cell is unable to undergo apoptosis, due to <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutation.html" title="Mutation">mutation</a> or biochemical inhibition, it can continue dividing and develop into a <a href="../../../t/u/m/Tumour.html" title="Tumour">tumour</a>. For example, infection by <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papillomavirus.html" title="Papillomavirus">papillomaviruses</a> causes a viral gene to interfere with the cell's <a href="../../../p/5/3/P53_gene.html" title="P53 gene">p53</a> protein, an important member of the apoptotic pathway. This interference in the apoptotic capability of the cell plays a critical role in the development of <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cervical_cancer.html" title="Cervical cancer">cervical cancer</a> in women.</p>
<p><a name="Homeostasis" id="Homeostasis"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apoptosis.html" title="Edit section: Homeostasis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Homeostasis</span></h3>
<p>In the adult organism, the number of cells is kept relatively constant through cell death and division. Cells must be replaced when they become diseased or malfunctioning; but proliferation must be compensated by cell death<sup id="_ref-pathogenesis_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pathogenesis" title="">[2]</a></sup>. This balancing process is part of the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeostasis.html" title="Homeostasis">homeostasis</a> required by living organisms to maintain their internal states within certain limits. Some scientists have suggested <i>homeodynamics</i> as a more accurate term<sup id="_ref-damasio_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-damasio" title="">[3]</a></sup>. The related term <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/Allostasis.html" title="Allostasis">allostasis</a></i> reflects a balance of a more complex nature by the body.</p>
<p>Homeostasis is achieved when the rate of <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitosis.html" title="Mitosis">mitosis</a> (cell proliferation) in the tissue is balanced by cell death. If this equilibrium is disturbed, one of two potentially fatal disorders occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cells are dividing faster than they die, effectively developing a <a href="../../../t/u/m/Tumor.html" title="Tumor">tumor</a>.</li>
<li>The cells are dividing slower than they die, which results in a disorder of cell loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>The organism must orchestrate a complex series of controls to keep homeostasis tightly controlled, a process which is ongoing for the life of the organism and involves many different types of <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_signaling.html" title="Cell signaling">cell signaling</a>. Impairment of any one of these controls can lead to a diseased state: for example, dysregulation of <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedgehog_signaling_pathway.html" title="Hedgehog signaling pathway">hedgehog signaling</a> has been implicated in several forms of cancer. The hedgehog pathway, which conveys an anti-apoptotic signal, has been found to be activated in <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pancreas.html" title="Pancreas">pancreatic</a> <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adenocarcinoma.html" title="Adenocarcinoma">adenocarcinoma</a> tissues.</p>

Incomplete differentiation in two toes due to lack of apoptosis</div>

<p>Programmed cell death is an integral part of both plant and animal <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_tissue.html" title="Biological tissue">tissue</a> <a href="../../../d/e/v/Developmental_biology.html" title="Developmental biology">development</a>. Development of an organ or tissue is often preceded by the extensive division and differentiation of a particular cell, the resultant mass is then "pruned" into the correct form by apoptosis. Unlike cellular death caused by injury, apoptosis results in cell shrinkage and fragmentation. This allows the cells to be efficiently <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phagocytose.html" title="Phagocytose">phagocytosed</a> and their components reused without releasing potentially harmful intracellular substances into the surrounding tissue.</p>
<p>Research on chick embryos has suggested how selective cell proliferation, combined with selective apoptosis, sculpts developing tissues in vertebrates. During vertebrate embryo development, structures called the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notochord.html" title="Notochord">notochord</a> and the floor plate secrete a gradient of the signaling molecule <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_hedgehog.html" title="Sonic hedgehog">Sonic hedgehog</a> (Shh), and it is this gradient that directs cells to form patterns in the embryonic neural tube: cells that receive Shh in a receptor in their membranes called Patched1 (Ptc1) survive and proliferate; but, in the absence of Shh, one of the ends of this same Ptc1 receptor (the carboxyl-terminal, inside the membrane) is cleaved by caspase-3, an action that exposes an apoptosis-producing domain<sup id="_ref-guerrero_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guerrero" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-thibert_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thibert" title="">[5]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>During development, apoptosis is tightly regulated and different tissues use different signals for inducing apoptosis. In birds, <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bone_morphogenetic_protein.html" title="Bone morphogenetic protein">bone morphogenetic proteins</a> (BMP) signaling is used to induce apoptosis in the interdigital tissue. In <i><a href="../../../d/r/o/Drosophila.html" title="Drosophila">Drosophila</a></i> flies, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steroid_hormone.html" title="Steroid hormone">steroid hormones</a> regulate cell death. Developmental cues can also induce apoptosis, such as the sex-specific cell death of hermaphrodite specific neurons in <i><a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._elegans.html" title="C. elegans">C. elegans</a></i> males through low <i>TRA-1</i> transcription factor activity (<i>TRA-1</i> helps prevent cell death).</p>

The process of apoptosis</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The process of apoptosis is controlled by a diverse range of <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_signalling.html" title="Cell signalling">cell signals</a> which may originate either extracellularly (<i>extrinsic inducers</i>) or intracellularly (<i>intrinsic inducers</i>). Extracellular signals may include <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hormone.html" title="Hormone">hormones</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/o/Growth_factor.html" title="Growth factor">growth factors</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitric_oxide.html" title="Nitric oxide">nitric oxide</a><sup id="_ref-NO_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NO" title="">[8]</a></sup> or <a href="../../../c/y/t/Cytokine.html" title="Cytokine">cytokines</a>, and therefore must either cross the plasma membrane or <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signal_transduction.html" title="Signal transduction">transduce</a> to effect a response. These signals may positively or negatively induce apoptosis; in this context the binding and subsequent initiation of apoptosis by a molecule is termed positive, whereas the active repression of apoptosis by a molecule is termed negative.</p>
<p>Intracellular apoptotic signalling is a response initiated by a cell in response to stress, and may ultimately result in cell suicide. The binding of nuclear receptors by <a href="../../../g/l/u/Glucocorticoid.html" title="Glucocorticoid">glucocorticoids</a>, heat, radiation, nutrient deprivation, viral infection and <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypoxia.html" title="Hypoxia">hypoxia</a> are all factors which can lead to the release of intracellular apoptotic signals by a damaged cell<sup id="_ref-robspath_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-robspath" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Before the actual process of cell death is carried out by enzymes, apoptotic signals must be connected to the actual death pathway by way of regulatory proteins. This step allows apoptotic signals to either culminate in cell death, or be aborted should the cell no longer need to die. Several proteins are involved, however two main methods of achieving regulation have been identified; targeting <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitochondria.html" title="Mitochondria">mitochondria</a> functionality, or directly transducing the signal via <i>adapter proteins</i> to the apoptotic mechanisms. The whole preparation process requires energy and functioning cell machinery.</p>
<p><a name="Mitochondrial_regulation" id="Mitochondrial_regulation"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apoptosis.html" title="Edit section: Mitochondrial regulation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mitochondrial regulation</span></h3>
<p>The mitochondria are essential to multicellular life, without them a cell ceases to <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerobic_respiration.html" title="Aerobic respiration">respire aerobically</a> and quickly dies - a fact exploited by some apoptotic pathways. Apoptotic proteins which target mitochondria affect them in different ways; they may cause mitochondrial swelling through the formation of membrane pores, or they may increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and cause apoptotic effectors to leak out<sup id="_ref-robspath_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-robspath" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial proteins known as SMACs (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) are released into the <a href="../../../c/y/t/Cytosol.html" title="Cytosol">cytosol</a> following an increase in permeability. SMAC binds to <i>inhibitor of apoptosis proteins</i> (IAPs) and inhibits them, preventing the IAPs from arresting the apoptotic process and therefore allowing apoptosis to proceed. IAP also normally suppresses the activity of a group of <a href="../../../c/y/s/Cysteine_protease.html" title="Cysteine protease">cysteine proteases</a> called <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caspase.html" title="Caspase">caspases</a><sup id="_ref-caspcontrol_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-caspcontrol" title="">[9]</a></sup>, which carry out the degradation of the cell, therefore the actual degradation enzymes can be seen to be indirectly regulated by mitochondrial permeability.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/y/t/Cytochrome_c.html" title="Cytochrome c">Cytochrome c</a> is also released from mitochondria due to increased permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and serves a regulatory function as it precedes morphological change associated with apoptosis<sup id="_ref-robspath_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-robspath" title="">[7]</a></sup>. <i>Bcl-2</i> proteins are able to promote or inhibit apoptosis by either direct action on mitochondrial permeability, or indirectly through other proteins. Importantly, the actions of some <i>Bcl-2</i> proteins are able to halt apoptosis even if cytochrome c has been released by the mitochondria<sup id="_ref-robspath_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-robspath" title="">[7]</a></sup> coupled to extrinsic signals.</p>
<p>TNF is a <a href="../../../c/y/t/Cytokine.html" title="Cytokine">cytokine</a> produced mainly by activated <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macrophage.html" title="Macrophage">macrophages</a>, and is the major extrinsic mediator of apoptosis. Most cells in the human body have two receptors for TNF: <i>TNF-R1</i> and <i>TNF-R2</i>. The binding of TNF to <i>TNF-R1</i> has been shown to initiate the pathway that leads to caspase activation via the intermediate membrane proteins <i>TNF receptor-associated death domain</i> (TRADD) and <i>Fas-associated death domain protein</i> (FADD)<sup id="_ref-tnfr1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tnfr1" title="">[10]</a></sup>.

<p>The <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fas_receptor.html" title="Fas receptor">Fas receptor</a> (also known as <i>Apo-1</i> or <i>CD95</i>) binds the <a href="../../../f/a/s/FAS_ligand_e4f8.html" title="FAS ligand">Fas ligand</a> (FasL), a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmembrane_protein.html" title="Transmembrane protein">transmembrane protein</a> part of the TNF family<sup id="_ref-fas_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fas" title="">[12]</a></sup>. The interaction between Fas and FasL results in the formation of the <i>death-inducing signaling complex</i> (DISC), which contains the FADD, caspase-8 and caspase-10. In some types of cells (type I), processed caspase-8 directly activates other members of the caspase family, and triggers the execution of apoptosis. In other types of cells (type II), the <i>Fas</i>-DISC starts a feedback loop that spirals into increasing release of pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria and the amplified activation of caspase-8<sup id="_ref-fassignal_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fassignal" title="">[13]</a></sup>.</p>

This balance is the proportion of pro-apoptotic <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homodimer.html" title="Homodimer">homodimers</a> that form in the outer-membrane of the mitochondrion. The pro-apoptotic homodimers are required to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable for the release of caspase activators such as cytochrome c and SMAC.

<p>Although many pathways and signals lead to apoptosis, there is only one mechanism which actually causes the death of the cell in this process; after the appropriate stimulus has been received by the cell and the necessary controls exerted, a cell will undergo the organised degradation of cellular organelles by activated <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proteolytic.html" title="Proteolytic">proteolytic</a> caspases. A cell undergoing apoptosis shows a characteristic morphology that can be observed with a <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microscope.html" title="Microscope">microscope</a>:</p>

<li>Cell shrinkage and rounding due to the breakdown of the proteinaceous cytoskeleton by caspases.</li>

<li>The cell membrane shows irregular buds known as <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleb.html" title="Bleb">blebs</a>.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apoptosis.html" title="Edit section: Defective apoptotic pathways">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Defective apoptotic pathways</span></h3>
<p>The many different types of apoptotic pathways contain a multitude of different biochemical components, many of them not yet understood<sup id="_ref-pathogenesis_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pathogenesis" title="">[2]</a></sup>. As a pathway is more or less sequential in nature it is a victim of causality; removing or modifying one component leads to an effect in another. In a living organism this can have disastrous effects, often in the form of disease or disorder. A discussion of every disease caused by modification of the various apoptotic pathways would be impractical, but the concept overlying each one is the same: the normal functioning of the pathway has been disrupted in such a way as to impair the ability of the cell to undergo normal apoptosis. This results in a cell which lives past its "use-by-date" and is able to replicate and pass on any faulty machinery to its progeny, increasing the likelihood of the cell becoming cancerous or diseased.</p>
<p>A recently described example of this concept in action can be seen in the development of a lung cancer called NCI-H460<sup id="_ref-h460_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-h460" title="">[23]</a></sup>. The <i>X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein</i> (XIAP) is <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_expression.html" title="Gene expression">overexpressed</a> in cells of the H460 <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_line.html" title="Cell line">cell line</a>. XIAPs bind to the processed form of caspase-9, and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator <a href="../../../c/y/t/Cytochrome_c.html" title="Cytochrome c">cytochrome c</a>, therefore overexpression leads to a decrease in the amount of pro-apoptotic agonists. Consequently, the balance of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic effectors is upset in favour of the former and the damaged cells continue to replicate despite being told to die.</p>

<p>The tumor-suppressor protein <i><a href="../../../p/5/3/P53.html" title="P53">p53</a></i> accumulates when DNA is damaged due to a chain reaction of biochemical reactions.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apoptosis.html" title="Edit section: Viruses and apoptosis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Viruses and apoptosis</span></h2>
<p>Viruses can trigger apoptosis of infected cells via a range of mechanisms including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receptor binding.</li>
<li>Activation of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protein_kinase_R_9deb.html" title="Protein kinase R">protein kinase R</a> (PKR).</li>
<li>Interaction with p53.</li>
<li>Expression of viral proteins.<sup id="_ref-Everett_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Everett" title="">[26]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Viruses have developed strategies to evade apoptosis to permit their survival within the host cell. Most viruses encode proteins that can inhibit apoptosis.<sup id="_ref-Teodora_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Teodora" title="">[27]</a></sup> Several viruses encode viral homologs of Bcl-2. These homologs can inhibit pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK, which are essential for the activation of apoptosis. Examples of viral Bcl-2 proteins include the <a href="../../../e/p/s/Epstein-Barr_virus_6f15.html" title="Epstein-Barr virus">Epstein-Barr virus</a> BHRF1 protein and the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adenovirus.html" title="Adenovirus">adenovirus</a> E1B 19K protein.<sup id="_ref-Polster_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Polster" title="">[28]</a></sup> Some viruses express caspase inhibitors that inhibit caspase activity and an example is the CrmA protein of cowpox viruses. Whilst a number of viruses can block the effects of TNF and Fas. For example the M-T2 protein of myxoma viruses can bind TNF preventing it from binding the TNF receptor and inducing a response.<sup id="_ref-Hay_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hay" title="">[29]</a></sup> Furthermore, many viruses express p53 inhibitors that can bind p53 and inhibit its transcriptional transactivation activity. Consequently p53 cannot induce apoptosis since it cannot induce the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins. The adenovirus E1B-55K protein and the <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hepatitis_B_virus_6549.html" title="Hepatitis B virus">hepatitis B virus</a> HBx protein are examples of viral proteins that can perform such a function.<sup id="_ref-Wang_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wang" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, viruses can benefit from apoptosis particularly in the latter stages of infection. They can escape in the <i>apoptotic bodies</i> that pinch off from the surface of the dying cell and the fact that they are engulfed by phagocytes prevents the initiation of a host response. This favours the spread of the virus.<sup id="_ref-Hay_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hay" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p>Cells express pro-apoptotic factor, EGL-1, when they are fated to die. EGL-1 is a BH3 domain containing protein and is homologous to the vertebrates BAD and BIK. EGL-1 binds to CED-9 (homolog of Bcl-2) and prevents CED-9 from binding to adaptor protein CED-4 (homolog of Apaf-1, Cytochrome c). When released, CED-4 is capable of binding to CED-3 and activating the caspase CED-3. CED-3 is the key protein involved in executing the death of the cell.</p>
