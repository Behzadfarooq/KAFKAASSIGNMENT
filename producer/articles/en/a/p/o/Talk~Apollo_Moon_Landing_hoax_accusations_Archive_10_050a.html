<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unmentioned theory</span></h2>
<p>There is one theory not mentioned in this page: that the astronauts did land on the moon but that at least some of the photos are fake (since at that time they didn't want to reveal to the Sovietics potentially important images and give away information to the USSR). This theory was developed in a documentary on the French-German channel ARTE a few years ago, so I don't have any web links but I assume this must be somewhere on the web. This explains why the "C" are shown on the rocks (photographs would have been reconstructed in studios), and some other inconstancies. I hope this theory could be included with proper references. I am not saying anything on this page is biased (or at least not voluntarily) but it is a common and easy tactic to dismiss claims by exaggerating opponent theories and it sometimes *look* like it is the case here, as a large part of the writers are American. Herve661</p>
<ul>
<li>Look in the archives (if you're sufficiently bored) and you'll see there was lengthy discussion of the "C on the rock" stuff. There also used to be a mention of the idea that the only "hoax" was in censoring some photos to avoid revealing that there were moon men there or some such. If that was taken out of the article, it was probably because no one could find a reference to such a theory other than hearsay. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:16, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't think that we should simply be assuming that anything on U-Tube must be copyright violation. In particular, the moon walk videos are works created by NASA, and therefore not copyrightable. Also, at least some of the hoax accusers' videos may be uploaded by the authors in order to spread their message - I'm sure they will tell you that they are not simply in this for the money. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 09:15, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Manned hours in space</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Technological capability of USA compared to the USSR" At the time of Apollo, the Soviet Union had five times more manned hours in space than the US. ... Before the first Earth-orbiting Apollo flight, the USSR had accumulated 534 hours of manned spaceflight whereas the US had accumulated over 1,992 hours of manned spaceflight. By the time of Apollo 11, the US's lead was much wider than that (see List of human spaceflights, 1960s.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't understand. It seems like these two points contradict each other.Ghost.scream 01:12, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hoax believers made the claim that the USSR had more manned hours in space than the US, but the fact is that the US had much more up to <s>Apollo 11</s> the first Apollo mission, and the gap was even wider at the time of the Apollo 11 mission. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 02:29, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The similarity of lunar and terrestrial oxygen isotopes are used as constrains on the giant impact hypothesis for the Moon's origin. I don't think that they are distinguishably different.

<dd>Oy, what a pedantic can of worms this could be.

<dd>That policy is a subtle change from what I was taught, and I would argue that it's incorrect. Our satellite is named "Moon" when used standalone, but it's called "the moon", as in "<b>THE</b> moon", as in the "most important" moon, as distinguished from those other planet's moons. However, it's not worth making a big deal over. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:34, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Speaking from the standpoint of a lunar scientist, I can say that this convenction has evolved with time. Most scientific articles written during the Apollo era say "the moon", whereas almost all today say "the Moon". Nevertheless, many non lunar scientists, particularly astronomers, still use "the moon". My take on this is that the scientific community only had one moon to work with until voyager visited the outer solar system, and then people began to distinguish among these by capitalizing our moon. A similar thing happened with using the prefix "seleno-" as opposed to "geo-". When there was only one body being investigated scientifically, it made sense to talk of "selenography". But as soon as you have to start appending different prefixes to every solar system body, it became clear that this practice was ridiculous.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, it should be noted that "lunar" is never captipalized (as it is not derived from a proper noun), whereas "Martian" is! I hate these kind of discussions, but these issues come up so often that I thought I'd throw my two cents in. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 10:01, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nor is "solar", but they come from Luna and Sol, right? However, we don't normally call the moon "Luna", but we do call Mars "Mars". <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 11:51, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Failed GA</span></h2>
<p>This article was nominated for <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">Good Article</a> review and I took a few minutes to review it. Unfortunately, it is my opinion that the article needs substantial work before it will meet Wikipedia's <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">Good Article standards</a>. Just a few of the problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly underreferenced. I started adding {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags, but gave up about 1/3 of the way into the article.</li>
<li>Many of the references provided are of dubious quality. I followed a couple of the links and wasn't impressed with the neutrality of the source or how applicable the source was to the statement being referenced. Example: in the what-is-now the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations&amp;oldid=89392342" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations&amp;oldid=89392342" rel="nofollow">current</a> version, citation #4 doesn't even begin to explain that paragraph. (citation numbers may change as revisions are made to this article, so be sure to click the link I provided to version 89392342 so you know what I'm talking about).</li>
<li>Citations need to be cleaned up, preferrably with the {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">Cite web</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_journal_df49.html" title="Template:Cite journal">Cite journal</a>}}, etc. templates. Merely listing a URL isn't helpful.</li>
<li>The article is significantly biased. This isn't an easy topic to addressed in a non-judmental manner, and I noticed when I came over to this talk page that it's been discussed at length above. I won't re-hash the issues, but as a first-time viewer of this article, it is my opinion that the article needs some significant neutrality work. Resist the urge to call the hoax proponents a bunch of crackpots. The article's title is "Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations". The article should list the accusations in an appropriate context, and list the responses from experts who dispute the accusations. Leave it at that, don't paint the people with those theories as a bunch of loonies.</li>
<li>There are many short one-sentence paragraphs. Expand them or combine them.</li>
<li>Article stability issues. My {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tagging of the article was reverted before I even finished writing this GA review.</li>
</ul>
<p>Final note: I did tag the article with the {{<a href="../../../n/e/u/Template%7ENeutrality_7cd9.html" title="Template:Neutrality">neutrality</a>}} banner before viewing this talk page and seeing that there has been a heated discussion in the recent past about its applicability, but as I mentioned, I put it there because I think it is appropriate, not because I'm trying to re-hash an old edit war. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeil916_fb6c.html" title="User:Neil916">Neil916</a> (<a href="../../../n/e/i/User_talk%7ENeil916_0ff9.html" title="User talk:Neil916">Talk</a>) 06:02, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>My apologies for a fast revert. We had one user this past summer that slapped a "fact" tag on everything he didn't agree with, and I thought for a hot minute that he had come back to haunt us. The issue of "bias" has been raised over and over, yet the complainants never can quite explain <i>specifically</i> what they think is biased... unless it adds up to <i>leaving out</i> the reasonable explanations for the questions they raise. At least you're not advocating that. But you need to be more specific. It is <i>very</i> difficult to find a cool-and-calm internet source on this subject. (Of course, it's placid waters compared to Evolution, but let's don't get into that.) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 06:15, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I'll take a stab at it (and I won't even go <i>near</i> the evolution article, BTW). Like I mentioned, this isn't the easiest type of article to remain neutral on because most of the people writing here probably don't believe the hoax theories. However, the thing to keep in mind is that this is an encyclopedia entry, not a magazine article or a personal web page. Like <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Friday_deeb.html" title="Joe Friday">Joe Friday</a> would say, "<i>Just the facts, Ma'am.</i>". Say what was said and who said it. Don't tell the reader what to think, and don't paint any of the parties you describe as more credible than others, even if you think they are. Definitely avoid POV words like "Tom Harris <b>claimed</b> that the moon is really green cheese". Some of the guidelines at <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> may be useful, but I'm sure you're all familiar with that page by now. But here's how I'd structure the article if I was trying to do it from scratch:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Introduction</b>
<ul>
<li>Write this last, it should summarize the major points of the artice only, without introducing content that isn't described elsewhere. Use <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Wikipedia:Lead section</a> as a guideline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>History of hoax theories</b>
<ul>
<li>Tell who said what, and when. Tell about polls describing trends in public opinion. Don't get into great detail in this section about the specific arguments, but make statements like "In 1972, University of Squashed Armadillo professor Dr. John Doe wrote an editorial in the New York Times disputing the authenticity of the burn marks on the lander's ladder. In 1982, Peter Smith published <i>The facts about the Moon</i>, a bestselling book that brought up many of the same claims, but also raising the issue of the lack of paint chips found on the astronauts' shoes". The point of the section is to establish that it's not a case of one or two publicity seekers raising theories in order to get their fifteen minutes of fame, but that there have been many books, papers, and so on written over the years raising this issue, those books sell well, and that gallup polls show that x% of the American population have doubts about the authenticity of NASA's depiction of the moon landings. Resist the urge to discuss a claim and then listing a counterclaim. List counter-hoax publications and papers in this same section, but in their own subsection. Avoid using language that gives them more credibility, but you don't need to sidestep the fact that many of the readers will probably find a press release by the top scientists at NASA more credible than a self-published book by a previously unpublished author. Just make sure to let the reader reach their own conclusions, don't steer them in any specific direction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Specific theories</b>
<ul>
<li>Provide a reasonable level of detail about specific claims of evidence. Say who said it, and their credentials. Give a summary of the argument. Do <b>not</b> rebut the claims here. This section needs to be well-referenced, and <i>not</i> to websites with "conspiracy theory" anywhere in the title; preferrably to the original work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Rebuttals to the hoax theories</b>
<ul>
<li>Once again, it is necessary to be very specific and relate <i>who</i> said <i>what</i> with a high level of citations, and provide the person's credentials. Don't make statements like this, taken from the current version of the article:
<dl>
<dd><i><b>3. The quality of the photographs is implausibly high.</b> Not true. There are many, many poor quality photographs taken by the Apollo astronauts. NASA chose to publish only the best examples.</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Instead, it needs to be more like this (facts obviously made up):</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>3. The quality of the photographs is implausibly high.</b> In an article in National Geographic, Dr. Martin James, NASA's chief historian, raised the fact that over 10,000 photographs were taken on the missions, of which only 25 were widely distributed in the mass media. "Many of the others were pretty bad," he said, "and others were even better, but just weren't of a subject matter that would appeal to the general public."<sup>[ref]</sup> The photographic equipment used on the missions was specifically designed to account for the low light and had an exceptionally high focal length<sup>[ref]</sup>.</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>References</b></li>
<li><b>External links</b>
<ul>
<li>Far fewer than the article currently contains. It is not necessary to provide a directory to every website describing moon landing hoax theories. Review the guidelines at <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was going to comment on this nomination, but it was failed before I got around to it. Much of what I would have said has already been mentioned, but I will comment on the reference situation. At the moment almost all of your citations are of websites, yet the article lists some books that are relevant. It would help the article look more credible if it also cited books, as well as giving more detail about the websites cited so that a reader can easily determine whether they're credible sources or not. <a href="../../../m/l/i/User%7EMLilburne_c545.html" title="User:MLilburne">MLilburne</a> 09:33, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also a stylistic point: italics really shouldn't be used in quotations. <a href="../../../m/l/i/User%7EMLilburne_c545.html" title="User:MLilburne">MLilburne</a> 09:35, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A few observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>I argued against too much use of the word "claim", and took a lot of them out in favor of "say" or whatever, because "claim" implies "they say that, but I know it's not true". Maybe some of them have creeped back in. I'm not sure I dislike "claims" any worse than "accusations", but we have to call the article <i>something</i>, and the title was a compromise solution.</li>
<li>The long list of external links was piled on by those trying to cite one side or the other. Someone could take a day off from work and weed out the ones that essentially say the same stuff as some others.</li>
<li>As with the many internet sites, it's important to keep in mind that the "many" sources actually fed off just a few sources, like Kaysing and Sibrel, then mushroomed as each writer put his own spin on it. It's a lot like the JFK theories that way. The problem with going with the mushroom cloud is that many of them start with false premises, i.e. the assumption that Kaysing and Sibrel knew what he was talking about, which is demonstrably false in many cases. It's better to stick with a few original sources rather than their derivatives.</li>
<li>There was, at one time, a lengthy response to each challenge, as you seem to be recommending. It was shortened at the request of others. If you go back in the history a few months, you'll see that. Meanwhile, there is, or was, a longer article that went into more detail, taken from this one. In summary, we tried that already, and no one liked it.</li>
<li>I fully agree that each question deserves to be heard, and it also deserves to be <i>answered</i>, because if you leave it unchallenged, it misleads the casual reader into thinking that there is no reasonable answer. Providing "NASA's answer" does not compel the reader to <i>believe</i> the answer we consider reasonable, but it at least gives them a chance to consider it.</li>
<li>Many of the places you attached "fact" actually had references immediately above. If you've got a problem with the formatting, then fix the formatting. Putting a "fact" tag is misleading.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:07, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>I'm not a fan of the article's title. The word "accusation" implies a claim without basis or supporting facts. While scrolling down the talk page, I noticed a discussion about the title, but didn't read it over so I don't know the history. I don't have much of a better title, so I didn't bring it up. But perhaps even "Apollo Moon Landing hoax claims" would be more neutral. My <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_two_cents_%28idiom%29.html" title="My two cents (idiom)">two cents</a>.</li>
<li>Wikipedia isn't Google. Link to one or two sites that are a directory of hoax theories and leave it at that.</li>
<li>Agreed.</li>
<li>I don't believe I'm recommending that at all. In my example, I listed a concise, short paragraph addressing a concern. You don't have to list every single person who opposed a claim, just summarize the consensus argument against the claim, using direct quotes from one person, or specific scientific concepts as an example.</li>
<li>Agreed.</li>
<li>I started adding the {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags because in the past when editors have raised the "insufficiently referenced" argument, the response is invariably, "What do you mean? Give me examples of bad referencing". I stopped where I did becuase I felt that I'd given enough examples. Where there was a paragraph that had a reference at one point and I tagged a later statement in the same paragraph, it was usually because I had gone to the cited reference and felt that it didn't support the subsequent statement. But I could have been mistaken. Same thing for the neutrality tags I added.</li>

<dd>I have a few short comments. I'm guilty of italicizing inside quotes. I didn't know better, and I thought it made it stand out better. I'm surprised that this was nominated as a <i>good article</i>. It is the product of a <b>lot</b> of <b>edit wars</b>. Finally the bad editors left (or had RfCs about them), and I think that the good editors were exhausted at that point and didn't have the energy to continue working on the article.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One thing about references for arguments against the hoax theories is that there is very little in print. There was a book commissioned, to be written by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Oberg_97d0.html" title="James Oberg">James Oberg</a>, but it was canceled. A couple of years ago he said that he would write it anyway, but I haven't heard anything else about it. I doubt it will come out, but it might. Other than that, the only book I know of is a chapter in Plaitt's <i>Bad Astronomy</i>. I think there are a couple of articles in print, but there isn't much countering the hoax accusations. That leaves mostly websites to critically examine the hoax accusations.</dd>

<dd>From above: "you don't need to sidestep the fact that many of the readers will probably find a press release by the top scientists at NASA more credible than a self-published book by a previously unpublished author."

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Completely NPOV article heavily biased in favor of NASA!</span></h2>
<p>How can the article say things like "A picture of Buzz Aldrin on the MOONS surface" when NASA can't even prove it ever landed a man on the moon? Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and none of theirs can be verified. It could just as well have been filmed in a film studio, it would certainly have been a lot easier. Surely the word alleged should be included whenever making such bold statements proclaiming that man actually landed on the moon? Such far fetched claims are both unproven and highly doubtful. Also, near the start it seems the article takes great delight in listing a few extremists who support the hoax theory in an attempt to smear all hoax theory proponents as crackpots. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYourPTR%21_3d33.html" title="User:YourPTR!">YourPTR!</a> 09:31, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Please, the burdon of proof is squarely on the on the shoulders of hoax proponets to prove NASA has not gone to the moon. NASA has presented their evidence of their claim and it has been accepted by and large. Any claim to the contrary needs to be backed up with some supporting evidence. Thus far, the only evidence I've seen presented by hoax believers, is well non-existant. All I have seen wild speculation and simple accusations that NASA is "obviously" lying. Shhewitt 02:33, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You need to read the lengthy discussion history archives here. Everything you say has been discussed at great length. Since the article is about allegations, it's understood that the moon photos are in dispute by those who don't agree that we went to the moon. And this article is one of the least-biased you'll find on the internet. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 11:47, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

(I'm pretty sure that at least 1200 baud modems were available to the general public in the 1980s). Secondly, though, the signal was analog all the way, so it didn't need a modem. Thirdly, I'm pretty sure that data compression was available bavk then, but again, that is normally done on digital data, not analog. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 05:00, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>IMO this article is pretty poor as an encylopedia entry. The title is "Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations". Yet the piece is pretty much a list of the accusations with a point by point rebuttal. It reads as though the only purpose of entry is to dismiss the allegations. It would be just as bad if done the other way round i.e. the "facts" in the rebuttals listed first, and then the "hoax facts" contradicting those. I do feel the whole article is very POV. It's also VERY long.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Infinitum_1a6b.html" title="User:Mike Infinitum">Mike Infinitum</a> 00:20, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is neutral. Yes, it is very long, but the reason is that, quite frankly, there's a lot of claims brought up by the group, and splitting it into two articles would be a headache. The fact of the matter is, the claims are debunked and it would be non-neutral to not include the debunking. You have the right to your own opinion, but not your own facts, after all, and all of the allegations have been answered. Perhaps the presentation is not as neutral as possible, but I can't think of a better way of presenting the claims and counters to the claims offhand. The article's very existence is an example of undue weight, as everyone reputable dismisses it, but as it is a cultural phenomenon it should be addressed properly. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 02:29, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">1972 to 2020</span></h2>
<p>NASA plans to 'return to the moon' in 2020. This would be 48 years after the last lunar landing 1972. In 1961 JFK announced NASA's plans to land a man on the moon, a mere 8 years later NASA fufills this dream. How can 1960's technology, be so much better then 21st century technology? What happened (1972-2006) to the technology of moon landing in the last 34 years? The USA surely has more money for it in 2006. Is there anyway this can be added to the article? Could someone provide a varifiable source for this pro-hoax fact? <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 18:13, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The goal is differnt this time. Why do you assume that because it is taking longer this time that we are unable to do it faster if we wanted to? Rushing a project makes it more expensive, and limits the scope of the mission. Take our time, and we'll get more acomplished, and save money. It simply doesn't make sense to rush up there again without a good reason. Shhewitt 02:39, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think this should be in the article. There are differences. In the 1960s, the Moon project had top priority and basically had a blank check. The (unofficial) motto was "waste anything but time." Major funding for the return to the Moon won't come until after the ISS is complete and the Shuttle fleet is retired, and even then the budget will be limited. Also, some of the things done in the 1960s would be considered too risky now. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 18:29, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Motivations for hoaxing the missions</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to add some changes to the Motivations section. I'd like to add a counter-point to all the reasons the US would have had to fake the missions.</p>
<p><b>1. Distraction—The U.S. government sought to distract the public from the Vietnam War.</b></p>
<p>A real successful landing would have acomplished the same thing.</p>
<p><b>2. Cold War Prestige—The U.S. government considered it vital that the U.S. win the space race against the Soviet Union. Going to the Moon, if it had been possible, would have been risky and expensive (though John F. Kennedy famously said that we chose to go because it was difficult). Despite close monitoring by the Soviet Union, hoax proponents argue that it would have been easier for the U.S. to fake it, and consequently guarantee success, than for the U.S. actually to go.</b></p>
<p>Faking the missions does not garentee success, getting caught faking it has serious consequences, not just to the USA as a country, but to those actually responsible for attempting it as well.</p>
<p><b>3. Money—NASA raised approximately $30 billion to go to the Moon. Hoax proponents hypothesize that this could have been used to pay off a large number of people, providing significant motivation for complicity.</b></p>
<p>NASA didn't raise money for the program. NASA is a government agency that was allocated money by the government.</p>
<p><b>4. Risk—The available technology at the time was such that the landing might fail if genuinely attempted. This argument assumes that the problems early in the space program were insurmountable, even by a technology team fully motivated and funded to fix the problems.</b></p>
<p>Not really much to say here, the second part of this statement refutes the first part well enough for me. Shhewitt 13:04, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Simply put, they are not anyones opinion because they are not opinions. They are facts. NASA doesn't raise money because they are not a charity.

<li>It's a question posed by an IP address, probably "original research", which if he did some <i>real</i> "original research", he would find the answer.

<li>About the spacesuits and air conditioning, radiative cooling is not satisfactory. The equilibrium temperature of a body on the moon ranges roughly from -150°C and +150°C (exact values needed), depending on the position of the sun (night is cooler, midday is hotter and dawn or dusk are warm). Apollo's missions were setting during moon's dawn or dusk (the moon's day lasts nearly 30 earth days), but as the last missions lasted 3 earth days, conditions might have changed somewhat. NASA used a water evaporative cooling (reference needed)&#160;: evaporating water in the vacuum is a very efficient way to cool an object (but you need a reserve of liquid water). For example, evaporating only 1 gram of water per second yelds a cooling power of 2460 watts (which is much more than the cooling power of a typical AC device). With a few kilos of water, you can cool the astronauts very easily and efficiently.</li>

<dd>Thank you, FrankB, for your attempt to improve the article. I would like to respond to a couple of the points you raised, however. First, the tag was not incorrectly applied. Your comments about the various arguments that should be used with the tag are accurate, if someone was to use the tag today. However, the tag was applied at the end of November, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Citecheck&amp;oldid=78910392" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Citecheck&amp;oldid=78910392" rel="nofollow">as you can see</a>, back then, the template did not have any parameters. The template was modified on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">December 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> by Rich Farmbrough to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Citecheck&amp;diff=91795860&amp;oldid=78910392" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Citecheck&amp;diff=91795860&amp;oldid=78910392" rel="nofollow">add the date parameter</a>, at which point, a bot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations&amp;diff=91812298&amp;oldid=91781418" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations&amp;diff=91812298&amp;oldid=91781418" rel="nofollow">came around</a> and added the "date=December, 2006" parameter. Even with that, the current version of the template describes those two fields as "optional" fields, and states "<i>Note that order does not matter with respect to the above optional parameters</i>". Second, the rationale was explained on the this talk page under my second bullet point in the "Failed GA" section. Third, if you would like editors who use the tag to put {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitecheck_535c.html" title="Template:Citecheck">Citecheck</a>}} in the edit summary, it would be best if that was identified on the template page itself. Fourth, as I mentioned already, the reason for the tag was outlined in the "Failed GA" section. Once again, if you would find it easier to find such a rationale if the talk page section took a certain form, it would be more helpful to outline such instructions on the {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitecheck_535c.html" title="Template:Citecheck">Citecheck</a>}} template itself so that editors who use the tag don't run the risk of being scolded for using it incorrectly. I'm not sure that simply removing the tag without seeking additional input here if you had questions as to what it was referring to was the best course of action, but I'll defer to your judgement and leave it out for now.

<p>The <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_moon_landing_conspiracy_accusations.html#Ionizing_radiation_and_heat" title="Apollo moon landing conspiracy accusations">Ionizing radiation and heat</a> section states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>33 of the 36 Apollo astronauts involved in the nine Apollo missions to leave Earth orbit have early stage cataracts that have been shown to be caused by radiation exposure to cosmic rays during their trip.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I realized (after editing this sentence for clarity) that the numbers don't add up.</p>
<p>There were eleven Apollo missions in all, disregarding <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_1.html" title="Apollo 1">Apollo 1</a> which was named retroactively to honor the dead astronauts. <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_7.html" title="Apollo 7">Apollo 7</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_9.html" title="Apollo 9">Apollo 9</a> were equipment tests in Earth orbit, the remaining nine missions went to the moon. Sine the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_spacecraft.html" title="Apollo spacecraft">Apollo spacecraft</a> had a crew of three, at most 27 astronauts could have been involved in these missions. Actually, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Lovell_cfeb.html" title="Jim Lovell">Jim Lovell</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Young_8c2c.html" title="John Young">John Young</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Cernan_2652.html" title="Eugene Cernan">Eugene Cernan</a> flew two missions each, so the correct number is 24 - nowhere near the 36 claimed by Ms Schneider (about 25:30 into the referenced recording). Even when you add the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_7.html" title="Apollo 7">Apollo 7</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_9.html" title="Apollo 9">Apollo 9</a> crew, the total only comes to 29 (not 30, since <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Scott_6b67.html" title="David Scott">David Scott</a> flew on both <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_9.html" title="Apollo 9">Apollo 9</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_15.html" title="Apollo 15">Apollo 15</a> and has already been counted). The only way to get to 36 is to add the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_1.html" title="Apollo 1">Apollo 1</a> crew and the four astronauts who were assigned to backup crews but never flew on Apollo missions (including <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clifton_Williams_df64.html" title="Clifton Williams">Clifton Williams</a> who died before his mission ever took place).</p>
<p>Subsequent flights using Apollo hardware (<a href="../../../s/k/y/Skylab.html" title="Skylab">Skylab</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo-Soyuz_ee41.html" title="Apollo-Soyuz">Apollo-Soyuz</a>) never left Earth orbit.</p>
<p>I was able to find some hard numbers on <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/22oct_cataracts.htm" class="external text" title="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/22oct_cataracts.htm" rel="nofollow">this NASA web page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At least 39 former astronauts have suffered some form of cataracts after flying in space [...] Of those 39 astronauts, 36 had flown on high-radiation missions such as the Apollo Moon landings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, this is a PR story, but it is based on a peer-reviewed article which is available <a href="http://www.bu.edu/csp/EMMREM/papers/cataracts.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.bu.edu/csp/EMMREM/papers/cataracts.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I haven't had time to read the entire article yet, but what it seems to say is that out of 295 NASA astronauts involved in the study (including 73 who died or retired without ever flying on a mission), 48 had developed cataracts. Two had never flown and seven had developed cataracts prior to flying. Of the remaining 39, 35 (not 36!) had flown on lunar missions <i>or</i> high-inclination earth-orbit missions prior to developing cataracts. There is no detailed breakdown of cataract incidence per mission type.</p>

<dd>If it is a large vacuum chamber, then it has to be several miles in size, since the Apollo 15 astronauts clearly traveled several miles on the buggy. Are there any like that on Earth? There is no evidence that it is in a vacuum chamber and no evidence that it is slowed down. And if you watch more of the video, it is clear that it is not slowed down. To paraphrase someone, this is a belief in search of evidence rather than evidence in search of an explanation. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 02:23, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Look - don't shoot the messenger, 123 simply pointed out the obvious flaw in your logic. Instead of accepting the correction graciously, you change the subject from the original incorrect claim and instead make other claims, attempting to suggest that this discredits the original correction. How is it clear from that video clip (which is stationary) that the rover traveled for miles? How is it clear that it is not slowed down? These sorts of claims require evidence. It's the belief in the landing that requires evidence, not health skepticism of outlandish claims by NASA. 129.44.172.8 04:48, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the late 1990s, the BBC made a television series called The Planets. In this, film from a Soviet Lunakhod rover was broadcast which clearly showed the landing gear and descent engine of an Apollo lander, believed to be Apollo 11. A flag was also present, along with impressions of what could be interpreted as footprints. If this is indeed footage of the Eagle landing site, it would be independent confirmation that the landings had in fact taken place. However, no details of the location, the date the footage was recorded, or even which Lunakhod took it were supplied.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Independent evidence of human landing</span></h2>
<p>Following from 123's question, and Wahkeenah's suggestion, I'm using this space to collect independent (not from a US govt agency or someone paid by them) evidence (actual evidence, video, logs, pictures, rocks, testimony, recordings, plans, layouts, models, anything) of a human landing on the moon.

<dd>An excellent point. The article was getting too long, and detail about photos was separated into another article. Likewise with the chronology of accomplishments, which implicitly refuted the notion that Russia was way ahead of the U.S. Maybe the same could be done with the independent observations. The article wouldn't have to be written in such a way that its sole purpose is to refute the hoaxsters.

<p>This paragraph is a bit of an embarrassment to Wikipedia - "<i>in formal rhetoric the burden actually lies upon those who propose a new hypothesis, in this case...</i>" How can you possibly argue that NASA is not the one that proposed a new hypothesis? Clearly the burden of proof is on NASA to prove the landings. 129.44.172.8 01:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please check out the previous sentence. It says some people think NASA should prove things; then the second sentence says other people think the conspiracy theorists should prove their position. If both sentences say the same thing it doesn't make sense: critics of conspiracy theorists think the conspiracy theorists are right??

<dd>Your logic is flawed. NASA has never proposed any hypothesis as to whether they went to the moon or not. They merely went there and observers reported it. The hoaxsters claim otherwise.

<dd>No, you are wrong. NASA made a claim - the burden of proof is on them to demonstrate that claim.

<dd>So you keep parroting, but if you read the paragraph we are talking about, it is not about whether NASA went to the moon, it is about whether, in formal logic, they should have to show evidence that they did. Your opinion is that they have. That's fine - I don't think that you are arguing that if they announced today, without any evidence, that they landed a man on Mars, there would not be a burden of proof. The issue is not 'Have they met the burden of proof', but, 'in formal logic, is there a burden of proof for them to meet'.

<dd>It still kind of looks like an editorial, but it also summarizes the attitude taken by the hoaxsters, as per the argument of the above IP address: That it is somehow up to NASA to "prove" that they went to the moon, thus absolving the hoaxsters from having to do anything except snipe. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:05, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed it is pointless editorializing. It should be removed, since it shows no sign of being fixed. As has been pointed out many times, by many people, this section does not deal with <i>whether NASA has proved their case</i>, but with <i>whether, informal logic, evidence is relevant</i>. Clearly Wahkeenah does not think that it is irrelevant whether or not there is any evidence that NASA went to the Moon, he thinks that there is <b>good evidence to support the idea that they went to the moon</b>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 00:31, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Its purpose could be to state succinctly what the hoaxsters' viewpoint often seems to be, i.e. that somehow NASA has to prove something to the small minority who disbelieve the historical record. That part, both sides would agree on, I think: i.e., both sides would agree that that's what the hoaxsters believe. However, that viewpoint can be inferred by the reader, due to the nature of the hoaxsters' questions. The second point, the issue of whether NASA actually does need to prove anything, can be inferred by the poll results. Clearly, the majority would say "no" and the minority would say "yes", so there can be no absolute resolution of that question 100%. So the paragraph in question does not really add anything to the article... and Wikipedia guidelines would say that the reader should draw his own conclusions, rather than being lectured to, as the second part of that paragraph tends to do, even being toned down a bit from what it was before. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:57, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that it should be removed. The two points you are still confusing though are: 1. Is evidence relevant in formal logic? 2. Is there evidence for the NASA landing? In your effort to be emphatic about the second point, you are inadvertently claiming that no evidence is needed. I don't think even you really believe that. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 01:59, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have no clue what you're getting at in point 1. Without evidence, you can't prove anything about anything. In point 2, the disagreement fundamentally is that those who accept the historical record say that the evidence is sufficient, and those who do no accept the historical record say that that evidence is not sufficient... which is the reason this page exists in the first place. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 07:05, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How do we know that Columbus crossed the Atlantic Ocean? How do we know that Lincoln was assassinated in 1865? There is far less evidence for these events than there is for the Moon landings.

One was saying that the Moon landings are a "new hypotheses". Does he think that only 30+ years after the fact, NASA started claiming that they landed on the Moon?

<p>Notice how it looked back in October, and you'll see what we were getting at about it reading like an editorial:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hoax critics have claimed that a key assumption of hoax proponents is that the burden of proof for the Apollo landings lies entirely with NASA. These critics have countered that in formal logic the burden actually lies upon those who propose a new hypothesis, in this case, the hoax. According to Phil Plait's Bad Astronomy Web site, hoax theorists, or pseudoscientists, often focus on a variety of technical minutiae with the expectation that hoax critics should research and address any questions that the hoax proponents raise. Plait says that failure to address a given question is taken by the hoax theorists as proof of some aspect of the Moon landing hoax.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your version (below) is substantially different, and while more neutral, omits the issue raised in the original version, i.e. that the hoaxsters nitpick what they perceive to be "clues" of a hoax and try to connect the dots to claim that there was a hoax. However, the fact of that nitpicking can already be inferred from the rest of the article. Also, beware of the editorial comment that "hoax proponents must accept..." as it should be more along the lines that hoax proponents have not proved their case to the majority:</p>
<dl>
<dd>One fundamental disagreement between proponents and opponents of the hoax theory regards the burden of proof. In formal rethoric, the onus is on the party proposing a new hypothesis to provide evidence in its support. Hoax proponents argue that it is NASA who is proposing a new hypothesis with their claim of having landed on the moon. Opponents argue that the established consensus is that NASA did land on the moon, and that the burden of proof therefore lies with the hoax theorists. It can also be asserted that NASA have provided evidence in support of their claim (the testimonies of the astronauts and staff; the vehicles that were used; rock samples; TV and radio transmissions and recordings; thousands of photographs) and that hoax proponents must therefore accept NASA's hypothesis unless they can prove said evidence to be falsified. Note that the burden of proof argument is similar but not identical to the scientific method argument described below.</dd>

<dd>While I'm entirely certain that the moon landings happened just as NASA said, I do also have concerns about the tone of the section.

I'm aware that I am a Johnny-come-lately to the article, and in a sense I'm impressed that it's managed to maintain any coherence at all.

<p>Interesting to hear terms like "formal logic" and "burden of proof" used in the context presented in this discussion. "Formal logic", as it is, concerns itself only with the validity or invalidity of an argument; that is, only whether the form of an argument violates the rules of logic, such as they are. "Formal logic" does not concern itself with the truth of the matter as asserted within the argument. With respect to the moon landing, the discussion ought not necessarily to be one of "formal logic", but of probability and credibility; for, one could assign arbitary values to any of the major or minor elements of each mutually exclusive argument and achieve logical validity, which would not speak to the underlying truth. As to "burden of proof", this is largely a legal concept. If one wishes to borrow from this concept, then he ought to define this burden. For instance, what is the burden of proof; does NASA need to show a "preponderance of the evidence" (at least 51% likely in most jurisdictions), "beyond reasonable doubt" (difficult to explain although OW Holmes does a good job), "clear and convincing" (at least 85% likely), or some other defined standard? I agree that NASA should show some evidence because NASA did claim to have travelled to the moon. Consitent with this, NASA displayed evidence, which evidence is generally accepted within the scientific community as highly credible. As far as can be determined, evidence to the contrary has been countered effectively with clear, scientific argument. Therefore, this question is ultimately one of credibility and inductive reasoning; more of aristotle than Plato. All of the arguments presented may be made valid (logical) if the underlying values are assigned individually by the advocate.</p>

<p>I think the hoax supporters have the burden of proof backwards. When NASA landed, they provided proof. it was widely accepted. Therefore, the statement "We have landed on the moon" was supported by proof. When hoax people come and state "The proof was faked" their following statement should not "Provide us with new proof" but rather "here is proof that it was faked." If the landing statement had to be supported by proof, the statement that the proofs are faked has to be supported. Until that proof is widely accepted, the burden remains on the hoax people and not on NASA, which has provided proof that was widely accepted. When it comes to NASA's proofs, the important part is not about the fact that you don't believe it, it's about how you come to that conclusion and what evidence you have of that proof being falsified.<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoukai_no_unmei_9066.html" title="User:Youkai no unmei">Youkai no unmei</a> 19:03, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Burden of Proof - to whom?</span></h3>
<p>Nasa did indeed have a burden to demonstrate their accomplishments - but this proof was to be made to the government, and the respected worldwide scientific community, not to any publicity seeker who wants attention and won't accept basic science. Nasa has met this burden, no respected institution denies the moon landing - so now the burden of proof falls on anyone who asks us to disbelieve the whole world in favor of some guy who chases astronauts around and yells at them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when public figures who have had no other proven accusations of dishonesty say something, this should be taken as meaningful. Hoax arguments treat anyone associated with NASA as if they were known criminals. How does one justify such distrust? Real scientists don't treat each other like this. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 23:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There you go. Some sense at last. Of <b>course</b> there is a burden of proof for NASA. Landing beleivers think it has been met, skeptics think not. The idea that Wahkeenah et al is banging on that there is no burden of proof for NASA is nonsense. 05:29, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Algr's assessment is correct. It could be said that NASA <i>had</i> a "burden of proof", which they met <i>at the time</i>, and thus have nothing to prove now, except in the eyes of the conspiracy theorists, who have yet to present any evidence contradicting the history of NASA's programs. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 05:50, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Conspiracy Theorists have a burden of proof now. They have to prove two things: 1: NASA is an unreliable source of information due to misinformation in the past. 2: The lunar landing did not happene as explained by NASA. To do that, they will have to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that at least a major part of NASA's evidence was falsified. So far, most "proof" I have seen from them was conjectures and theories due to a lack of technical and scientific knowledge. There is no doubt in my mind that in the heat of the cold war (I know, horrible pun) it could have been possible for NASA to fake a lunar landing. However, the fact that it was possible does not in any way make it real. It was also possible for NASA to actually land on the moon (having worked at the Canadian Space Agency, I have seen how much we can do now, landing on the moon does not seem so unrealistic back then). Possible does not mean probable. And probable does not mean certain. (anyway I am getting far from my original point.) Until the currently accepted evidence from NASA is completely refuted, there is no need for NASA to prove what they did again and again. Once an accused person has been found not-guilty, he does not have to go through a trial every day of his or her life.<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoukai_no_unmei_9066.html" title="User:Youkai no unmei">Youkai no unmei</a> 16:20, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When people hear that eight Apollo-related astronauts died in the late sixties, they might think of it as an evidence of MiB had tampered with their aircraft.

<dl>
<dd>Actually not, in the specific meaning of "conspiracy theory" as it's used in popular culture. Watergate as well as the current case brought by Fitzgerald were crime stories that evolved into criminal cases pursued by the government and, in the case of Watergate, convictions; the current case obviously is ongoing, and may or may not result in convictions, but it's still the government trying the case. A "conspiracy theory" or an "alternate" theory, or whatever you want to call it, is a story that runs <i>counter</i> to the "official" government explanation/conclusion and/or conventional history for some event. Thus, there are counter-theories about the JFK, RFK and King assassinations; the deaths of Hollywood stars like Bern, Reeves and Monroe; about 9/11; about the Iraq war; on and on; and about the NASA history. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:09, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If we adjust our understanding of the world simply by how it is understood by popular culture, we would end up with a lot of meaningless words.

There is a theory that people conspired to hide the truth from the population. Connotation is a much more flexible meaning than denotation, and it may change in the near future. In fact, the very same concept can have many connotations in different cultures or even groups. Among people who firmly believe in a shadow government, a conspiracy theory is taken more seriously than with people's which only had contact with the local nutjob who wears a tinfoil hat. (I am not saying anyone here is such a nutjob.) I do believe that in an international and neutral work, denotation should be used rather than connotation.<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoukai_no_unmei_9066.html" title="User:Youkai no unmei">Youkai no unmei</a> 14:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly. Wahkeenah, are you sure you are not suffering from concussion? Perhaps you should lie down for a while? You have total trust in the outcome of the case currently being prosecuted, despite no findings? The 'official story' from the executive branch is that there is no conspiracy. The prosecutor has a conspiracy theory (by your definition) that he is propounding that is counter to the official version. What is happening is that you are using the term 'conspiracy' for a case where you believe in the evidence, and 'conspiracy theory' for one where you don't, and want to disparage the idea. That is the only meaning of the term. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 17:42, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>While user Youkai no unmei is correct in the context of the literal meanings of the terms, "conspiracy theory" as a term was coined specifically to describe these alternate explanations to the official story, probably originally in connection with the JFK alternate theories.

History has been filled with people conspiring against someone. And people have been suspicious of these conspirations ever since the first one was found. However, all semantics aside (while I love arguing on the nature of terminology, we have to get to the point at some time), we must consider the following: Until something is proven, it is concidered a theory. People secretly working together with the intention of deceiving is a conspiracy. Hence, the possible faking of the lunar landing is a theory relevant to a conspiracy. However, if you want to go even deeper in the meanings and use the scientific method's definition of theory, to actually be a theory, it would recquire a partial backing by fact of what is supported that would, according to the current understanding, lead to the theory's conclusion. Since the False Lunar Landing conspiracy is mostly based on speculative evidence, if not entirely, it is hard to see it as a theory in the scientific definition of the term. In common usage, theory can be used for anything that is suspected, like a hunch. However, conspiracy hunches seems a bit too weak. Anyway, to get back to the topic at hand. People suspect a conspiracy, it is therefore a conspiracy theory UNTIL it is proven or disproven, at which point it will simply be a conspiracy or it will become nothing if it is disproven. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoukai_no_unmei_9066.html" title="User:Youkai no unmei">Youkai no unmei</a> 19:08, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>The catarcats argument could hold if compared to the actual rate of cataracts in similar non-space faring individuals. It, however, remains a rather weak argument, as the astronauts probably had other things in common that may have caused cataracts. It is still a stronger argument than some person who claims that some guy who died the week before was about to give him proof.</p>

<dd>A shill is someone paid by an organization, in secret, to mislead the public in the guise of a neutral observer. The term itself is neutral.

<dd>Actually, the whole sentence is rather impolite. "In the end, most of us have jobs and lives, which the NASA shills don't seem to (unless trolling this page is their full time job...)" In one sentence, people who diagree with him are accused of not having a life nor a job, of being tools for NASA and of being trolls.

<p>In the interest of shortening this long article, I think that it might be a good idea to remove the section "Individuals featured in the controversy". I think that these people are notable enough to have their own wikipedia entry, if they don't already. Furthermore, listing and discussing the individuals seems to have a problem with NPOV.

I think it's very important to know who is making these claims and whether they have any kind of background that would allow them to do so... the Apollo-deniers don't like this because it's immediately apparent that most of these people are, shall we say, a little out of the ordinary. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 02:28, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Putting lengthy bios in separate articles is standard wiki procedure. But is there enough for a separate article? What can you say about guys like Kaysing and Sibrel beyond the obvious, that they don't know what they're talking about. Meanwhile, I see that Carfiend is also back after a long absence.

As was mentioned above, many view the hoax proponents as "crackpots", so the less visible these people are in the article, the more respectable the article will appear. The hoax opponents will thus have to counter the hoax proponents with evidence. As it is now, the article does a decent job of describing the controversy, but at the end, the list of proponents just screams "if you don't believe us, look at these crazies who are making these claims!" <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 00:06, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I find it funny that you people think the only way people can trust the evidence brought forward by NASA concerning the lunar landing is that they are paid by NASA and the CIA in a major conspiracy to ensure that a minor fraction of the population is convinced of something that at this point has no influence on your daily lives.

<p>I have done the following in an attempt to better organize the Apollo Moon landing hoax accusation pages. First, I have created a category with the same name and have added the relevant topics that I know of.

Finally, in the interest of triming down the size of this article, and to stick to the point of documenting the claims, I have removed this section from this article.

<dd>This is ridiculous. A hoax page without the people that started the movement? Might as well take off the "debunkings" and start a separate page for Apollo hoax debunkings. That is a lot more appropiate than starting a separate page for hoax accusers.24.7.34.99 13:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The hoax propenents are in the article, they are referenced, what is the problem? If they are NOT referenced, they should be! The article is about accusations, not the people.

<dd>You can't write an article about Apollo-denial without talking about the hoax proponents, because so many of the claims are merely their word against NASA's. An article which doesn't cover their background and their justification is pointless.

<dd>Rather than excising them to such an extent, as was done by Lunokhod, I think it would be better to retain the list in this article, with maybe a sentence on each player, and with the link to the "main article" on those guys. That would still have the desired effect of shortening the article and would follow the normal wiki approach. However, there is also duplication between that spinoff "main article" and the individuals' bios. I'm not so sure that's a good thing, although that practice seems to be rampant in wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 13:42, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment stemming from merger debate</b></p>
<p>This editing two talk pages is a right old pain in the wossnames. Right - about the length of this article. There is no denying it goes on, and on, and on. A couple of observations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the main instigators of the allegations now have an <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Moon_landing_hoax_accusers_c30d.html" title="Apollo Moon landing hoax accusers">article unto themselves</a>, so I think that whole section can be trimmed severely. We need names and <i>at most</i> a two sentence paragraph on who they are, and their tie-in to this whole thing.</li>
<li>Secondly far the biggest part of this is the accusation-rebuttal bit. It's a great piece of writing, but too long to sit in the middle of the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>To shorten the article, do with it as we have the accusers - carve it out as a separate page called along the lines of "responses to the moon landing hoax accusations" or something similar. That takes out a big chunk of this article. If needs be, the ultimate rebuttal (here's a stack of other things that people nothing to do with NASA saw on those nights) can be lobbed in there too.</p>
<p>I see the problems here "it doesn't deal with the way the accusations can be rebutted" which can be driven by a short paragraph setting out that each of the accusations can be explained, and indeed have been explained by NASA <i>et al</i>, see other article. This leaves a bit of a gap, but with some re-wording that can be overcome. Much as Being Bold is part of WP, doing this off my own bat would be tantamount to declaring war; I'll sit back and see what everyone else thinks.</p>
<p>I do recall seeing a similar suggestion somewhere in the archives, but I'm stoned if I can recall why it was deemed to be a Bad Idea. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeG_3209.html" title="User:LeeG">LeeG</a> 23:36, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that <i>if the people have their own article</i> their bio can be shortened to two sentences.

<dd>Although actually, when I come to look at it, a lot of the entries of these people are Moon Landing Hoax accusations, it seems better to the parts of the bios that are actually bios on the bio pages, and keep the parts which are elucidations of their hoax theories on the hoax page, that way someone interested in the person can get the bio, and someone interested in the hoax can get all the hoax stuff in one place. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 16:29, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We talked about using <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a> last summer to tackle this very problem, which seems to be the suggestion here. The objections had to do with pro-hoaxers calling it an inflamatory move by pro NASA POV jihadis, or words to that effect. I'm not sure of the specifics of the objections beyond that, assuming there were specifics, beyond that. It never got of the ground in the face of their objections and the various editors were lucky to even maintain some sort of equilibrium. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 20:38, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Holy potatoes this is a minefield. I have done a first pass on <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeG_test_e799.html" title="User:LeeG\test">My Moon Hoax rewrite test page</a> in which I have done a lot of text removal, a big chunk of copy writing, duplicate statement removal (that Gallup poll was in twice, for example), excise two sections (step by step rebuttals and the bios) and it is STILL 46Kb long. I know the first pass will not survive as I'm sure I have inadvertently upset one party or another - if that's the case, I'm sorry. I'd prefer if you hit the discussion page over there (or here) rather than the rewrite page, as it will be easier for me to track what the heck people actually think. To shrink this further we need to look at all sorts of stuff. There's the links for starters - it's a link farm at the bottom. There's the almost endless list of song lyrics and obtuse references to video games, bits of film script and random TV shows. I don't see what any of that stuff adds, but I am not a fan of bloated "trivia" sections in any article. In short - see if I am on the right lines, if so I'll continue, if not I'll try to do what you think with it. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeG_3209.html" title="User:LeeG">LeeG</a> 00:57, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
