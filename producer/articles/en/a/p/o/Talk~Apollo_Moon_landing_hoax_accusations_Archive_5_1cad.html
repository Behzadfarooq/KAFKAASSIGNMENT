<li>Jeff Foust of The Space Review [18], the sci.space FAQ, [19] and the AFU and Urban Legends Archive [20] report that it is an urban legend that the Saturn V blueprints are missing, and that they are on microfilm at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.</li>

<dd>Well, that may be the case, but if so I'd say you should remove the claim that the blueprints for the Rover appear to be missing unless you can provide a NASA (or similarly definitive) source to that effect. I know there's a link to a web site, but the claim is from some unidentified poster saying that the blueprints aren't on NASA's web site... hardly a conclusive and verifiable source. In any case, this suffers from exactly the same problems as the other blueprint claims, in that lack of blueprints says nothing about the existence of the hardware. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 20:52, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BTW, these people claim to have LEM blueprints: <a href="http://www.space1.com/About_Us/Our_Approach/Drawing_Archive/drawing_archive.html" class="external free" title="http://www.space1.com/About_Us/Our_Approach/Drawing_Archive/drawing_archive.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.space1.com/About_Us/Our_Approach/Drawing_Archive/drawing_archive.html</a> and included part of one on that page. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 21:56, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you read carefully, they don't really claim to have the full blueprints - I couldn't find them anywhere on the site. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 23:45, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, but they claim to have built their LEM simulator based on '200 Grumman drawings'. That would be difficult if they didn't exist. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 23:51, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So do I take it we should believe that don't exist because some guy can't find them on a NASA web site? Do you think you can find the Ford Capri blueprints on Ford's web site? (heck, maybe you can, I haven't looked for them: but equally I wouldn't claim that Ford Capris didn't exist just because I couldn't find the blueprints on that site) <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 15:34, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Haven't seen a Capri for about three months, but if I wanted to I could find one in a car museum any time I felt like it. Similarly, I believe there's at least one LRV in a museum, which any Apollo-denier could visit. If they believe that lack of blueprints on the web means no LRVs were built, I guess their head would explode at that point in a tsunami of cognitive dissonance. I don't know whether there are any actual flight-worthy LEMs in museums. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 16:57, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't count on there being any flight-worthy LEM's around, since most of them would be on the moon. If an Apollo-denier claims the Saturn V was never built, then the citizens of Cocoa Beach and other places who watched them take off must have been watching an image projected onto the clouds. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:09, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I suspect all the flight-worthy LEMs were used in lunar missions too, however given a couple were cancelled fairly late on the LEMs may have been at least partially completed. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 17:22, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, it appears the Apollo 18 LEM is in a museum... guess we can make new blueprints from that one if Grumman can't find them&#160;:)&#160;: <a href="http://www.cradleofaviation.org/exhibits/space/lm-13/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cradleofaviation.org/exhibits/space/lm-13/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cradleofaviation.org/exhibits/space/lm-13/index.html</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 17:27, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point is not whether you think it's important, but that, since these are publicly owned documents, why are they not publicly available? If they exist, they should be easy to find. If NASA went to the moon, these documents should exist. If they simply mocked up the fakes, you would not expect them to want to produce blueprints or nav tapes, because errors would become apparent on close examination. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 17:03, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Apollo is more than 30 years old, and maybe they just don't feel like posting every last tedious detail on their website. Are there <i>shuttle</i> blueprints on the site? I don't know, but if there aren't, does that mean the shuttle does not exist? 17:09, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>If they exist, they should be easy to find</i> Why? I mean that as a serious question: this is 1960s technology, printed on paper, maybe transferred to microfilm, that no-one plans to use again. Why should it be 'easy to find'? In particular, why would they be on the web? And lastly, what difference would it make? Somewhere in my parents' house I still have a set of blueprints of the USS Enterprise from Star Trek: does that mean that the Enterprise exists? Or does the fact that they're not 'easy to find' mean that the Enterprise doesn't exist? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 17:12, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, the statement "if they exist, they should be easy to find" is untrue. How many times have you lost a sock in the laundry? It obviously exists, so why can't you find it? Also, as I and others have said repeatedly, the existence or non-existence of the blueprints has nothing to do with whether Apollo was real or not. You can draw a blueprint for anything, it doesn't mean the object exists. The blueprints question is just another red herring thrown out there by the hoaxster cons. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:24, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem here is that NASA want's a get out of jail free card for having 'lost' all of the detailed evidence that they havn't faked yet. The fact is that if they went, this stuff should exist. It's not like my sock drawer - this was a big deal at the time, and the science data and engineering drawings should exist. It's ridiculous to just say 'oh, they're somewhere, don't worry about it' and expect the question to go away. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 17:37, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hey, ya know what? Instead of badgering us, why don't you contact NASA directly, and ask them why the blueprints aren't online? While you're at it, check and see if shuttle blueprints are also online. Also, what about Mercury, Gemini, Apollo-Soyuz and Skylab? If Mercury is there and Apollo is not, then you might be onto something. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:46, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not 'badgering you'. I'm helping to write an article on the apollo moon landing hoax accusations. There are accusations made on various site, and in books, by hoax proponents, this page is about reporting what they say, and what NASA and it's defenders say in response. Please don't feel badgered! <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 20:47, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't feel badgered, no worries. But I still want to know why you think the presence or absence of blueprints has anything to do with this article. Neither their presence nor their absences proves anything either way. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:07, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quest for the tapes and blueprints is probably not of much interest to those who are religiously attached to either postion (pro or anti). They do provide the equivalent of an 'alibi' for NASA though - if they had the telemetry tapes, it would pretty much proove that they went, because they would be so difficult to fake convincingly. Those interested in the truth want them because of that. Without them, it's not that there's proof of guilt, but it does look suspicious, and warrent more investigation. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 05:07, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am not religiously attached to any position except facts. I keep waiting for the cons to come up with something to contradict the historical record, and they haven't done it. Moreover, I get offended by their approach, which is filled with ignorance and willful deceptions, all the while claiming to be innocent little lambs. The telemetry tapes might be useful, assuming they are even readable after 30-35 years. Maybe they are sitting next to the Lost Ark in some warehouse. The blueprints would be interesting, but their presence or absence proves nothing. If they turned up, the cons would simply claim they are fakes, so it doesn't matter either way. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 06:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, another thing: What basis does anyone have for saying it "looks suspicious"? How much stuff from 35 years ago is still floating around? Labeling as suspicious, in the article anyway (which no one has overtly done yet) constitutes original research and point-of-view bias... because there is no contextual basis for declaring it any more suspicious than anything else from 35 years ago that's not around. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 06:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The historical record from what NASA says was the first time people left earth orbit? No, nothing significant about that. Toss it with the garbage. As often is the case with NASA shills, you are accusing people of things they have not done. Frankly I find it hard to imagine why anyone would not be interested in keeping this data. In fact, as you point out, other people are interested in keeping it, but, interestingly, NASA wants to destroy the only machine that could read it. Are you up for a wager? I'm betting NASA's pretty determined to destroy that machine.... <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 14:45, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The tapes are only of any real value for the video footage they contain, or to a small extent for any useful information they might contain for building the next generation of lunar spacecraft. That's the reason why they've been stuffed away somewhere and never looked at for decades: no-one has any use for the other data on the tapes, and until recently they thought the standards-converted video footage we do have was as good as the original footage on those tapes. It's only people who don't understand spaceflight who think there's anything else of great important on there. People who'd claim that a real, actual LEM isn't as convincing as a few blueprints aren't going to be convinced that people went to the Moon because they can now see that Glycol Evaporator 2 Temperature was 137.5F at MET 134:07:56... which is the kind of useless information which fills up most of the tapes. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 01:03, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gentlemen, if you feel that the information should be available, you can make a Freedom of Information request (<a href="../../../f/o/i/FOIA_3838.html" title="FOIA">FOIA</a>) to NASA. They will charge you the minimum fee for duplicating the drawings/tapes/film and mail it to you. If you are unwilling to do this, then it's time to go. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. As your claims that this is a hoax rely on tens of thousands conspiring to keep the largest secret ever, they are pretty extraordinary. It is not the job of those who have scientific training or engineering backgrounds to prove a positive to you, it is up to _you_ to take steps to prove your claims to us. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 04:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>More to the point, what exactly is that paragraph trying to prove? That there's some notable disagreement about where the "neutral point" is? Any grade schooler could tell you that the moon is nowhere near 64 percent of the earth's gravity, so any calculation that suggests that is obviously wrong. Also, the "neutral point" is not a "point", it's a <i>range</i>. According to my <i>World Almanac</i>, the perigee and apogee vary from 225,744 miles to 251,966 miles. So the neutral point is also going to vary by over 10 percent. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:35, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>According to one page I saw where a guy did some math, based on the inverse-square law, the neutral point should be about 9/10 of the way to the moon, or between 22,500 and 25,000 miles or some such. Also, now I see what you're getting at, that every measurement taken by astronomers that demonstrated the relative masses of the moon and earth are now to be considered invalid because of something that someone <i>supposedly</i> reported in 1969. I'm seeing that assertion parroted all over the Internet. Someone needs to go back to the source and see if they really said that, or if this is just another lie by the hoaxster cons. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:45, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I see where Bubba73 made his initial comments, still on this page, and quoting that same statement that many have parroted about 43,000 miles or whatever. His comment reminded me that the path to the moon was not a straight line, but rather a curved trajectory, so it is perfectly obvious that there is no mystery about this at all, it's just another example of the ignorance and/or deception constantly practiced by the hoaxster cons. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:20, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In short, it's false. I can either take it out or post the explanation. Which would you prefer? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:21, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I went ahead and posted the explanation. Since it is effectively now in the typical question-and-answer format, it could theoretically be moved to the question-and-answer section. The one missing piece is the 1973 E.B. statement. I would like to know whether that's true, or if it's just another hoaxster con fabrication; and what the E.B. says <i>currently</i>. (Maybe you get the idea I don't believe a word they say. Their 2001 Fox TV special destroyed whatever credibility they might have had.) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:59, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought so. &gt;:) It's documented in many places that the flights took a curved path toward the moon. Also notice that the <i>Time</i> reference did not use the term "neutral point", it merely indicated the distance from the moon that the Apollo craft would be when it fell under the moon's influence. The misuse of that quote is a typical hoaxsters trick. As for what the 1973 EB said, maybe someone could find it, scan it, and post it here (along with what it says <i>now</i>), since you can't trust anything the hoaxsters claim as facts.

<p>The bulk of this piece should be about details of hoax theories and related information, not a history lesson, not a rebuttal and not a demonstration of the powers of rationality and common sense. Certainly the information should be laced with disclaimors and asides that point to the improbability and lack of 'authoratative' support for the hoax claims, but for the bulk of this article to be a seemingly heartfelt rant about how wrong the hoax theories are wrong is just silly. I believe the theories could be presented fairly and completed ( with refuting evidence added as counterpoints if you really feel the need) without the necessity of 'proving' that the apollo missions happened. That is after all what the Apollo mission pages are for. This page should be about hoax theories. Link to the histories if you need to. The wikipedia is big enough to be contain them both.

<dd>I do have a concrete, if general, suggestion: remove the bulk of the information refuting the hoax theories and replace it with a series of disclaimors (This element of the theory like all Apollo hoax theories is widely disputed and wholly debunked in mainstream culture) and links to content that supports these refutations. Perhaps there should be a separate page for refutations of Apollo hoax theories. My point is not to bolster the hoax theoriest's claims (I'm as sure as I can be without having actually gone that the apollo missions happened)but to make this particular article more focused on it's stated topic: 'apollo hoax theories' which are <b>american pop CULT/ural artifacts</b> and deserve pointed attention as such. The idea that by including all the refutations you're somehow preventing innocents from being preverted by these theories is silly and a little insulting to us laymen. Also, seriously engaging hoax theorists in debate is a waste of time. You're talking two different languages -- one faith-based(broadly defined), one data-based. This is the place for the faith-based content. BTW: it is the Burden of proof section specifically that prompted me to write here. That section seems ridiculous in context, akin to a discussion of gavity proplulsion and aerodynamics to 'prove' that eight flying reindeer could not if fact power a flying sleigh. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 16:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm sure we all know that debates with CTs are a waste of time in convincing the CTs that they are mistaken, but such debates allow the CTs an opportunity to make themselves look silly in the eyes of less devoted readers.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blueprints</span></h2>
<p>I think it looks very weak to have this section in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Despite the questions concerning the existance or location of the LEM blueprints, what is said to be a flight-worthy LEM is on exhibit at the Cradle of Aviation Museum. LM-13 would have landed on the moon during the Apollo 18 mission, but was instead put into storage when the mission was cancelled: it has since been restored and put on display. Four flight-worthy Lunar Rovers were built, but three flew to the Moon and the other was used for spares after Apollo 18 was cancelled: the only Lunar Rovers on display are test articles and replicas.[19]</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Basically you're saying - yes - all the documentation 'disapeared', but there are replicas available in a museum! Look at those instead of asking awkward questions! We should focus on the point, which is why are there no blueprints or tapes? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 05:04, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you think that section is weak, maybe you shouldn't have edited it to make it so. <i>You</i> are the one claiming that LM-13 is not a real, actual, flight-worthy LEM that would have flown to the Moon. I suppose I should have guessed that even when presented with an actual, real LEM capable of a lunar landing that Apollo-deniers would stick their fingers in their ears, close their eyes and claim it didn't exist. I'd imagine that anyone who would focus on blueprints and ignore the actual, real existence of an actual, real LEM is probably beyond salvation. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 10:19, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No you didn't. You edited it in such a way that it's pedantically correct, yet ignores the fact that pretty much the entire world accepts that it's real. The only reasons I haven't removed that change are because it _is_ pedantically correct and because it helps to show the wacky extremes that Apollo-deniers have to go to with their 'theories'. I really don't think you're helping your case by claiming that the Apollo 18 LEM doesn't exist. Now you want to remove it because you claim it's 'weak', after you deliberately made it so... why don't you want people to know there's an actual flight-worthy LEM they can go look at any time they choose? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 14:55, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I answered above - the point is that the telemetry and documentation are the side effects of producing an actual vehicle. If you just make a model for a museum, you don't typically have all of the masses of technical drawings etc that go alongside actually testing and developing a vehicle. While the absense of the blueprints is not a smoking gun, their presence would pretty much proove the landings took place, or at least that a good-faith effort was made. The lack of them is dissapointing for those of us who want to see proof of the landing, since, at the very least, it indicates negligence in the archivists. It's pretty suspicious that these are the ones missing, frankly, and is circumstantial evidence of a hoax. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 14:39, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me put it this way. A factory shows you what looks like a car. They refuse to start it, or let you drive it, but show you a video of it being driven. How do you tell whether they made the car, or a mock-up, and a fake video? Well, one way would be to ask to see the development documentation and the transcripts of the test. If they had all of that, you'd feel better, if not, it would further raise your suspicions. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 14:48, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your argument would be that blueprints and tapes by themselves don't prove much, but they add to the "preponderence of evidence?" If so, I can accept that.

<dd>No, I'm saying that if the Apollo program looked more like an engineering development program, with technical drawings, test data, logs etc, it would be more convicing than something that looks like what's left over after a film crew leaves, with some models in a museum that are claimed to be real, but can't be tested. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 00:27, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>So let me get this right. Your one and only reason for believing that the Moon landings were faked is that NASA hasn't put every last technical document on the web? You're not claiming the photos are faked, you're not claiming they couldn't get to the Moon, you're not claiming that the Moon's gravity is much higher than accepted, you're just claiming that the vast amounts of technical data which _is_ available isn't enough to satisfy you? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 00:31, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>No, I'm saying that the fact that NASA does not produce information that they should have that would be very difficult to fake is evidence in favor of the hoax theory. The 'real LEM' is not convincing. The documentation of how it was made and the logs of its activities would be. But we don't have them... <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 00:33, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>The 'real LEM' is not convincing.</i> I think that says it all, really.

</dd>
<dd>Your 'scare quotes' are appropriate. How do we know it's real? Because NASA tells us. Again, we are asked to take it on faith. When we ask for the documents to prove it, we are told we are being unreasonable. There's a model of Godzilla in a museum I saw, it doesn't prove she's real. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 00:46, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Um, if people make the claim that the surface gravity and the neutral point are related (as they do above) then this is a misconception. They conflated surface gravity with the mass of the moon.

<dl>
<dd>In the real world scenario being discussed, they are related. The case being made is about the neutral point not being correctly computed. That is a funcation of the mass and distance of the moon. Since nobody disputes the radius of the moon, a change in it's mass will result in a change in it's surface gravity. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 15:41, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>But that's not the argument that's being made. They are equating the strength of gravity at a Lagrange point with the strength at the surface claiming that the strength at the surface of the moon compared to the strength at the surface of the Earth should represent a ratio that is similar at the Lagrange point. Are they mathematically related? Yes. But these people are confusing the terms.

<dd>And a change in the neutral point will not result in a change in the mass of the Moon, even if it had occured.

<dd>Xenophilia has taken a quote from <i>Time</i> and misinterpreted it, typical of the hoaxsters. The neutral point is 22,500-25,000 miles on a straight line from the moon to the earth, but there are an infinite number of points where, at any given moment, the earth and the moon's gravitations balance out. The Apollo craft came toward the moon on a curved path, not a straight line.

<dd>It is not. You cite no such claim in that section at all. You say that a Time magazine article says one thing and that an Encyclopedia Britannica article says something else. Where is any actual, real, verifiable claim made in that section which is relevant to Apollo? You claim that two articles say different things and that if the Moon's gravity was higher then the Apollo missions couldn't have had enough fuel to get there.

<p>My back-of-the-envelope calculations show that, with a E-M distance of 250k miles and a neutral point 40k miles from the moon, the ratio of the Earth and moon masses is 21*21/4/4 which is about 27. If the Moon was the same density as the Earth, this would give a radius of 1/3 and a surface gravity of about 1/3. With the moon being less dense (it contains less iron), its radius is bigger and surface gravity is smaller giving 1/6 the gravity. The neutral point quoted is not so surprising. Who said it was doesn't have a cite. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 17:18, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't believe there's any requirement to cite a reference to prove that 2+2=4. A reference to gravitational theory or a definition of 'neutral point' would be a good idea, but there's no reason I can see to have to prove that such simple calculations are correct when they'd be so easy to disprove if they weren't. In any case, this article: <a href="http://www.apollo-hoax.me.uk/neutral.html" class="external free" title="http://www.apollo-hoax.me.uk/neutral.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apollo-hoax.me.uk/neutral.html</a> claims that the Earth's gravity and Moon's gravity are equal at 24,000 miles, but that the gravitational minimum is at 43,000 miles... so either could be correct depending on your definition of 'neutral point'.

<p>Ok, to do your work for you, it would appear that the source for this bizarre claim is a guy by the name of William Brian, who apparently claims in <i>Moongate: Suppressed Findings of the U.S. Space Program</i> that yes, indeed, the lunar surface gravity is 64% of Earth's, even though pretty much the entire scientific community believes that it is around 16%. What I can't find is a reliable cite to that effect, only the odd book review and other uncited quotes on the web. There are some supposed quotes at: <a href="http://www.beyond-the-illusion.com/files/Science/Space/Planets/Moon/moongate.txt" class="external free" title="http://www.beyond-the-illusion.com/files/Science/Space/Planets/Moon/moongate.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.beyond-the-illusion.com/files/Science/Space/Planets/Moon/moongate.txt</a>, which imply he really does believe that <i>the Moon's surface gravity is 64% of the Earth's surface gravity, not the one-sixth (or 16.7%) value predicted by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation!</i> So he doesn't seem to believe Newton's laws either.</p>
<p>If you can find a reliable cite for his claim then feel free to rewrite that section to say 'William Brian claims that Lunar surface gravity is 64% of Earth's, based on neutral point, blah, blah, so Apollo couldn't have had enough fuel.'. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 21:03, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Most interesting is that according to <a href="http://www.crosslink.net/~blackcat/moonhoax.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.crosslink.net/~blackcat/moonhoax.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.crosslink.net/~blackcat/moonhoax.pdf</a>, Brian reportedly _does_ believe that the Apollo astronauts went to the Moon, but that it had an atmosphere and that the footage was faked to pretend that the gravity was only 1/6 of Earth's! Apparently the book was self-published (not surprising), and therefore it's now very hard to find. This gets funnier all the time. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 21:15, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So, to summarise the available information:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>William Brian saw two different values for his 'neutral point'. He decided that this showed that the moon has 64% of Earth's gravity and not 16%. He also decided that the moon has an atmosphere, and that the Apollo astronauts landed on the Moon but the footage was faked to make it appear to only have 16% of Earth's gravity and no atmosphere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, back in reality, the two different values are probably measuring different things. One gives the distance where the Earth's gravity and moon's gravity are equal, the other appears to be the distance of the Moon's sphere of influence, which is far more important to NASA, as it tells them the point where the Moon's gravity is having more influence on the spacecraft's trajectory than the Earth's gravity. So both are correct, and the Moon is not four times heavier than the scientific community believe.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/ap16fj/09_Day3_Pt2.htm" class="external free" title="http://history.nasa.gov/ap16fj/09_Day3_Pt2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://history.nasa.gov/ap16fj/09_Day3_Pt2.htm</a> also mentions that the lunar sphere of influence was the point NASA used: <i>we're scheduled to cross that mythical line known as the lunar Sphere of Influence, the point of which we begin calculating the increasing of the lunar gravity on the spacecraft. Our displays here in Mission Control shortly after that point are generally switched over to Moon reference from Earth reference. The velocities that we have been watching decrease steadily up to now, will then begin to increase as the spacecraft is accelerated toward the Moon.</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately without access to a copy of Brian's book it's difficult to give reliable cites. The sites above have some information, <a href="http://www.ahealedplanet.net/cover-up.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ahealedplanet.net/cover-up.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ahealedplanet.net/cover-up.htm</a> has more, and <a href="http://www.ahealedplanet.net/cover-up.htm#_edn57" class="external free" title="http://www.ahealedplanet.net/cover-up.htm#_edn57" rel="nofollow">http://www.ahealedplanet.net/cover-up.htm#_edn57</a> points out the way to calculate the gravitational sphere of influence. All in all, it appears to be a total non-event, but shows how wacky some of the Apollo-deniers may get.</dd>
</dl>

<li>1. "Accused" is a legalistic term and carries an inherent point-of-view to it. 2. The statement is being cited as if he were serious, which is not necessarily a correct interpretation.

<p>So what is Wiki policy on potentially libellous statements? I also notice a number of uncited claims in that section (e.g. mentions of 'some proponents' rather than specific verifiable cases, use of 'say' rather than 'claim', the former implying to me that they're in a position to have personal knowledge, and statements that astronauts and others said or did things with no cites). Given this is potentially libellous I think you should be very careful about what you write in that section and ensure everything is clarified and cited. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 22:44, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I changed most of the "claim" to "say", because reporting that they "say" it is true, and is a fairly neutral word, while "claim" is a word with a built-in bias. I took it away from <i>both</i> sides of the fence, FYI. And the reason I say it has a bias is that it was almost always posted by someone on the other side of the fence... like they're saying "NASA claims this but I don't believe it" or "moon hoaxsters claim this but I don't believe it." There's no arguing that they "say" something, provided they are quoted accurately. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:28, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Gravitor, may I respectfully suggest you do some looking up yourself, rather than burdening the editors here with all the work of clearing up things you're personally not certain about? I appreciate you're simply applying a 'healthy scepticism' to all the material that tends to support the point of view you doubt. But it would do you credit if you were to do a quick Google on sibrel and "false identity", say, and brought your own cites to the case. Otherwise there's a risk people will come to think of your contribution here as entirely negative and burdensome on everyone else. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 18:32, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Adhib, I appreciate your feedback, however, I could find no evidence in a brief search for this slanderous accusation.

<dd>If you want to challenge the majority belief, then it's down for you to provide proof to do so. There is no 'independently verifiable evidence' of _any_ historical event, because any event could have been hoaxed by a large enough conspiracy: but that doesn't mean that anyone should take you seriously if you claim that, say, the Vietnam War was a hoax.

<dd>The "independent verification" complaint is yet another hoaxster cons' red herring.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The point is this: you cannot prove that the Vietnam War happened, because it's a historical event which happnened in the past. So if I was to claim that it was a hoax, I would have to prove it was hoaxed.

<dl>
<dd>'Witnesses'? They're all part of the hoax. 'Evidence'? Come on, you can't seriously expect me to believe that dumping a few burnt-out helicopters and tanks in Vietnam proves that a war happened? Where are all the blueprints? Where is all the technical data? Why do the photos look like they were shot on a war movie set?

<p>If you are really claiming that there is no difference then there is no point in continuing this discussion. There are many independent sources and first hand reports in Vietnam.

<p>NASA is a large institution comprised of a many, many individuals. The space program was a huge project involving many many individuals inside and outside of NASA.

My method is to simply reword each sentence so it doesn't sound like a zealot (of either stripe) wrote it and to rearrange the sections so the cart is behind the horse and the leg bone is connected to foot bone or whatever. So far it's working pretty well. While I feel perfectly competant that I can improve this article via revision in the manner I've described (we'll see how it all works out anyway), I have no special knowledge about this topic and I'm relatively new to wikipedia. The presentation is simply so bad and the exchanges on this page so silly, that I'm sure I can do better.</p>
<p>I welcome input from anyone on exactly how to proceed either with respect to the collaborative revision process, the relative wieght to give the various sources, the importance of key features of the theories, or the actual content of the finished piece.</p>
<p>For starters, I'm boldly renaming the page (if i can). The current name is obviously and needlessly perjorative.</p>
<p>Tomorrow evening (24 hours notice), barring someone convincing me otherwise, I'll remove the burden of proof section (which is hopelessly off topic-- you reference Occam's Razor for God's sake) and regroup all of the current content in a sensible manner that puts the theories first and refutations after in a claim/refutation format as opposed to the inherently POV Q&amp;A format.</p>
<p>I do have a question. Why aren't there flags or tags on the article ( or how do you do it) to indicate the weakness of the current piece <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 01:13, 19 July 2006 (UTC) this was me or whatever</p>

<dd>In what sense can the title 'Apollo moon landing hoax theories' be considered 'obviously and needlessly perjorative.'? Other than that, rewriting and tidying may be a good idea, though I'd suggest putting up a version on your talk page first so people can raise any objections before you replace the current version completely. Also there's a tag to say that you're carrying out a major revision which you could put on the current page: underconstruction.</dd>

<dd>As Bubba73 indicates, there is no actual "theory", just a list of questions. However, as a "<i>conspiracy</i> theory", the shoe fits pretty well.

My POV is that this is a cultural phenom, akin to UFO sitings or Bigfoot legends (I'm not judging but . . . ), that merits being addressed in its own right. If the theory consists of a series of claims of inconsistencies than that is what the theory consists of. That said, I don't think this is a good place to hash out whether or not the theories make sense.

I'm not really interested in contributing to this article, but I <i>do</i> have a comment on the name. I came here via a user's contributions page where I noticed the various rename/redirects.

<dd>It's not appropriate because the term is abusive. This discussion has been had in the archives time and again. A theory about a conspiracy is not the same as a 'conspiracy theory'. Google is not an appropriate way to settle this, since the most common term in a highly charged debate is abusive. The hoax proponents virtually never use the term to describe themselves. 'Accusations' is litterally true, and carries no bias. The proponents make accusations of NASA. No one disputes that. We don't comment on whether they are true. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 15:01, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The term "accusation" is not neutral either, but it's true enough. The fact that the hoaxster cons don't want to call themselves conspiracy theorists doesn't mean they aren't.

<p>Wha-? Putting a man on the moon was a feat of engineering, not a scientific experiment requiring duplication in the lab. There was definitely science there, but it was the science we employed in building the rockets that took us there. The "repeatable" part of those experiments was in building and launching the next rocket, which worked better than the previous. To say that we didn't go to the moon because it's not repeatable without a budget larger than the GDP of most countries is faulty logic.--<a href="../../../h/b/n/User%7EHBNayr_ef73.html" title="User:HBNayr">Ryan!</a> 00:29, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed, it's almost impossible to manage a conspiracy of more than about a dozen people, and hoaxing the Moon landings would have taken hundreds at an absolute minimum, and more like thousands. In addition, faking the lunar photos and video was way beyond movie technology at the time: just compare '2001' to the actual lunar photos and video... it's garbage in comparison. Hey, now there's an idea: you want to prove to people that Apollo was faked? You go out there with 1960s movie technology and reproduce photos and video of the same quality as those we have from Apollo.

<dd>LOL. Explain how _FIFTY_ people could have faked the Moon landings.

<p>Only one of you even tried to address MY point, that the argument against the hoax (at least in this section) is flawed. The 'hoax hypothesis' is criticized for being multiple hypotheses. The problem I was pointing out was that that is not a problem for any of the individual hypotheses at all, because there isn't just one hoax hypothesis. Did any of you actually read what I wrote? I never endorsed that the theory that the moon landing was a hoax, I simply stated the argument that is made in the burden of proof section is flawed.</p>
<p>"The incompatible fragments of the hoax hypothesis are not hypotheses because they don't individually describe any possible sequence of events." I am sorry but this statement is untrue. The sequence of events used to explain the situation can be as far out and crazy as anyone wants, and it would still be a hypothesis (it might not be correct but it would be a hypothesis). "A hypothesis is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon or reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between multiple phenomena.” An example of hypothesis is that since there are no stars in the background that proves that it was not actually in space (I don't believe this, it is just an example). Another hypothesis is that the earth is flat, and since the pictures have a round earth they must be fraudulent (I definitely don't believe this, but again just an example). Do you deny that these are two separate hypotheses? Can you then still argue that there is only one hypothesis?</p>
<p>The specific argument in this section uses the application of the scientific method in an incorrect way, and should still therefore be removed in two weeks unless someone objects with a counter to my arugment. One of you provided a counterpoint, which I have adressed with a counterpoint, to what I said, please respond to the arguments I have made, tell me why the argument I made was wrong instead of continuing the debate about whether or not it the moon landing was a hoax. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_conway_bcc_10d2.html" title="User:William conway bcc">William conway bcc</a> 01:20, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Appreciate your application of logic here, but it's probably fruitless to expect logic in return from the landing believers.

<dd>I agree that the burden of proof section 'AS IT STANDS' doesn't belong. There is some resonable content in it. I advocate (without much hope) taking the specific hoax refutations, since they speak to general a anti-theorists view of the methodology of conspiracy theorists, and redrafting it as an introduction to the claims/counter-claims section. The 'theory of knloweldge' content should be removed. I did that in a series of rewrites that carfiend reverted without specific or detailed comment other than claiming it was ALL POV. I also included rational for why the hoax theorists use the evidence in the manner described. I further propose that the introduction should reference the disputed nature of the data on both sides (did that too) by way of explaining the whole tit for tat methodology of the claims counter claims sxection.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Concerns about rewrite</span></h2>
<p>Numskll, I have to say I am rather concerned about your rewrite, as it sounds like you may just end up making us rehash discussions that have already been settled. Particularly as a new wikipedia user you may not have the experience to build consensus, and may end up with hurt feelings if lots of your work gets reverted. While the article certainly has problems, it's been far worse in the past, and everything there has good reasons for being there that you'll need to support in your rewrite.</p>
<p>You start by criticizing the "laundry list", but it seems like that is where you are headed with your "claims and counter claims" model. [<a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/debating.html" class="external text" title="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/debating.html" rel="nofollow">| Phil Plat</a>] observes why this model unfairly favors the hoax advocates: Accusers throw hundreds of false-premise questions and drill through technical minute to the point that they force an entire physics education as a reply. This overwhelms most readers, who then just end up seeing two "experts" disagreeing with each other. This gives a false appearance of equality, and is thus biased.</p>
<p>For the article to be unbiased, the "hoax" version of events must be subjected to equal scrutiny to that of Nasa's version. But no such version of events exists - we would have to invent one in order to analyze it. (A violation of NOR) Failure to violate NOR violates NPOV by putting the entire burden of evidence on NASA. The article would then become it's own subject - people asking uninformed or malicous questions, and making NASA supporters do all the work of putting out the flames and explaining the truth.</p>
<p>The article appears biased only if you assume that their is a coherent alternative to NASA's version of events. But no one has been able to produce such an alternative - so this is in fact an article about belief. Why do some people believe one thing, while others looking at the same evidence reach the opposite conclusion? <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 01:44, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again my intent is to edit/revise the article for clarity amd to return the focus to the hoax conspiracy theories. While some content related to counterclaims is appropriate, I contend that the conventional space program related articles are the place to go to for science. It is a mistake to view this as having parity with controversies in the realm of accepted science. This isn't science. This is pop culture. This is a modern media phenomena. The article should be a description of the beliefs of this fringe group - Apollo Moon Landing Hoax Conspiracy Theorists. As such it should contain content that places this group and their beliefs in an appropriate context with respect to society at large. This contextualizing should satisfy the concerns of the 'enemies' of the hoax conspiracy theorists. As it is this article is a psychophrenic non-encyclopedic rant. I beleive that the views of the pro and anti conspiracists are inreconcilible (because their is and probabably can not be any agreement on what counts as evidence) and that any attempt to do so would result in simply making stuff up. It is fine if the pros and cons like to debate the issues. Perhaps some general reference to this debate is appropriate if it is in the context of the theories as a whole. But this article should not be that debate <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 13:51, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's very hard to find a compromise between reality and Apollo-denial: as stated above, they'll freak if you try to treat it as a 'cultural phenomenon'. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 14:17, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Again, I <b>seriously</b> recommend we all go take a look at how the editors at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> handle <i>that</i> little hot patootie. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a>, when you take out the claims and counter-claims, and all the editorialising, what we <i>ought</i> to find left over is a social history of the phenomenon. Just such a solution has suggested itself from different directions to Numskll, Algr and myself over recent weeks.</p>
<p>I think Bubba's quite incorrect to suggest this represents content forking. It's simply defusing the 'controversy' over this article, which should be an accurate documentation of the history of these accusations - ie, their epidemiology, as a cultural phenomenon - and locating it within a defined space, where controversy may express itself ad infinitum without clogging up the article and making it essentially unreadable. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 19:23, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not a false balance, these pages are both about the Apollo program. The Apollo page describes NASA's version, while this page describes both, but is heavily biased towards NASA's story. While some 80-90% of people believe NASA, the term 'historical record' is misleading, we've already established that most of the historical record has been lost or discarded (according to NASA), or more likely never existed. No, the hoax proponents don't own the issue, but neither should NASA. This page should be merged with Apollo. I recognize that politically that will not happen, since there are a majority of NASA POV pushers on the Wiki. The next best thing is for this page to be a fair representation of the dispute. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 13:52, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am being factual. The 'historical record that has been lost or discarded' is the Grummond drawings and data for the LEM and rover (missing, Grummond says they tossed them out), the rest of the blueprints for the Apollo missions, the telemetry tapes and the original hi res video. These make up a substantial portion of what I would think of as the HR. Apologies if you use the term differently. I think it's more likely that this stuff never existed. Certainly very convenient that it is ALL missing, and that NASA is currently trying to decomission the only machine left that could read the tele tapes, even if they existed.</dd>

<dd>I don't think Adhib was drawing a direct parallel between the two groups so your offense, if it is geniune, is misplaced. I included the aside becuase Adhib's point seems so plain that I can't help but think you've misunderstood it either purposely or by not reading what he wrote at all. If I'm mistaken and you simply misunderstood I apologize. Adhib's aim seems to be looking at high level ways to improve this article, rather than arguing about which side is right. In any case I think he was referring simply to the structure of the article in wikipedia, not the larger, false connection to which you've alluded. Since there is such a gulf between what I see as three sides of this issue: Moon Bats, NASA nuts, and err. . . an interested third group we'll call cultural critics, looking at the way a similarity devisive topic is handled may well be instructive. Also, there are certainly parallels to be seen in the treatment of evidence by holocaust deniers and moon hoax conspiracy theorists, though you may be loathe to see these parallels and the stakes are much higher in the case of holocaust denial. In the event that you've thought about these similarites but not seen them or don't think they're valid, you may consider that you hold your preferred version of reality too close to see beyond it. Finally, there is asymmetry. Most people beleive the holocaust and moon landings both happened. Two separate groups of activists don't.

<p>What if we got away from the idea of 'sides', and represented the views as a sliding scale, with the extremists (a complete hoax, on one extreme, and NASA on the other), and in between varying degrees (partial hoax, landing with cover up etc)? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 16:49, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>you include the word 'curious' of course to inject a negative POV in the idea of the treating topic in terms of what people beleive that simply is not there.

<p>I regret that you seem unable to distinguish a difference (however you might describe this difference) between accepted history and conventional science (for what it is) and fringe group beliefs -which is what hoax theories are, but they sohlud not be treated as equal my an encyclopedia. More to the point is that all science is a social phenomena -- think peer review. think educational institutions. Again treating this as a social phenomena simpy remove the right/wrong argument or at least allows us to deal with it factually and reasonably. What it does not do is allow the hoax theorists to claim parity with institutional science.</p>
<p><b>it's not a quaint psychosis, it's a real theory.</b> Excellent, then you're OK with the title going back to conspiracy theory.</p>

Both sides have some guilt, but the pro-NASA side are particularly bad. Refusing to provide evidence, logical falacies, changing the topic, abuse are all common tactics. If I was not convinced, I certainly would not be by the generally poor standard of scholarship. You come over as arogant and uninterested in the facts.

<dd>Sweet of you, but you have missed a large amount of water under the bridge. Apollo deniers keep charging over the top, fresh faced and ill-equipped. Their opponents here have sickened of blatting away at them with their high-tech weaponry. They're attempting to find ways to appeal to these poor chaps' common sense, through the fog of ideas. Current strategies being explored include humour and appeals to higher cognitive functions. I agree the success rate isn't great, but if you'd seen the carnage in Spring, you might accept this was better. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 20:02, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed. Every time an Apollo-denier comes along with some 'fact' it's debunked, often requiring a few hours of research on our part, then they often deny the real, actual facts (like claiming that LM-13 is not a LEM), before they pull another accusation out of nowhere, requiring more research to disprove. Eventually people get tired of being treated like performing poodles. In any case, if you're interesting in Apollo-denier 'facts' and the explanations of those facts, you should be reading the article, not the talk page. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 20:08, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Technological capability of USA, especially when compared to the USSR</span></h3>
<p>At the time of Apollo, the Soviet Union had five times more manned hours in space than the US. They were the first to achieve:</p>
<ol>
<li>First manmade satellite in orbit.</li>
<li>First man in space.</li>
<li>First man to orbit the earth.</li>
<li>First woman in space.</li>
<li>The first crew of three astronauts onboard one spacecraft.</li>
<li>The first spacewalk.</li>
<li>The first of two orbiting spacecraft rendezvousing.</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1967 three astronauts were burned alive on the launch pad. The congressional inquiry found that the entire Apollo program was in shambles and it was a miracle no one was killed sooner. Two years later all of the problems were 'fixed'. Bart Sibrel and others say that this led NASA to conclude that the only way to 'win' the space race was to fake the landings. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><i>NASA and others claim that these achievements by the Soviets are not as impressive as the simple list implies, and that they were built on a dangerous program of balistic rocket research, not a gradual program aimed to get to the moon. <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[</span>citation needed<i>]</i></a></sup></i></li>

<dd>I don't think it's bloated. It lists the evidence for the theories, and the counter claims in an organized and thorough way.

<dd>No, it's because it's pointless to have a list of 'accusations' and rebuttals here when there are far better web pages out there. All this page should do is give an overview of both sides, and leave it at that. Or do you think the 'Holocaust Denial' article should be edited to be a list of deniers' arguments and rebuttals too? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 20:55, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>in my opinion it was not directly relevent and certainly not neutral and as i have siad i'm most concerned with the format and organization of the article. That makes new content suspect. You asked me to discuss changes prior to making them . Why do you refuse to do the same? Please repsnd to that. Calling my edits vandalism is silly. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 20:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm beginning to think you're trolling. Vandalism needs to be reverted, good faith edits should not be. It's that simple. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 21:05, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please be civil. Please respond to the question I've asked: why are there two sets of rules. What makes you think my edits were vandalism and not an attempt to clean up this piece?<a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumskll_783d.html" title="User:Numskll">Numskll</a> 21:08, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>The two rules are 1. Vandalism should be reverted, and 2. Good faith edits should not be. I think yours are vandalism because they remove relevant, sourced and neutral information from the article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 21:09, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>and you and you alone decide which is which? I stated my reason for doing the revert. You directed me earlier to only edit after getting consensus here. You didn't even attempt it let alone reach it. and you accuse me variously of being a vandal, a troll and a POV jihadist? Am I getting all that? I repsectfully ask agian that you remove the blaot and discuss it here prior to adding it AS you've diected me to do. Please remain civil.22:04, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure what your point is. Why don't you try suggesting something relating to content (not simply removing useful information)? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 22:08, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Title</span></h2>
<p>One or two of the main "theories" state that the landings <i>did</i> occur, so there is clearly no consensus among the hoaxsters. So, how about this, or something like it, as this article's title? <b>Apollo program alternative theories</b>. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:26, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, pedantically speaking, I believe the guy who claims the landings did occur but that gravity was four times higher than accepted claims that the video footage of the landing was faked to pretend that gravity wasn't any higher than we thought. BTW, it might be worth pointing out that many (if not most) of these people have had to self-publish, presumably because no publisher would touch it... I believe he's a case in point. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 23:35, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks to the Internet (and especially to this page) any yahoo can self-publish... up to a point. Anyway, that title came to me as being neutral and non-inflammatory. "hoax accusations" and "conspiracy theories" and "Apollo shills" and "Bill Kaysing shills" just don't quite cut it. Maybe someone will go for this one, or something like it; or at least maybe everyone will disagree with it, so they'll have <i>some</i> common ground. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:43, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe the title, <b>Apollo program alternative theories,</b>is an example of false balance as it implies parity between the generally accepted historical record and the conspiracy theories. As far as sources go, I agree with Mark. We should point out the various issues with all of the sources. Since the treatment of evidence seems to be a central argument, I think there should be a blanket statement about the veracity of the sources briefly explaining the POVs of 'both' sides. i.e. NASA faked the evidence vs. the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historiography.html" title="Historiography">Historiography</a>. See the&#160;::introduction of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> for an excellent treatment of a similar problem of evidence. I think this statement should be added to the skanty introduction and the 'Burden of proof' section removed entirely.</p>
<p>Look at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> as well as a good way to structure the 'top' of this article to make for a good short introduction to the topic. Then we can trail off into the swamp if you want. 70.160.231.246 00:02, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You've got an excellent point, the article title gives more legitimacy to the "Apollo skeptics" than it deserves, but at least it doesn't contain any "pejorative" words, I don't think. Although there are some comparisons to be made, Holocaust denial is largely confined to neo-Nazis, and there are few (even the Apollo skeptics) who would argue that Holocaust denial is anything other than patently offensive. This is more of an argument about whether the government, which couldn't even hide a third-rate burglary, could somehow pull off faking the space program. As I said, maybe there could be a better title... maybe "<i>Challenges</i> to the official Apollo history", or something hopefully less wordy. "Apollo denial" is very succinct, but I don't think they would buy into it. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:07, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>the term conspiracy theory is not inherently perjorative. it is simply descriptive in the case of this topic. 70.160.231.246 02:28, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To the hoax proponents, it is a hot-button issue. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:40, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>understood and beside the point. This is not a soapboax or a vanity page. it is widely understood as a conspiracy theory and should be labeled as such 70.160.48.35 11:45, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Theoretically it's beside the point, but in practice it will unleash further edit wars. Read all the junk on this page and you might see what I'm getting at. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:43, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Wahkeenah's entirely correct, except that the point runs even deeper than the title. The problem here is not going to be solved by clever naming; it'll be solved by getting the <i>editorial framing</i> of the content structured in a way which acknowledges the inevitable onslaught of opinion it will always attract - not always from the most patient or 'housetrained' wikipedians. Hence my 'stuck record' insistence that we consider how other touchy issues are handled <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">elsewhere</a> on the 'pedia, to see how other editors maintain articles which might suffer as this one has.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm proposing we should keep this article to an account of the accusations in <i>one dimension only</i> - the <b>fact</b> of their existence, as a cultural phenomenon: That's the only aspect of them that is accepted as common ground between Apollo deniers and Apollo defenders - that they are out there, and have a certain history, key individuals, popular resonances, etc. We can join together to tell that story entirely neutrally. Put the substance of the arguments elsewhere, and make it VERY clear in a top-note to the discussion page that contributors wishing to engage in the specific arguments should do so under the "Examination of the claims ... " article. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 20:46, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
