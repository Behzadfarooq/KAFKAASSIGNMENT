<p>I forgot about Helios. When was Apollo equated with Helios? --<a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Sanger_037d.html" title="Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a></p>
<hr />
<p>In standard mythology, Apollo and Dionysius are not brothers; they are half-brothers, but then so are Apollo and Ares, Apollo and Hermes, Apollo and almost half the gods out there. The idea that the two are complementary is not in the mainstream of mythology, and so probably stems from one of the mystery cults, in which case the source should be attributed, since there are often considerable differences in these (e.g. Dionysius and the Titans). Nothing I have ever seen suggests Dionysius has anything to do with Delphi, so that probably should be attributed as well. Besides, I'm interested to know!</p>
<dl>
<dd>The tomb of Dionysius was acually inside the adyton of the Apollo temple at Delphi. Clea, Priestess to Apollo, lead the secret Dionysian rites from Delphi to the Korykian cave, 7 miles up the slope of Mount Parnassos, in the winter months when Apollo was said to be absent from Delphi. Men were not allowed to witness these women's rites, altough some are thought to have been chosen for the role of satyrs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nietzsche in "The Birth of Tragedy" traced the genius of Greek culture to the tension between these two divinities.</dd>

<p>Why is it necessary to parenthetically disambiguate the god when all the other uses of the term "Apollo" have natural disambiguators? The god doesn't have a natural disambuguator so I say the article on the god should be at <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo.html" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> and at the top of that article there should be a disambiguation block. Unless somebody gives me a good reason not to I will do this myself. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm, you're right, I hadn't seen that (fixed all links now). However, it was apparently decided earlier that none of the Apollos has preference over the others. In that case, non of the article "deserves" to be here, and we need parens to disambiguate the god as well. We could change all that of course... <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheijmans_2d7f.html" title="User:Jheijmans">Jeronimo</a></dd>

<dd>The links you changed aren't that important -- they can as-is for now. BTW, finding natural disambiguators shouldn't cloud judgement -- the previous decision on what to do with this page was made before the idea of disambiguation blocks was developed. Now this page can be both and article <i>and</i> a disambiguation page (the planets are really the only poster children of full disambiguation -- there is no way to naturally disambiguate the gods from the planets and this results in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars_%28god%29.html" title="Mars (god)">Mars</a> being a full disambiguation page). --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>

<dd>I agree that this page should really be about the god.

<p>What's the "good" spelling: 'Archegetes' or 'Archigetes', 'Lukeios' or 'Lyceios'? Should we mention 'Pythian Apollo' or 'Apollo Pythios'? -- <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELooxix_ce1b.html" title="User:Looxix">looxix</a> 00:35 Mar 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Talk%7EApollo_80c5.html" title="Edit section: Origin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origin</span></h2>
<p>There is a whole section missing on Apollo's origins</p>
<p>For example it appears that both Greek and Etruscan Apollo's came during the archaic period (from 1,100 BCE till 800 BCE) from Anatolian. Homer has him on the side of the Trojans and he has close affiliations with Luwian Apaliuna, who in turn seems to have travelled west from further east. Late Bronze Age (from 1,700 - 1,200 BCE) Hittite and Hurrian "Aplu", like Homeric Apollo, was a God of the Plague, and resembles the mouse God Apollo Smitheus. Here we have a case where a God originally of the Plague was invoked to end illness, merging over time through fusion with the Mycenaean "doctor" God Paieon, PA-JA-WO in Linear B. Paean, in Homer, was the Greek physician of the gods. In other writers the word is a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of healing, but it is now known from Linear B that Paean was originally a separate Deity who over time became merely an aspect of Apollo.</p>
<p>Homer left the question unanswered, whilst Hesiod separated the two, and in later poetry Paean was invoked independently as a health god. It is equally difficult to discover the relation between Paean or Paeon in the sense of "healer" and Paean in the sense of "song." It was believed to refer to the ancient association between the healing craft and the singing of spells, but here we see a shift from the concerns to the original sense of "healer" gradually giving way to that of "hymn," from the phrase Ιή Παιάν.</p>
<p>Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo, and afterwards to other gods, Dionysus, Helios, Asclepius. About the 4th century the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune, or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. Its connection with Apollo as the slayer of the Python led to its association with battle and victory; hence it became the custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.</p>
<p>Hurrian Aplu itself seems derived from the Babylonian "Aplu" meaning a "son of" - a title that was given to the Babylonian plague God, Nergal (son of Enlil)! Apollo's links with Oracles again seem to be associated with wishing to know the outcome of a personal illness. Looking at the ancient oracular shrines to Apollo from the oldest to the youngest we find</p>
<ul>
<li>In Didyma, an oracle on the Asiatic Coast of Anatolia, South West of Lydian (Luwian) Sardis the Branchidae priests drank from a healing spring located in the temple</li>
<li>In Hieropolis, Asia Minor, priests breathed in vapours that for small animals were highly poisonous. They used to throw small animals and birds into the Plutonium, named after Pluto - the god of death and the underworld.</li>
<li>In Delos, there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo.</li>
<li>In Corinth, from the town of Tenea, from prisonners supposedly taken in the Trojan War</li>
<li>In Bassae in the Peloponnese</li>
<li>In Abae, near Delphi, all had Apollonian oracles</li>
<li>In Delphi, the Pythia became filled with the pneuma of Apollo, said to come from a spring inside the Adyton.</li>
<li>At Claros, on the west coast of Greece, like Delphi had a holy spring which gave of a pneuma, from which the priests drank.</li>
<li>In Segesta in Sicily, the latest of the series, was another oracle of Apollo, seized originally from Gaia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oracles were also given supposedly by sons of Apollo</p>
<ul>
<li>In Oropus, north of Athens, the oracle Amphiaraus, was said to be the son of Apollo</li>
<li>in Labadea, 20 miles east of Delphi, Trophonius, another son of Apollo, killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also consulted as an oracle.</li>

<p>In Homer Apollo appears only as the god of prophecy, the sender of plagues, and sometimes as a warrior, but elsewhere as exercising the most varied functions. He is the god of agriculture, specially connected with <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristaeus.html" title="Aristaeus">Aristaeus</a>, which, originally a mere epithet, became an independent personality (see, however, Farnell, <i>Cults of the Greek States</i>, iv. 123). This side of his character is clearly expressed in the titles <i>Sitalcas</i> ("protector of corn"); <i>Erythibius</i> ("preventer of blight"); <i>Parnopius</i> ("destroyer of locusts"); <i>Smintheus</i> ("destroyer of mice"), in which, however, some modern inquirers see a totemistic significance (<i>e.g</i>. A. Lang, "Apollo and the Mouse," in <i>Custom and Myth</i>, p. 101; against this, W. W. Fowler, in <i>Classical Review</i>, November 1892); <i>Erithius</i> ("god of reapers"); and <i>Pasparius</i> ("god of meal"). He is further the god of vegetation generally--<i>Nomios</i>, "god of pastures" (explained, however, by Cicero, as "god of law"), <i>Hersos</i>, "sender of the fertilizing dew." Valleys and groves are under his protection, unless the epithets <i>Napaeus</i> and <i>Hylates</i> belong to a more primitive aspect of the god as supporting himself by the chase, and roaming the glades and forests in pursuit of prey. Certain trees and plants, especially the laurel, were sacred to him. As the god of agriculture and vegetation he is naturally connected with the course of the year and the arrangement of the seasons, so important in farming operations, and becomes the orderer of time (<i>Horomedon</i>, "ruler of the seasons"), and frequently appears on monuments in company with the Horae.</p>
<p>Apollo is also the protector of cattle and herds, hence <i>Poimnius</i> ("god of flocks"), <i>Tragius</i> ("of goats"), <i>Kereatas</i> ("of horned animals"). <i>Carneius</i> (probably "horned") is considered by some to be a pre-Dorian god of cattle, also connected with harvest operations, whose cult was grafted on to that of Apollo; by others, to have been originally an epithet of Apollo, afterwards detached as a separate personality (Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, iv. p. 131). The epithet <i>Maleatas</i>, which, as the quantity of the first vowel (ă) shows, (The authority for the quantity is Isyllus.) cannot mean god of "sheep" or "the apple-tree," is probably a local adjective derived from Malea (perhaps Cape Malea), and may refer to an originally distinct personality, subsequently merged in that of Apollo (see below). Apollo himself is spoken of as a keeper of flocks, and the legends of his service as a herdsman with Laomedon and Admetus point in the same direction. Here probably also is to be referred the epithet <i>Lyceius</i>, which, formerly connected with λυκ- ("shine") and used to support the conception of Apollo as a light-god, is now generally referred to λυκος ("wolf") and explained as he who keeps away the wolves from the flock (cf. λυκοεργος, λυκοκτονος). In accordance with this, the epithet λυκηγενης will not mean "born of" or "begetting light," but rather "born from the she-wolf," in which form Leto herself was said to have been conducted by wolves to Delos. The consecration of the wolf to Apollo is probably the relic of an ancient totemistic religion (Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, i. 41; W. Robertson Smith, <i>Religion of the Semites</i>, new ed., 1894, p. 226).</p>
<p>With the care of the fruits of the earth and the lower animals is associated that of the highest animal, man, especially the youth on his passage to manhood. As such Apollo is κουροτροφος ("rearer of boys") and patron of the palaestra. In many places gymnastic contests form a feature of his festivals, and he himself is proficient in athletic exercises (εναγωνιος). Thus he was supposed to be the first victor at the Olympic games; he overcomes Hermes in the foot-race, and Ares in boxing.</p>
<p>The transition is easy to Apollo as a warlike god; in fact, the earlier legends represent him as engaged in strife with Python, Tityus, the Cyclopes and the Aloidae. He is <i>Boëdromios</i> ("the helper"), <i>Eleleus</i> ("god of the war-cry"), and the Paean was said to have been originally a song of triumph composed by him after his victory over Python. In Homer he frequently appears on the field, like Ares and Athene, bearing the aegis to frighten the foe. This aspect is confirmed by the epithets <i>Argyrotoxos</i> ("god of the silver bow"), <i>Hecatebolos</i> ("the shooter from afar"), <i>Chrysaoros</i> ("wearer of the golden sword"), and his statues are often equipped with the accoutrements of war. (Hence some have derived "Apollo" from απomicron;λλυναι, "to destroy.")</p>
<p>The fame of the Pythian oracle at Delphi, connected with the slaying of Python by the god immediately after his birth, gave especial prominence to the idea of Apollo as a god of prophecy. Python, always represented in the form of a snake, sometimes nameless, is the symbol of the old chthonian divinity whose home was the place of "enquiry" (πυθεσθαι). When Apollo Delphinius with his worshippers from Crete took possession of the earth-oracle Python, he received in consequence the name Pythius. That Python was no fearful monster, symbolizing the darkness of winter which is scattered by the advent of spring, is shown by the fact that Apollo was considered to have been guilty of murder in slaying it, and compelled to wander for a term of years and expiate his crime by servitude and purification. Possibly at Delphi and other places there was an old serpent-worship ousted by that of Apollo, which may account for expiation for the slaying of Python being considered necessary. In the solar explanation, the serpent is the darkness driven away by the rays of the sun. (On the Delphian cult of Apollo and its political significance, see <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphictyony.html" title="Amphictyony">Amphictyony</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delphi.html" title="Delphi">Delphi</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oracle.html" title="Oracle">Oracle</a>; and Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, iv. pp. 179-218.) Oracular responses were also given at Claros near Colophon in Ionia by means of the wdter of a spring which inspired those who drank of it; at Patara in Lycia; and at Didyma near Miletus through the priestly family of the Branchidae. Apollo's oracles, which he did not deliver on his own initiative but as the mouthpiece of Zeus, were infallible, but the human mind was not always able to grasp their meaning; hence he is called <i>Loxias</i> ("crooked," "ambiguous"). To certain favoured mortals he communicated the gift of prophecy (Cassandra, the Cumaean sibyl, Helenus, Melampus and Epimenides). Although his favourite method was by word of mouth, yet signs were sometimes used; thus Calchas interpreted the flight of birds; burning offerings, sacrificial barley, the arrow of the god, dreams and the lot, all played their part in communicating the will of the gods.</p>
<p>Closely connected with the god of oracles was the god of the healing art, the oracle being frequently consulted in cases of sickness. These two functions are indicated by the titles <i>Iatromantis</i> ("physician and seer") and <i>Oulios</i>, probably meaning "health-giving" (so Suidas) rather than "destructive." This side of Apollo's character does not appear in Homer, where Paieon is mentioned as the physician of the gods. Here again, as in the case of Aristaeus and Carneius, the question arises whether Paean (or Paeon) was originally an epithet of Apollo, subsequently developed into an independent personality, or an independent deity merged in the later arrival (Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, iv. p. 234). According to Wilamowitz-Möllendorff in his edition of Isyllus, the epithet Maleatas alluded to above is also connected with the functions of the healing god, imported into Athens in the 4th century B.C. with other well-known health divinities. In this connexion, it is said to mean the "gentle one," who gave his name to the rock Malion or Maleas (O. Gruppe, <i>Griechische Mythologie</i>, ii. 1442) on the Gortynian coast. Apollo is further supposed to be the father of Asclepius (Aesculapius), whose ritual is closely modelled upon his. The healing god could also prevent disease and misfortune of all kinds: hence he is αλεξικακος ("averter of evil") and αποτροπαιος. Further, he is able to purify the guilty and to cleanse from sin (here some refer the epithet ιατρομαντις, in the sense of "physician of the soul"). Such a task can be fitly undertaken by Apollo, since he himself underwent purification after slaying Python. According to the Delphic legend, this took place in the laurel grove of Tempe, and after nine years of penance the god returned, as was represented in the festival called Stepterion or Septerion (see A. Mommsen, <i>Delphika</i>, 1878). Thus the old law of blood for blood, which only perpetuated the crime from generation to generation, gave way to the milder idea of the expiatory power of atonement for murder (cf. the court called τ&amp;omicron επι Δελφινιω at Athens, which retained jurisdiction in cases where justifiable homicide was pleaded).</p>
<p>The same element of enthusiasm that affects the priestess of the oracle at Delphi produces song and music. The close connexion between prophecy and song is indicated in Homer (<i>Odyssey</i>, viii. 488), where Odysseus suggests that the lay of the fall of Troy by Demodocus was inspired by Apollo or the Muse. The metrical form of the oracular responses at Delphi, the important part played by the paean and the Pythian nomos in his ritual, contributed to make Apollo a god of song and music, friend and leader of the Muses (μουσαγετης). He plays the lyre at the banquets of the gods, and causes Marsyas to be flayed alive because he had boasted of his superior skill in playing the flute, and the ears of Midas to grow long because he had declared in favour of Pan, who contended that the flute was a better instrument than Apollo's favourite, the lyre.</p>
<p>A less important aspect of Apollo is that of a marine deity, due to the spread of his cult to the Greek colonies and islands. As such, his commonest name is <i>Delphinius</i>, the "dolphin god," in whose honour the festival Delphinia was celebrated in Attica. This cult probably originated in Crete, whence the god in the form of a dolphin led his Cretan worshippers to the Delphian shore, where he bade them erect an altar in his honour. He is <i>Epibaterius</i> and <i>Apobaterius</i> ("embarker" and "disembarker"), <i>Nasiotas</i> ("the islander"), <i>Euryalus</i> ("god of the broad sea"). Like Poseidon, he looks forth over his watery kingdom from lofty cliffs and promontories (ακταιος, and perhaps ακριτας).</p>
<p>These maritime cults of Apollo are probably due to his importance as the god of colonization, who accompanied emigrants on their voyage. As such he is αγητωρ ("leader"), οικιστης ("founder"), δωματιτης ("god of the home"). As <i>Agyieus</i> ("god of streets and ways"), in the form of a stone pillar with painted head, placed before the doors of houses, he let in the good and kept out the evil (see Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, iv. p. 150, who takes Agyieus to mean "leader"); on the epithet <i>Prostaterius</i>, he who "stands before the house," hence "protector," see G. M. Hirst in <i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i>, xxii. (1902). Lastly, as the originator and protector of civil order, Apollo was regarded as the founder of cities and legislation. Thus, at Athens, Apollo <i>Patroös</i> was known as the protector of the lonians, and the Spartans referred the institutions of Lycurgus to the Delphic oracle.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned above that W. H. Roscher, in the article "Apollo" in his <i>Lexikon der Mythologie</i>, derives all the aspects and functions of Apollo from the conception of an original light- and sun-god. The chief objections to this are the following. It cannot be shown that on <i>Greek</i> soil Apollo originally had the meaning of a sun-god; in Homer, Aeschylus and Plato, the sun-god Helios is distinctly separated from Phoebus Apollo; the constant epithet Φοιβος, usually explained as the brightness of the sun, may equally well refer to his physical beauty or moral purity; λυκηγενης has already been noticed. It is not until the beginning of the 5th century B.C. that the identification makes its appearance. The first literary evidence is a fragment of Euripides (<i>Phaëthon</i>), in which it is especially characterized as an innovation. The idea was taken up by the Stoics, and in the Roman period generally accepted. But the fact of the gradual development of Apollo as a god of light and heaven, and his identification with foreign sun-gods, is no proof of an original Greek solar conception of him. Apollo-Helios must be regarded as "a late by-product of Greek religion" (Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, iv. p. 136; Wernicke in Pauly-Wissowa's <i>Realencydopädie</i>). For the manner in which the solar theory is developed, reference must be made to Roscher's article, but one legend may here be mentioned, since it helps to trace the spread of the cult of the god. It was said that Apollo soon after his birth spent a year amongst the Hyperboreans, who dwelt in a land of perpetual sunshine, before his return to Delphi. This return is explained as the second birth of the god and his victory over the powers of winter; the name Hyperboreans is explained as the "dwellers beyond the north wind." This interpretation is now, however, generally rejected in favour of that of H. L. Ahrens,--that Hyperborei is identical with the Perphereës ("the carriers"), who are described as the servants of Apollo, carriers of cereal offerings from one community to another (Herodotus iv. 33). This would point to the fact that certain settlements of Apolline worship along the northernmost border of Greece (Illyria, Thrace, Macedonia) were in the habit of sending offerings to the god to a centre of his worship farther south (probably Delphi), advancing by the route from Tempe through Thessaly, Pherae and Doris to Delphi; while others adopted the route through Illyria, Epirus, Dodona, the Malian gulf, Carystus in Euboea, and Tenos to Delos (Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, iv. p. 100).</p>
<p>Apollo was represented more frequently than any other deity in ancient art. As Apollo Agyieus he was shown by a simple conic pillar; the Apollo of Amyclae was a pillar of bronze surmounted by a helmeted head, with extended arms carrying lance and bow. There were also rude idols of him in wood (<i>xoana</i>), in which the human form was scarcely recognizable. In the 6th century, his statues of stone were naked, stiff and rigid in attitude, shoulders square, limbs strong and broad, hair falling down the back. In the riper period of art the type is softer, and Apollo appears in a form which seeks to combine manhood and eternal youth. His long hair is usually tied in a large knot above his forehead. The most famous statue of him is the Apollo Belvidere in the Vatican (found at Frascati, 1455), an imitation belonging to the early imperial period of a bronze statue representing him, with aegis in his left hand, driving back the Gauls from his temple at Delphi (279 B.C.), or, according to another view, fighting with the Pythian dragon. In the Apollo Citharoedus or Musagetes in the Vatican, he is crowned with laurel and wears the long, flowing robe of the Ionic bard, and his form is almost feminine in its fulness; in a statue at Rome of the older and more vigorous type he is naked and holds a lyre in his left hand; his right arm rests upon his head, and a griffin is seated at his side. The Apollo Sauroctonus (after Praxiteles), copied in bronze at the Villa Albani in Rome and in marble at Paris, is a naked, youthful, almost boyish figure, leaning against a tree, waiting to strike a lizard climbing up the trunk. The gigantic statue of Helios (the sun-god), "the colossus of Rhodes," by Chares of Lindus, celebrated.as one of the seven wonders of the world, is unknown to us. Bas-reliefs and painted vases reproduce the contests of Apollo with Tityus, Marsyas, and Heracles, the slaughter of the daughters of Niobe, and other incidents in his life.</p>

<p>Apollyon was the name of the destroyer unleashed at the Tribulation. Some have seen links to this name and Apollon (supposedly, the pit was an allusian to a ritual which involved digging into the Earth to uncover the fallen Sun, which Apollo is supposed to represent). Can somebody give some feedback on this and determined if this and any subsequnt information is worth mention in the article? -- <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeArchos_b85c.html" title="User:IdeArchos">IdeArchos</a> 17:36, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just cleaned up Acesius which had this information about Apollo. Really Apollo should be discussed here rather than there. I think putting the info at the end of attribution was the best I could do, but an Apollo expert might want to clean it up, cut any duplication, and integrate it better if it is worth keeping. -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 02:43, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How should we have recognized the following snippet, intruded by User:76.16.246.114, 3 February 2007, as bogus?</p>

<dd>"It is also said that Apollo played a magical string made of the finest silk. It is said that it was given to him by Hermes on the Mountain of Tomoluese. This magical string created melodic tunes that were so powerful that anyone who heard it would fall into a trance."</dd>
</dl>
<p>By the unsourced "it is said", by "played a string" rather than his cithara, by the false note of "silk" which is Chinese and unknown in Greece, let alone myth, and by the second-hand echo of Orpheus applied to Apollo. Let's pay closer critical attention.--<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 10:59, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've added the reference to my source at the end of the introductory paragraph, and I've listed the book under modern references at the end of the article.

<dd>T@nn, thanks for supplying the reference. If your source has any more information about these epithets/titles, it would be great to put it in the article. For instance, take the statement "Apollo Virotutis was worshipped, among other places, at Fins d'Annecy (Haute-Savoire) and at Jublains (Maine-et-Loire)". How do we know these things? Is there a passage in an ancient author that says this? If so, we should be told who. Or does this information come from an inscription? In that case, the article should be precise about the inscription.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, if you don't have convenient access to more precise information, I wouldn't worry about it too much--it's not as if the rest of the article is very precise about its sourcing. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 16:05, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
