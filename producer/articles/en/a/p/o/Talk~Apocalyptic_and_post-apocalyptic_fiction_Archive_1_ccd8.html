	    <p>Renamed the section on war to just war, since some of them do not feature nuclear war, but retained the link (akira is non nuclear: world war three being fought by powerful psychcs and blamed on nuclear weapons, and mad max is due to social decline: should be moved) also moved Tank Girl: in the movie it was a comet that boiled the earth seas off.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wrong on <i>Akira</i> and <i>Mad Max</i>. The Akira's awakening starts WW3, which the two superpowers in 1988 believe is a nuclear strike and respond with nuclear weapons (there's even an storyboarded scene for the film that shows WW3 in detail, with leaders being waken in the middle of the night, to nuclear weapons being launched from submarines and bombers, and chemical and conventional warfare). Outside of Akira and the other 3 number children, there isn't another psychic until Tetsuo and Kei. The oil crisis in <i>Mad Max</i> descends into WW3. In fact, the "great fire" is mentioned in <i>Beyond Thunderdome</i> by the oasis children is a nuclear explosion.</dd>

<dd>However, I kinda accept the change. I would rather have <i>World War III or other wars</i>.

<p>as far as a category for Zardoz, how about 'societal bifurcation', in which the society splits, a bit like the HGWells Time Machine, Eloi and Morlocks etc I'm sure there must be other examples of this in SF. <a href="../../../f/o/j/User%7EFojxl_a242.html" title="User:Fojxl">fojxl</a> 01:25 Apr 4, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I understand it, the categories relate to the type of apocalypse that the story is post-.

<hr />
<p>I'm wondering: after looking at the Vampire Hunter D entry, I recall there's a lot of Japanese pop culture, especially anime and manga, that deals with apocalyptic fiction, almost too many to count. The ones I can name of the top of my head are Akira, Fist of the North Star, Evangelion, Grey, Appleseed, Ghost In The Shell, Battle Angel Alita/Gunnm, and that's already getting to be a long list.</p>
<p>I've avoided putting them since there's more than this and plenty that make references to total devastation (For example, Macross' second half, where Misa and Hikaru tour a battle-scarred Earth that looks very similar to Hiroshima after the bomb). I only included Dragon Head and Last Days of Planet Earth as they're live action films. I'm wondering how to continue, just add more anime titles until it chokes the page, keep it to famous and direct (i.e. definite mentions of WW3, etc. in the story) examples, or leave them out. I'd rather not excise them completely, as apocalyptic literature and imagery is such a common occurance in Japanese manga, anime and cinema.</p>
<p>Also, I think DADES's example should be limited to WW3, and not Pandemic. The plague that kills the owls (amongst other creatures) mentioned in the book is part of WW3, perhaps as a biological weapons hazarded by both sides, in addition to the Synthetic Freedom Fighters and nuclear weapons. Also, the war is not mentioned in Blade Runner, just the source material, it seems. --<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungFreud_9a6b.html" title="User:YoungFreud">YoungFreud</a> 04:15, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

These two seem cyberpunk to me, and I didn't recognize GitS as post-apocalyptic. I also encountered someone referring to <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_808a.html" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brave_New_World_b07b.html" title="Brave New World">Brave New World</a> as cyberpunk, which I think is too far reaching. -- Claw 21:34, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't consider apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic fiction a subgenre of cyberpunk. I think they share some elements, but in and of itself, post-apocalyptic fiction is a seperate entity from cyberpunk. Many cyberpunk genre stories use post-apocalyptic settings, but many post-apocalyptic stories don't use cyberpunk genre elements.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I mentioned GITS, since, IIRC, the manga and the GITS:SAC both take place after World War III (I believe mentioned by name in the book, and just mentioned as "the war" in the SAC episode "Jungle Cruise"), although WWIII is not as final as everyone thought it would turn out (I think the only real evidence of major damage is balkanization of many countries, excluding Japan, Britian, and perhaps the US, and the formation of new ones like the Gavel Republic and Genova), so I wouldn't really include that as a post-apocalyptic title, now that you mention it. Appleseed, Shirow's other famous story, OTOH, concerns efforts by a biological androids' and their human masters/servants' attempt to bring order to the world following a <b>series</b> of devastating world wars, so it would probably should be included. Gunnm is very much both post-apocalyptic, in that it has the visual and thematic references, and cyberpunk. However, I would probably have to rewrite a section, "After the fall of space civilization", to include "or neglect from space civilization", to take in account the Last Order chapter, which has a thriving transhumanity from Earth orbit, all the way out to Jupiter but has all but forgotten the lives of the inhabitants on Earth's surface, save an elite few. --<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungFreud_9a6b.html" title="User:YoungFreud">YoungFreud</a> 01:34, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can we change the article focus from "science fiction" to just "fiction"? There are works here that are not "science fiction", and there are a lot of fictional works that deal with the end of Civilization. Currently a lot of articles link to <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_the_world.html" title="End of the world">End of the world</a> and they need disambiguation, this article seems the appropriate place to link in to on any subject dealing with fictional ends of the world (civilization), could be covered in this article, not just science fiction.

<dd>Can't most works of apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic fiction be considered a form of science fiction? or at least <a href="../../../s/o/f/Soft_science_fiction.html" title="Soft science fiction">soft science fiction</a>?</dd>
<dd>Even many 'fantasy' novels that fall into the post-apocalyptic category, such as the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wheel_of_Time_a73a.html" title="The Wheel of Time">Wheel of Time</a> when relating to past events, mention science fiction veriety flying cars and weapons, as well as other technology.</dd>
<dd>One series I have read (<a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Wolfe_0963.html" title="Gene Wolfe">Gene Wolfe</a>'s "The Book of the New Sun" progresses. The first book is a 'fantasy' novel. As the post-apocalyptic nature of the world is further revieled, the series becomes 'science fantasy' and finally 'science fiction'.</dd>
<dd>Those cases in which the world (or civilization) is harmed by magical, or other non-science fiction circumstances are rare, from what I've seen. The closest thing I can think of, are <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chronicles_of_Thomas_Covenant_e67f.html" title="The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant">The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant</a> but that is another world that is destroyed, not Earth or her people.</dd>
<dd>Also; apocalypse does occur in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." But (from what I recall) it is mentioned sparingly. And (notwithstanding the plot point in which it occurs) effects the plot little. Should it truly be considered a work of apocalyptic science fiction? Depherios 11:57, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a link to an off-site page here, promoting the book "Full Circle" by an author named Boyle. The link goes to an URL also by a person whose last name is Boyle, apparently a relative (or perhaps the same as the author). This seems to go against the rules about promoting oneself. The book is published by controversial press <a href="../../../p/u/b/PublishAmerica_23f8.html" title="PublishAmerica">PublishAmerica</a> as well. I also understand from the website project that pages on geocities.com, etc. are being considered for removal. Would it be instead appropriate if there were a Wiki article, written by a third party, regarding the book and its plot? 67.10.131.229 5 July 2005 21:34 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, it's bugged me for the longest time. I think that if the book or movie or story has no page, it should simply be left italicized. I also believe that there should be no outside links in an article, unless it's footnotes, source, or external links. I do think you're right in that it's a self-promotion, especially in light of the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_press.html" title="Vanity press">vanity press</a> angle that I was unaware about. There was another link like that a few weeks ago, <i>It's Inevitable</i> or something like that, and it was removed recently. I would, in the best spirit of Wikipedia and as a compromise, turn the link into an italicized title or remove it. --<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungFreud_9a6b.html" title="User:YoungFreud">YoungFreud</a> 5 July 2005 23:09 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to discuss how this page can be improved on. One of the items I'm suggesting is an inclusion of general elements of apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction. Basically, it's themes, the politics behind such themes, allegories, cliches, etc.. The inclusion of this list would also act as a criteria for the various lists, as there has been some discussion on whether or not some of the titles mentioned should be listed in this article. I would also like to expand the list titles in some way. The biggest of these would be the World War 3 title heading. I'd like to expand this to "World War 3 and other wars". I would really like to include titles like <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appleseed.html" title="Appleseed">Appleseed</a>, but also include <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> <a href="../../../m/g/m/MGM_7545.html" title="MGM">MGM</a> animated short <i><a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_to_Earth_%281939_cartoon%29_312a.html" title="Peace to Earth (1939 cartoon)">Peace To Earth</a></i> in which all humanity is extinguished in a then-future World War 2.</p>

<p>I agree this should be merged in. At the same time the article should be renamed to somthing more inclusive besides just science fiction.
