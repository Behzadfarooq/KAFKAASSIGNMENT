<p>What is a 24 volt current, as referred to in the section on the Cause of the Accident? I can't decide if this should be 24 volt supply, or if its more complicated. I had a look at this page: <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ap13acc.html" class="external free" title="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ap13acc.html" rel="nofollow">http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ap13acc.html</a> It doesn't mention these figures, but does have some different DC voltages. --<a href="../../../j/p/3/User%7EJp347_43da.html" title="User:Jp347">John</a> 15:19, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

If I had sufficient english skills I would edit the article instead of writing here. Another thing: the paragraph is not totally incorrect, because one timezone more east it was 13:13 at launch time.</p>
<p>The mission starts, ends, etc. were usually listed as Houston time (U.S. Central) and thus it would have been at 13:13 Houston time. (Houston is west, not east, by the way, of the Cape) --</p>

<p>I sort of stumbled upon this article and saw that it (sadly) did not achieve Good Article status. As such, I did what I could to help edit and improve this article. The suggestions above (under "GA Failed") were addressed individually (see notes above). Here are some other small changes I made.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed "cislunar". Cis-lunar means within the lunar orbit, which is clearly not the case for this mission.</li>
<li>Moved reference to "LEM 'lifeboat' procedure" being created to right after first mention of the "lifeboat" scenario.</li>
<li>Fixed inconsistencies between referring to the Lunar Excursion Module as both LEM and LM.</li>
<li>Free Return Trajectory was mentioned in two disjoint places - They are now combined.</li>
<li>Made many other small corrections/copyedits</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
++----------------------------------------++</p>
<p>I added correction to Crew, and gave NASA page as source. The Crew name needs to be actual name, not "nickname", as it gives off the impression of incorrect data, as which I thought it was. Just a suggestion is all.</p>
<ul>
<li>I took out the word "Correction" on the page. It gives the feel of incorrect and conflicting data, which I think you were trying to avoid. Sources go at the bottom of the page.--<a href="../../../r/c/k/User%7ERckmRobot_6328.html" title="User:RckmRobot">Nate</a> 13:07, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I've done some additional cleanup and copyediting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standardized on US English (double quotes for quotations, -ize rather than -ise).</li>
<li>Consistently capitalized Command/Service/Lunar Module.</li>
<li>Replaced "Lunar Excursion Module" and "LEM" with "Lunar Module" and "LM", respectively, to match the article summary.</li>
<li>Eliminated several POV terms.</li>
<li>Clarified a couple of explanations, particularly the cause of the oxygen tank explosion (making it clear that the fire did not ignite the oxygen, it merely heated it up).</li>
<li>Various minor copyedits (punctuation etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Further corrections (or reverts of anything I did that made it worse!) welcome. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchurch_b5b5.html" title="User:Achurch">Achurch</a> 08:01, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just snipped:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the Apollo 13 Command Module was examined after its return, it was found that the crew had tried to wire up a manual deployment switch for the recovery parachutes. However - they had in fact wired the switch to the parachute jettison control. If they had decided to use their jury-rigged manual override they would have in reality released the parachutes from the command module and plunged to their deaths in the ocean below.</li>
</ul>
<p>from the list of mission factoids as I've never heard of that before and it strikes me as quite staggeringly improbable that the crew of 13 would have attempted to rewire the ship's systems without at least a little chat with Houston. Wikipedia's the only place I've ever seen this claim mentioned, so if someone can come up with a cite for it in the reams of NASA documentation available, fine, otherwise, no. --<a href="../../../m/p/k/User%7EMpk_a450.html" title="User:Mpk">Mike</a> 19:12, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>yes, but what was the chemical reaction? Oxygen + something + sparks = exposion. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterGrecian_eb47.html" title="User:PeterGrecian">PeterGrecian</a> 18:49, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, it was not a chemical explosion. As explained (perhaps poorly) in the article, an electrical short-circuit caused a fire which fed on the electrical insulation and heated up the oxygen until the pressure exceeded the limits of the tank. If you want more detail, it's on page 1 of the accident investigation report: maybe that section of the article should be expanded to clarify exactly what happened. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 18:57, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ahh, a short-circuit, an arc, a fire inside the tank, oxygen and the remaining teflon insulator. I can't find the 'accident investigation report' I'm having a look at <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/challenger/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/challenger/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gpoaccess.gov/challenger/index.html</a> <i>The Apollo 13 Accident - (Hearing) U.S. House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Date: 91st Congress, 2nd Session, June 16, 1970</i> to see if I can work it out. It would be great if the article did as you say 'clarify exactly what happened'. Page 49 of the reference suggests it took about 90 seconds from the fans going on to the pannel blowing out. Page 51 suggests that the heat also weakened the tank.

<p>The article currently lists Swigert (CMP) as uttering the initial "I believe we've had a problem here", but the PDF transcript lists CDR (Lovell) as the speaker, at 02:07:55:20. Is there a source for naming Swigert instead? If not, it should be corrected to Lovell. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchurch_b5b5.html" title="User:Achurch">Achurch</a> 15:06, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What I read is that Swigert said the initial, differently-worded quote, which Lovell then repeated in more-or-less the form that has been popularised by media. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37"><b><span style="color:#DF2F2F">Big</span><span style="color:#3F3F3F">Nate</span><span style="color:#DF2F2F">37</span></b></a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">(T)</a></sub> 16:15, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to Lovell's own book, "Lost Moon," Swigert said the first line, and then Lovell said the second. It is very likely that the transcript is in error, as they were prepared very quickly after the event by teams of typists who might not have been expert at recognising astronauts' voices. <a href="../../../m/l/i/User%7EMLilburne_c545.html" title="User:MLilburne">MLilburne</a> 16:34, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, it looks like you're right--there are some scribbles on the side of that page in the transcript, which look like they read read "5/9/70: Per Jack (something) - Swigert reported trouble.

<p>Gentlemen, the second stage of the Saturn V had 3 "J2" engines arranged in a single row. The portion of the article about the pogo occillations of the center engine refers to the "other four" being run longer to compensate for the early shutdown of the center engine. This is incorrect as there were only three engines. I edited the page and it was deleted. Please check the engine configuration of the second stage to confirm.</p>

<dd>[The second, or S-II, stage of Apollo 15's Saturn V vehicle is 24.9 metres tall and is powered by the combustion of LH2 (liquid hydrogen) and LOX <b>in a cluster of five J-2 rocket motors</b> which generate a total thrust of 5,115kN (1.15 million pounds). A million litres of LH2, cooled to -253°C to get it into a liquid state, is loaded into the large, upper tank of the stage while 331,000 litres of LOX is loaded into the smaller, squat tank below. These tanks share a single insulated structure with only an insulated, common bulkhead between them. With both propellants being so cold - LH2 is only 20 degrees above absolute zero - the tanks must be prepared and chilled down before they can be filled.]</dd>
