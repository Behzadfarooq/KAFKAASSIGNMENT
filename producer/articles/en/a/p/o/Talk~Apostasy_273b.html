	    <p>Apostasy in Judaism and Islam Judaism explicitly demands that apostates be stoned to death, as stated in Deut 13, and referenced in Exodus (Moses ordering those praying to the golden calf to be killed). I am also removing the part that states Islam requires apostates to be killed; there is no mention of it in the Quran, and only occurs in the different interpretations of Sharia Law.</p>
<p>66.42.54.89 00:36, 26 February 2007 (UTC) Marcus</p>
<p>I think it is a mistake to assert that there is no mention of this in the Quran. While many of the lines of the Quran used to assert a death penalty for apostasy may have that meaning chiefly from tradition and "scholarship", Sura IV line 89 is... translated, "They desire that you should disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so that you might be (all) alike; therefore take not from among them friends until they fly (their homes) in Allah's way; but if they turn back, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and take not from among them a friend or a helper."</p>
<p>It's only one line, but it's pretty direct.</p>
<p>Further reference: <a href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/dhimmiwatch/archives/001590.php" class="external text" title="http://www.jihadwatch.org/dhimmiwatch/archives/001590.php" rel="nofollow">Paper from a UN Commission on Human Rights panel discussion</a> Gruber76 05:22, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Okay, but why remove the part of apostasy in Judaism? Deut. 13 clearly states that apostates (those who leave Judaism) are to be ritually stoned. I feel that Pro-Jewish wiki users are removing the parts so Judaism will be spared criticism.</p>

<p>There is no apostasy in <i>hinduism</i>. <i>Hinduism</i> is not a defined religion in the first place. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKartheeque_8193.html" title="User:Kartheeque">Kartheeque</a> 06:53, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reference to abandoning Dharma in the Bhagavad Gita has no relation to the apostacy from Hinduism because the Gita mentions Dharma as a Yogic concept. In the Bhagavad Gita Dharma does not mean any religious dharma or Hindu dharma. The reference is therefore misleading. Dharma in its philosophical meaning is about what makes a person into a human being rather than an animal who is ruled by instincts and nature (Prakrti). Human beings are capable of speeding up their return to God (self realisation), so Krishna urges them to follow their human Dharma. If you discuss this as though you are talking about leaving a religion, you are missing the point entirely. Whether you become a Christian or a Buddhist is of no importance, what matters is whether you live as a human being should do, i.e. whether you follow Dharma.<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriesb_fb23.html" title="User:Andriesb">Andriesb</a> 18:26, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I just read the article you mentioned, and I didn't see anywhere in the article that directly connects religious faith and happiness. From the conclusion of the article:</p>
<p>"Religious/spiritual commitment may enhance recovery from depression, serious mental or physical illness, and substance abuse; help curtail suicide; and reduce health risks."</p>
<p>The statement is at best arguable -- I certainly wouldn't classify it as empirical. I think it should be removed. gutzalpus 12:30, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gutzalpus, what about this from the article "Another study of adolescents found that frequent church-goers with high spiritual support had the lowest scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (Wright et al., 1993). " I want to state that do not have any faith at the moment nor do I want to convert anyone, but evidence is evidence, even if we do not like it. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 12:36, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

If the studies say religious faith helps with depression, or that people with religious faith have lower instances of depression, then that is what should be said in the article (or nothing at all on the subject.) The statement in the wiki article implies that people in general have been found to be happier when they have religious faith. However, the studies that you have given were only done on depressed people, which is a subset of the overall population and we can't infer that the results would apply to everyone.</p>
<p>If the statement is left in the article, it should be made more specific based on what you have shown for these studies. Perhaps something along the lines of:</p>
<p>"There is empirical evidence that people who have strong religious faith are less likely to suffer from depression."</p>

<dd>gutzalpus, Okay, I agree that this is more accurate, so feel free to change it. One follows from the other. Lack of depression <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correlation.html" title="Correlation">correlates</a> with happiness so what was written was down was and is a proven and documented fact. I have to admit that the assertion that I wrote down in Wikipedia was based on the several news articles over several years that I remembered. My memory or the journalists may have been inaccurate. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 13:20, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andries, thanks for the reference. With respect to the entry itself, I still don't see the need to include that line in an article about Apostasy. I would find it fine in some article referring to religion in a broader sense, where the positive and/or negative effects of religious faith on health could be discussed.</p>
<p>Now, as regards the content of the sentence being discussed, I disagree with the statement as it is phrased: “people who have strong religious faith and regularly attend church services are happier than people who do not”. In the last article you recommended, under “Potencial Harmful Effects”, it can be read:</p>
<p>“Psychiatry still needs more research and clearer hypotheses in differentiating between the supportive use of religion/spirituality in finding hope, meaning, and a sense of being valued and loved versus harmful beliefs that may manipulate or condemn”. That section of the article also mentions some research into harm on mental health done by religious faith. If lack of depression correlates with happiness, then the opposite correlates with unhappiness, and given that the article provides information about both aspects, the statement becomes invalid.</p>
<p>Lena</p>
<dl>
<dd>Lena, I think the confusion comes from that the summary at the end is the conclusion from that particular study. The sentence "Another study of adolescents found that frequent church-goers with high spiritual support had the lowest scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (Wright et al., 1993). " comes from another study. The empirical evidence about faith makes the statement that losing faith (apostasy) can be a difficult experience more plausible but you may be right that it doesn't belong here. The better reference would be Wright but I do not have online access to this research. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 15:43, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lena, I would have to become a member of a university library to read the Wright study. Or pay for it on the internet.

<p>Your subtopics seem a little questionable. A coerced renunciation of religion doesn't seem like it would properly fit under "apostasy", which connotes an actual turning away from religion, as opposed to a forced renunciation, and I'm not sure how "Apostasy and freedom of religion" fits into anything other than "Apostasy by coercion."

<dd>Coercion (as per apostasy during the Spanish inquisition) and freedom of religion (as a discourse within the context of being able to become an apostate without being thrown to jail or killed) are highly significant to this subject and have are widely studied as such. Before you make an assessment about fitness, you could chose to wait and see if my edits warrant inclusion here or in another article, and if at all. And if you are knowledgeable in the subject, I would appreciate your collaborations.

<dd>Well, your first subtopic is "apostasy <i>by</i> coercion". This would make sense if we were talking about "<a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_conversion.html" title="Religious conversion">religious conversion</a> by coercion", or "renunciation of faith under coercion", because neither "religious conversion" nor "renunciation of faith" connote a fully willed act on the part of the convert/renunciator. "Apostasy", on the other hand, has strong connotations of an illicit act whose guilt falls upon the apostate -- so to suddenly introduce the concept of apostasy as something that someone else can <i>coerce</i> you to commit is, a) changing the concept of apostasy to make it indistinguishable from religious conversion, b) redundant since the article on religious conversion already covers coerced religious conversions. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:39, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Antaeus, most converts to a new religion can also be considered apostates (the other side of the coin of conversion). And yes, most probably both articles will have a lot in common, but still I believe that there is merit in developing this article from this angle. Once this article is developed we can all look at it, and evaluate what to do next. We could attempt a merge, maybe spawning a few pieces out onto their own articles, or we could decide to keep them separate. First things first, this article needs a throrough expansion to become a good article.

<p>Antaeus, what is your opinion on the difference between <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">New religious movement</a>, that warrants an edit (sumarized as <i>rv POV</i> )? --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 01:26, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because the edit which I reverted endorses one of two presuppositions: it either pre-supposes that "cult" and "new religious movement" are the same thing, or that the reliability of the testimonies of apostates is only an important and controversial issue in the study of apostasy in new religious movements, and that in the study of cults it is not an important issue. Neither pre-supposition meets the burden of NPOV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I've explained elsewhere, many of those who study cults view the defining characteristic of the cult as a particular cultic structure; so far from being synonymous with "new religious movement", "cult" in this sense does not even require the organization to be religious or new, nor does being new and religious mean "cult". The edit cannot be justified by a claim that "cult" and "new religious movement" mean the same to everyone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Neither can it be justified by claiming that the reliability of the testimonies of apostates is unimportant in the study of cults; if anything, it is a more important subject. An important part of the cultic structure (which is, again, the defining characteristic of a cult for a substantial number of scholars) is that members are pressured to believe that truth only comes from those higher up in the organization. Members are told that outsiders don't have the truth because they don't have the experience; then they are told that apostates, who had the experience, <i>still</i> don't have the truth because if they did, they never would have left. The edit cannot be justified by saying that the reliability of apostate testimony is <i>not</i> an issue in the study of cults; if it wasn't, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_J._Ryan_6f3d.html" title="Leo J.

<dd>Maria Monk was born as a protestant but then pretended having been a Catholic and criticized Catholicism. This is not apostasy according to the definition which is formal renunciation of one's religion. She critized a religion to which she she never adhered. It would have been apostasy if she had criticized protestantism. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 09:01, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, you pointed out the reason yourself: "<i>if true</i>, a clear case of apostasy."

To put her in a list where she belongs <i>only</i> if her story is true and omit <i>any mention</i> of the high probability that she "lied all the way"?

<p>Bromley never made statements about the reliability of apostates unless they are involved in a countermovement. Hence the `atrocity story´ should go either to Christian Counter Movement or to the Anti-cult movement.

<dd>Zappaz, please provide references for your assertion that apostates of cults are part of the ACM. Times have changed since the internet. Schnabel's dissertation also places Bromley's remarks under ACM. For example, I read this weekend Andre van der Braak's book "Enlightenment Blues. He is an apostate of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Cohen_79a3.html" title="Andrew Cohen">Andrew Cohen</a> and only refers to typical anti-cult literature once. To be excessively sceptical of his testimony is, I think, unfair and insulting <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 18:10, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I refer to the sentence, possibly to more
<dl>

<dd>I understand the issue of generalizations hurts both apostates and members of NRMs, and it is unfair to both sides.

<dd>Regarding your request to support with citacion the assertion that apostates are part of the ACM, I would argue that the opposite is the case. Any one visiting the website of ex-members will see that these groups are indeed part of the ACM and one of the most active ones. Also, mainstream ACM websites base much of their theories on apostate testimonies.

<dd>I will try but I think you are exaggerating by asking references for people like Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Marjoe Gortner, and Augustine. Explicit public strong criticism of core issues and doctrines of one's former faith is de facto apostay. A formal statement of resignation and disillusionment is, I think, often not public and hence not verfiable and in the aformentioned case redundant. [User:Andries|Andries]] 06:16, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Incorrect. There is a clear definition of Apostasy in Wikidictionary and in this article. Notable apostates are those that professed a religion in the first place and then went to formaly renounce it. In this context Carl Marx was <b>not</b> and apostate, Carl Jung was <b>not</b> an apostate. etc. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 15:49, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>Sorry Andries, but this is a no go... Rushdie is not an apostate. It was declared to be one by his enemies. Calling Jung an apostate is unacceptable, same applies to Nietzche. Luther, well that is definitively strange. Where are you getting these ideas, Andries? I have studied apostasy for years and this is the first time I see these people labeled as such! You will need to provide references, or at least <b>attribuitions</b> (see entry for Luther), that these people have been referred to as apostates.

<dd>How does Nietzsche not count as an apostate?

<p>I think that there is a misunderstanding of what Apostasy is, and that is resulting in confusion about who is a "notable apostate".</p>
<p>See some of the definitions of Apostate/Apostasy:</p>
<ol>
<li>deserter, apostate, renegade, turncoat, recreant, ratter -- (a disloyal person who betrays or deserts his cause or religion or political party or friend etc.) Not faithful to religion or party or cause. <i>Princeton's WordNet search</i>. <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn2.0?stage=1&amp;word=apostate" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn2.0?stage=1&amp;word=apostate" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>From the Greek apo - histanai ("depart from a stand.") A person who was once affiliated with a faith group, but has since "fallen away" and left the group. One group's apostate is generally another group's convert. Very severe penalties exist in some countries of the world against individuals who abandon the state religion in favor of another faith. It can theoretically mean execution in some Islamic countries. The Roman Catholic church stopped burning European apostates at the stake in 1792 CE. <i>Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance</i> <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/gl_a1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/gl_a1.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
<li>(1)&#160;: renunciation of a religious faith (2): abandonment of a previous loyalty&#160;: DEFECTION - Merriam Webster</li>
<li>apostate:One who is guilty of desertion of one's faith, religion, party, or principles. <i>Theological Dictionary</i> <a href="http://www.innvista.com/culture/religion/diction.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.innvista.com/culture/religion/diction.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>
<li>The falling away from the faith. It is a revolt against the truth of God’s word by a believer. It can also describe a group or church organization that has "fallen away" from the truths of Christianity as revealed in the Bible. <i>Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry</i> <a href="http://www.carm.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.carm.org/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>
</ol>
<p><br />
So ... to be notable, it is necessary that the person:</p>
<ol>
<li>had a strong involvement in the religion/belief/liturgy/community</li>
<li>renounced that religion/belief/liturgy/community in a formal manner</li>
<li>became public about his/her renunciaion of the prior religion in such as manner as to attract the label of apostate</li>
</ol>
<p>With the above in mind, Rushdie is an apostate in the eyes of devote muslims. That does not apply to Marx, Jung or Nietzsche (at least I have yet to come across such a label in regard to these illustrious Germans). --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 04:14, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Zappaz, notable can also mean influential. Ambedkar is about the most influential apostate that I can think of. I can not understand the steps you are making from the definitions to the meaning that you give to "notable". From the same defintions, I could also argue that someone is a notable apostate if
<ol>
<li>s/he has followed a religion and then publicly criticized it in such a way that there can be no doubt that the person does no longer follows the religion</li>
<li>and attracted attention by this criticism or had a notable influence on society with his defection.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Or
<ul>
<li>Has been referred to as an apostate by his critics, though the person may not accept this label.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Besides, as far as I know, the word apostate is quite unusual and somewhat pejorative which means that it is difficult to find a respected person labelled as an apostate even if s/he clearly fits the definition, such as Augustine. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 06:46, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the section on NRM's has become too large and I want to merge most of it into the page for Opposition to NRM's where it really belongs ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_cults_and_new_religious_movements" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_cults_and_new_religious_movements" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_cults_and_new_religious_movements</a> ).

<p>I do not think that this article contains the gist of Bromley's and Shupe's work on the subject but a selective quote that suits people who want to discredit the tesimonies of apostates. I think they write more about interpretations of facts and the influence of society on this interpretation. They generally do not doubt the facts in the testimonies of apostates. I have not read enough by Bromley and Shupe to be sure though. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 05:25, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that the current version presents an uninformative view of the matter. What is the reader to think when he is presented with strongly opposing POVs? Instead, the article should focus on the societal influences on apostates, instead of presenting opposing POVs about their reliability. (Apart from that, it will be clear that I think that generalizations about such a diverse group of people are crazy and highly insulting, comparable to statements by scholars that e.g. American people can't be trusted.) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 13:06, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not insulting to me.The reliability (or lack thereof) of apostate testimony is a field of study in the domain of new religious movement. I do not see the reason for censoring it from Wikipedia. On the contrary. If a notable enough group of people believe that American people can't be trusted, or that people in an NRM are brainwashed, then NPOV calls for making that statement and attribute it to these scholars. Why should it be diffrerent in the case of apostates? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi ≈</a> 16:44, May 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Fact</b>: most scholars that study New Religious Movements (with the exception of a few), believe that the testimony of ex-members is not to be trusted for reasons a, b, c, d, and e as described in the article. Even anti-cultists such as Mark Dunlop (ex-<a href="../../../f/w/b/FWBO_dbaf.html" title="FWBO">FWBO</a>) thinks that way! How can you say that information is <i>not</i> informative? <b>It is actually the most informative</b> in this article for anyone studying apostasy in NRMs. FYI, WP needs to include facts as well as notable POVs if properly attributed. Otherwise, If we follow your logic, most of the stuff on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat_e41b.html" title="Criticism of Prem Rawat">Criticism of Prem Rawat</a> should be deleted, because these are not facts, just the abhorrent POV of a group of apostates who's testimony is not worth the pixels used to display them. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi ≈</a> 20:48, May 30, 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Ah, then I'm happy to explain this part, since it may help you at some point to be a better Wikipedia contributor: when you put quote marks around a series of words and present it as the words that a person spoke or wrote, it needs to be <i>their words</i>, not a paraphrasing thereof, or a "condensed version of the summary" thereof. Especially if you are going to append the notation [sic], which is necessary less often than people think: it notes that what may appear to be a typo or some other alteration on the part of the reproducer is in fact reproduced faithfully. To append it to a simple quotation that does not present the appearance of typo or other transcription mistake is unnecessary; to append it to a "quotation" that is in fact <i>not a faithful reproduction</i> is simply doubling the offense.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The only exceptions to the rule that what is presented as a quote must in fact be the verbatim words of the person quoted without alteration are <i>interpolation</i> and <i>ellipsis</i>. Interpolation is used when the context in which the quote appears makes certain portions of the meaning clear which are not clear from only the quote itself -- most frequently used to replace a pronoun or unclear noun with its referent, such as converting Roger Ebert's "<i>Battlefield Earth</i> was written in 1980 by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. The film contains no evidence of Scientology or any other system of thought; it is shapeless and senseless, without a compelling plot or characters we care for in the slightest." to "[The film ''Battlefield Earth''] contains no evidence of Scientology or any other system of thought; it is shapeless and senseless, without a compelling plot or characters we care for in the slightest." Single brackets go around the interpolated section to make clear that interpolation has taken place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ellipsis is used when portions of the quote can safely be omitted without changing the meaning of the quote. For instance, when the complete quote is "Additionally, dissatisfied members or other critics have great difficulty in disproving ad-hominem arguments, such as that they just have a personal axe to grind, that they are trying to find a scapegoat to excuse their own failure or deficiency, or that they are simply being subjective and emotional", three examples have been given of ad-hominem arguments used to attack ex-members and whistleblowers: the phrase "such as" makes it perfectly clear that these are only three examples out of a list that could potentially be longer. Thus, if one wished to shorten the quote, one could keep one of the examples, and replace the other two with ellipses.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As with interpolation, one inserts formatting into the quote to indicate that an alteration <i>has</i> taken place, even if the person quoting believes it is a benign alteration which does not misrepresent the person quoted (in the case of ellipsis, it is '...', which may be unfortunate since that punctuation is increasingly popular in on-line writing to indicate a "trailing-off".) This is considered a matter of basic honesty, since one person might think that he has not changed the basic meaning of a quote by omitting or substituting words when in fact he has altered its meaning considerably (for instance, by changing the words someone wrote about a certain group's "public credibility" to make it appear the person was talking about that group's actual credibility.) By using the correct formatting, one notifies others "I have made alterations to this quote; I consider them minor and non-material, but if you suspect you might disagree, this is where you should look for differences between the person's original words and my representation of them." And of course, one should not present as an unaltered quote what is <i>not</i>, in fact, a person's own unaltered words <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=site%3Afwbo-files.com+%22expose+cults%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=site%3Afwbo-files.com+%22expose+cults%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> , and in particular one should not append "[sic]" to pre-emptively assure readers that one's transcription was 100% faithful to even the mistakes and infelicities of the original writer's words. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:39, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This section deals with apostasy in new religious movements and not with complaints by apostates. You moved these complaints from the Oppostion to cults and new reigious movements (Don't know why). Putting their complaints first in this section is putting the cart befoer the horse. Explain what an paostate of NRM is, what scholars that studied them say about them and then list their complaints. Not the other way around.

<dd>Jossi, every group of people should start with a definition first and followed by their POV and complaints as per the NPOV policy. The normally accepted practice of describing a group is first to give a definition, then to describe their POV, and then criticism. In this case the group described are apostates so their complaints and allegations should be mentioned first. Even the most unpopular in the public mind of all NRMs Scientology starts with their beliefs and practices, seen from their POV. I do not see any good reason to deviate from this normal order in this article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:32, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have read all the articles by Carter and Bromley in the book and it does not contain the following statement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In studies by Lewis Carter and David Bromley, it is presented that the onus of pathology experienced by former members of new religions movements shifted from these groups to the coercive activities of the anti-cult movement. As a result of this study, the treatment (coerced or voluntary) of former members as people in need of psychological assistance largely ceased. These studies also point out that the lack of any widespread need for psychological help by former members of new religions has in itself become the strongest evidence refuting early sweeping condemnations of new religions as causes of psychological trauma.</p>

<p>The synonyms of apostate mostly seem to be perjorative terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>A person who has defected: defector, deserter, recreant, renegade, runagate, tergiversator, turncoat. <i>Informal</i> rat.<a href="http://www.answers.com/apostate&amp;r=67" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/apostate&amp;r=67" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The positive version of the word is probably "convert", which focuses on the religion that the person has moved towards rather than the one that they have moved away from. The Catholic Church calls apostasy a sin.<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01624b.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01624b.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> Other religions also condemn it.

<p>However, apostasy is complicated in Judaism. A joke goes as follows: "What do you call a Jew who doesn't [sic]belive in God?" Answer: "A Jew."

<p>Reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>However, apostasy is <b>complicated</b> in Judaism.</i> - not attributed, this is the editor's opinion.</li>
<li><i>The joke <b>demonstrates</b> the belief held by <b>some</b> Jewish theologians</i> . Weasel word, "some". Yo need to specify who are these theologians for NPOV.</li>
<li><i>that a rejection of the central premise of the religion -- the existence of a deity -- does not make one heretical or apostate.</i> This is the editor's assessment of what the joke "demonstrates".

<dd>there is some truth in the joke: one remains a Jew even one has rejected Judaism, in contrast to other religions, with the possible exception of Hinduism.

<dd>Your are mistaken: Judaism has many facets, and we Jews have very different ways to indicate our <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>. For example, I consider myself a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a>, but not from a religious POV, but from a cultural POV. Only if a religious Jew rejects Judaism as his/her religion, he/she can be considered an apostate of Judaism. There is another aspect: even if I don't consider myself a Jew, but I was born Jew, bigots and antisemites will always consider me a Jew... and that is not a joke. See below the introduction to the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> article:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The word <i><b>Jew</b></i> (<a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>: <b>יהודי</b>) is used in a wide number of ways, but generally refers to a follower of the Jewish faith, a child of a Jewish mother, or someone of Jewish descent with a connection to Jewish <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a> or <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">ethnicity</a> and often a combination of these attributes. This article discusses the term as describing an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_group.html" title="Ethnic group">ethnic group</a>; for a consideration of the religion, please refer to <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>.</p>

<p>Here, for everyone to examine, is the current content of <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html#Judaism" title="Atheism">Atheism#Judaism</a>, to which Zappaz admonished us to look for the "correct" quoting of the joke. I am going to assume that Zappaz is not nit-picking over the misspelling of "believe", and I would <i>like</i> to believe that he would not nit-pick over the "Q." and "A." present in one and missing from the other, but the problem is that the two are then exactly the same. What difference are you seeing, Zappaz? Please explain it, avoiding verbosity and keeping to the point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, formulations of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_principles_of_faith.html" title="Jewish principles of faith">Jewish principles of faith</a> require a belief in God (represented by Judaism's paramount prayer, the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shema.html" title="Shema">Shema</a>). In many modern movements in Judaism, rabbis have generally considered the behavior of a Jew to be the determining factor in whether or not one is considered an adherent of Judaism. Within these movements it is often recognized that it is possible for a Jew to strictly practise <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> as a faith, while at the same time being an agnostic or atheist, giving rise to the riddle: "Q: What do you call a Jew who doesn't believe in God? A: A Jew." It is also worth noting that <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstructionist_Judaism_c62c.html" title="Reconstructionist Judaism">Reconstructionism</a> does not require any belief in a deity, and that certain popular <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Judaism_1877.html" title="Reform Judaism">Reform</a> prayer books such as <i>Gates of Prayer</i> offer some services without mention of God.</p>

<p>Apostasy is defined as the act of recanting one's religion or belief. Someone who converts to atheism, agnosticism, another religion or any other system of belief from a given religion NECESSARILY committs apostasy. Therefore, by any reasonable standard, freedom of religion ipso facto entails the right of apostasy.</p>

<dd>OK, I agree with this approach (I posted the int'l law versions). I am not totally happy with "the UNCHR <i>considers</i>" which I feel is too weak, but would rather have something like "<i>has determined</i>". This would reflect that any interpretation that sees apostasy as <i>not</i> being covered by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ist both legally and logically unconvincing. Maybe we can address this in the future. Thank you though, for your editing (especially my first version was indeed not quite to the point)!</dd>

(There are even more narrow sociological definitions by the way). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 06:28, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologize to <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">User:Willmcw</a> for overlooking the question. If there is some sense in which Augustine can be seen as an apostate, perhaps he can be described as "apostasized from <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manichaeism.html" title="Manichaeism">Manichaeism</a> to convert to Catholic Christianity". However, I'm still unclear about whether Manichaeism has an idea of "standing", along the lines of a community of trust and obligation (analogous to the Jewish and Christian concept of "covenant"), which I would think should be basic to any idea of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy.html" title="Apostasy">apostasy</a>. I really don't know the answer to that question (as I mentioned to Andries). Otherwise, "apostasy" becomes a rather overblown word for "change of opinion". — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 06:58, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Many new religious movements have no sense of orthodoxy and have teachings widely divergent from Christianity, but its critical former members are called apostates by sociologists. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 07:06, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspect that one of the reasons why Augustine is rarely called an apostate is that the word apostate had and has a negative connotation in daily and religious usage and Augustine is generally very much respected by Christian (I think including Protestants). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 07:34, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't speak for others, but I don't think that a psychological explanation works. I understand what people mean by a Sikh, Muslim, Jehovah's Witness, Mormon, or Jewish apostate convert to the Christian church. Evangelicals also often speak of apostates, who join the Catholic Church, or Eastern Orthodoxy; even if they otherwise regard these as Christian churches. I can barely understand what it would mean to "fall away from Hinduism", or to "be cut off from Buddhism", or to "depart from Unitarian Universalism". And I don't understand at all what it would mean to be an "apostate from paganism", or to "betray animism", or even to say one "lost his Scientology". To me it sounds made up. The difference, as I mentioned above, is a sense of profound communal obligation which must be overthrown in order to leave: a covenant, a standing, a communion. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 08:16, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sociologist do make up definitions and terms, that is true.

<p>There are two theological points listed as signs of apostasy which have in history as well (or more often) been signs not of apostasy but of heresy. Apostasy is not the denial of single doctrines - it is a complete denial of Christianity (which sure includes denial of central teachings). If denial of the deity of the holy spirit is the only "symptom" it's not apostasy but a case of heresy, this should be made clear. --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 12:43, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

Watertight, exhaustive, and completely consistent criteria will probably never be achieved because of the existence of several somewhat different definitions. Please dicuss (and possibly remove) the persons that you find doubtful, but your removal of the complete list deprives the reader of valuable content from this article. I propose the list to include notable former members (both silent and critical) of the Abrahamic religions, notable critical former members of purported new religious movements and purported cults and to exclude notable former members of Hinduism and Buddhism, like <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambedkar.html" title="Ambedkar">Ambedkar</a>, because the concept of apostasy is traditionally mainly used for the Abrahamic religions, an opinion also voiced by users user:Mkmconn and user:Andriesb. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:56, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One safe way to have such a list is to stay within the confines of what the article describes as an apostate from a sociological perspective: (1) a person that formally renounces his religion, <b>and</b> (2) that criticizes his former religion. I see that you refer to "former-member", but please note that the concept of apostasy refers to only those persons that fit both aspects (renunciation and criticism). I have re-added the list in his entirety, with the hope you could help in removing these that do not fit. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi fresco ≈</a> 22:22, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I think that a much safer approach would be to use definitions that are not so esoteric, that incorporate a more thorough sociology into the "sociological perspective". The problem is that the definition is not correct in the contexts where the word or idea of apostasy is most important. Apostates do not have to leave; the worst apostates are those who stay. It is not criticism that makes an apostate; the most dangerous are those who flatter and deceive. Apostates are traitors to the religious cause. If you keep this analogy in mind, you can understand why these vapid and barely meaningful criteria can be perceived as beside the point. A traitor is not 1. a person who formally renounces his citizenship, <b>and</b> 2. criticizes his former homeland. That describes only some traitors and, some who are not traitors. A list of traitors based on superficial criteria would run into the same problems that this list would have. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 05:05, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that these is solution: Listing noted apostates under each religion. That way we can apply the more appropriate use of the term in respect to that religion. If we add a name,, we also need some context about the person and his/her apostasy. Another possibility is to delete the list all together. My point was, and still is, that having a list in which we mix them all in an strange pile is POV, not encyclopedic and unfair to these persons.<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi fresco ≈</a> 15:40, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am a bit uncomfortable with "Apostates of new religious movements usually make a number of allegations against their former affiliation and their leaders, including failed...". The use of "usually" cannot be supported since by far the most apostates just go off and lick their wounds in silence. And as an apostate (whose opinions are therefore automatically suspect!&#160;:) ) I also find the term "usually" to have possible negative connotations in this context -- it can give the impression that we apostates are making knee-jerk reactions. I propose this instead: "Apostates of new religious movements sometimes make a number of allegations against their former affiliation and their leaders. These allegationss can include failed...". <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 20:22, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would argue that these that "go off and lick their wounds in silence" are not referred to as "apostates", but as "leavetakers", "defectors", etc. Apostates, in this context, are those that usually <i>do</i> actively criticize their former groups/religions. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 03:36, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
