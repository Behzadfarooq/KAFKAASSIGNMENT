<p><i>Apollo 15</i> spent one more day in lunar orbit, continuing the observations of Worden. After releasing a subsatellite, they ignited their Service Propulsion system to put them on a trajectory back to Earth. The next day, Worden performed an EVA to retrieve the film cassettes from the SIM bay cameras.</p>
<p>The twelfth day in space was uneventful, with Mission Control holding a press conference where the astronauts were asked questions submitted by the news media. On their 13th and final day they prepared for reentry. During descent one of their parachutes failed, meaning they landed under only two.</p>

<p><i>Falcon</i> lifted off from the lunar surface at 171 hours, 37 minutes and 16 seconds GET. During ascent from the Moon, Worden played "The Air Force Song". Although he thought it was only being played for Houston, unbeknownst to him, a switch had been flicked in Mission Control that relayed his voice transmissions to the LM. It is understood that Scott was not very happy with this.</p>

<p>The LM was placed into a 42 by 9 nm (77.8 by 16.7 km) orbit. <i>Apollo 15</i> would be the first direct rendezvous, where the two craft would rendezvous within one <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbit.html" title="Orbit">orbit</a>. The LM orbit was not perfectly in the same <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plane_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Plane (mathematics)">plane</a> as the CSM's, so another burn of the LM's ascent engine was required.</p>
<p>During the following near side pass, the spacecrafts continued to close, with <i>Falcon</i>, in its lower orbit, catching <i>Endeavour</i>. Once about 120 feet (40 m) apart the spacecraft started to station-keep — keeping the distance between them constant. As on all Apollo flights, the crew extensively photographed and filmed this process. <i>Endeavour</i> closed into to hard dock and the mission of <i>Falcon</i> had come to an end.</p>

<p>After opening the hatches, the crew began the task of transferring the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_%28geology%29.html" title="Rock (geology)">rock</a> samples that have been collected on the surface. Scott and Irwin also vacuumed their spacesuits to try and rid them of as much <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dust.html" title="Dust">dust</a> as possible. Also transferred were film magazines, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food.html" title="Food">food</a>, used <a href="../../../u/r/i/Urine.html" title="Urine">urine</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/c/Fecal.html" title="Fecal">fecal</a> bags (they were included for medical investigators). One Oxygen Purge System (OPS) was also transferred. On the lunar surface the OPS would be used as an emergency <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen.html" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> supply, or by the crew of the LM in the event that they were unable to achieve hard docking with the LM and had to undertake an EVA to transfer across from the LM. Worden would use it during his EVA later in the mission.</p>
<p>Following the completion of the transfer, the crew resealed the hatches between the crafts and prepared to <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jettison.html" title="Jettison">jettison</a> the LM. This was different to the undocking that took place before landing. In this case it would be an <a href="../../../e/x/p/Explosive.html" title="Explosive">explosive</a> jettison as much of the docking probe structure was now unneeded and will stay in the LM. There was some difficulty in getting the tunnel between the crafts to depressurize. This suggested that there was an improperly sealed hatch, delaying the separation by one orbit. After checking the hatches the crew could not find a cause for the improper seal, but the tunnel now vented successfully.</p>
<p>A change in crew procedure had come after the deaths of three crewmembers of <i><a href="../../../s/o/y/Soyuz_11.html" title="Soyuz 11">Soyuz 11</a></i> less than a month before the launch of <i>Apollo 15</i>. On <i>Soyuz 11</i> the crew had been killed after a repressurization valve opened during the separation of the orbital and service modules from the reentry module of the <a href="../../../s/o/y/Soyuz_spacecraft.html" title="Soyuz spacecraft">Soyuz spacecraft</a>. Mission planners for <i>Apollo 15</i> decided that the crew should now wear their pressure suits during the separation of the LM from the CSM, something that had not previously occurred. The suits caused some problems for <i>15</i> as during an integrity test before the tunnel venting they were unable to achieve suit integrity in Scott's suit.</p>
<p>After finally jettisoning the LM, the CSM performed a small RCS burn to further separate from the LM. <i>Falcon</i> was directed to burn its ascent stage engine, so that it would impact the lunar surface. The delay has meant it would not impact in the planned site, instead impacting at 26°12' N, 0°6' E, about 56 miles (90 km) from the landing site.</p>
<p>Due to the delays the crew, should have started their sleep period but now had to finish housekeeping chores. Mainly these centered around turning back on the SIM instruments which had been turned off during the rendezvous and docking and orientating the spacecraft for their proper use. Just before the sleep period, <a href="../../../d/e/k/Deke_Slayton_0540.html" title="Deke Slayton">Deke Slayton</a>, who was affectly the astronaut's boss, radioed the crew and told them to take a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secobarbitol.html" title="Secobarbitol">Seconal</a> <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedative.html" title="Sedative">sedative</a>. The crew decided against this.</p>
<p>Doctors on the ground had become worried when they saw that Scott's and Irwin's <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrocardiogram.html" title="Electrocardiogram">EKG</a> had developed a <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigeminy.html" title="Bigeminy">bigeminy</a> rhythm. Caused by a lack of <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potassium.html" title="Potassium">potassium</a>, the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Ventricle_%28heart%29.html" title="Ventricle (heart)">ventricles</a> beat in couplets, instead of a single constant beat. The <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypokalemia.html" title="Hypokalemia">potassium deficiency</a> is thought to have been caused by the training schedule and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stress_%28medicine%29.html" title="Stress (medicine)">stress</a> of the flight. Irwin would later die in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> of a <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>.</p>
<p>Finally 3½ hours after they were meant to go to sleep and 2 hours after Mission Control first said good night to the crew, they started their sleep period on the 54th orbit of the Moon. Scott and Irwin had been awake over 23 hours and Worden 21 hours.</p>

<p><i>Apollo 15</i> spent one final day in lunar orbit before Trans-Earth Injection (TEI), the SPS burn that would put them on a trajectory back to Earth. This day was spent mainly on the same tasks that had occupied Worden during the past four days.</p>
<p>Mission Control decided to make many changes to the <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_plan.html" title="Flight plan">flight plan</a>. The <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">Laser</a> <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altimeter.html" title="Altimeter">Altimeter</a> failed and was declared a lost cause. The crew were asked to use a 250-mm <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephoto.html" title="Telephoto">telephoto</a> lens instead of an 80-mm lens on the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasselblad.html" title="Hasselblad">Hasselblad</a>. They are also instructed to take as many photographs as they liked. There was no point in them returning to Earth carrying <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exposure_%28photography%29.html" title="Exposure (photography)">unexposed</a> film.</p>
<p>Among their photographic targets were the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terminator_%28solar%29.html" title="Terminator (solar)">terminator</a> region, where the Sun would appear to be either rising or setting for an observer on the ground. These photographs were extremely useful as they showed surface features in strong relief. Now with three persons onboard the crew were able to acquire many more handheld photographs, with one person always available to run the SIM and receive flight plan updates from Mission Control. The crew are also instructed to just turn on the Panoramic Camera and let it run now that all its primary targets have been imaged.</p>
<p>As <i>Apollo 15</i> appeared from behind the Moon on its 73rd orbit, there were only two more orbits left before TEI. During this time the crew had to release the subsatellite and prepare for the rocket burn that would send them home. Like all parts of the CSM and LM, the SPS was highly redundant. The only parts that were not were the engine bell and the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combustion_chamber.html" title="Combustion chamber">combustion chamber</a>.</p>
<p>The subsatellite was designed to measure the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravitational field</a> of the Moon and investigate the Earth and Moon's <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetosphere.html" title="Magnetosphere">magnetospheres</a>. It was 31 inches (79 cm) long, with a 14 inches (36 cm) hexagonal body. Weighing a total of 78.5 pounds (35.6 kg), it was powered by solar cells for daytime operations and a <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver.html" title="Silver">silver</a>-<a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadmium.html" title="Cadmium">cadmium</a> battery for the nighttime. It had three booms that extended after release, which were 5 ft (1.5 m) long.</p>
<p>Before releasing the subsatellite, the crew performed another engine burn to raise their orbit. This was designed to allow the subsatellite to last longer. The 3 second burn at raised their orbit from 65.4 by 52.2 nautical miles (121.1 by 96.7 kilometres) to 76.0 by 54.3 nautical miles (140.8 by 100.6 km). In this new orbit it was expected that the subsatellite would survive for 1 year.</p>

<p>As they began their 74th and final orbit of the Moon, the crew positioned the spacecraft for the correct attitude for release. The subsatellite was released on schedule. The release process involved two pyrotechnic bolts being fired to release the satellite which was launched using a <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_%28device%29.html" title="Spring (device)">spring</a>-loaded mechanism, a pin in a curved groove to impart a <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotation.html" title="Rotation">spin</a> in the satellite. The spinning helped to stabilise the craft.</p>
<p>After having the information needed to burn the SPS to send them home radioed from Mission Control, <i>Apollo 15</i> disappeared behind the Moon for the last time. Igniting on time, the SPS burned for 2 minutes, 21 seconds, adding 3,050 ft/s (930 m/s) to their speed.</p>
<p>Little was left for the crew to do on their tenth day in space. They continued to photograph the lunar surface as it receded from them, using up the remaining film. And now they were back in the constant sunlight of cis-lunar space, they put the spacecraft into PTC.</p>
<p><a name="Day_11_and_EVA" id="Day_11_and_EVA"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_15%2C_Return_to_Earth_341b.html" title="Edit section: Day 11 and EVA">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Day 11 and EVA</span></h2>
<p>The eleventh day in space's main task is an <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extra-vehicular_activity.html" title="Extra-vehicular activity">EVA</a> by Worden. This was the first EVA by a Command Module Pilot since Scott performed one on <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_9.html" title="Apollo 9">Apollo 9</a></i>.</p>
<p>As the crew began their preparations, they left the Lunar Sphere of Influence at 238 hours, 14 minutes, 51 seconds GET, at which point the gravitational pull of the Earth was stronger than that of the Moon. From now on they would start to <a href="../../../a/c/c/Acceleration.html" title="Acceleration">accelerate</a> towards the Earth. After retracting and turning off the equipment in the SIM bay, the crew donned their space suits. They disabled the RCS thrusters that were near the SIM and if accidentally fired would have been dangerous to Worden. Guards were also placed over the control panel to ensure that switches were not flicked by an errant foot.</p>
<p>After suit checks and depressurizing the spacecraft, the hatch was opened. After mounting a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">TV</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_camera.html" title="Film camera">film camera</a> on the hatch, Worden jettisoned two bags of <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubbish.html" title="Rubbish">rubbish</a> that did not need to be returned to Earth. Then using handholds built into the craft he moved along to the SIM bay. Along with retrieval he was tasked with inspecting the instruments to find the cause for the various problems experienced with them.</p>

Later analysis would find that the problem was related to the optical signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
<p>As the other instruments had radioed their data back to Earth, there were nothing else to collect. Twenty minutes after opening the hatch, it was closed and locked again. The SIM bay was turned back on so that the X-ray Spectrometer could be pointed at <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorpius_X-1_d047.html" title="Scorpius X-1">Scorpius X-1</a> and <a href="../../../c/y/g/Cygnus_X-1_e637.html" title="Cygnus X-1">Cygnus X-1</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_15%2C_Return_to_Earth_341b.html" title="Edit section: Day 12">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Day 12</span></h2>
<p>During the night, the crew sent a new space endurance record for the Apollo program (though not for all spaceflight with <i><a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemini_7.html" title="Gemini 7">Gemini 7</a></i> having stayed in space for 14 days, and <i><a href="../../../s/o/y/Soyuz_11.html" title="Soyuz 11">Soyuz 11</a></i> for a month). The twelfth day in space for the crew was one of the quietest. Like on all Apollo lunar flights, on the return trip there was little left to do, with the main objectives already accomplished.</p>
<p>The crew undertook another light flash experiment, this time keeping the cabin lights on to see if this affected the visibility. They found that they were less visible.</p>
<p>Mission Control ran over the stowage of items in the cabin. It was extremely important that stowed items were placed such that the spacecraft's centre-of-gravity was within the set limits. Especially important were items like the rock samples weighing 170 lb (77 kg) and the 55 lb (25 kg) film cassettes from the Panoramic Camera.</p>
<p>The Earth bound portion of the flight coincided with a <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_eclipse.html" title="Lunar eclipse">lunar eclipse</a>. This occurs when the Moon passes through the <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umbra.html" title="Umbra">shadow</a> of the Earth. The crew were instructed to photograph it but due to the handheld nature of the cameras and the length of the exposures, most of the photos were blurred. Instruments on the lunar surface left by the crew also recorded the eclipse, though only through noting the drop of the surface temperature by 185 <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelvin.html" title="Kelvin">kelvins</a>.</p>
<p>The crew also conducted an inflight press conference, with questions having been submitted by members of the press to be read by the CapCom. Firstly they were asked what was the event that would like to repeat and any they would not like to. Scott responded that looking down on the plain from Hadley Delta was for him the best moment. For Worden it was LOI, and their first close up views of the Moon and TEI, which meant they were coming home. Irwin enjoyed the launch the most, but would not like to repeat falling down in front of the TV camera while deploying the <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_Rover_0e44.html" title="Lunar Rover">Rover</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the questions centered around the surface operations, such what to the crew was the most important findings. Irwin responded that to him it was the "<a href="../../../o/r/g/Organization.html" title="Organization">organization</a> that was revealed in the side of Mount Hadley". Scott was asked to describe what it was like to land <i>Falcon</i>. He said that the cratering on the surface was much more subtle than expected making <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark.html" title="Landmark">landmark</a> sighting harder. Scott was also asked about the physical workload of doing three 7 hour EVAs. He said that he saw no problem with it and praised their <a href="../../../t/r/a/Training.html" title="Training">training</a> on the Earth before the mission in preparing them for all possible events.</p>
<p>The Rover was of interest, with Irwin describing it as a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronc_riding.html" title="Bronc riding">bucking bronco</a> that at times only had two wheels still touching the surface. Scott said that he felt it was a very <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stable.html" title="Stable">stable</a> machine that in the 1/6th gravity had a tendency to float a bit. Scott was also asked about the drill which he had much trouble with. He said that after about a meter below the surface he ran into hard rock that he was unable to drill through easily. Although he and Irwin had great difficulty extracting the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Core_sample.html" title="Core sample">core sample</a>, he felt it was worthwhile.</p>
<p>Scott answered a question about the loss of the North Complex by saying that in terms of the original mission objectives, the North Complex was not even mentioned and was only added later. Although personally disappointed, it would have been more of a bonus.</p>
<p>As always there were questions related to what the American taxpayer was getting out the mission except for some "pretty television pictures". Scott said that man must <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploration.html" title="Exploration">explore</a> and that along with huge amounts of scientific data, there was the great sense of exploration that came from the flight. Worden and Irwin agreed totally with these sentiments.</p>
<p>When asked about the problems on board, the crew thought that they had a very smooth flight except for some popped circuit breakers and the problem with the SPS Thrust switch. Irwin said that "it seemed like a very tame <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simulation.html" title="Simulation">simulation</a>".</p>
<p>When asked to describe his geological observations from orbit, Worden talked about the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volcanic_cones.html" title="Volcanic cones">Cinder Cones</a> he had seen and how many of the craters they observed, especially on the far side seemed to have been filled by <a href="../../../l/a/v/Lava_flow.html" title="Lava flow">lava flows</a>. The press were also interested in what a man thinks about when he is alone for three days. He responded that with the flight plan there was little time to sit back and think. The three days seemed to go very quickly for him. When asked why on his EVA he had come in so soon, he said that he didn't come in soon, he just came in when the job was finished.</p>
<p>The sixth course correction was cancelled after the press conference. The TEI had out the spacecraft on such a good trajectory that it was thought that no further trims were needed. Dave Scott, Jim Irwin and Al Worden begin their final sleep period at 278 hours.</p>

<p>After awaking on their final day in space, the crew shut down the SIM bay for the last time. The gamma-ray spectrometer boom was stowed and all the equipment was safed. Along with the rest of the Service Module it would burn up as it <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reentry.html" title="Reentry">reentered</a> the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth%27s_atmosphere.html" title="Earth's atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a>.</p>
<p>The final midcourse correction of the mission (MCC-7) or the Corridor Control Burn, was a 21 s RCS thruster, slowing them down by 5.6 ft/s (1.7 m/s). Now all that was left for them to do was separate from the Service Module and assume the blunt-end-forward orientation.</p>
<p>The CM's own RCS system was pressurized and the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Very_high_frequency.html" title="Very high frequency">VHF</a> radio link checked. VHF would be used after passing through the radio <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communications_blackout.html" title="Communications blackout">communications blackout</a> of reentry.</p>
<p>The separation from the SM was a highly important event. First, a series of <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrotechnic.html" title="Pyrotechnic">pyrotechnic</a> systems were armed; a switch was then flicked to initiate separation. From here an automatic system took over. A timer was started to have the RCS thrusters fire to increase the separation. The electrical connections between the two crafts were severed using cannon-style <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plug.html" title="Plug">plug</a> and socket connectors that were 'unplugged' using small pyrotechnic charges. A pyro-powered <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillotine.html" title="Guillotine">guillotine</a> severed the wire bundles and plumbing. Further charges severed tension ties that connected the two modules, which were then pushed apart using springs.</p>
<p>After entering the atmosphere, the acceleration built, peaking at 6 gee (59 m/s²). This dropped as they slowed down, coming out of radio blackout. Passing through 7,300 metres (24,000 ft), the apex cover was blown by a pyrotechnic charge. This exposed the two sets of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parachute.html" title="Parachute">parachutes</a>. First the two drogue parachutes were released that slowed and stabilized the capsule from 500 km/h to 280 km/h. They pulled out the three large main parachutes some twenty seconds later.</p>

The capsule of <i>Apollo 15</i> descends under only two good parachutes.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The recovery forces in the area reported that only two of the main parachutes had inflated. Worden said after splashdown that all three parachutes did inflate properly at first but after dumping the RCS fuel (highly <a href="../../../t/o/x/Toxicity.html" title="Toxicity">toxic</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrazine.html" title="Hydrazine">hydrazine</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinitrogen_tetroxide.html" title="Dinitrogen tetroxide">dinitrogen tetroxide</a>), he noticed that one was not inflated anymore. Post flight analysis would find that two or three of the six <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shroud_lines.html" title="Shroud lines">shroud lines</a> on the failed parachute were missing. Although no conclusive cause was found it is thought that the loss of the shroud lines was due to the RCS fuel dump.</p>
<p>The splashdown point was estimated to be <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/geo/geohack.php?params=26_13_N_158_13_W_" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/geo/geohack.php?params=26_13_N_158_13_W_" rel="nofollow"><span title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for 26°13′N 158°13′W">26°13′N, 158°13′W</span></a></span>, 330 <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_miles.html" title="Statute miles">statute miles</a> (530 km) north of <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honolulu.html" title="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> and 5.3 <a href="../../../n/a/u/Nautical_mile.html" title="Nautical mile">n mi</a> (9.8 km) from the prime recovery ship, the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Okinawa_%28LPH-3%29_8fed.html" title="USS Okinawa (LPH-3)">USS <i>Okinawa</i></a>.</p>
<p>The loss of a parachute was of no consequence for the capsule, which was designed to land safely on just two parachutes, the third parachute being a redundancy in case one parachute had failed. After splashing down the capsule stayed upright, which meant their recovery was not delayed while it righted itself. <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frogman.html" title="Frogman">Frogmen</a> from the <i>Okinawa</i> were at the capsule within minutes attaching a sea <a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchor.html" title="Anchor">anchor</a> and opening the hatch to get the crew into a <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lifeboat.html" title="Lifeboat">life raft</a>. <i>Apollo 15</i> was the first mission where the crew did not go into <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarantine.html" title="Quarantine">quarantine</a> in case of any lunar <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microorganism.html" title="Microorganism">microorganisms</a>, after it was found from previous flights that the Moon was lifeless.</p>
