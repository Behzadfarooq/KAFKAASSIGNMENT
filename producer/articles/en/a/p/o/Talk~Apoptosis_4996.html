<p>The VDAC interacts with Bak to inhibit its own mitochondrial outermembrane permeablisation (MOMP) activity? I thought Bak or Bax can interact with VDAC to directly induce permeablisation (when they multimerise), and it's the binding of these pro-apoptotic proteins to the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2/Bcl-Xl that inhibits MOMP?</p>

<p>I know I read somewhere that (statistically) each day, every human has two cells developing into cancer cells, but are stopped by the immune system via apoptosis.

<p>What the article doesn't seem to discuss much is the philosophical implication of having a cell programmed to kill itself on purpose. Which is all fine and well, since its mostly a scientific article, but I have read many many articles in magazines that discuss apoptosis and cite it as the fact that being a <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamikaze.html" title="Kamikaze">kamikaze</a> or a <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_bomber.html" title="Suicide bomber">suicide bomber</a>, or <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> itself isn't as "unnatural" as everyone makes it out to be, whether this is true/NPOV or not. But would there be a place for this in the article?</p>
<p>And on a different note, I think this article can make it for <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> if there were some neat diagrams and images - I have already emailed a webmaster for permission to use one (which happens to be 300 KB large), but of course to be an FA you have to have more images. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 06:33, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Response: Sorry for taking so long to answer. There is no doubt on the importance of the implications of this topic for the philosophy of science. As Lowe et al. mention in their 18 Nov. 2004 <i>Nature</i> article, "Intrinsic tumour suppression": "Cell proliferation and cell death are such diametrically opposed cellular fates that the discovery that the two are linked and interdependent processes was a great surprise." However, the only way I foresee to legitimately introduce wider philosophical questions into a Wikipedia article like "apoptosis" would be to quote or paraphrase highly recognized authors' opinions. And there is an additional difficulty involved, because it has already been suggested that the article is too long (see discussion above). Suggestions are welcome, but probably the best solution will be to place material on the wider implications (when found) into articles dealing with the philosophy of science.</dd>

<p>This article doesn't appear to elaborate on this too much, especially, how do immune cells recognise cells that have been infected by viruses? Do their cell membranes change, or something? Do they withdraw signals? And of other things, for example, a lack of a cell stimuli as much as presence of stimuli can also cause apoptosis (I have read) - ie. if there's a cell without an "anchor" tying it to other cells at a cer Would the article explain more on this programming? Can more be elaborated on this? If we don't know (we probably don't know a lot), can the article clarify? -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 19:22, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article only mentions one pronunciation, and the reference link provided says that it's controversial. I've heard the word said by professionals in any of 4 different ways, and don't like the idea that the article only mentions one. While I pronounce it with a silent second-p, I don't accept that as standard because I also don't pronounce "helicopter" as "helicotter," nor do I use Greek and Latin plurals when an English one is acceptable. To me, the pronunciation as indicated is derived from pretentiousness rather than accuracy, because if accuracy was the issue, ptosis wouldn't be the most accurate Greek suffix.--<a href="../../../t/r/y/User%7ETrypsin_f14a.html" title="User:Trypsin">Trypsin</a> 15:31, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well from one of my lectures with Professor Wyllie, he himself said that the correct pronunciation is with A-POP-TOW-SIS (pronouncing the "p").

<p>Citation and recognition of articles by women and young researchers is gone.</p>
<p>Citations and recognition of articles by both a variety of US, European and other nationality researchers is gone.</p>
<p>The history of how apoptosis was researched, discovered and brought to the forefront of international science by both collaboration and competition by many different has been removed from the article and placed somewhere else, despite that it was explicitly asked in this discussion section not to do so.</p>
<p>I perfectly understand that any article can be subjected to changes by any contributor, and that the order or the wording could have benefited a lot from good editing. However, great care had been taken to make the article acurate and founded on the best scientific literature available.</p>
<p>Sorry for the tone of the note I left yesterday. I take it back, and recognize it was totally inapproprite. Although it is not a justification, I did get irked at the fact that I had explicitly requested the article not to be broken into several pieces, and I still don't understand why there has been so much insistence.</p>

I maintain the British English spelling of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golgi_apparatus.html" title="Golgi apparatus">Golgi apparatus</a> article in silent protest against this fact, so please don't accuse me of something so unfounded. I moved all citations, at great trouble (every one was checked against the sentence I included it in), to the in-line style of referencing, as you noticed. I even added a few new ones. I removed any reference not contributing to the article after I edited it, these were references dealing with extremely complicated topics which, in all honesty, would interest no-one but an expert in the field. Said expert doesn't need the help of an online encyclopaedia to find these articles, hence my justification in removing all of 3 articles.</li>
<li>The history of apoptosis has been removed to its own page, and linked from the main article. This, I believe, was a good move on my behalf to centre the article more on the <i>process</i> and <i>function</i> of apoptosis, which the majority of the visitors would want from the page. Should you wish to include an outline of the major points along with the link, please feel free, indeed this would only improve the article.</li>

<dd>Your passive-aggressive tone in denouncing my changes comes as somewhat of a disappointment considering that part of your spiel was directed at how I've degraded the article, somewhat ironic since you have broken a Wikipedian tenet and haven't assumed good faith. I think that the elucidation of the article, the inclusion of diagrams, cleaned up references, improved readability <i>and</i> the promotion of the article from a "B" to an "A" class article would actually contradict your entire basis for your attack. I would hope that you would consider simply listing your grievances in the future rather than launching into a sarcastic attack on both my personal inclinations and the tenets of Wikipedia. Quite frankly, I'm offended and insulted. -- <i><b><a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerephine_0d7d.html" title="User:Serephine"><font color="#3D8B37">Serephine</font></a></b></i> <b><font style="color:#FF5333;">♠</font></b> <i><b><small><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESerephine_4d60.html" title="User talk:Serephine"><span style="color:#009900;">talk</span></a></small></b></i> - 00:51, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Talk%7EApoptosis_4996.html" title="Edit section: Justification">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Justification</span></h3>
<p>Your note had all the hallmarks of being written more with passion than calculated thoughtfulness, so it's ok&#160;:) It's natural to feel very protective of something you've worked very hard upon - as I saw with the level of references included in the article. I was very impressed with this, and this was in part the reason I initiated my large clean-up. Plus you re-worded the tone of your note and effectively apologised, for that I can easily forgive you - although I hope you mean that it was inappropriate because it was unprofessional rather than because I am not American&#160;;) To address your points and hopefully reach a conclusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>When removing references, I did not remove them on the basis of whether they were by PhD students or women. I removed them because they no longer had any relevance to the text. There is no need to "fill-up" references to make sure all demographics are equally represented, therefore your point, to me, makes no sense. I myself am female and not a researcher, therefore I can't be accused of bias.</li>
<li>On the topic of removing references, my justification for removing them stemmed from the fact that referencing was not in-line: i.e. not linked from the end of the sentence/paragraph it supports. Therefore, when placing the references I had to check each (both the abstract and full text thanks to a university proxy) to see what exactly they supported. Hence when cleaning up the article from reading like a journal review to reading like an encyclopaedia ("Thibert <i>et al.</i> showed that..." -&gt; "It has been shown that&lt;ref=Thibert&gt;") there were inevitably references which had to be removed, as they had no relevance in the text.</li>
<li>On the topic of cleaning up: when I first came to this article I recoiled in horror at the unfriendly and unreadable layout; big, unbroken paragraphs, a review-like format, needlessly detailed explanations, sections referring back to previous sections, a big clunky list of references at the end (though I noticed the effort on the discussion page to neaten these up, most impressive). I re-did the headings and systematically rewrote the article to be readable by at least a university student (which I am). The problem at hand was prose: there was no flow in idea progression or sentence - hence when reading a paragraph you would need to recheck it a couple of times to understand what was being said, and even then you might come across the dastardly "See also above ...". There were sections also that made no sense as context was not provided.</li>
<li>I tried not to eliminate detail where possible, and rewrote much of it to be relevant to the article. I apologise for removing it, I know the feeling of having a large chunk of work removed, but I was being brutal to mould the page into a <i>useful one</i> for anyone who came across it. I shouldn't have to say that Wikipedia isn't a scientific encyclopaedia - it's open to anyone and therefore the information should be written for anyone interested in that topic. Detail like what I removed would be better used in an article more specific for the processes, where the hardcore enthusiasts and scientifically literate would be more inclined to go for that calibre of information.</li>
<li>Finally, the history move. Another aplology on my behalf - I didn't not see the discussion on this page. I was being a bold editor, though I think it was for the better. I do not think the article in it's entirety should be moved back to this page - it is big enough as a separate entity to exist on its own. However, as I mentioned above, a short summary of the main points would flesh out the heading in the main article and encourage people to visit the history article.</li>
</ol>
<p>Should you have any concerns over my justifications and still do not agree with the direction the article has taken, please let me know and we can get a couple of people from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Molecular_and_Cellular_Biology_47d3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Molecular and Cellular Biology">Wikiproject MCB</a> to arbitrate and input into any issues. I realise that you've said "much was lost in the rewriting of this article", but look at how much has been gained: readability, context, diagrams, easy references, appropriate headings, and of course it scraped up an "A" and paved the way for further contribution.
