<hr />
<p>I'll wait for a moment for an explanation, but the deleted sentence contrasting the LDS and Catholic view is crucial, it seems to me. Is there some reason that the LDS and Catholic principles should not be directly contrasted? The LDS has made claims against the Catholic principle: didn't the deleted sentence clarify what the Catholic principle is, without being redundant? I request that the person who deleted it, would put it back - or I will, if there is no reasoned objection. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>A fuller contrast probably would be useful in a separate paragraph. The primary problem with the deleted sentence (which modified the original) was that it "put words in the mouth" of the LDS view: an LDS claim in catholic-like language. So, why merely delete it? Short explanation: I didn't have time to modify and expand upon it and it wasn't particularly crucial to have it in their NOW the way it was. Longer explanation: I think the objective of wikipedia is magnificent which is why I'm participating. However, one problem I have with the process is that wikipedia articles are getting more and more exposure while the info it presents is not necessarily reliable. If there were some sort of disclaimer on articles for the casual observer that the articles were in progress and not necessarily accurate, I could probably care less....BUT I don't want casual observers going away with the wrong idea. IMO, deletion with merely some notice is appropriate so long as the history of the deleted material continues to be available. On another matter....watch out for anti-mormon material...it tends to take it upon itself to interpret LDS doctrine and impose quotes of church leaders as authoritive or put their words in a false light. -Randy 11/23/02</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's understandable reason for deleting something. However, it would be helpful if the deleted content were pasted into the Talk page (here) along with a brief description of why it was deleted. That way it will be easier for others to find the change without hunting through the history, and if the reason is given, someone else might find a way to better express or balance the information in a more neutral or accurate fashion. This seems to be the general convention in Wikipedia that has worked fairly well in lots of controversial articles. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a></dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>An explanatory note in the edit summary is also nice, and almost always sufficient. Something like "LDS believe Jesus is the (OT) God of Israel" would be helpful. <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I went back in and moved the paragraph emphasizing the unbrokeness of the apostolic succession to the end of the article. I think the previous paragraph with the LDS view is a good lead into it. When I get a chance I'll go back and add some LDS view as to the meaning of "the gates of hell shall not prevail", Christ's promise of being with apostles to the end, and "upon this rock" I will build my church. -Randy 11/23/02</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sure you (is it Randy?) don't mean that the paragraph about the LDS is supposed to be out of the LDS mouth. You have a right to expect a fair description of the LDS, though - an accurate description. If a description, then the contrast to catholicism was useful - and that contrast is, that there is a single historical apostolic foundation for the entire Church according to Catholics, compared to multiple historical foundations according to the Mormons. This description was intended merely to be a summation of what you and other Mormon contributors have been adding to Wikipedia concerning how authority was restored to Joseph Smith, as well as what has been written about the visit of Jesus to America. I didn't consult "anti-mormon" material, and it wasn't intended to be an attack on Mormonism. Anyway, I think that Wesley's added sentence removes the need for replacing the deletion. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a></dd>

<dd>I think that the whole two paragraphs on the LDS/Mormon view of apostolic succession is irrelevent, is an idiosyncratic extension of the concept of apostolic succession, and is best placed as a reference, with an article on the subject at a link. Even logically, speaking of "renewing" apostolic succession, after a 'break' is on pretty thin ground. Can we keep the article a little relevent at least. The LDS spiel looks very like a bit of religious propaganda to me. <a href="../../../m/e/a/User%7EMeabhar_a7bb.html" title="User:Meabhar">Meabhar</a> 22:46, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article should contain a thorough delineation of the apostolic succession for the various religious groups which emphasize succession in terms of lines of authority. I was curious as to why in the Christianity article Mkmccon deleted as "historically inaccurate" a reference that Catholics can trace their authority to a bishop in ancient rome who was apparently ordained by the apostles (either Peter or Paul)...yet emphasized the point that the pope can trace that line to the apostles. Lets see the details please. Do Catholics not trace their authority back to Clement, Anacletus and Linus, the early bishops of Rome? Do Catholics not view Clement as the successor of apostolic perogatives or privileges? If not, then who are the early intermediary successors of the apostles in the Catholic tradition? If so, why delete it? How is it "historically inaccurate"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, without going through the old page versions, it's hard to know or remember exactly what text you're referring to. I'm not quite sure what point you're trying to make either. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bishops_6e44.html" title="List of Bishops">List of Bishops</a> has links to lists of bishops in Rome, Constantinople, and elsewhere. No need to duplicate those lists here, but I'll add a link to that list. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's not historically accurate to contrast Mormonism to Catholicism by saying that the entire hierarchy of the church is traceable to a single bishop of Rome - that's not what they say. The "Apostolic See" is succession from the apostles (plural). The uniqueness of Rome is that it is an uninterrupted succession of known names, carefully maintained, all the way back to Peter (who even he was not a pope himself, supposedly ordained the first bishop of Rome perhaps together with Paul). But Rome was not the only "apostolic see", and it was not the only line of succession. The Pope did not ordain all bishops; only those who were under his territorial jurisdiction. Alexandrian bishops did not go to Antioch to be ordained. Alexandria was "autocephalous". It had its own "pope" (and still does). It is true that the popes are traceable in a direct line. Apostolic succession does not have to do only with popes.

<dd>You are most sincerely welcome. Randy, why don't you get yourself a user name? I think that your contributions have been good, and you along with Quintessent and only a handful of others certainly know more about the LDS. It would be helpful for setting up your talk page, so that questions can be asked about issues that you are interested in, as well as to work through disagreements so that the entry/Talk pages can be even more topic-oriented. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>

<p>Latest addition on Mormon interpretation of Jesus promises may sound harsh to some.

<dd>I think the bits about alternate interpretations are fine, even informative, but the character attacks are a bit much, especially given all the suspicions and accusations surrounding Joseph Smith. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 16:33 16 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course, there is quite a difference between speculatory and generally contested accusations (as of Joseph's misdeeds) and confessed sin (like <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Alexander_VI_b1dc.html" title="Pope Alexander VI">Pope Alexander VI</a>'s adultery). If folks look at who is doing the accusing and why as closely as they scrutinize Joseph, I'm confident folks would come away with a fairer perception of the man. In my readings of primary sources both of and by Joseph, he appears as a man of integrity. But even if a person acknowledges that Joseph was not a charlatan, crook, swindler, liar, deluded, conspirator-to-murder, adulterer, etc as some have accused, some people still consider, for example, Joseph's practice of polygamy as sin although to Mormons it is an act of obedience. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBoNoMoJo_c7e6.html" title="User:BoNoMoJo">B</a> 20:47 16 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For your reading pleasure, here they are:</p>
<p>"The Catholic Church founded by Jesus Christ defines that Apostolicity means that the Apostles have successors to their doctrine, authority and Orders. As such, those who do not profess the Catholic doctrine whole and entire and without any question, despite havin been consecrated bishop are not successors of the Apostles, while those that have been lawfully appointed by the Pope as bishops are successors of the Apostles, even prior to their consecration as bishop.</p>
<p>"The Vatican II Church, which claims the name of Catholic holds that men must be appointed bishop by the Pope and consecrated to be a successor of the Apostles. In fact, a man does not become Pope until he has been consecrated bishop, which is a departure from Catholic tradition which holds that a man becomes Pope the moment he accepts election, even before his consecration as bishop (if he has not been consecrated bishop.)"</p>

<p>I read on my Talk page "Please discuss any major changes/additions on the talk page of the article, as there seems to be some debate regarding your recent edits. Thanks...and merry Christmas. KHM03 13:37, 24 December 2005 (UTC)". My thanks to KHMO3, with seasonal wishes, for being the only one not to think I'll magically disappear if reverted often enough.</p>
<p>So first let me point out that <i>I changed nothing</i>, not even very minor (except sections marked with a technically illegal number of = signs, the order should ==, === etc., never a single; even that is blindly reverted, but I suppose that is accidental).</p>
<p>Secondly I see no "debate" about the addition that I do make, and that is the problem: people shout "POV" at me without a shred of argumentation; I might learn something or even a lot if there <i>were</i> a debate, so I'm interested to see if this starts one. If anyone thinks the Catholic Encyclopaedia (one of the rare source that actually have a template for the frequent copyright-free use of its vast and well-reputed content, except on things outdated since the early 20th century) is wrong at some precise point(s), it's up to him to point out where, preferably with source(s), and possibly amend that part or counter it. Just ignoring the major use of the term in the largest religious organisation in wold history is to absurd for words, so even if someone thinks he can refute every single paragraph, shoving everything under the carpet is denying the sun: I clearly mark the section CLAIM, and the existence of a view relevant for a billion catholics is worth mentioning (no less then the existence of say superstition or long scientificaly refuted errors such as 'the earth is flat'), as long as it is not presented as fact- if you can think of rewording and addition to take out a fuse in that respect, pleaso do, but simply deleting the whole section is an inacceptable censorship of facts: religion IS belief, not only material truth. If someone were, for instance, to add a section on say protestant objections to the Catholic claims, that would be positive. So I keep restoring what is not even seriously challenged, but hope to learn what can be improved, and if that is the bulk of Catholic Encyclopaedia's text but for good reasons, fine, but I will not stand for what looks -for lack of any explanation at this point; I can only hope it is something more constructive- like a Catholicism-phobia, but please prove that impression entirely wrong! <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastifex_6571.html" title="User:Fastifex">Fastifex</a> 18:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no objection with adding a section regarding the RC view of apostolic succession. But what was added is <i>massive</i> compared to the rest of the article, which is disproportionate, ISTM. In any event, the onus of "proof," so to speak, is on those who want to drastically alter the article as it now stands. So making any substantial addition or subtraction should be proposed with explanation and justification so that there can be a consensus formed. As of this writing, at least, that hasn't happened. Rather, a gigantic chunk was added and then a complaint made when that chunk got reverted to the article's previous state. The term <i>restoration</i> has been used for that addition, but it's not a restoration if it's an addition to the article. Re-adding it after reversion doesn't count.</dd>

<p>There still is not a single element of argumentation against any part of Fastifex' contribution, so I will revert to his version (whether it is techically a restoration or revert is of no interest) what is not refuted- at this point, all. The 'previous state' of an article is NEVER relevant, nor the 'disproportionate' lenght of sections as such; if it were, it would be only normal that Catholicism, the world's largest religion ever, got a larger section, but feel free to add even more on protestant (or other) views if you feel (wrongly, but no bother) 'better' representation is achieved by quantity. The <i>onus probandi</i> is always on the side which challenges, and since Fastifex left every existing sentence in he didn't, so the burden of proof is entirely on the other side, which is utterly silent in every respect to the content, while admitting Catholic Encyclopaedia is a 'good source', so again it should should specify which of its elements are not NPOV but can be refuted or how they are best balanced by other facts. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcarius_bda5.html" title="User:Arcarius">Arcarius</a> 01:33, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So you're telling me that anyone can add anything they like to any article, and the responsibility to prove that it <b>shouldn't</b> be there is on everyone else? Please reassure me that you aren't kidding. The reality is that there is a proposed <b>addition</b> to the article (which didn't get proposed, really, but just added) which radically changes the general shape it's had for well over a year. If only for the sake of politeness, such additions should be proposed and discussed on the talk page <b>before</b> they are added, not as posturing <i>fait accompli</i> challenges to objectors afterward.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The fact that the RCC is the world's largest religion is not really relevant in terms of determining what its amount of representation in an article is. Should there be an Islamic section of nearly equal size as a result? Surely Muslims might have an opinion on it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with this gigantic addition is mainly its size. It needs to be summarized. If there is a genuine feeling that there needs to be an article on Wikipedia which represents the RCC's view more thoroughly, then a separate article dedicated to that view can be created. On an article about apostolic succession in general, no one group should have a dominant representation. You may not know this, since your account has been editing on Wikipedia for only about a month (including only two Talk pages including this one), but disproportionate representation is <b>frequently</b> cited as a reason to trim certain sections of an article.</dd>

<p>At a glance, I see two major problems with the added text itself, in addition to the procedural objections that ASDamick raised. First, it duplicates much of what was already said earlier in the article. Secondly, despite the intro to the section the text itself is plainly argumentative in tone, advocating its POV. It needs to be trimmed down and edited to integrate it with the rest of the article. I don't have time to undertake that task at the moment, so I'm going to remove the section as it is. However, I invite Fastifex or anyone else to re-add it in shortened form, adjusting both the content and style to better fit with the rest of the article. I'll leave the NPOV notice in place for now until it appears that we've reached some consensus on whether to include this section and if so, in what form. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 05:04, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Wesley sounds like he has finally got the idea: restyling and shortening may be in orther, and the same goes for the tone; so the NPOV notice now at least has an intentional basis. Until anyone follows up on his good intentions, I put the Primacy tetx back: the major use in Catholicism must a least be visible to anyone ready to work on reworking it. 10:52, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I tried my hand at summarizing the first section, "Roman claim of Primacy." I don't even know where to begin with the second section; it's a very different version of the church history of Britain than what I've heard or read. For me, that alone is enough to make me inclined to scrap the whole section or 95% of it, since the source of this history is probably as biased and involved as the histories I've read of it. For instance, I had thought that all the "Orthodox" monasteries were shut down and the rule of Rome imposed by force there sometime in the 11th and 12th centuries. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 04:51, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The principle underlying the Roman Catholic claim is contained in the idea of succession. "To succeed" is to be the successor of, especially to be the heir of, or to occupy an official position just after, as Victoria succeeded William IV. Now the Roman Pontiffs come immediately after, occupy the position, and perform the functions of St. Peter; they are, therefore, his successors. St. Peter came to Rome, and ended there his pontificate; the Bishops of Rome who came after him held his official position in the Church. Beginning with the middle of the second century, there exists a consensus among the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_Fathers_d0f6.html" title="Church Fathers">Church Fathers</a> as to Peter's martyrdom in Rome. In the third century the popes claim authority from the fact that they are St. Peter's successors, and no one objects to this claim. The <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiochian_Orthodox_Church_fdef.html" title="Antiochian Orthodox Church">Antiochian Orthodox Church</a> also claims this honor, as Peter was also bishop there before he was bishop in Rome, as Rome herself acknowledges. No city boasts the tomb of the Apostle but Rome, where he died.</p>
<p>This chain of documentary evidence, having its first link in Scripture itself, and broken nowhere, puts the sojourn of St. Peter in Rome among the best-ascertained facts in history. It is further strengthened by a similar chain of monumental evidence, which Lanciani, the prince of Roman topographers, sums up as follows: "For the archaeologist the presence and execution of Sts. Peter and Paul in Rome are facts established beyond a shadow of doubt, by purely monumental evidence!" (Pagan and Christian Rome, 123).</p>
<ul>
<li>St. Peter's successors carried on his office, the importance of which grew with the growth of the Church. In 97 serious dissensions troubled the Church of Corinth. The Roman Bishop, Clement, unbidden, wrote an authoritative letter to restore peace. St. John was still living at Ephesus, yet neither he nor his interfered with Corinth. Before 117 St. <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignatius_of_Antioch_9e29.html" title="Ignatius of Antioch">Ignatius of Antioch</a> addresses the Roman Church as the one which "presides over charity . . . which has never deceived any one, which has taught others." St. Irenaeus (180-200) states the theory and practice of doctrinal unity as follows, using Rome as an example of apostolic succession:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>With this Church [of Rome] because of its more powerful principality, every Church must agree, that is the faithful everywhere, in this [i. e. in communion with the Roman Church] the tradition of the Apostles has ever been preserved by those on every side.</i> (Adv. Haereses, III)</p>
<p>During the 464 years between the accession of Constantine (323) and the Seventh General Council (787), the whole or part of the Eastern episcopate lived in schism for approximately two hundred and three years: namely from the Council of Sardica (343) to St. John Chrysostom (389), 55 years; owing to Chrysostom's condemnation (404-415), 11 years; owing to Acadius and the Henoticon edict (484-519), 35 years; total, 203 years (Duchesne). They do, however, claim doctrinal connection with the Apostles, sufficient to their mind to stamp them with the mark of Apostolicity.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Talk%7EApostolic_Succession_910a.html" title="Edit section: The Anglican continuity claim">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Anglican continuity claim</span></h4>
<p>The Anglican High-Church party asserts its continuity with the pre-Reformation Church in England, and through it with the Catholic Church of Christ. "At the Reformation we but washed our face" is a favourite Anglican saying.</p>
<p>Of all the Churches now separated from Rome, none has a more distinctly Roman origin than the Church of England. It has often been claimed that St. Paul, or some other Apostle, evangelized the Britons. It is certain, however, that whenever Welsh annals mention the introduction of Christianity into the island, invariably they conduct the reader to Rome.</p>
<p>In the "Liber Pontificalis" (ed. Duchesne, I, 136) we read that "Pope Eleutherius received a letter from Lucius, King of Britain, that he might be made a Christian by his orders." The incident is told again and again by the Venerable Bede; it is found in the Book of Llandaff, as well as in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; it is accepted by French, Swiss, German chroniclers, together with the home authorities Fabius, Henry of Huntingdon, William of Malmesbury, and Giraldus Cambrensis.</p>
<p>The Saxon invasion swept the British Church out of existence wherever it penetrated, and drove the British Christians to the western borders of the island, or across the sea into Armorica, now French Brittany. No attempt at converting their conquerors was ever made by the conquered. Rome once more stepped in. The missionaries sent by Gregory the Great converted and baptized King Ethelbert of Kent, with thousands of his subjects. In 597 Augustine was made Primate over all England, and his successors, down to the Reformation, have ever received from Rome the pallium, the symbol of super-episcopal authority. The Anglo-Saxon hierarchy was thoroughly Roman in its origin, in its faith and practice, in its obedience and affection; witness every page in Bede's "Ecclesiastical History". A like Roman spirit animated the nation. Among the saints recognized by the Church are twenty-three kings and sixty queens, princes, or princesses of the different Anglo-Saxon dynasties, reckoned from the seventh to the eleventh century. Ten of the Saxon kings made the journey to the tomb of St. Peter, and his successor, in Rome. Anglo-Saxon pilgrims formed quite a colony in proximity to the Vatican, where the local topography (Borgo, Sassia, Vicus Saxonum) still recalls their memory. There was an English school in Rome, founded by King Ine of Wessex and Pope Gregory II (715-731), and supported by the Romescot, or Peter's-pence, paid yearly by every Wessex family. The Romescot was made obligatory by Edward the Confessor, on every monastery and household in possession of land or cattle to the yearly value of thirty pence.</p>
<p>The Norman Conquest (1066) wrought no change in the religion of England. St. Anselm of Canterbury (1093-1109) testified to the supremacy of the Roman Pontiff in his writings (in Matthew 16) and by his acts. When pressed to surrender his right of appeal to Rome, he answered the king in court: You wish me to swear never, on any account, to appeal in England to Blessed Peter or his Vicar; this, I say, ought not to be commanded by you, who are a Christian, for to swear this is to abjure Blessed Peter; he who abjures Blessed Peter undoubtedly abjures Christ, who made him Prince over his Church. St. Thomas Becket shed his blood in defence of the liberties of the Church against the encroachments of the Norman king (1170). Grosseteste, in the thirteenth century, writes more forcibly on the Pope's authority over the whole Church than any other ancient English bishop, although he resisted an ill-advised appointment to a canonry made by the Pope. In the fourteen century Duns Scotus teaches at Oxford "that they are excommunicated as heretics who teach or hold anything different from what the Roman Church holds or teaches." In 1411 the English bishops at the Synod of London condemn Wycliffe's proposition "that it is not of necessity to salvation to hold that the Roman Church is supreme among the Churches." In 1535 Blessed John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, is put to death for upholding against Henry VIII the Pope's supremacy over the English Church. The most striking piece of evidence is the working of the oath taken by archbishops before entering into office: "I, Robert, Archbishop of Canterbury, from this hour forward, will be faithful and obedient to St. Peter, to the Holy Apostolic Roman Church, to my Lord Pope Celestine, and his successors canonically succeeding...I will, saving my order, give aid to defend and to maintain against every man the primacy of the Roman Church and the royalty of St. Peter. I will visit the threshold of the Apostles every three years, either in person or by my deputy, unless I be absolved by apostolic dispensation...So help me God and these holy Gospels." (Wilkins, Concilia Angliae, II, 199).</p>
<p>Chief Justice Bracton (1260) lays down the civil law of this country thus: "It is to be noted concerning the jurisdiction of superior and inferior courts, that in the first place as the Lord Pope has ordinary jurisdiction over all in spirituals, so the king has, in the realm, in temporals." The line of demarcation between things spiritual and temporal is in many cases blurred and uncertain; the two powers often overlap, and conflicts are unavoidable. During five hundred years such conflicts were frequent. Their very recurrence, however, proves that England acknowledged the papal supremacy, for it requires two to make a quarrel. The complaint of one side was always that the other encroached upon its rights. Henry VIII himself, in 1533, still pleaded in the Roman Courts for a divorce. Had he succeeded, the supremacy of the Pope would not have found a more strenuous defender. It was only after his failure that he questioned the authority of the tribunal to which he had himself appealed. In 1534 he was, by Act of Parliament, made the Supreme Head of the English Church. The bishops, instead of swearing allegiance to the Pope, now swore allegiance to the King, without any saving clause. Blessed John Fisher was the only bishop who refused to take the new oath; his martyrdom is the first witness to the breach of continuity between the old English and the new Anglican Church. Heresy stepped in to widen the breach.</p>
<p>The Thirty-nine Articles teach the Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith alone, deny purgatory, reduce the seven sacraments to two, insist on the fallibility of the Church, establish the king's supremacy, and deny the pope's jurisdiction in England. Mass was abolished, and the Real Presence; the form of ordination was so altered to suit the new views on the priesthood that it became ineffective, and the succession of priests failed as well as the succession of bishops. (See ANGLICAN ORDERS.) Is it possible to imagine that the framers of such vital alternations thought of "continuing" the existing Church? When the hierarchical framework is destroyed, when the doctrinal foundation is removed, when every stone of the edifice is freely rearranged to suit individual tastes, then there is no continuity, but collapse. The old façade of Battle Abbey still stands, also parts of the outer wall, and one faces a stately, newish, comfortable mansion; green lawns and shrubs hide old foundations of church and cloisters; the monks' scriptorium and storerooms still stand to sadden the visitor's mood. Of the abbey of 1538, the abbey of 1906 only keeps the mask, the diminished sculptures and the stones--a fitting image of the old Church and the new.</p>
<p>Dr. James Gairdner, whose "History of the English Church in the 16th Century" lays bare the essentially Protestant spirit of the English Reformation, in a letter on "Continuity" (reproduced in the Tablet, 20 January, 1906), shifts the controversy from historical to doctrinal ground. "If the country," he says, "still contained a community of Christians--that is to say, of real believers in the great gospel of salvation, men who still accepted the old creeds, and had no doubt Christ died to save them--then the Church of England remained the same as before. The old system was preserved, in fact all that was really essential to it, and as regards doctrine nothing was taken away except some doubtful scholastic propositions."</p>

<dd>I have reverted the changes to the LDS section. First, the NPOV tag was added anonymously on 5 March 2006 by 202.1.165.40 with no discussion on the discussion page or any comment on the change itself. Secondly, the changes made to supposedly "correct" the NPOV were not relevant to any NPOV issue and greatly confused the section. Some comments were erroneous, some were irrelevant, and the text contained spelling errors. If there is an actual NPOV issue and not just vandalism, let's discuss it and correct it properly. <a href="../../../b/h/l/User%7EBhludzin_20c6.html" title="User:Bhludzin">Bhludzin</a> 05:14, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the assertions aren't irrelevant, as they explain why JW's reject this doctrine. To see whether they're supported, one would have to investigate the references. Assuming the references confirm that the JW's make these claims, they're fine. One reason this might be worth including is because the doctrine of Apostolic Succession is a significant challenge to the JW's, Mormons, and any other denomination that has deliberately made a complete break with the historic church. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 16:41, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>The Reply of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York (1896) effectively demolished avery one of Leo's arguments and pointed out that his own arguments to nullify Anglican Orders nullified his own.

<p>I reverted the rather lengthy parenthetical statement querying why Anglicans might be interested in establishing alternative lines of succession. My thoughts are that by "adding-in" a recognised line, combined with the changes to ordinals could in future lead to a "way around" Apostolicae Curae, neither "side" would have to admit that they were previously in the wrong, but RCs could recognise Anglican orders as being valid.

<dd>I disagree - respectfully. Many external links are to articles that attempt to or "intended to prove a point." What's wrong with that? And where is stated in Wikipedia policy that the purpose of such links is <i>only</i> to provide "a neutral analysis of the relevant sources by a noted scholar?" I dont think such a restriction exists. As for Mr. Miller's "opinions," they are most certainly in accord with Catholic teaching in this area.

<p>Minor alteration: In the list of churches I altered the "Catholic Church" reference to "Roman Catholic Church." I assume the reason for omitting "Roman" here was not to alienate the Eastern rites but since many churches consider themselves part of the catholic Church using this term to refer to one church in such a formal listing can be potentially offensive. I realize that "Catholic Church" is commonly used in many informal settings but it seems we should be careful in this setting. --Mcorazao 04:05, 13 January 2007 (UTC)<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, the Eastern Rites of the Church are part of the "Catholic Church." But Not the "ROMAN" Catholic Church. The Word "Roman" describes the Rite (Latin-Rite), which the other churches are NOT part of therefore, the appropriate term to use is&#160;:CATHOLIC CHURCH (including its rites). <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJyoz_3281.html" title="User:Jyoz">Jyoz</a></li>
