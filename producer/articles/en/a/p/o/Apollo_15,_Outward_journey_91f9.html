Launch of <i>Apollo 15</i> from Launch Complex 39A</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The crew were awakened at 4:19 am <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Standard_Time_Zone_3d34.html" title="Eastern Standard Time Zone">EST</a>. After brief medical exams, they ate <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakfast.html" title="Breakfast">breakfast</a> with the backup and support crews. They then put on their pressure suits and were taken by <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van.html" title="Van">van</a> to the launch site, where they arrived at 6:45 am. This was about 2Â½ hours before launch. During the launch phase of the flight, Scott would sit in the left-hand seat of the CSM, Worden in the center seat, and Irwin in the right-hand seat.</p>
<p><i>Apollo 15</i> launched at 9:34:00 am EST on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_26.html" title="July 26">July 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>. One of the few problems encountered during the launch phase came at the separation of the first and second stages. Solid-fuelled retrorockets had been removed from the interstage between the first and second stages. These rockets were used to settle the fuel and <a href="../../../o/x/i/Oxidizer.html" title="Oxidizer">oxidizer</a> in the S-II. The first stage engines did not cutoff cleanly, taking over four seconds to drop from 2% thrust to zero. This meant that the S-IC was closer to the S-II than planned and the ignition of the second stage disabled the telemetry package on the first stage.</p>
<p>Eleven minutes and 34 seconds after launch the crew were in their Earth parking orbit 92.5 by 91.5 nm (171.3 by 169.5 km). An orbit of this height is not sustainable for very long due to friction with the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth%27s_atmosphere.html" title="Earth's atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a>, but the crew would only spend three hours before reigniting the <a href="../../../s/-/i/S-IVB_b9de.html" title="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> third stage to put them on a lunar-bound trajectory. About 485 lb (220 kg) of liquid oxygen (<a href="../../../l/o/x/LOX_eeac.html" title="LOX">LOX</a>) was lost through an open vent of the S-IVB after the rocket was pitched down too quickly after cutoff.</p>
<p>One of the windows of the <i>Apollo 15</i> CSM was specifically designed to transmit <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultraviolet.html" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> radiation, permitting the crew to acquire UV photographs of the Earth and the Moon. These photographs began as soon as they reached Earth orbit and would continue throughout the mission. During times when they were not using the window, Mission Control had them place a cover over the window that blocked the UV, in an effort to minimize their exposure.</p>
<p>Two hours, 50 minutes and 2.6 seconds after launch the S-IVB reignited and burned for 5 minutes and 49 seconds. The burn would increase the spacecraft's speed from 25,620 feet per second (7,809 m/s) to 35,522 feet per second (10,827 m/s). The altitude had been raised to 167.4 nautical miles (310.0 km).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_15%2C_Outward_journey_91f9.html" title="Edit section: Engine problems">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Engine problems</span></h2>
<p>The next major task for the crew was Transposition, Docking and Extraction. The <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Lunar_Module_61b7.html" title="Apollo Lunar Module">Lunar Module</a> sat below the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Command_Service_Module_9517.html" title="Apollo Command/Service Module">Command/Service Module</a>, head-to-tail. As such, it was required for the CSM to separate from the S-IVB, travel a short distance, turn 180 degrees and then dock with and extract the Lunar Module. First the CSM separated, taking ten minutes to turn, come back and hard dock. About half an hour later, after pressurizing the Lunar Module and checking the integrity of the docking latches, the crew extracted <i>Falcon</i> from the S-IVB. The S-IVB would be put on a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trajectory.html" title="Trajectory">trajectory</a> so that it would impact the lunar surface at 3Â°39'S, 7Â°35'W.</p>
<p>It was sometime during the Transposition and Docking that the "SPS Thrust" light on the Entry Monitor System part of the control panel came on. The Service Propulsion System (SPS) was the rocket engine of the CSM and this particular light was used to indicate the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valve.html" title="Valve">valves</a> in the engine were open and that the rocket should be firing, something that was not in fact happening. As a precaution the crew opened the circuit breakers that controlled the valves to stop them being opened by an <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_circuit.html" title="Short circuit">short circuit</a> and causing the engine to fire.</p>
<p>After some period of troubleshooting it was determined that there was a short circuit in the "Delta-V Thrust" <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switch.html" title="Switch">switch</a>. This switch opened the valves in the SPS. With the cause being in the switch it meant that the engine itself was fine, but new procedures would have to be used when operating the engine to stop accidental ignition.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the success of the Apollo program was the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redundancy_%28engineering%29.html" title="Redundancy (engineering)">redundancy</a> of critical systems â in the case of the SPS, there were two independent valve systems for the engine. The short in the switch only affected one of these sets of valves and as such it was still possible to fire the engine. But instead of having both sets of valves open at the start of each ignition, only the trouble-free valves would be used. For long burns, the valves affected by the short would be opened only after ten seconds, and closed before the end of the burn.</p>
<p>Mission Control decided to cancel the first midcourse correction (MCC-1). This would give them a chance to fire the SPS engine at the second planned correction. This cancellation meant that tasks that would have been done later could be brought forward and the crew could get to <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep.html" title="Sleep">sleep</a> sooner. These tasks included a <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a> dump and putting the spacecraft into Passive Thermal Control (PTC) or what was often called "<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbecue.html" title="Barbecue">barbecue</a> mode", as the spacecraft was put into a slow <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_dynamics.html" title="Flight dynamics">roll</a> so that there was even heat distribution. Nearly 15 hours after launch, the crew switched off the lights in the cabin and went to sleep.</p>
<p><a name="Day_2" id="Day_2"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_15%2C_Outward_journey_91f9.html" title="Edit section: Day 2">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Day 2</span></h2>
<p>The second day of <i>Apollo 15</i> centered around the second planned midcourse correction and the a preliminary check of the Lunar Module, <i>Falcon</i>. <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission_Control_e156.html" title="Mission Control">Mission Control</a> first got the crew to perform 0.7 second burn of the SPS engine before the planned second course correction. This was designed to isolate the location of the short in the Delta-V Thrust switch. The burn allowed Mission Control to confirm that the SPS would only be ignited accidentally if the faulty switch was armed. It was found after the flight that a 0.06 inch (1.4 mm) length of wire had found its way into the switch, and had shorted it. The engine burn itself was good enough, adding 5.3 ft/s (1.62 m/s) to their speed, that Mission Control cancelled the planned second and third course corrections.</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../v/e/n/Vent.html" title="Vent">venting</a> the atmosphere of the Lunar Module overboard (in case there was some <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contamination.html" title="Contamination">contamination</a> in the spacecraft), and then replenishing it from the CSM, the crew removed the <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatch_%28door%29.html" title="Hatch (door)">hatch</a> between <i>Endeavour</i> and <i>Falcon</i> and entered the LM. Scott and Irwin checked the switch settings in the LM to make sure none had changed since launch and also checked the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electricity.html" title="Electricity">electrical</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/i/Built_environment.html" title="Built environment">environmental</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communication.html" title="Communication">communications</a> systems. They found that a glass cover on one of the tapemeters had broken and that there was glass in the cabin. This did not impair the meters use, but was of concern, as glass could be inhaled by the crew or get into the environmental systems. After replacing the hatch, the crew ate and got to the bed to end their first full day in space.</p>
<p><a name="Day_3" id="Day_3"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_15%2C_Outward_journey_91f9.html" title="Edit section: Day 3">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Day 3</span></h2>
<p>The 'morning' of the third day centered around an <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eye.html" title="Eye">eye</a> flash experiment. Some previous crews had experienced bright flashes even when they closed their eyes. Irwin reported that he had seen them during the two previous sleep periods. The experiment involves the crew facing in the same direction, wearing <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blindfold.html" title="Blindfold">blindfolds</a> and having placed <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shade.html" title="Shade">shades</a> over the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Window.html" title="Window">windows</a>. They described the position, color and time of the flashes. They spent an hour doing this. It is thought that the flashes were caused by high energy <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_ray.html" title="Cosmic ray">cosmic rays</a> passing through the eyes.</p>
<p>The crew entered <i>Falcon</i> for a second time. Mission Control had them <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuum.html" title="Vacuum">vacuum</a> the spacecraft and the leave the <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuum_cleaner.html" title="Vacuum cleaner">vacuum cleaner</a> running while they did the rest of their <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housekeeping.html" title="Housekeeping">housekeeping</a>. This was in an effort to remove any <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glass.html" title="Glass">glass</a> particles left in the cabin. During this period, the spacecraft passes the point when the lunar <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> becomes stronger than that of the Earth's as felt by <i>Apollo 15</i>.</p>
<p>After a quiet day, the crew had some problems after they discover a water leak. Due to zero-gravity the water was just a large ball, and although the spacecraft was water-proof, if it had grown too large and broken apart, water everywhere would have been unpleasant for the crew. The leak came from a loose fitting on the <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chlorine.html" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a> injector outlet. During the flight the crew would add chlorine to the water to stop any <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacterium.html" title="Bacterium">bacterial</a> or <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fungus.html" title="Fungus">fungal</a> growths. The place where this was injected into the tank had come loose.</p>
<p><a name="Day_4_and_LOI" id="Day_4_and_LOI"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_15%2C_Outward_journey_91f9.html" title="Edit section: Day 4 and LOI">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Day 4 and LOI</span></h2>
<p>The fourth day saw fourth planned midcourse correction, although it was only the second actually performed on the mission. The burn lasted 0.91 seconds, adding 5.4 ft/s (1.65 m/s) to their speed. The crew then put on their <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_suit.html" title="Space suit">space suits</a> for the jettisoning of the SIM bay door. This door was jettisoned using <a href="../../../e/x/p/Explosive_material.html" title="Explosive material">explosive</a> cord and there was a small risk that it could cause the spacecraft to depressurize. It was possible, in an emergency for the crew to spend the cruise back to Earth in their pressurised space suits.</p>
<p>The major event of day 4 was Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI). Occurring behind the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a>, out of contact with the Earth, this engine burn put the spacecraft into <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetary_orbit.html" title="Planetary orbit">orbit</a> around the Moon. It was the first test of the new procedures for using both SPS during a long burn.</p>
<p>Loss of Signal (LOS) was at 78 hours, 23 minutes and 31 seconds GET as the spacecraft went behind the Moon as seen from the Earth. This was about 8 minutes before LOI. As with all the LOI performed during <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Apollo_b4b9.html" title="Project Apollo">Project Apollo</a> it was perfect, the SPS burned for 6 minutes and 38 seconds, placing them into a 169 by 59 nautical miles (313 by 109.3 km) orbit.</p>

</div>
<p>Much of the first hour or so in lunar orbit was spent describing the landforms they were orbiting above. The crew had become highly trained field <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geologist.html" title="Geologist">geologists</a>, especially Worden who spent time observing the Earth from an airplane, trained by <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farouk_El-Baz_0929.html" title="Farouk El-Baz">Farouk El-Baz</a>. They also photographed many features, with this crew being the first to enter into a highly <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inclination.html" title="Inclination">inclined</a> orbit. Previous Apollo crews had been in lunar orbits that were just over <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equator.html" title="Equator">equatorial</a> regions.</p>
<p>The Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI) burn was performed behind the Moon on the second orbit. This burn placed them into a 58.8 by 9.5 nautical mile (108.9 by 17.6 km) orbit, with the low point over Hadley Rille landing site. On <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_11.html" title="Apollo 11">Apollo 11</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_12.html" title="Apollo 12">Apollo 12</a></i> this burn was done by the Lunar Module after it had undocked from the Command/Service Module. From <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_14.html" title="Apollo 14">Apollo 14</a></i> onwards it was done by the CSM as a way of conserving fuel on the LM, allowing it to land with more equipment and consumables onboard.</p>
<p>A major issue for all lunar orbiting spacecraft are <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_concentration.html" title="Mass concentration">mass concentrations</a> or mascons. These are regional areas where it is believed that <a href="../../../d/e/n/Density.html" title="Density">dense</a> material is under the surface. <i>Apollo 15</i> travelled over regions that had never been covered on previous flights, so it was unknown how its orbit would be affected by them. Mission Control predicted that by the time the crew awoke the next 'morning', the lowest point of their orbit, <a href="../../../a/p/s/Apsis.html" title="Apsis">perilune</a>, will have dropped to about 8.6 nm (16.1 km) but this will turn out to be an underestimate.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_15%2C_Outward_journey_91f9.html" title="Edit section: Lunar orbit up to PDI">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lunar orbit up to PDI</span></h2>
<p>During the crew's sleep period, the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectroscopy.html" title="Mass spectroscopy">mass spectrometer</a> was collecting the prime part of its data. The spacecraft was kept in a perfect attitude for the instrument which was designed to investigate the extremely tenuous <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celestial_body_atmosphere.html" title="Celestial body atmosphere">lunar atmosphere</a>. The "Apollo 15 Preliminary Science Report" said that most of the measurements of gas made by the spectrometer were actually caused by the spacecraft itself.</p>
<p>The crew was woken 18 minutes early when it was found that their orbit had decayed to 58.8 by 7.6 nm (108.8 by 14.1 km). The low point was lower than planned for and the crew would have to perform a small trim burn to raise this. This was done on the opposite side of the Moon to their landing site at the end of their ninth orbit of the Moon. It was a 20 second burn of the Reaction Control System (RCS) and added 3.1 ft/s (0.94 m/s) to their speed. It raised the lowest point of their orbit to about 9.6 nm (17.8 km).</p>
<p>During the eleventh orbit, Scott and Irwin began to transfer to <i>Falcon</i>. The crew spent the period behind the Moon activating the LM and general housekeeping in preparation for the undocking. They also updated the guidance computer on the LM and made <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark.html" title="Landmark">landmark</a> sightings to improve the accuracy of the known position of the landing site.</p>
<p>Undocking was meant to come at the end of their eleventh orbit of the Moon, but delayed by an improperly attached <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umbilical_cable.html" title="Umbilical cable">umbilical</a> that sent the signal to the docking probe to disengage. After Worden fixed the connection, undocking and separation occurred properly about half an orbit late. The only effect of the late separation was the need to delay some landmark sighting by one orbit.</p>
<p>At the end of the twelfth orbit, Worden performed a circularization burn with SPS, raising the perilune of his orbit. The reason for this was that in the case of an abort during landing by <i>Falcon</i>, a circular orbit is much easier for <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_rendezvous.html" title="Space rendezvous">rendezvous</a> than to an <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliptic_orbit.html" title="Elliptic orbit">elliptic orbit</a>. Without the LM, the SPS only had to burn for 4 seconds, raising its orbit to 65.2 by 54.8 nm (120.7 by 101.4 km). During the 13th orbit, Worden placed <i>Endeavour</i> into the science collecting <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_attitude.html" title="Aircraft attitude">attitude</a>.</p>
<p>On <i>Falcon</i>, Scott and Irwin continued to check the spacecraft, and prepared for Powered Descent, when they would burn the Descent Engine of the LM to begin their landing.</p>
