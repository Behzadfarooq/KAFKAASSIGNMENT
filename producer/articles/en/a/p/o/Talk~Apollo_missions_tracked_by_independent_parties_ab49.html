<p>This page is a POV fork of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings_d3ac.html" title="Independent evidence for Apollo Moon landings">Independent evidence for Apollo Moon landings</a>. It has been started in an attempt to delete content from that page, following a content dispute that remains unresolved.

<dd>Could you explain why you think that this article is a POV fork? In particular, could you explain what POV it is catering to, and that POV that it is ignoring? Also, could you please discuss changes on the talk page?

<dd>Gravitor, There is no consensus on your article. It only looks like it because it hasn't been edited for awhile.

<p>Gravitor: I apologize in advance, but I am no longer going to respond to you until you start responding to the questions asked of you on the talk pages. If you read through these, you will see that most of us have responded to every concern you have brought up (even though you might have disagreed). You, on the other hand, consistently evade our questions. As one example: Why don't you answer my question above as to why you think that this article is a POV fork, and describe that POV that the article is catering to? I am glad to see that your level of disruptive behavior has diminished somewhat since the filing of the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Gravitor_8549.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Gravitor">RfC</a> on your behavior, but as a professional editor in real life, I still find your behavior unacceptable. So, once again, I apologize for ignoring you in the future; you are just a colossal waste of my time. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 09:38, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This should be merged into the original article - as above - this is a POV fork. We did not go 11:17, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> the user who put the merge tag on has only 4 edits on wikipedia. Most likely he/she hasn't read the entire talk page on the evidence article. As we all know this page was agreed by most that it should be created, and the rest of the stuff we are dealing with now. Gravitor said that it has nothing to do with the hoax. But it does! Who needs evidence if they already believe that the moon landings happened. This article puts the old one into a new POV, one that more people will want to read. 6% of Americans don't believe the moon landings happened. so 94% of Americans would not want to look at an article with evidence of the moon landings. This one has to do with tracking and observations of apollo missions. The other one's title doesn't fit most of the sections. Evidence of Moon Landings has nothing to do with the missions, which is one of the sections. And last, on the Independent Evidence article, We did not go said: "<b>Leave it as it is - no need to merge, and certainly not delete</b>." Then he puts the merge tag on one of the articles and not the other. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBranson03_ab4e.html" title="User:Branson03">Branson03</a> 12:45, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - the reason this is here was to split it off from <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings_d3ac.html" title="Independent evidence for Apollo Moon landings">that very same article</a>, see the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Talk%7EIndependent_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings_2974.html" title="Talk:Independent evidence for Apollo Moon landings">talk page</a> there where it is discussed <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_nauseum.html" title="Ad nauseum">ad nauseum</a></i>. I too fail to see how this is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_fork_160a.html" title="WP:POV fork">point of view fork</a>, and would appreciate somebody setting out for me, using very small words, how it is such. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeG_3209.html" title="User:LeeG">LeeG</a> 03:17, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We did not go is just saying it is a POV Fork, because <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> said it was. POV Forks is when the NPOV rule is broken. The article is in a NPOV. For We did not go, a non-NPOV would be if the hoax article said that it is fact, not a theory, because it has never (*and never will be*) proven. (The *s represent a non-NPOV statement). <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBranson03_ab4e.html" title="User:Branson03">Branson03</a> 22:44, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Oppose</b> - as Gravitor kept saying, "This has nothing to do with the hoax." OK, now I'm quoting Gravitor, which is scary.
