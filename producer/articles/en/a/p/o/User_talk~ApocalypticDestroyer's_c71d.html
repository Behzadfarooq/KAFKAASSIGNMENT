<dd>Thanks for the help. I will apologise to Bishonen and Isberg for posting on Isberg talkpage. However, Bishonen already <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=100771439&amp;oldid=100757749" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=100771439&amp;oldid=100757749" rel="nofollow">admitted</a> that Isberg is his sockpuppet.

<dl>
<dd>Not looking good. People are convinced you've been abusive. Personally, that's not what I saw in your contributions, and I've said so on <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#User:Guardian_Tiger.7CGuardian_Tiger_and_the_unblock_template" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">ANI</a>. If there's anything abusive you've said or done that I've missed, then I suggest that now is a good time for you to bring it up and apologise before someone else points it out. Because either way, you'll be made to apologise for it before you're unblocked. If there isn't anything, then ANI has made a mistake. That's not common, but I'll keep trying to persuade them and I'm sure they'll keep trying to persuade me. We'll see what happens.

<dd>Thanks for the help Ben Aveling. There is nothing abusive about anything I've said or done that warrants a community ban for "disruption". Another user, <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a> has explained the situation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bishonen#Re:User:Guardian_Tiger" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bishonen#Re:User:Guardian_Tiger" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I will apologise if necessary and promise not to do anything not to do anything abusive. Unfortunately, I've been currently indef blocked so there is no way for me to defend myself on <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#User:Guardian_Tiger.7CGuardian_Tiger_and_the_unblock_template" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">ANI</a>.

<dd>Firstly, my apologies over Isberg, I was wrong, you were right. I thought it was a sock, but I didn't think it would be Bishonen's. You still owe her an apology for suggesting that she is not neutral. She may be mistaken, but she is not biased. As for ANI, I can act as your advocate. But first I suggest we give people a chance to respond to what I've already written, and then see what still needs to addressed.</dd>
<dd>I know it can be annoying to have to wait when you'd rather be making a contribution. Maybe you might like to have a look at <a href="../../../m/i/s/WP%7EMISSING_b880.html" title="WP:MISSING">WP:MISSING</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/n/WP%7EWANTED_8605.html" title="WP:WANTED">WP:WANTED</a> and find an article you'd like to create.

Hi, I'm still looking through your old edits - there are a lot of them. The problem for me is that even though there may not be any individual edit that is abusive, the collective effect of them might still be considered as being difficult. I realise there are other difficult editors out there, but that's life. Everyone has to be able to deal with that without getting too annoyed too often.</p>
<p>A couple of questions for you to help me.</p>
<ol>
<li>Apart from User:RevolverOcelotX, User:Apocalyptic Destroyer, and User:Guardian Tiger, what other accounts have you used in the past?</li>
<li>What is suspicious about October 8?</li>
<li>If I can get you unblocked, what sort of contribution do you expect to make to wikipedia? (Remember that wikilinking every instance of the word China is not considered a big contribution.)</li>
<li>Assuming you meet other editors with whom you disagree, how will you handle it in the future?</li>
<li>Would you agree to stay away from articles about China and Taiwan?</li>
<li>I'm sure you've seen <a href="../../../c/e/r/User_talk%7ECertified.Gangsta_e887.html#User:Guardian_Tiger_Timeline" title="User talk:Certified.Gangsta">User_talk:Certified.Gangsta#User:Guardian Tiger Timeline</a>. I'm sure it's not a complete picture of what happened, but are the facts he presents there accurate?</li>
<li>Is there anything that we should post on ANI that hasn't already been said?</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm still trying to work out how to build the case for the defence. It's difficult because the accusations against you are fairly vague, possibly because the offence people have taken hasn't come from any single post so much as the cummulative effect of a lot of posts.</p>
<p>Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 11:58, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, thanks for contacting me. I've had alot of old edits from my past account, but most of them are on <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">User:RevolverOcelotX</a>. I'll try my best to answer the questions.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Apart from User:RevolverOcelotX, User:Apocalyptic Destroyer, and User:Guardian Tiger, another account I used for a short time was User:RaGnaRoK SepHír0tH. However, the <i>vast</i> majority of my old edits comes from my original account <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">User:RevolverOcelotX</a>, which I had accumulated over 4000 edits on.</li>
<li>I'm not sure what you mean by October 8. Could you explain further?</li>
<li>If I can get unblocked, I expect to make different sorts of contributions than I have in the past. My interests include a wide range of articles such as East Asian history, Japan-related articles, and Video Games article.</li>
<li>If I meet other editors I disagree with, I will try to handle it by using the talk page instead of edit warring.</li>
<li>If necessary, I will agree to stay away from articles about China and Taiwan.</li>
<li>I've seen the "User:Guardian Tiger Timeline". I think it is a very distorted view of what happened and is very inaccurate. Most of the diffs Certified.Gangsta cited are content disputes and reasonable edits.</li>
<li>I'm not sure what else we could post on ANI but I believe not enough people had a chance to comment on the ANI thread. I am hoping that some editors who has interacted with myself and Certified.Gangsta in the past will have a chance to comment on the ANI thread such as: <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">User:Sumple</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENic_tan33_3da7.html" title="User:Nic tan33">User:Nic tan33</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">User:Jiang</a>, and <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">User:Enochlau</a>. Perhaps you can help contact them about the discussion on ANI?</li>
</ol>
<p>I've also noticed the accusations against me are are fairly vague but it doesn't seem like there is a clear consensus for a community ban on ANI.

<dd>While I don't think there was strong support for the ban, I don't think there was much opposition either. Once people determined that you were a sock, they accepted at face value the claim that you were an 'abusive' sock. That's why I want to dig into the timeline, and show that while you were a sock, you were not abusive. So we can go to people and say, look, he's been misrepresented. This is what happened, nothing abusive. Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 02:12, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that there wasn't strong support or opposition for the ban. User:Dmcdevit put "community ban for disruption" in my block log which IMO seems misleading because there wasn't strong support for it on ANI. I just find it strange that User:Dmcdevit said "unless anyone gives me any reason not too" on ANI but didn't reply afterwards on the ANI thread.

<p>Removing the emotive language, what's below seems to be the bones of prosecution case against Guardian Tiger. Without worrying yet about why the actions occurred, can you check that the below is a true and accurate representation of what is shown by the diffs. Some of the diffs provided aren't as good as they could be, they only show the last of a series of changes. But they should be good enough for the moment.

<dd>Other people have taken him at his word - that you are an abusive sock. So we need to show that your behaviour has been reasonably good. Think of Gangsta as the prosecuting attourney in this, and the admins as the judges. He's presented his evidence. The admins don't want to spend a lot of their time, so we have to make things as easy as possible for them, pull all the evidence together so they can just look at it and see what happened. Looking at the diffs, I can see that you have made some mistakes, so it is going to be a combination of asking for forgiveness and pleading misrepresentation. Continued below.

<dd>Thanks for the encouraging words. If you have a growing suspicion, which is obvious since the user's edit pattern and behaviors are so similar, please file a checkuser.

A good place to start is <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Lee_368a.html" title="Bruce Lee">Bruce Lee</a> where all 4 users are extremely zealous in editing and had gotten into numberous content disputes in that particular article.

Some other common and disrupting pattern this users and his socks do is constantly adding wikiproject: china tag to every single article, stalking my contributions and revert everything I edited, sometimes out of his usual scope (which is making hostile edits about Taiwan and Japan related articles and spreading communist propaganda) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keeley_Hazell&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99784004" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keeley_Hazell&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99784004" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>], [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wigger&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99783899" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wigger&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99783899" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>] and lots more.

<p>Hi, You might be interested in this: <a href="../../../w/h/y/Wikipedia%7EWhy_Wikipedia_is_not_so_great_f7b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Why Wikipedia is not so great">Wikipedia:Why_Wikipedia_is_not_so_great</a>.</p>
<p>I'm still going back through the edit history, trying to put together the case that shows that you shouldn't have received an indef ban. Eventually I'll get you to put an unblock request on this page. But we only get one chance at this, so I want to make sure the case is watertight. Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 22:23, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, I've seen the discussion on <a href="../../../c/e/r/User_talk%7ECertified.Gangsta_e887.html" title="User talk:Certified.Gangsta">User talk:Certified.Gangsta</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">User talk:Bishonen</a>, <a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">User talk:Dmcdevit</a>, and other talk pages but it doesn't seem like the admins have replied and given their opinions yet. I don't think argueing this on Certified.Gangsta's talk page is effective because it will quickly come down to a matter of content disputes because there are a few editors of this site which have clashed with me at different articles. I think this is a separate issue and requires the attention of an admin. Looking at the above evidence, I think my previous accounts above were reincarnations rather than socks because they were all editing at different times. I think we should post this on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">ANI</a> and perhaps revive the previous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive177#Guardian_Tiger_and_the_unblock_template" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive177#Guardian_Tiger_and_the_unblock_template" rel="nofollow">previous ANI thread</a> rather than posting an unblock request here because it would allow more editors and uninvolved admins to comment on it. It would also allow the larger community to review this block. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApocalypticDestroyer%27s_3405.html" title="User:ApocalypticDestroyer's">ApocalypticDestroyer's</a> 23:38, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We should probably do both. Post the unblock request (I'm feeling a need to really follow the rules and guidelines as precisely as possible) and post a message on ANI letting people know it's been posted for their comment. But not yet. At least, I don't think we'd succeed yet. Sorry, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 12:11, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know what we still need to do to get my account unblocked. The few editors which I have alluded to earlier which have clashed with me at different articles are <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECertified.Gangsta_104a.html" title="User:Certified.Gangsta">User:Certified.Gangsta</a> at <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>-related articles; and <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuckyDucky_7e9c.html" title="User:ShuckyDucky">User:ShuckyDucky</a> mostly at the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Lee_368a.html" title="Bruce Lee">Bruce Lee</a> article. However, I don't think these disputes I have had are very relevant here because I believe they are strictly a matter of content disputes and are not policy violations. I think the case is fairly watertight and we have enough alot of evidence above for this matter to be successful if we take this back to ANI. However, I don't think this page, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_RevolverOcelotX_allegations_25c8.html" title="User talk:BenAveling/RevolverOcelotX allegations">User talk:BenAveling/RevolverOcelotX allegations</a>, is necessary and I think it may be encroaching on my privacy. I don't think anybody has provided any substance to the allegations, but I think I've been unfairly blocked for many days now, which I could have been improving and expanding different articles. I wish to be unblocked ASAP because I want to do some useful editing and I promise not to make the same mistakes I did in the past. I think the best option now is to take this back to ANI ASAP. Please put this talk page on your watchlist.

<dd>Hi, I have this page watchlisted. I have 1,290 pages watchlisted. I did type a reply to you this morning, but I can't see it in the history. Maybe I hit the wrong button. Anyway, I've blanked that page. On reflection, it probably isn't necessary, unless we need to deal with specific claims. What do you want to say at ANI? Maybe something like "User requests a review and a lifting of the perma block. Acknowledges the following mistakes ... Promises not to do .... Denys having ever .... Wants to contribute by ... If asked, is prepared to ... " Something like that? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 10:55, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, I think saying something like "User requests a review and a lifting of the perma block. Acknowledges the following mistakes ... Promises not to do .... Denys having ever .... Wants to contribute by ..." on ANI is good. It might also help to post some of the evidence from above. It would probably also be a good idea to link to this talk page and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive177#Guardian_Tiger_and_the_unblock_template" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive177#Guardian_Tiger_and_the_unblock_template" rel="nofollow">previous ANI thread</a> to show that there is no strong consensus for a community ban of all accounts. Please let me know when you've posted on ANI and if there is anything else that needs to be done.

<dd>It looks like nobody except Certified Gangsta has any objections, and his objection seems to be that you're blocked, therefore you're blocked forever with no chance of redemption, which I don't think is the wiki-way. I'd unblock you myself if I were an admin. I suggest adding an {{unblock} request, linking to the discussion on on ANI and we'll see what happens.

<dd>Thanks, I've seen the previous ANI threads and it doesn't seem like there is any strong support for the block. How should I word the {{unblock}} request? Could you post a message on ANI letting people know it's been posted for their comment when I post my unblock request? On a related note, please see this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112696587" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112696587" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApocalypticDestroyer%27s_3405.html" title="User:ApocalypticDestroyer's">ApocalypticDestroyer's</a> 01:19, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess you need to explain that you were blocked in good faith but in error because you were a sock, which you are, but that you were not and are not disruptive, nor a banned user, and that you cannot and are no longer using the original account. Maybe have a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Unblock" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Unblock" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> and see what other people are putting.
