<dd>Yes, although we disagree I respect you for actually debating points and not resorting to censorship as ScienceApologist has done. I am not here to cause trouble but to have an honest intellectual debate about the validity of the moon landings. Also the reason why I don't edit the main page is because I know it is a hopeless endeavour, at least on the discussion page I thought I could express my views on this issue. <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoodle_boy_ab11.html" title="User:Noodle boy">Noodle boy</a> 02:58, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They are for discussion of the subject included in the main page. Once we can come to a concensus about the allegations we can move the allegation to the main page. This is the point of the talk page. What you are doing is censorship, plain and simple.

<p>Noodle boy has made some fine contribution in this discussion page. I see that they now are well hidden for the public. I consider this an injustice. Noodle Boy could of course refrase his contributions as suggested sections for the main article. Then ScienceApologist clearly would not have any formal reason to do censorship.</p>
<p>The main article as it is now has this function: People curious about the hoax accusations may look up the article, and within 30 seconds conclude that the hoax rumor is ridiculous. Just the first sentences, pictures with text, and perhaps read some of the long "rebuttals" which may seem resonable. The landing believers will want the page to stay that way. I do not think hoax proponents ever will se that this page presents the hoax claim in a fair way. I am surely not going to spend much energy on such a hopeless task. The topic is not really that important. But I will do some writing now and then, and support persons like Noodle boy. (Axlalta 11:58, 27 May 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Thanks for the support. Not only did they move all of my discussions to my user page, they blocked my IP so there is no way for me to edit on my main computer. The reason for this is beause supposedly I tried to avoid the 3-revert by using a "sockpuppet" which is ridiculous. I restarted my computer and edited it without signing in and next thing you know my IP is blocked. They claim that I tried to avoid the 3 revert rule but anybody who checks the history can see that when I was logged in as noodle boy I reverted the deleted discussions around 10 times. Anyways, no worries. I agree with you that the hoax allegation page will never be presented in a fair way. These people clearly have something to hide and moderators such as chairboy are blatantly Pro-Apollo so it's no surprise he blocked my IP. These actions actually make my convictions stronger that the whole thing was a fake. Clearly, as was already evident on the main page, they only include hoax allegations that are clearly easy to debunk. Also any hoax allegation links that make valid points will be deleted under the excuse that it is a "non-notable" link. Whatever that means I do not know, but it is censorship plain and simple. Glad you have enough good sense to at least question what is being told to you, unlike the sheeple that dominate this page.<a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoodle_boy_ab11.html" title="User:Noodle boy">Noodle boy</a> 15:07, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Burden of proof addition</span></h2>
<p>In my recent addition I point to something that could be taken as a weakness in the structure of this article as a whole. While lots of text is devoted to attacks and defense of the NASA version of events, the alternative theory is not examined on its own terms. I'd like to ask moon hoax proponents to assemble a complete narrative of what they believe happened so that the two versions of events can be placed on an equal standing for comparison. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 16:11, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Congratulations on starting the next round of the Edit Jihad on this article. The conspiracists have been arguing that the article is "too pro-NASA", and now you're asking them to "put up or shut up". However, you're likely to trip their trigger with this one, because you have pointed out that there is <i>no single theory</i> of the moon hoax, only the premise that "NASA lied about it". Further, they argue that anything they consider "suspicious", ranging from the amateurish photo mockup in Shepard's 1975 book to the worth-a-look theories about the alleged dangers of the Van Allen belts, is "proof" that NASA lied; meanwhile, any holes shot in their own arguments don't invalidate <i>their</i> original, unshakeable (and unprovable) premise that "NASA lied about it". Good luck, you'll need it. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:25, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not original. Phil Plat says the same thing on his radio show, and the recent PBS documentary "Evolution" describes the same tactic from Creationists. If we are talking about ideas, then the tactics of the idea's advocates are of central relevance. The most important question of all is why people choose to believe what they do, and why can two people look at the same data and reach such different conclusions. Details about cameras and shadows are background. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 02:07, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am not a moan hoax believer, but I do not like the new section. It seems like argument rather than neutral presentation. It's not that I disagree with your conclusions. On the contrary, it seems a fairly insightful point. But it is nonetheless presented as an original argument.</li>

<dd>I suggest you cite others making this argument and present it as a report of someone else's claims. You mention citations above. Give them explicitly in the article. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 07:32, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The whole claim and rebuttal section should be revamped. The hoax claims should be presented as they are. This is a documentation of what hoax advocates believe. It is not the place to refute their arguments. There should be a separate page for that. In the beginning of this article it is clearly stated that most scientists and general people believe the moon landings to be real. That is enough to let people know the mainstream take on this issue. This hoax allegation site should be just that. Hoax allegations. Then there could be a link to a hoax debunking page. This is the best and most neutral format.206.148.32.16 09:42, 30 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also, why should hoax advocates present an alternative theory? They are just questioning the anomalies of the Apollo record through seemingly "impossible" photographs or analyzing the technical hurdles involved. If any of their claims are true, then it simply means that we are not being told the whole truth about the Apollo missions. There is no need for Hoax advocatees to come up with an alternative story because only Nasa knows the truth about this issue, whether we went up to the moon or we didn't.206.148.32.16 09:42, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I like the new section. It provides a logical underpinning and correctly decribes the major difficulties with the moonbat theories for anyone of any intelligence and/or education. Splitting the article would constitute a content fork, which is against policy. There is every need for hoax advocates to come up with a cohesive and self-consistent alternative story; the fact they cannot is a clue as to why they are derided by most people who actually know anything about the subject. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 11:02, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. If we do this, then the article becomes it's own subject. It ceases to be an article about the Moon hoax theory, and becomes the theory itself.

<dd>This is the most unbalanced approach possible. There are an infinite number of questions that one could ask about Apollo. It is the same logic as saying that if even one Hoax argument is false then the landings must be true. Balance doesn't mean making both sides of the argument look equally good, it means holding both sides to equal scrutiny. This is why you must present an alternative theory. If you don't, then you have no position and your "evidence", even unanswered, means nothing.

<dd>Bringing up the former USSR of course adds another nail (or twenty) in the coffin of this idiotic conspiracy theory. As they were able to track, via radar, the entire mission, one thinks they'd've noticed, and commented upon, anything that was at variance with the Apollo missions landing on the moon. After all, this battle to land a man on the moon was a competition betwen the two countries, with national pride at stake. To think that they would just clam up if they knew (as they would have) that the mission was bogus is to show a complete misunderstanding of the dynamic between the two nations. (As would including them in an ever-widening conspiracy).</dd>
<dd>Expected rejoinder: "But that they tracked the spacecraft to the moon doesn't mean humans were on board, so there!". Alas, the Russians also tracked the conversations between mission control and the men on the moon, and could very easily determine whence the source of those radio signals (it's a simple matter of triangulation).</dd>
<dd>Finally, all of the other nonsensical "evidence", if it were true, would have been noticed and pounced upon by the Russians.

<p>Science appologist - I'm sorry that, like most NASA proponents, you prefer to communicate through reverting, with, if we are lucky, some barbed comment in the notes, I shall answer your question: It is only landing believers that use the term 'conspiracy theory'. No proponent of any theory ever describes it as a 'conspiracy theory'. It is a derogatory term used solely to disparage a theory that the writer wants to denegrate. Its usage is appropriate as a sourced comment, not under the guise of a neutral, 'factual' statement. For great justice. 17:16, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Quote?</span></h2>
<p>" By getting scientists bogged down in technical details such as why stars aren't visible or how a retrorocket landing might work, they overwhelm the non-technically trained audience into doubts, while distracting from larger issues like how to get tens of thousands of educated people in countries that were (at times) near war with each other to all keep silent for 40 years.

<dd>Yes, not all of them needed to be in on the hoax. The designers of the landing module might have believed it went to the moon. Again - is this a quote? If so, where does it come from? For great justice. 20:48, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Q: How could such a secret be kept from the world with so many people involved? (Didn't NASA have tens of thousands of people working on the Apollo project?)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A: This is the same logical question I asked before I did any research. Yet after having done eight years of investigation, I discovered that, in fact, very few people were involved in the actual faking. NASA, indeed, did have tens of thousands of people working constructing the nuts and bolts of the project. One team worked on the spacecraft hatch, another on the astronaut's boot, yet none of them saw an overview of the entire project, only those at the very top of the bureaucratic pyramid. All of those NASA guys at the computer consoles that you saw prior to the launch were receiving the exact same information as their colleagues sitting beside them, which was fed to all of them by a simulation computer program. If you look at the footage ten seconds prior to launch, they are all kicked back watching television, just like the rest of us. Apollo astronauts from later or previous missions were the ones at the real consoles. We know from the newly discovered behind-the-scenes footage that each crew was on the rocket during the launch. They went up in front of witnesses, splashed down in front of witnesses, yet the evidence recently uncovered proves that they never left Earth orbit. Apollo 11 was supposed to be the greatest event in human history, yet there were only three (government employee) witnesses and, for the first time ever, no independent press coverage of such an historical event.</p>
<p>With Cold War tensions running high, those who knew the truth went along with the deception to fool the Soviets that we had technological superiority.</p>
<p>In 1957 Time Magazine had on its cover "The Smartest Man in America" (the latest winner of the most popular TV trivia game show at that time.) It was later uncovered that the contestant received the answers in advance from the show's producers because he was widely loved by the viewers. In fact, one hundred twenty contestants and staff initially swore on the Bible during a grand jury investigation that the television show was not rigged. Most later recanted, and it is now known they all lied. If all these people were willing to lie for a little money, how much more for alleged national security? The fact is, Time Magazine was wrong. The best way to fool the world was to fool the media.</p>

<dd>Wow, the idiocy of that quote speaks for itself. I guess the tens of thousands of personal witnesses of various Saturn V launches doesn't count as evidence -- but I suppose the basic physics was never one of the moonbats strong suits. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 21:43, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, the solution is obvious - apply the scientific method. Test the prediction that, if NASA went to the moon, the debris should be there as the photos describe. You're hoisted by your own petard, because, if you follow through on your science rhetoric, you'd have to do an experiment that would prove you wrong. NASA won't do it.

<dd>In effect, the historical record is the "proof" for the Apollo flights. They don't have to "re-prove" anything just to satisfy the complaints of a few conspiracists (none of whom are responsible for NASA funding allocations, right?).

<dd>It's not proof, since the 'historical record', is just NASA photos, video and commentry. There is no independent record, since their claims have never been verified independently - a core part of the scientific method. Absolutely agree with you though that the hoax theorists don't control NASA funding, and, given that, why should NASA respond? Well, there's no political reason, the only reason they would respond is if they cared about the truth. Again, you evade the point that the theory IS falsifiable. For great justice. 16:45, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I said "proof", not <i>proof</i>. If it's true that NASA is the only source (which I question), then you still have to prove NASA lied. Their being the only source does not prove they lied. I have never gotten into the "falsifiability" mumbo jumbo, because it's as obvious as the nose on your face that the way to "prove" it to (almost) everyone's satisfaction is to go back to the moon and say, "See, there are the remnants of Apollo" or "Oops, there are no remnants of Apollo". If you really think your hard-earned tax dollars should go for a project like that, knock yourself out. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:00, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Both are "falsifiable" or "verifiable" depending on which term you want to use. You go there and look, or you develop a telescope strong enough to confirm it. Barring those measures, it comes down to whether you buy into the historical record or the conspiracists' rejection of it.

<dd>If you are not interested, then don't comment on it, but this section of the discussion was about whether or not the claim that the hoax accusations are not falsifiable should go in. Clearly it should not, because the claims are falsifiable. For great justice. 18:35, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm interested in it, just not interested enough to write about it, because it seems to have to do with whether either view is falsifiable <i>based on current evidence</i> as opposed to actually going there and answering the question definitively.

<dd>Reflectors on the moon don't prove that man set foot on the moon... but they prove that man had the technology to safely send a rocket through the Van Allen belts and to soft-land on the moon, which rubs out a large percentage of the hoax accusers' premise.

Duh, it's daytime! (Besides, given even the modest special effects used on Star Trek, the assumption that NASA would have been too dumb to put stars in the picture, <i>if they were supposed to be there</i> argues against a hoax as one cannot say, "they were too dumb to do a simple thing" and "they were really smart and could pull the wool over everyone's eyes".) <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">User:Jim62sch</a> 09:58, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Directional radio dishes were in use in 1969, but it wasn't always possible for the Apollo astronauts to use them - I recall reading about how they had to get out of the LEM, unfold the dish, and point it at earth before they could transmit video. I could be wrong, but I think that even the directional dishes on the moon would still cover the whole earth - a 10° signal spread concentrates far more power then 360°. I also recall something about spies in WWII having to be very careful about transmitting with radio for fear of being found by triangulation.

<dd>That's what I was getting at. It seems like you would have to put up a satellite that would be positioned in such a way that it would appear the signal was coming from the moon. As I recall from high school physics, the only way to actually do that would be to have the satellite <i>at the same distance from earth that the moon is</i>, or from the Apollo flight path. Assuming it could be confirmed that the signals were definitely coming from the Apollo flight path, the cons' next ready-made answer would be that the Apollo vehicles were just unmanned satellites, beaming earth-based signals back to earth on their way to soft-landing laser-reflective mirrors to fool us earthlings further. It gets more and more preposterous. It's like the kinds of wild theories you have to come up with in order to postulate backwards time travel. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:37, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>24) NASA launched the TETR-A satellite just months before the first lunar mission. The proclaimed purpose was to simulate transmissions coming from the moon so that the Houston ground crews (all those employees sitting behind computer screens at Mission Control) could "rehearse" the first moon landing. In other words, though NASA claimed that the satellite crashed shortly before the first lunar mission (a misinformation lie), its real purpose was to relay voice, fuel consumption, altitude, and telemetry data as if the transmissions were coming from an Apollo spacecraft as it neared the moon. Very few NASA employees knew the truth because they believed that the computer and television data they were receiving was the genuine article. Merely a hundred or so knew what was really going on; not tens of thousands as it might first appear. <a href="http://www.ufos-aliens.co.uk/cosmicapollo.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ufos-aliens.co.uk/cosmicapollo.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>

<p>Bart Sibrel's comments on this are: Q: Wouldn't the Russians find out and then tell the world?</p>
<p>A: This is another, very logical, yet superficial question. After thinking about it for some time, I believe that one of the major reasons for faking the moon missions was to fool the Soviets about US strategic and space capability during the height of the Cold War (like a bluff in poker.) In addition, the Soviets did not have the capability to track deep spacecraft until late in 1972, immediately after which, the last three Apollo missions were abruptly cancelled.</p>
<p>Even if the Russians did suspect the landings were not authentic, the act of calling us liars of this magnitude at the height of the Cold War could have instigated a war, and perhaps they thought it better not to chance that.</p>

<p>There is an interesting facet to conspiracy theories that I'm not sure has been fully explored. It could be called the Da Vinci Code syndrome. It has been applied to many different situations, from Biblical scholars trying to find hidden meanings in the scriptures based on lining the text up a certain way; to micro-inspection of the available JFK assassination video and photos to try to definitively prove (in vain, so far) that there was more than one shooter in Dealey Plaza; to Area 51, the "top secret" government testing site that everyone knows about. With Apollo, they started with the premise that NASA lied. They couldn't find any direct evidence of this assertion, however; no one in a position to know has "confessed". So, instead, they put on their Sherlock Holmes caps and looked for "clues". When they found enough of them to satisfy themselves, they proclaimed they had found "evidence" that NASA lied... even though most of their so-called "clues" have been shown to be either ignorant or willful misinterpretations of what they were seeing (such as the "waving flag" nonsense). Maybe the "Apollo Code syndrome" would actually be the better term. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:32, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>That the Apollo hoax theory fits the pattern of other conspiracy theories, a term which you don't like, but it fits like a glove. And while it is <i>possible</i> that there was more than one shooter in Dealey Plaza, there is no definitive <i>proof</i> of it. One of the cornerstones of the JFK consipiracists was that Oswald was not a good enough marksman to have fired 3 shots in 6 seconds. First, he <i>was</i> a good marksman. And second, the six seconds start with the first shot, so technically he only had to fire <i>two</i> shots in six seconds. Etc. Etc. The JFK story is pretty much off the conspiracist radar anymore, because too much time has passed and nothing new has emerged, and JFK remains dead (although one theory postulated that he had survived and was in a vegetative state; once the autopsy photos were made public, it pretty well put that one to rest). However, the Apollo story remains alive. It will die (except in the minds of a handful of hard-core doubters) when and if we return to the moon, which will require funding, and also a practical reason to go... other than to "prove" that the Apollo program happened, which would be a collosal waste of our tax dollars. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:51, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Anyway, this talk page makes an amazing read, you moonbats are quite off your rockers.

<dd>The Apollo question won't be settled to everyone's satisfaction, no matter what is done. And I do not necessarily believe the "full government account" of the JFK story. It is <i>possible</i> that Oswald acted alone, and it is also <i>possible</i> that he had co-conspirators and that, as with Tim McVeigh (as some have postulated), he kept silent and protected them. I <i>am</i> about 99% certain that Oswald was <i>involved</i>. I don't buy into the "vast government conspiracy" stuff that Oliver Stone came up with. There is no question that the government wanted to downplay any hint of conspiracy that might suggest the Soviets were behind it, as it would likely have triggered WWIII if it were true. But the conspiracists can't accept that one lone nut could do this to us, denying the fact that all it took was a rifle and the will to do it. As the years have gone by, we have seen that JFK had <i>many</i> enemies. The group with the greatest motivation, other than supporters of Fidel Castro, would seem to be the Mafia, as they felt betrayed by JFK. I have sometimes wondered if Oswald and some other independent assassin were coincidentally shooting him <i>at the same time</i>. Not likely, but <i>possible</i>. Unless any new evidence comes forward, I don't think we'll ever know the truth of the JFK situation for sure. That raises the question of the "falsifiability" of the many JFK assassination theories. That could require a book or two. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:07, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>IIRC there are still some govt archives that are sealed on the JFK issue, but I agree that, without new evidence, it's unlikely that there will be resolution. There is a difference between a case like the JFK assasination, where the evidence has been largely destroyed, and the Apollo landings, where, if they happened, the evidence should be in good condition, on the moon. We can't revisist the JFK moment, we can (if we want to) revisit the scene of the crime with Apollo. That's what makes the moon landing accusation falsifiable, and JFK not. For great justice. 18:42, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You might be right, and that's why I have to hedge on the JFK thing. <i>Maybe</i> once all the participants are long dead (along with us) the full truth will come out. There were a number of folks who also thought the Lincoln conspiracy was an "inside job", but after 141 years I think the chances of determining that are fairly slim. However, as with JFK, I wouldn't say with absolute certainty that it's "not falsiable", just "<i>probably</i> not falsifiable, or verifiable". Obviously, the final answer to the Apollo question is to go there again and either find or not find the Apollo remnants. Back to JFK, don't forget that the <i>Kennedys themselves</i> bear a good share of the responsibility for all this, as they went to some lengths to keep "sensitive" info out of the public eye... such as JFK's extramarital situations... and their reticence helped to fuel the conspiracists' flames. Maybe we need to invent that time machine and go back and revisit any number of historical events and find out what really happened.

<p>Guinnog, I'm glad the spirit of collaboration is alive and well - perhaps you could explain why you immediately reverted my addition of the 'Nazi Moon base' link to the See also section. It seems to me that it is a theory about conspiracy related to moon landings. What's the problem? For great justice. 16:37, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Whoever deleted this, maybe you should put it back. It provides a little perspective to the Apollo hoax story, as it is off the chart for silliness. One item I liked was that the Nazis supposedly met several alien races, and it was just begging for the postscript, "...and the Aryans were superior to every one of them." <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:39, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Urban legend?</span></h2>
<p>The moon hoax stories are not really urban legends. Urban legends are more like the stories about alligators in the sewers and tarantulas in the cactus plants. The moon hoax stories are conspiracy theories, i.e. the idea that there is a vast conspiracy (usually by the government) to hide the "real truth" about conventional history. Urban legends are usually about something innocuous, although they can cause harm, such as the claim that Procter &amp; Gamble's moon-and-stars logo was a satanic symbol, which was very hard to shake, even when very conservative Christian leaders like Jerry Falwell went to bat for the company. Conspiracy theories are like a parallel universe to generally accepted history. They are often hard to totally disparage, but they are also fad-like, so they tend to stick around for awhile until the next one comes along, or until proven or disproven definitively. Another good example of a conspiracy theory is the notion held by some (mostly leftists) that the U.S. government was either negligent or even responsible for the 9/11/01 attacks. This is of particular interest because it's similar to the notion held by some (mostly rightists) that the U.S. government was either negligent or even responsible for the Pearl Harbor attack on 12/7/41. In both cases, the allegations were raised by people who objected to our having gone to war over it. It now occurs to me that this section really belongs on the conspiracy theory page. Whatever.&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 19:52, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While they are certainly conspiracy theories, there is some overlap: They're narratives with many elements of folklore; they're usually thought to be true by those who repeat them; The points about the malign intent of the supposed perpetrators are sensationalized, as is characteristic of urban legends. I think 'collection of urban legends' succinctly summarizes the nature of the hoax stories. I suppose reasonable men might disagree, but the phrase would have to be up long enough for someone to see it and disagree with it. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 20:13, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is overlap, but they are not the same thing. One characteristic of urban legends is that there is virtually no evidence. Has anyone ever actually <i>seen</i> an alligator in a sewer? No, but those who talk about it know someone who knows someone who has seen them. By contrast, conspiracy theorists take bits and pieces of actual evidence, like a jigsaw puzzle with many pieces missing, and construct their own "picture" from it. Also, conspiracy theories are usually connected with politics in some way or another. Liberals like to talk about how there is a vast right wing conspiracy, and conservatives talk about how there is a vast left wing conspiracy. It's not a coincidence that the conspiracy theories really heated up during the Vietnam War and its aftermath. Of course, that's <i>my own</i> conspiracy theory.&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 20:22, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What's poor about it is that application of the scientific method to the scenario established competing hypotheses, it doesn't "require" the criteria you inserted. This criteria might be something that hoax proponents yearn for, I don't know, but the sentence is establishing the two possible hypotheses, it's not trying to describe what amount and kind of evidence is required for a "claim of a moon landing [to] be produced". What's more that sentence doesn't even make any sense. A "claim of a moon landing" can be "produced" whenever and however one likes.

<dd>I think there are very strong parallels.

And yet - I'm not aware that his story has ever raised sceptical questions, such as demands for independent evidence. The reasons why seem pretty clear. That species of cynicism which gives rise to conspiracy theories does not attach to the efforts of individuals, whose motivations are relatively easy for the casual observer to discern. It only gets properly <i>aroused</i> by the activities of large institutions (science, government, industry) whose sophistication is unsatisfying to those who prefer their truths simple - and whose authority appears to them as <i>de facto</i> grounds for suspicion. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 19:05, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Theory has special connotations in science and since there are "scientific aspects" to this topic we should avoid this (except in the special case of "conspiracy theory" which can be linked to a separate term). For the same reason "hoax theorist" should be avoided in the article. "Hoax proponent" or "hoax believer" is appropriate.</p>
<p>"NASA proponent" is an example of an inappropriate generalization. There are NASA proponents that argue in front of Congress for more funding for NASA. They are not involved in this topic. To avoid equivocation refer directly to the opposition they have to hoax believer's claims.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mirrors</span></h2>
<p>Let's get this one settled once and for all. Read the Lunar Ranging article. The Russian mission placed mirrors on the moon. They returned ranging data. A mechanical failure left them in a less than ideal position. This was a successful mission in that it proved that robot missions could place mirrors on the moon. Subequent failure of a motor is not the point. For great justice. 21:17, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The laser reflectors worked pretty well when the Americans put them there, since a manned mission allows for fine adjustments to things. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:30, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The point is that the robot mirrors worked fine, and are a good proof that robot missions can place mirrors acurately. The fact that, on that particular mission, the lander later malfunctioned is not relevant. You know that, so I don't know why you continue to press the point. Oh wait, yes I do. For great justice. 23:35, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And another point is that a soft-landing on the moon was well within the technological reach of both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., despite the hoaxsters continued argument that we lacked the technology to get to the moon. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:51, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nice change of subject. The russian mirror experiment proves that mirrors on the moon can be robot placed. Soft landing a robot without return capability is not the same problem as landing and returning humans. Capability to do one does not equal capability to do the other. For great justice. 23:56, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Some (or many) hoaxsters have argued that a soft-landing on the moon was impossible. Clearly, they have not thought it through. Similarly, they argue that taking off from the moon was impossible. Well, they got it wrong once, so their odds of getting it wrong again are good. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:11, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Their best guess would probably be that the supposedly manned launches were actually these robotic launches. I suppose that when the astronauts appeared to be boarding the spacecraft, they were actually ducking down some secret escape hatch. Not that the conspiracists indulge in speculation or anything like that. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:25, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have seen no records from anyone but NASA. You have not shown any. I have not seen anyone else produce any. If they exist - where are they? I'm not going to make assumptions without evidence, that's AstroNot logic again. The hypothesis that NASA faked the landings is based on supposed errors in NASA's account of the landings. There is no third party record available. For great justice. 00:27, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You've hit it on the head: "Supposed" errors. Everything the conspiracists come up with is easily shot down. They can't find anything or anyone to contradict the historical record.

<dd>Change the subject. There is NO INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE for NASA's claims. I know you believe anyway, and that's fine, you're entitled to your beliefs, but while I agree that the hoax claims are not proven, neither is NASA's case. For great justice. 00:40, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And you're entitled to define "independant" in any way you see fit, likely in such a way as to it not being possible to verify; according to a peculiar personal standard.

<dd>OK, so you're stuck in a corner. When asked to produce evidence for your position, you say you don't know whether any exists, and ask for evidence that you're wrong. This is like much pseudo science. This conversation is fruitless, since you don't have any independent evidence. If anyone else does, maybe they can chime in.

<dd>So if Bubba looked into his telescope during launch, saw the vehicles in orbit and leave orbit, that, instead of the evidence we do have in abundance would convince you? Oh wait, Bubba doesn't have image capture on his telescope, which are otherwise known as binoculars. My point is your definition of "independant" is likely laughable, and anything provided by say, other countries, could be dismissed as "unconvincing" or part of the conspiracy. Is there a compelling reason to find said evidence when you obviously have handily dismissed much of the evidence already presented in detail? - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 04:39, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>"Solidly debunked". Yeah, right. I tried to find some facts or serious arguments in the link. I only found this: "If the Apollo capsule was actually in a low-earth orbit as Sibrel claims, the observed cloud patterns would be whizzing by the screen at a very observable clip rather than remaining relatively fixed as we see in the video." Seriously?? What am i missing? He claims that the picture of the earth which was filmed should show moving clouds? I would think that a picture would not be showing moving clouds, or anything else moving. Does the page say anything about the blue light coming in from the windows late in the movie clip? I find the debunking argument as thin as the debunking arguments you find in one of Wikipedia's weakest pages, named "Apollo moon landing hoax accustions". (Axlalta 21:13, 9 June 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>The concept is quite straight forward, in low Earth orbit (or any orbit for that matter) the spacecraft would be travelling so quickly the Earth below it would be noticeably moving (not just the clouds).

<dd>I did a calculation on this (probably back in an archive), and if the circular part of the Apollo was used to make it look like a distant Earth but actually in low Earth orbit, something would pass through the entire field of view in under a minute (I think it was). It clearly doesn't do that. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 03:19, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>You also have the filmclip where they are claiming to film the earth halfway to the moon in the first part of "What happened on the Moon" with David Percy commenting (second Google video link, about 15 minutes into part 1). He claims that they are filming a colour transparent of the earth. My point is that you don't rebutt the colour transparent theory by arguing that the earth is not moving. I looked at the first 8 minute Google link again "NASA - Apollo 11 How did they do it?" - and they are saying something else, so I understand your comments. Percy knows about film and photo, and his view is more thrustworthy. Percy let the filming run longer, and then you se the real earth close from another window&#160;:) The faking is obvious. The "talk" instruction. Saying they fill up the window with the camera, when you in fact can see a person coming in front of the camera. Saying they are halfway to the moon, and later you see the bright blue sky from the windows. Surely this filmclip was not ment for the public. (213.161.184.64 12:57, 10 June 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>I was watching the National Geographic channel show about this again the other day (titled <i>Moon Conspiracy</i>, I think. Excellent, BTW - everyone should see it.) Kaysing says that the F1 engine (the one used in the first stage of the Saturn V) was too unreliable. Kaysing was in technical writing at Rocketdyne during their early part of the development of the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-1_%28rocket_engine%29.html" title="F-1 (rocket engine)">F-1 (rocket engine)</a>, I think, and left about 1961. Yes, there were problems with the early F-1 tests. But about five years later, the problems were solved. There were thirteen Saturn V launches, each one had five F-1s in it, and none of them failed in actual flights. Yet Kaysing said that they were too unreliable... Go figure. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 04:11, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I've said, it's either ignorance or willful distortion. He based his assertions on when he left. So he was perhaps correct in saying the 1961 version was unreliable, but to continue to spout that when its problems were fixed amounts to fraud. It would be interesting to find out the circumstances under which he left. Maybe he was angry at NASA for some reason, and this moon hoax stuff was his way of trying to get back at them. I think it would be useful to investigate the motives of the moan hoaxsters. They want everyone to think they are innocent little cherubs who are only looking at facts and, at worst, misunderstanding them. But I have come to realize it's much more than that... those characters are guilty of what they accuse NASA of doing. Meanwhile, I see that someone posted a "POV" thingie on the article.

<p>Exactly. Personally, I can never understand why some people simply cannot understand that even when all the computing power that's available to you is less than that which is present in a Wal-Mart watch, all it really takes is your imagination and the right determination. Given that, anything can be achieved. And I mean anything. And as to the Russians or Chinese, or Japanese, for that matter: they can have all the technology in the world but they will never be able to put a man on the moon. They simply lack the right attitude, they do not have the proper determination, they never experienced a time like the sixties where imagination could run riot, and, basically, they've got no Wal-Mart. Again, given the right imagination you can achieve anything. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnon2_85e5.html" title="User:Anon2">Anon2</a> 10:02, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

A reasonable person may conclude that 1. There are too few scientists willing to answer questions from the public about this historic experience, 2. It is disappointing and curious that NASA does not have an official open question and answer forum as a means of teaching science and generating interest in the US space program, 3. Some unanswered questions cast reasonable doubt on the official story."

<dd>What an incredibly ignorant website! I'll quote their first "unanswered question":
<blockquote>
<p>Gravity of Moon Doesn't Fit Neutral Point -- In 1960, before the Apollo missions, Encyclopedia Britannica reported the neutral point to be 20,520 miles from the Moon. A Moon with 1/6 Earth's gravity should have a Neutral Point between 22,078 - 25,193 miles from the Moons surface. Yet after the Apollo missions, Time magazine July 25, 1969 said "At a point of 43,495 miles from the moon, lunar gravity exerted a force equal to the gravity of the Earth, then some 200,000 miles distant" In 1973 Encyclopedia Britannica, gave a new neutral point distance of 39,000 miles. The problem with all of this is, a neutral point of 43,495 miles would make the moon with not 1/6th (16%) the Earth's gravity, but 64%. A moon with 64% of Earth's gravity would require way more fuel and power than was supposedly available in the Apollo missions. -- STATUS -- AS YET UNANSERED</p>
</blockquote>
The <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surface_gravity.html" title="Surface gravity">surface gravity</a> of the Earth and Moon don't have anything to do with the neutral point. The neutral point depends only on the individual masses. The surface gravity also depends on the radius of the body. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 22:50, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And another thing - the distance to the neutral point varies, because the distance between the Earth and Moon varies. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 23:28, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To clarify, the neutral point depends only on the mass of the earth, the mass of the moon, and the distance between them (which varies by a significant amount). The surface gravity of the moon depends only on the mass of the moon and the radius of the moon. The mass of the earth and the distance to earth have nothing to do with it. Secondly, spacecraft don't go on a straigt line from the earth to the moon. Finally, when they say "200,000 miles" - that is a rounded number, not exact. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 15:31, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When debating against the moon landing, your best strategy is to overwhelm your opponent with questions about details and minutia. Never provide answers, even if you know them. NASA had thousands of people solving problems and working out details of the trip - it's not humanly possible for one person to know every answer to every problem they foresaw and solved. Even if your opponent knows the answers to all your questions, you will notice that the answers are usually much longer then the questions. If both you and your opponent are given equal time, you'll be able to ask far more questions then your opponent can answer. Then you can talk about all the unanswered questions! <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgr_5427.html" title="User:Algr">Algr</a> 07:02, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Another advantage you'll have is that a question can't be 'wrong' - only an answer can.

<dd>As with most conspiracy theorists, they claim that because they are being discriminated against, they don't have the resources to come up with the correct explanation: they can only tell that the "official story" is wrong. This is another good tactic if you're going to debate on the side of the hoax proponents: keep your head above the clouds and simply say that NASA didn't go to the moon, and when someone asks what actually did happen claim that you cannot find out because NASA spends all their 15 billion dollars in resources maintaining the coverup, killing off people, preventing research dollars from getting to the true believers, etc. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 20:52, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">When scepticism goes overboard</span></h2>
<p>This is to all the sceptics that have contributed to this article. Maybe it will change their mind.</p>
<p>To illustrate my point: only recently I was reading up on the Old Greeks. In one of their stories they write about having walked on the sun. Of course, initially I laughed, as I am naturally inclined to scepticism. Later, however, I began to think: what arrogance and what temerity of me to doubt that a people as intelligent and inventive, and as resourceful and imaginative as the Old Greeks could not have put a man on the sun. Of course, they lacked the computing power that was available in the nineteen sixties and seventies, let alone that of our age, but look at their imagination, their power of reasoning and their capacity for storytelling. They must have known hardship, and then be able to overcome that hardship with the proper will of mind and the right amount of can-do attitude. They must have known adversity and set-backs. And then managed to counter that all. And while I was pondering all this, I saw my mistake: never underestimate the power of the imagination. Even when rocket science was in its very early stages and the only computing power available to them amounted to no more than a few electrons running through a stick of amber rubbed against a piece of straw, the right amount of can-do attitude could have taken the Old Greeks to where they said they have gone. Putting a man on the surface of the sun may seem an impossible project for us people in the 21st century, to them it was a mere challenge and a truly achievable goal. There are times and situations where scepticism is due but there are also moments when it is totally misplaced and inappropriate. That is where scepticism goes overboard. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnon2_85e5.html" title="User:Anon2">Anon2</a> 18:37, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you mean there's not much evidence supporting the hoax claims, you're right. It is <i>nearly</i> a lunatic fringe theory, and all their questions have been answered. That doesn't stop them from asking those same questions over and over, though, and that's what keeps alive the mythology that somehow Apollo was a humbug.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tagged article for POV check</span></h2>
<p>I clicked on a link to this page just out of curiosity, and found the article to be rather POV - arguing against the hoax accusations. To be clear, I don't advocate any of the landing hoax arguments, but I think the article would better serve everyone if it didn't actively argue for one position. It should simply present which arguments are made by each side and who supports them. And just an asside, I don't think that making the article argue against the hoax accusations really helps that side of the debate. If anything, it actually makes it come off as too defensive. I think the best model would be that of the flat earth article - at least the last time I saw it. With absurd ideas, the article can be written completely NPOV and the facts will speak for themselves, so there's no need to argue the case. I'm thinking though that perhaps in this article and some others the POV problem may have arrisen from an over-correction of hoax POV-pushers. But two wrongs don't make a right and we need more fair minded and unbiased editors to maintain NPOV. <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 02:35, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems to me that both sides are presented. There are plenty of pro-hoax arguements given. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 02:57, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm all in favor of both sides being presented, but neither one should be *asserted* by Wikipedia. For example, where the article reads: "The idea that the Moon landings were staged has become a classic example of the improbable theories that a small minority support with more zeal than logic." While I'm not an expert on this issue, that assessment seems pretty on-the-mark to me, but that's my point of view. We can objectively state that these views (that the landing was a hoax) are held by only a small minority, but NPOV demands that Wikipedia not assert whether or not they're "logical." You and I might both think they're illogical, but that's our point of view, not Wikipedia's neutral point of view. Of course if we presented this point of view as someone's opinion, say by quoting someone at NASA who said something to this effect then that would be fine, but it's just not ok for Wikipedia to assert it. The issue here isn't my POV - real or conjectured - or your POV, it's maintaining Wikipedia's NPOV. <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 04:55, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's the conspiracists usual trick - they object if both sides are presented. They only want their side presented, so that the casual reader will think there are no answers to the questions they raise. If you only present the conspiracists' side, as that user argues for, then the article <i>becomes POV.</i> <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:11, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm only referring to conspiracists in general. I did read what you wrote. And I agree that editorial comments like the one you cited about "more zeal than logic" don't belong, because then the article is telling the reader what to think. However, we've had some writers complain that even addressing the questions the conspiracists raise was somehow "not neutral", that in essence we should just list the questions. And <i>that is point-of-view</i>, because it implies that there are no explanations, and it serves to "recruit" naive new members into this parallel universe called the "Moon Hoax Theory". So, definitely take out the editorializing, but don't leave the questions unchallenged, and that should keep things fairly neutral... Until the next zealot (from <i>either</i> side) comes along and starts editorializing again. If you were to look at the history of this page for the last 6 months or so, it would boggle your mind how much edit fighting has gone on as various folks have weighed into it from time to time. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 06:48, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, when it comes to NPOV, this article is shameful for Wikipedia. I looked at the flat earth article wich was referred to, and it could be an example to follow. It just refers to the "flat earth view" on a matter of fact basis, without any POV regarding those arguments. The arguments pointing towards the Apollo program beeing the greatest hoax ever, could be presented in such a way. The Wikipedia have a lot of articles about the Apollo program which are in accordance with the official story, so this single page could be presented in a standard NPOV way.

<dd>There are naturally some differences with Flat Earth. There aren't very many people who believe in the Flat Earth theory today, whereas there are millions who believe the moon landings were a hoax. (Actually the Wikipedia article says that the Flat Earth Society is defunct.) The Flat Earth theory is not pushed in the media whereas the landing hoax theory is widely pushed. The Flat Earth people don't have this long list of points that needs to be examined. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 14:45, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">Flat Earth</a> article states over and over again that the notion of the flat earth is bogus. If you want to use that approach as a model for the "Moon Hoax Theory" page, i.e. to say that the idea that we didn't go to the moon is equally bogus, go for it. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 13:11, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think the Flat Earth article is showing great dicipline in NPOV. Bogus-claims? Maybe we interpret some sentences differently. Axlalta 13:30, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, ok, the Flat Earth article maybe not the best example. In that article it is interesting to see how mankind gradually accepted that the earth was not flat. Then you have to mention the historical arguments in favour of planet earth.Axlalta 13:44, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They don't literally use the word "bogus". They use words like "misconception", which is a politer way of saying the same thing. Maybe a better analogy with the "moon hoax" stuff would be the "ancient astronauts" idea that was circulating in the early 1970s or so. This writer, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_von_D%C3%A4niken_adc5.html" title="Erich von Däniken">Erich von Däniken</a>, cooked up the idea that strange visitors from other planets had somehow lent a hand in the building of the Egyptian pyramids, for example. The basis of his argument was that it just didn't seem possible that the Egyptians had the know-how to do it themselves. Sound familiar? The same argument is used by the conspiracists to claim that we couldn't possibly have had the technology to go to the moon... despite concessions (by some of them, anyway) that we could have soft-landed unmanned missions on the moon. You can take out the patronizing editorializing from the article, as long as you leave in the question-and-answer stuff, because if you leave only the questions then you have an inherently biased article. Although it's true that Apollo has plenty of coverage, it does not necessarily address the specific questions. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 13:58, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I just thought of a compromise solution. Maybe you could have a short article defining what the hoax is, and be done with it. Then have a separate article with the questions-and-answers, and the plethora of links. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 14:02, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Then you need to pose some unanswered questions, if you can find any. That was the core issue in one of the recent debates by someone (since blocked by the Admins) who kept yelping about the lack of "neutrality" of the article but was unwilling to actually contribute anything to the article other than editorializing. In my view, the article gives <i>too much</i> slack to the conspiracists. You need to study how they operate. They start with a basic premise, that the government is lying. Everything after that goes back to that premise. Any question given a reasonable answer is challenged on the grounds that it's NASA's answer, and NASA is lying, therefore the answer is invalid. It's a classic case of circular "reasoning". They have never found any actual evidence, no "confession" or direct physical evidence, to support their notion that the historical record of the Apollo flights is fraudulent. So they spend their time looking for "clues" that support their premise, discarding anything that appears to be in order, zeroing in on oddities and claiming that as "evidence" that the Apollo program was a fraud. If you've ever seen that 2001 Fox documentary, you could see what I'm getting at. The moon hoax "theory" is a combination of poor reasoning, ignorance, and willful distortion. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 21:24, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About unanswered questions, the website that has the "unanswered question about surface gravity and the neutral point - it has some more "unanswered questions", but many are so strange that it is hard to believe that they are serious. (1) Apollo 6 didn't make it into orbit, etc. But Apollo 6 did make it into orbit... (2) In 1969 the US launched a monkey, and it didn't live for 8.5 days, do how could they keep men alive for that long? First, I'm not aware of the US putting up a monkey after John Glenn's flight, but even if a monkey dies - so what? Prior to Apollo, Gemini 5 stayed up for 8 days, and Gemini 7 stayed for 14 days. After Apollo, we showed that people could live in space for months (at least). But it is hard to think of these "unanswered questions" as serious. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 01:22, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>We have another controversial topic which for the time beeing seems to be NPOV despite trolling, ridicule and such on the talk page, a conspiracy theory held by a small minority. Talking about the 9/11 inside job theory in the article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories</a> Still the article is very tidy and informative IMO.

<dd>I'm not touching that one. Or maybe I could right a parallel piece about how Pearl Harbor was also a D.C. based conspiracy. You think that's a joke? Afraid not.

So, since you seem to have serious complaints about the article, you need to offer concrete improvements, which you've started to to do.

<p>I thought that the term "conspiracy theory" was a neutral, describing term, until I read this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory#_note-1" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory#_note-1" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory#_note-1</a> The term is also used pejoratively to dismiss allegedly misconceived, paranoid or outlandish rumors. It is a negatively biased term which should be avoided in articles which aim to have a NPOV, including this. If it was a neutral term the chapter "Conspiracy theory" would also be totally unneccesary in this article. It would be like having an article about "Spaghetti" with a chapter explaining that it comes under the term "Food". Axlalta 17:46, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see the term "conspiracy theory" as being polite. In the past, these things were called "crackpot theories" or "crackpot ideas".

<dd>As a onetime wrestler in the pit of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">Conspiracy theory</a> article, I recognise For great justice's point, here; it comes up daily over there. It's not 100% true, but it ain't 100% false either. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">Conspiracy theory</a> does certainly mean a narrative with a particular kind of credibility problem, ie, if someone supposes that narrative to be true, they're right to be offended by the label (but perhaps wrong to leap to the offensive, themselves). The question is whether or not we can justify its use <i>over the objections</i> of the true believer. If it's used carelessly, it's simply a pejorative term - For great justice's right as far as that goes. But if it's used in defined circumstances - ie, when a particular belief has been demonstrated to have certain regularly occurring <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html#Features" title="Conspiracy theory">features</a> which each subtract from the credibility of the belief - then <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">Conspiracy theory</a> may be legitimately ascribed to that belief.

<p>There are many reliable sources that say we went to the moon. There are no reliable sources that say we did not. It's not neutrality to pretend otherwise. This page is not about whether we went to the moon, and it's not a forum for presenting arguments on both sides. That question doesn't have two sides.

<dd>I removed it once, because it is irrelevant as to whether or not Apollo went to the moon. If my neighbor never made it to Disney World, does that mean that I didn't make it there? If you study history, the USSR had many of the early space successes. But by the middle of Gemini program, we were ahead. They were planning for a moon landing about 1974. Their big N-1 rocket blew up a couple of times, and they canceled the program. They never announced that they were going to the moon by a certain date, or were going to beat us there. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 16:20, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Russians had the same means and the ambition to go to the moon as us. If your neighbor had the same means and ambition as you to go to Disneyland and you did go, most likely they would as well- especially if they were jealous of your trip and had pride at stake. It's not concrete proof that you lied about going there because you claimed you did and had motive to lie about it while he couldn't make it no matter how hard he tried, but it's still a point worth noting.

<dd>Your initial assumption would be incorrect. The U.S. economy was and is much stronger, and their technology and luck proved to be inferior as well. As Bubba points out, the U.S. started out behind, and then caught and passed them by 1964 or 1965. Their timetable for a lunar landing was 1974. Maybe they would have made it. But they had some launch-pad disasters, and they gave up. The U.S. could have given up after the Apollo I fire, but there was a national priority (i.e. budgetary money) to fix the problems and continue. If the Saturn V had exploded on takeoff of Apollo 8, that might have killed the program. But it didn't, and it didn't. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:36, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You're right. I think the anon user was trying to make the point that if they didn't make it, how did we, which is invalid logic. However, he did put me on to the idea that since the Soviets didn't make it, their jealousy of the U.S. would have been part of their motivation to blow the whistle on us if they suspected it. Maybe that's overkill, and it's certainly not the point the anon was trying to make.

<p>Nobody in their right mind could call this article neutral: "Nearly all interested scientists, technicians and space enthusiasts who have commented on the accusations have rejected them as baseless," "hoax proponents tend to respond to them by changing the subject, or finding a new audience," "Hoax accusation opponents maintain that a key feature of all arguments questioning the moon landing is the unstated assumption that the burden of proof lies entirely with NASA and its supporters. [1] Hoax proponents' presentations often consist of questioning technical minutiae with the result that debunkers must research and answer all questions that the hoax proponents come up with, failure to do so being taken as proof of a moon landing hoax." "The accusations are a type of conspiracy theory, because the hoax argument centers on claims that conspirators in the possession of secret knowledge are misleading the public in pursuit of a hidden agenda," etc.</p>
<p>The whole article reads from the point of view that the landing did occur and those who question it are wrong and illogical. This is not neutral.</p>

<p>There's <i>no</i> resolution to the issue so long as Apollo deniers reject (or ignore) the possibility that their argument might fall under the vital prohibition Bubba reminds of in the definition of NPOV - ie, our duty to ensure that we do not give <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">undue weight</a> to crackpot ideas. The Apollo moon landing hoax accusation is just such an idea.</p>
<p>The <i>only</i> good reason I can see for including it in wikipedia is to consider it in terms of its being an interesting sociological phenomenon. As the article stands, for me it's <i>too accommodating</i> to the deniers, treating their story as if it required logical interrogation. To me, that's the wrong mode of response for myths and legends - an encyclopedic response to the story of the Gorgon Medusa would not be to set out the impossibility of having hair made of snakes, but to investigate what those elements in the story signified for those engaged in that particular bit of "oral history". We can make some statements about that - ones which don't mistake the item under scrutiny for something that it's not. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 11:57, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You're right on the money. Conspiracy theories in general are a sociological phenomenon. That's the reason cons get so upset about that label, because it says something <i>about them</i>, it hits too close to home. It personalizes it. It implicitly calls them crackpots and looneys. Thus it is also shaky ground given the wiki POV policy. When and if we go back to the moon and find the old relics, that will shut up most of the cons, although there will always be a few disbelievers no matter what the evidence. They will eventually fade just like the Flat Earth Society did. Meanwhile, I think it is fair to present the questions and answers. It serves an educational purpose in terms of better understanding the Apollo missions. It is important to maintain an open mind until the facts become clear. When that 2001 Fox con show aired, I was curious to see what they had. I was willing to accept the possibility that the Apollo program was a fraud, <i>if they had some evidence</i>. I quickly realized how fraudulent that show was, I knew that the whole idea that we never went to the moon had to be nothing more than the product of ignorance, and as I have since come to believe, <i>willful deception</i>; the hoax story is the <i>real</i> hoax, and many who seem otherwise intelligent have bought into it, as they did not live through that time and thus did not follow it day by day to understand its continuity; and have not studied it sufficiently to realize that the hoax claims are a con. I also strongly suspect that many of them <i>don't even care</i> about the facts. It's just a game. Now, do we need a separate "the hoax is a hoax" page? Probably not. We don't need any additional lightning rod pages.&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:29, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please remove the word "interested" from the sentence "Nearly all interested scientists, technicians and space enthusiasts who have commented on the accusations have rejected them as baseless." The second half of the sentence is sufficient to establish which scientists, etc we are talking about, however the word "interested" <b>unfortunately</b> also means "having a stake in the matter"; a party with interest in the matter means something different from a party who finds it interesting. This word casts a shadow of prejudice over the views of these scientists, etc., since it implies that their comments reflect in large part their personal interest in the matter. (Especially since the word "interested" is the first qualifier). Please remove just this one word.</p>

<li>It's stated that way for a specific reason. It means that nearly all scientists who have been <i>sufficiently interested in the story</i> to state an opinion have drawn that conclusion. <i>Being</i> interested in something is <i>not</i> the same thing as <i>having</i> an interest in it. And in normal English usage, "interested" the way it's stated would mean "being interested".

<dd>Please assert that "interested" adds something that the second half of the sentence ("who have commented on the accusations") does not. In your opinion can a scientist choose to comment on the hoax without being "interested" in it? Otherwise it's a very weird qualification: Not nearly all <b>interested</b> scientists etc who have commented on the hoax, but nearly <b>all</b> scientists etc who have commented on the hoax...! BTW, "normal English usage" is not "encyclopedic English usage", as I hope you'll readily grant that "interested" especially means "interested party" in an encyclopedia. BTW, even if we take interested to mean "finding interesting" it still casts a aspersions over the sentence, since it implies the group is self-selecting! This is an <b>unnecessary</b> implication: it doesn't matter that a scientist takes an interest in something, it just matters that they comment on it in an official capacity. Of course, the only reason any self-reflecting scientist would become interested in, for example, numerology, so that they could take the time to inform the people who believe in it that numerological coincidences are of no predictive (etc) value. But the point is that it's not just that the scientist takes an "interest" in debunking (the only reason a scientist should be interested in non-science is for the sake of debunking) but rather without necessarily showing interest a scientist can comment on the fact. Can you at least see how "interested" implies a significant and superfluous self-selecting criterion?</dd>

<li>No. First, sign your post with four tildes, even though you're anon, so it's clear where one thought stops and another starts. Second, you might be right that it's redundant, and is probably one of the many compromises in this article. Rather than telling someone else to change it, you should do it yourself. Then you can wait for the next round of arguments. Third, don't be lecturing me about English "encyclopedic" usage. Some bozo was recently arguing that "proper" English usage would say "The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">Yankees</a> is" rather than "The Yankees are". Needless to say, he was shot down quickly, by those of us who speak and write "normal" English.

<dd>Maybe, I'll consider it some more later. A difference, though, is that one claim is that the landing was faked, the other is that the holocost never happened or was greatly exagurated. My initial response is that it might be good. However, several years ago I went to a debate about creationism versus evolution. The creationist spoke first. The evolutionists presented the case for evolution, but they didn't respond to the creationist point by point.

<dd>Indeed. Perhaps the sentence you've quoted didn't mean to you what it meant to me - I was specifically asking how the <i>methodology</i> by which Apollo deniers construct their argument differs from that used by Holocaust deniers. This was not to request another round of empirical evidences - a committed denier can extend the set of all possible disproofs <i>ad infinitum</i> as each previous disproof is shown to hold zero credibility - but rather to point out that the Apollo denier's <i>method</i>, their <i>way</i> of approaching the issue, is startlingly similar to that of Holocaust deniers who, one year, demand an explanation of the concentrations of Prussic acid salvaged from the rubble of the gas chambers, and the next prefer to concentrate on documents 'revealing' emigration numbers not adding up, or whatever. That is, they (you?) light upon whichever scrap of evidence seems most likely to confirm their pre-existing beliefs, today, and only stick by it so long as there's nothing more credible available. In this, the <i>method</i> is quite unlike a scientific method, in which one constructs a hypothesis and then seeks ways to <i>disprove</i> it. So I'll ask again - in what ways do the <i>methods of enquiry</i> of Apollo deniers differ from those of Holocaust denial? Surely there must be something, folks? Or else, why are we even giving this stuff 5 minutes of serious treatment? <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 20:59, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Similarly, even though the Saturn blueprints are <i>not</i> missing (contrary to the urban legend) - what if they were missing? Would that mean that the Saturn V never existed? You can see a Saturn V at (1) Kennedy Space Center, (2) Marshall Space Flight Center, and (3) Johnson Space Flight Center. Even if the blueprints were missing, there is plenty of evidence that the Saturn V did exist - photos, film, etc. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 04:17, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

There's no 'debate' about the fact of the Holocaust, only a confusion on some people's behalf.

<dd>Not really, since it's not my point of view that matters, but those involved in the controversy. I think the problem that you're talking about is that the public does not have access to all the facts. It's like the police finding a body, and immediately saying 'there's nothing to see here, we don't have a full explanation of what happened. The reason people think there is a problem is because of a series of inconsistencies in NASA's story. The fact that critics can't yet piece together exactly how they pulled the hoax off is not the point. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrendline_1085.html" title="User:Trendline">Trendline</a> 22:51, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The "series of inconsistencies" you allege in "NASA's story" is different from the "series of inconsistencies" deniers have singled out in the Holocaust story <i>how</i>, exactly? If your group of "those involved in the controvery" (my "tragically confused" group) are right to demand that their position be treated more seriously than that of Holocaust deniers, there must be some qualitative difference between the two sets of allegations, ie, between <i>how</i> the case is assembled by each. Until such distinction is made, Apollo boosters are quite right to consider <i>both</i> as examples of a particular species of confusion that arises when a certain type of enquirer gets out of their depth in a complex field which has emotional or political significance for them. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 02:17, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I apologise for allowing two issues to get muddled, here. Please allow me to separate them out, clearly:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>(a)</b> There is a recognisable pattern to the way certain disreputable 'alternative' histories' are constructed - ie, their methodology. The pattern includes <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html#Features" title="Conspiracy theory">features</a> characteristic of the process by which conspiracy theories are created, typified by the production of a set of discrete empirical 'challenges' which, though individually rebuttable, may be extended by the diligent and resourceful 'sceptic' to a potentially infinite series. Conclusion: if you wish to argue for the revision of the mainstream history of man's space exploration, to claim that Apollo was a hoax, it would be prudent to distinguish your method from that preferred by producers of such discredited stories.</li>
<li><b>(b)</b> If you are interested in neither 'side' of the Apollo 'debate', but simply seek to find a better editorial solution to the evident problem of including it in the encyclopaedia, there are models for solving the problem available from wikipedia's successful treatment of other such 'alternative history' narratives. <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">In one case</a>, whose specific features have no necessary bearing on this topic, the working solution is to devote the "x accusation" article to an account of the narrative itself as a cultural object, charting its emergence and development. Discussions integral to that narrative are then decanted into a separate article, entitled "Examination of x discussions". This editorial solution is proving stable in the highly contested example cited.</li>

<dd>I hear what you're saying, Carfiend. Ideally, what we <i>should</i> be discussing here is best editorial practice (to which my 'b' is addressed). I'm not convinced this page <i>should</i> simply document what the sides say - there's demonstrably a significant <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">undue weight</a> issue there. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 22:31, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure that undue weight does apply here. "<i>Articles that compare views need not give minority views as much or as detailed a description as more popular views, and may not include tiny-minority views at all (by example, the article on the Earth only very briefly refers to the Flat Earth theory, a view of a distinct minority)</i>" That's fine - the Apollo page does not even refer to this (although it probably should), but links in the See also. It goes on to say "<i>None of this is to say that tiny-minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can give them on pages specifically devoted to them.</i>". So I think you're fine here with as much detail as we can give. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 23:25, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not denying there's a place for all this <i>philosophizin</i>. I'm just urging my fellow editors to consider the model established <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">in one relevant case</a>, by which the material is primarily considered <i>encyclopaedically</i>, as a cultural phenomenon with certain features and a specific history, with its internal 'controversies' hived-off to an "Examination of the claims of ..." type element.</dd>
<dd>My reasoning is, roughly, that without such editorial <i>packaging</i>, people seeking to have their alternative opinions taken seriously will forever stumble onto this page and consider (perhaps rightly) that it is <b>the</b> place wikipedia provides for doing just that. I know I have been guilty of that at times in my contributions to the 'pedia, and I assume that few of us could claim complete selflessness, either? So it matters that wikipedia adopts appropriate forms to channel such impulses in such a way that they are accommodated, but do not undermine the credibility of the resource. <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 22:03, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you think it was easy to go to the moon, you haven't ready much about the history of Apollo. And the specific problems which caused two shuttles to explode weren't issues with the Mercury-Gemini-Apollo launches and landings as such. There were no side-by-size stages in which the flame from one could pierce the other; and there were no tiles on the capsules which could be banged into and dislodged by foam from a rocket. The point being that the shuttle and its accessories are rather more complex machines than Mercury-Gemini-Apollo machines were... which stands to reason, as they are part of the continuum, the evolution, of the NASA programs. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:39, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Dosimeters carried by the crews showed they received about the same cumulative dosage as a chest X-ray or about 1 milligray. [15]"</p>
<p>"The radiation is actually evidence that the astronauts went to the Moon. 33 of 36 of the Apollo astronauts have early stage cataracts that have been shown to be caused by radiation exposure to cosmic rays during their trip. (see Ms. Irene Schneider on The Space Show). (Plait 2002:160-162)"</p>
<p>This is strange and dubious. On the one hand it's suggested that the dosage is the same as an ordinary XRay exam. On the other that the fact that the astronauts developed cataracts was caused by this radiation. Since XRay exams are so common, many people should develop cataracts due to them which would pretty much render the fact that the astronauts have cataracts as irrelevant when proving that they did go to the Moon. This kind of reasoning, linking an health problem to the presence on the Moon is only valid if that health problem is unlikely to be caused by something else. Saying the dosage was the same as an XRay makes this link tenuous at best.</p>

<p>The reasoning that "more people should develop cataracts from X-rays" is also dubious. Your typical X-ray is of the chest, not the whole body, i.e. not including the eyes.

<p>I think the link could be possible even with similar dosage if the radiation had very different characteristics. Regarding <b>The reasoning that "more people should develop cataracts from X-rays" is also dubious. Your typical X-ray is of the chest, not the whole body, i.e. not including the eyes.</b> It's a good argument, but the thing is you end up getting some radiation on parts that are not being examined. Doing several exams during ones lifetime may (I don't have the actual data, so this is but a guess) result in the effect described. Another thing, commercial flights also cause passangers to absorb some radiation, though not levels as high as pop culture seems to promote. Being well traveled people I suppose the astronauts have several thousand hours of airplane travel time. This is most likely be the equivalent of getting the uniform dosage you (rightfully) mentioned. I still think this link is tenuous at best. <a href="../../../c/v/a/User%7ECvalente_452f.html" title="User:Cvalente">cvalente</a> 19:32, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur with taking out unsourced speculation, and I appreciate your efforts. However, you give the impression of someone who has not studied the hoaxsters' arguments very much. You should read all of the stuff on this page and in some of the archives. You will then get a different picture of how the hoaxsters think. Everything Bubba says about them is true. Their belief in Apollo being a hoax is like a religion, in that <i>no amount</i> of evidence confirming the Apollo flights will sway them. Some of them, I think, even if you personally flew them to the moon and showed them the Apollo remnants, would say <i>the trip they just took</i> had been faked. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 05:34, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I think the whole thrust of the missing data stuff is that every time you 'fake' a piece of data, you risk introducing errors, so it's easier for it to be missing. This relates most obviously to the telemetry tapes. There don't seem to be any, which is kind of odd. If there were though, that would be very compelling evidence for the landings, since they would be extraordinarily difficult to fake. Much more so than a photo album. I think the hoax proponents want to show that a large portion of data that should be there is not. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 15:24, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However, there could be little scrutiny of those tapes more careful than that of the engineers at the Mission Control Center, whose primary job was to scrutinise that data for the duration of the flight. For NASA to have hoaxed Apollo 11 with poorly faked telemetry data would almost certainly require that all the Mission Control engineers be part of the conspiracy.</dd>

<dd>As I've mentioned before, I don't understand why anyone is so surprised that the tapes can't be found.

<dd>What do the Apollo-deniers actually say about the 'missing' blueprints and telemetry tapes? In my experience they throw out a lot of supposed 'evidence', but rarely actually explain what the 'evidence' is supposed to prove. If they don't make claims related to that 'evidence', then it's rather hard to report on counter-claims that would explain why they're wrong. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 16:10, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right. It's just another hoaxster cons' trick. Their purpose is to <i>infer</i> that the allegedly missing data is further "evidence" of a "conspiracy". They think they've got something here, because if it's missing, then obviously it can't be produced, and they can list that as an "unanswered question", even though its absence, like that of blueprints, proves nothing. And if it did exist, or somehow turned up, they would then say it was faked. So, the cons "win", either way. Therefore, it's inherently prejudicial, and has no place in the article, unless someone can make a cogent argument that it "proves" something, as opposed to just reporting it standalone. As far as letting the hoaxster cons study the telemetry tapes, those characters can't even tell if a flag is waving or not, so what chance would they have of being able to properly interpret a bunch of 0's and 1's? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The issue is that the hoax proponents claim that the tapes are missing. NASA also says they are missing. The Hoax proponents draw one set of conclusions from this, those who don't believe the hoax theory another. We should simply report this, and try to establish the status of the various tapes etc. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 17:49, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Agreed, but first we'd need to tie the Apollo-deniers down to an actual verifiably and publically stated conclusion. From what I've seen and read they just seem to say 'the apollo 11 telemetry tapes are missing, woooh, scary...' and never actually say what they believe that means. They also seem to like referring to the telemetry tapes as 'science data', when in reality they're primarily engineering data which is of little value when the last Saturn flew over thirty years ago.</dd>

They also discuss potential changes that would only require storing the digital data extracted from the tapes in future, and not the tapes themselves. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 19:59, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There have been various analogies drawn here. The attitude of the Holocaust deniers is a bit of a touchy comparison. I was thinking that a better analogy would be the O.J. Simpson trial... or any trial in which someone "gets away" with something. The hoaxsters don't have to "prove" anything to their audience, all they have to do is try to introduce what they would argue is "reasonable doubt". I wouldn't be at all surprised if the tapes were wiped at some point, just to be re-used. It would be nice if there was a record of such. But it wouldn't matter, because no matter what the answer, the cons will say it supports their viewpoint. In the absence of any statements by anyone, you are left with the hoaxsters statement that the tapes and blueprints are missing, and NASA's response that they are indeed missing. Yawn. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:34, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This may shed some light on the missing tapes: <a href="http://www.honeysucklecreek.net.nyud.net:8080/Apollo_11/tapes/Search_for_SSTV_Tapes.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.honeysucklecreek.net.nyud.net:8080/Apollo_11/tapes/Search_for_SSTV_Tapes.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.honeysucklecreek.net.nyud.net:8080/Apollo_11/tapes/Search_for_SSTV_Tapes.pdf</a> - apparently the original Apollo tapes, including the TV pictures, were sent to the National Archives, then to the Goddard space center, where they can no longer be found. There's a serious attempt underway to find them before the last machines that can read them and recover the original video signals are retired. Of course, when and if they are found, I'm sure at least some Apollo-deniers will claim that they were removed to give the hoaxers time to create better fakes. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 12:57, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd like it to remain, as it's a verifiable quote from a reputable source which perfectly sums up how the majority of informed people think of this matter. In fact, all three conspiracy theories mentioned there have more actual evidence to support them than the moon landing hoax does. Only the Princess Diana one comes close in its pure urban myth-hood to the idea that many knew the Apollo program was a hoax, all went along with it, and <b>none</b>, nearly 40 years on, have come out and said so. When you consider that these people would have included scientists from all countries, including many which were openly hostile to the US and would have exposed the fake if there was one in a heartbeat... All in all this is a very good and very fair article. If anything it is too open to the idea that there is any truth in these unverifiable and unverified allegations. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 18:06, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another problem is the assumption that those other items in the list are all bogus. I don't think many seriously question whether Elvis is dead, and even if he were alive, it wouldn't really <i>matter</i>. The Mafia connection to JFK remains a possibility, because they certainly had a <i>motive</i> to shoot him, although the vast Oliver Stone fantasy conspiracy is unlikely... and it is still unclear whether Diana's wreck was caused strictly by a drunken driver or by interference from other drivers. So on that basis alone, its presence is questionable. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 23:27, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1. The missions were faked. Errors were introduced into the evidence by accident. 2.

<p>Someone deleted my "(Obviously, hoax proponents would say that this is merely a <i>mockup</i> of Surveyor 3)." Maybe that could be worded better... but if you let it stand <i>as is</i>, then the article is inherently biased, because it asserts <i>without challenge</i> that we did, in fact, go to the moon, and thus the entire premise for the article is null and void. <i>Which would be fine by me.</i> I will re-word it, and you all can edit it further if you like.

<dd>Come to think of it, that leads to another issue: That there is <i>more than one</i> moon hoax "theory". I haven't read the article <i>in toto</i> for awhile, but I'm thinking that's only addressed in the negative, by disparaging that fact, and that's a source of some of the recent complaints about bias. Rather than forcing the obvious down the readers' throats, maybe the article could be more specifically sectioned into what the various "theories" are, which should maybe stifle the complaints about bias, while letting the reader drew the obvious conclusion that even the hoaxster cons can't agree on what the con is: (1) We didn't go at all; (2) We did go, but only unmanned; (3) We did go, manned, but some facts were hidden; (4) whatever else. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:11, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
