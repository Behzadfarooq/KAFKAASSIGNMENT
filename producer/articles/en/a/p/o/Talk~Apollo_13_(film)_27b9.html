<p><i>The final manual burn of the LEM's engine, done to put Apollo 13 back in course, lasted 14 seconds, not 39, and was done with the engine pointed perpendicular to the Earth instead of towards the Earth as depicted in the film</i><br />
So uh, what's the difference between towards and perpendicular in the this senario? 22:55, 25 October 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the film, the burn was incorrectly shown as being towards the earth. In the actual mission, this burn was at right-angles to the earth to change their entry angle. However, it is a little confusing because there were three burns, with one pointed at the earth to pick up speed just after coming round the moon. (Ajkgordon 11:48, 24 March 2007 (UTC))</dd>

<p>I was not aware that the 'worm' logo was seen in Apollo 13. Can someone tell me where? Father Rob Lyons 21:01, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes - in the "Whiter Room" where the astros are suiting up (with James Horner's magnificent music in the background), you can just see the worm logo if you look carefully on the window behind them. It looks like they tried to hide it, so my guess is that they borrowed a current NASA room for the scene.Johno 12:49, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anybody know what song is playing on the spaceship at the beginning of the broadcast on the way to the moon? They're playing it on the tape player. I can't find the name of it anywhere. March 20, 2006, 7:54 PM.</p>
<ul>
<li>You mean "Spirit in the Sky"? It's the title track from a Norman Greenbaum album. At the very least, it's on the Apollo 13 Soundtrack, as is "Honky Tonkin" and "Blue Moon", the other two taped songs.Dangerdan97 10:05, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, I don't think that's it, it's a rock song, all you really hear is the intro, but I've heard it before and it sounds good. It's on the broadcast that was never broadcasted, I'm guessing the song wouldn't be on the soundtrack. 18:50, 15 April 2006
<ul>
<li>"Spirit in the Sky" IS a rock song, if you're not aware. Check out the BG music on this site: <a href="http://www.spiritinthesky.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.spiritinthesky.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiritinthesky.com/</a>, tell me if that's it.Dangerdan97 11:59, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yeah, you're right! I looked up that song on iTunes but they didn't have the Norman Greenbaum version, and none of the other ones really sounded like it. Well cool, thanks for the help. 21:12, 20 May 2006</li>

<p>What's all the stuff that falls off the rocket when it launches?</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's a while since I've seen the movie, but it's probably ice... The Saturn V didn't use foam insulation like the space shuttle and if you watch the real Apollo footage you'll see a fair amount of ice fall off as it's shaken free by the launch. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 01:19, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was ice. The fuels the rocket used are kept at very cold temperatures. Ice builds up before launch and falls away as it launches. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy120290_1fc1.html" title="User:Andy120290">Andy120290</a> 04:28, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any and Grant are completely right, it's ice. Inside the body of the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturn_V_58d4.html" title="Saturn V">Saturn V</a> are the fuel tanks containing liquid hydrogen, oxygen, and propane at very low temperatures. The skin of the rocket is therefore cooler than the surronding atmosphere causing condensation (think glass of ice water in a steamy room). The temperature is so low that the condensation freezes. The vibrations during launch then shake off all the ice.</dd>

<p>I removed the text " with beer cans which didn't exist in 1970." from the section "Technical Accuracy". Beer "Cans" have existed since 1935 and aluminuim pop-top beer cans as featured in the movie were invented in 1959 and first implemented by Coors in that same year (<a href="http://www.allaboutbeer.com/features/packaging.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allaboutbeer.com/features/packaging.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). So it's entirely possible that Ken Mattingly was drinking from beer cans, which certainly did exist at the time. --<a href="../../../i/m/j/User%7EImjustmatthew_9344.html" title="User:Imjustmatthew">Matthew</a> 04:11, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The following text from the article raises some questions for me:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Schoolday physics makes clear that the returning craft, coasting towards the Earth, cannot drift off course by being too light. The capsule's mass was important however to the calculations regarding the path made during re-entry (the capsule was slightly aerodynamic), but irrelevant in terms of coasting spacecraft.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>First off, what is "schoolday physics"? I can't find anything relevant about it on Google or wikipedia.</p>
<p>Second, the statement "the capsule was slightly aerodynamic" bothers me, the capsule was designed with airflow in mind, the shape of the capsule being dictated by the aerodynamic requirements of reentry. (See <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmospheric_reentry.html" title="Atmospheric reentry">Atmospheric reentry</a>)</p>
<p>Anyways, please give me some feedback on whether I'm way off base or legitimately confused. Thanks.--<a href="../../../i/m/j/User%7EImjustmatthew_9344.html" title="User:Imjustmatthew">Matthew</a> 18:31, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To me, that section seems very strangely worded, confused, and uncited. It definitely needs to either be removed or heavily rewritten. <a href="../../../m/l/i/User%7EMLilburne_c545.html" title="User:MLilburne">MLilburne</a> 18:46, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It sounds to me like someone was trying to display their aptitude in the field of physics. I just watched the commentary of Apollo 13 where Jim Lovell stated that the fact that they weren't carrying moon rocks did affect their trajectory due to it being underweight. This was in addition to the leaking water vapor.</p>

<dd><i>Schoolday physics</i> sounds like an attempt by a non-native English speaker to transfer an expression from a different language into English (<i>high school physics</i> is likely the equivalent phrase). Anyway the remark is very muddled. Whilst it's nominally true that mass wouldn't affect trajectory through a gravitational field during an unaccelerated coast through a perfect vacuum, the heavier a spacecraft, the less it "skims" or "skips" along the atmosphere during re-entry. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 01:07, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding the technical innacuracy "In reality, there was no one single source of the problem. The explosion wasn't caused by a bad coil, but by a sequence of events which led to bare wires and (flammable) insulation in a tank of oxygen" - While a series of oversights led to this problem being created and remaining undiscovered, in the context of the mission events, wouldn't this be considered a "single" initial problem?

<p>Can anyone provide any backing to the assertion that Gene Krantz did a cameo in the movie?

<p>The article makes several references to the "2005 DVD Commentary" by the Lovells. This commentary was also included with the original DVD. The only real additions of the 10th anniversary release are a remastered picture and the inclusion of the inferior Imax cut on the second disc.</p>
