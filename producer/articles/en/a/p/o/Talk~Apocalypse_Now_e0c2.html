<p>I don't think Willard "murders... in cold blood" the girl on the sampan - I think she was mortally wounded - it appears that she's shot with at least 3 or 4 rounds. I think Willard was putting her out of her misery. Who agrees? 68.8.55.55 11:03, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Replaced the description of Mr Coppola as <i>suicidal</i> with <i>temperamental</i>. Surely a more accurate reflection.. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Warning: Reading this will spoil the entire movie. In the film, Martin Sheen has been commanded to bring back Colonel Kurtz from the dense Vietnam jungle, played by Marlon Brando. As he makes his journey there, he sees scenes of violence and insanity, such as a young Laurence Fishburne (little Larry Fishburne) mow down a Vietnamese fishing boat. He also sees the darndest things, like Larry Fishburne dancing to Satisfaction on the tip of their boat, and dudes surfing while battles were going on. He makes it to where Kurtz has settled down. He listens to Kurtz' crazy rants and ponders. He eventually hacks Kurtz apart with a machete. "Mistah Kurtz, he dead".</p>
<p>Killer film about the Vietnam war directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando and Dennis Hopper.</p>
<p><br />
Practically a hallucinogenic trip, and Hopper's performance is a trip in itself.</p>
<p><br />
I love the smell of napalm in the morning...</p>
<p>The film is based on Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness", which also lends it's name to the film of the making of apocalypse now: "Hearts of Darkness".</p>
<p>Just as freaky and trippy as the film itself, if not more.</p>

<dd>Halucinogens used by the soldiers during war plus several other factors (such as the dubious nature of the "domino effect", wich was one of the reassons why America went to war) led to Viet Nam being one of the most complicated wars in american history (so far, the only counted defeat for america). All that is very well accounted in Apocalipse Now, perhaps one of the most faithful adaptations of the Nam war. Yet, it was criticized for the same issue, as it was one of the first Viet Nam movies to show up, critics were specting a movie about Viet Nam, not about Colonel Kurtz or about a poetical Journey into darkness. Years later, Platoon came up, widely praised for giving importance more to the war than to the story, wich all in all was a lot like the one in Apocalipse Now.</dd>

<p>The napalm quote is misleading. The full quote, transcribed from subtitles. "I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up. We didn't find one of them, not one stinking dink body. But the smell-- You know that gasoline smell. The whole hill smelled like... victory."</p>
<p>People have compared the Kilgore character to the Major Cook character played by Robert Redford in A Bridge too Far. Cook was also untouchable, and twenty years later he might have been a Colonel in Vietnam. It raises the controversial question of whether there was napalm in Europe in WWII. Yes they did. P-47 fighters were armed with napalm in 1945 to take out German tanks. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFrizb_8aa1.html" title="User:Frizb">Frizb</a> 02:16, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I've extended the "Redux" section which was really short of infos: "Willard sleeps with a French..." which is both false<b>¹</b> and insignificant for the 4-chapter running French Plantation act. I've added two screenshots like it was done for the 1979 cut. "The family together" quote is ironical and a courteous reference to your own "it smells like victory".</li>
</ul>
<p><b>¹</b> <i>actually she left him after he's stoned (and not in condition for doing anything but sleeping). Having sex with Willard would had been "incestuous" (and irrespectful vis-a-vis Hubert de Marais) for Roxanne Sarrault as she is a Hubert de Marais' son widow and she remains with the de Marais family (the French expression is "living under their roof") as a black widow</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a French myself, I tought it could be useful to explain the French Plantation chapter for those who are not familiar with the French political context nor the geopolitical background of this era.

<p>--<a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarialima_1656.html" title="User:Farialima">Farialima</a> 09:03, 31 August 2006 (UTC) One wrong fact from this otherwise great article: "...This touchy French political critique was removed from the 1979 cut which was premiered at Cannes, in a time where the French Communist Party was the country's first political strength..." In 1979 the communist party was not anymore "the first political strength" in France. This is factually wrong. The socialist party (with Mitterand at its head) had, at this time, shown its supremacy on the left. I would suppose, however, that Coppola avoided presenting the Cannes crowd and jury with a presentation of France's still recent colonial past that could have created controversy - not directly between communists and others, but definetly between left and right, and possibly within the "socialist" left. Interestingly enough, the short discussion in the dialog about "Pierre Mendes France was a Communist - No he was socialist" reflectd - to this day - the discussions of the origin of the modern left in France. In any case, the dialogs during this scene are quite subtle and cannot really be interpreted as one-sided about France's colonial history. This political presentation is - yet another - aspect that makes this movie quite a masterpiece (but of course this last sentence is not neutral&#160;:-)</p>

<p>I did see a documentary a few years ago which claimed that a retired CIA operator by the name of Tony Po was the inspiration behind Kurtz. He had apparently formed something of a private army to carry out his own agenda in Cambodia, and claimed to have been the subject of several CIA assassination attempts. Has anyone else seen this? If so, could we put in some references to it? [JRJW May '06]</p>

<p>'Pretentious' has only recently become a buzzword among people who talk about movies. It's mostly used by the sort of people who post messages at IMDB, and they don't use it very accurately (for instance, adding the unnecessary qualifier). I would bet that no critic actually applied the word to Apocalypse Now, and this is someone's sloppy attempt at a summary of opinion. 70.130.136.215 14:19, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Um, I've heard the word pretentious used to describe movies as far back as the 80's, and I'm sure that it was used at some point before then. You might just have become aware of the word recently on IMDB, but I assure you that people have been using that word to describe certain types of film, art, novels, etc, etc, etc, throughout recent history.

<p>I've seen <i>Apocalypse Now</i> more than I've seen any other film. Somehow I hadn't looked up the film here in the years I've been on Wikipedia. What a terrific, thorough entry! I own books on AN, I've seen many versions, I've seen the documentary <i>Heart's of Darkness</i>, I own the soundtrack that has talking tracks and I listen to it when I drive sometimes, still I had a lot to learn from this page.

<p>What's intesting is that the poem begins with a quote from the book <b>Heart of Darkness</b>, and it's last line is "This is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a whimper!", nearly the exact words Hopper's character exclaims before diserting the camp.</p>

<p>it is mentioned that it was heavily influenced both by style and substance which is not true even though capolla noted that apocalypse now was influenced by agguire but he never mentioned that it was totally based on agguire.Apocalypse now is not a ripoff of Aggure so i am makiong the mentioned change.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't say "it was totally based on Aguire". It doesn't say "it was a ripoff of Aguire". It says it was <i>heavily influenced by it</i>. That's not the same thing. <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECop_633_e50e.html" title="User:Cop 633">Cop 633</a> 12:22, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
