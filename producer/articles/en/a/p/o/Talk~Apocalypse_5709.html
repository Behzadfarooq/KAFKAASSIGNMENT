<p>Actually, it is <i>not</i> known commonly as "Revelation" but as "Revelations". People who point out that the latter is not a correct rendering of what is written are missing the point, which is that the plural form both is in ordinary spoken use, and has come down from a separate oral/visual tradition (a bit like Adam and Eve eating an apple, simply because that was the fruit ordinarily shown in stained glass window versions). PML.</p>
<p>But it <i><b>is</b></i> '<i><b>The</b> Revelation</i>. As the very first sentence says,&#160;:<i>The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants what must soon take place; and he made it known by sending his angel to his servant John</i> -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<p>See? People miss the point. I am very carefully <i>not</i> saying anything about what it <i>is</i> - either way - I am pointing out what it is commonly known as. While it becomes a matter of approach, possibly of opinion, which is right, it is a matter of objective fact that it is <i>not</i> known commonly as "Revelation" but as "Revelations". Don't believe me? Do a straw poll of people you meet in the street (being careful not to predispose the answers). PML.</p>
<p>"Book of Revelations" on Google turns up 18,500 hits. "Book of Revelation" turns up 135,000. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<p>I didn't suggest you consult putatively accurate information, even from secondary sources - I suggested that if you were concerned you should check what people thought. I am leading up to correcting that article in the respect in which it is incorrect - the way it claims that the last book of the New Testament is <b>commonly</b> called "Revelation". As to whether it <b>ought</b> to be called that, that is another question entirely. PML.</p>

<dd>Zoe, PML's not saying that "Revelations" is <i>correct</i>, or that he/she wants people to call it "Revelations". PML's just saying that, as a matter of objective fact, many people do (incorrectly) call it "Revelations", and that consequently the article's statement that the Revelation is "known commonly as <i>Revelation</i>" is incomplete, if not actually wrong.</dd>

<p>There is suggestions throughout the theory of evolution and time that organisms get smaller during evolution to adapt to there environment. Earth was relatively bigger, and oxygen escapes naturally making the environment smaller. Now if we put this theory into practice, in accordance with the myths of Atlantean giants or similar species of larger ape as men, and reptiles evolving into birds, mammals devolving into rats, and oceanic species? its no suprise. Atlantis created the deluge, Venus was created from Jupiter and spured insects. Wat say <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus.html" title="Venus">Venus</a> was not inhabited by insects? <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larva.html" title="Larva">Larva</a>? The heat of the sun? They out number us, and can destroy wat we become on this earth. Still oceans a satisfactory breeding ground? Motion stills and power cools. Even if the ocean became covered in water do to environmental catastrophes even it needs to cool.

<p>For the following sentence an anonymous editor 69.160.210.206 added the phrase "ineffective people going to hell". "The eschatological end of the world was often accompanied by images of resurrection, judgement of the dead in apocalyptic literature, and ineffective people going to hell." To be honest, my knowledge of the Apocalypse and Revalations is rusty, and I'm just following the edits done by someone who has done some odd edits, but I doubt that the addition is accurate.

<p>The part of the article concerning Islamic views on the apocalypse, seems either grossly confused or intended to confuse. For starters, Mirza Ahmed and his sect "the Ahmadis" or Qadiyanis are not considered muslims by either sunnis or shi`ites. Nor do Islamic beliefs admit anyone OTHER THAN Jesus Christ as the Messiah.</p>
<p>The more egregious error is in the author's claim that al-Azhar condones the Ahmadis' claims. It can't be further from the truth. As al-azhar and every other center of islamic scholarship and jurisprudence have been unanimous is rejecting the claims by Ghulam Mirza Ahmed from the start.</p>
<p>To repeat, islamic tenets are explicit that anyone claiming to be a prophet or a messenger after the prophet Muhammad, is a liar and a fraud; and that only Jesus Christ is awaited at the end times. There is difference on whether a Mahdi will appear.</p>
<p>The tendency to use the title, as a device to rally support and raise zeal in situations where a local leader is fighting a foreign occupier of a Muslim land (such as the sunni self-styled Mahdi in Sudan during Gordon's time in the XIXth century, and the shiite "Mahdi Army" in Iraq fighting the US occupation in 2003/2004.</p>
<p>Adding text (in the body of the article) and external links to pages subscribing to the Qadiyani/Ahmadi sect as part of Islam and Islamic beliefs and discourse is akin to passing Wicca or Paganism as part of Christianity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, concerning the notion that some of the more infamous or notorious militant figures associated with Islam, such as Osama bin laden, are milleniarists or apocalyptics is not sound. Neither Khomeini (a shi`ite) or bin-Laden (a sunni) have made any mention of the "end times" or of an apocalypse, nor do they seem to regard themselves as either mahdis or messiahs, as this would instantly discredit them in the eyes of Muslims (however discredited they already appear.)</p>
<p>My position on this matter can be amply verified from history as well as Islamic sources and texts.</p>
<p>I am therefore tempted to remove the problematic parts, but I have decided to wait a while, to see responses on this discussion page. If no one else removes the errors concerning this matter, eventually I hope to remove them myself.</p>

<dd>

<dd>I think you are correct on some points and not on others. Osama bin-Laden is clearly apocalyptic in the generic sense of the world, but avoids references to the end times as is appropriate for his religious background in Wahhabism. There are several views of the end times in Muslim theology.

<p>This page concentrates on apocalyptism in Christianity, with some small amount of (disputed) material on Islam, and almost nothing on Judaism. I propose creating a seperate page on Apocalypticism and break the redirect. The page would look at the various scholarly theories on apocalyptic belief in the larger sense, including secular apocalypticism. This is a growing area of history and sociology, as well as religious studies.

<p>As far as I understand, because of the Hindu cyclical view of time, the apocalypse is not an end of existence as claimed in the introduction, but rather the end of the Kali Yuga, which causes a return to the first age of the time cycle.

<p>Judeo-Christian "revelations" have historically been called apocalyptic because many of those texts are in Greek. There are no Greek Hindu writings.

<p>It has been said that the year 2012 may be the possible apocalypse. More specifically on the winter solstice, December 21 of 2012 is said to be said apocalypse. The Ancient Mayan Calander, which was able to predict lunar eclipses thousands of years preceeding the said lunar eclipses, suddenly ends on said date. Many other oracles who were well credited as well said the same thing. Scientists now say that on that date the earth will come to align with the sun and the black hole at the center of the solar system. Once this happens the polar axises will dissalign, causing chaos. Tides will change and highten, the mantle will rotate and cause many earthquakes. All of theses things will happen if we dont create our own apocolypse throught global warming first.</p>
