<p>Anyone out there have a better picture of Apocalypse? No offense to Dave DeVries (who produces excellent art) and the person who initially placed the current picture up, but it does little justice to such an immensely towering figure as Apocalypse.</p>

<p>Holocaust was in Stryfe Strike Files, the Marvel One Shot tie in to X-Cutioner's Song previously mentioned. This was a hint of his eventual appearance in our world, from another reality, and there is no 616 (main marvel continuity) Holocaust. He probably died at some point. He's a son from an alternate reality. And LazerBeem was correct.

<p>Yeah. He's back, and due to the Techno Organic Virus retcon, all they need is to slaughter some useless background normal guy and wham, Apocalypse is back.

<p>Has anyone attempted to translate "En Sabah Nur" into a language other than 'Arabic'? Ancient Egyptian might be an interesting (and more sensible) candidate. Breaking down the <i>sounds</i> in the name, the (computer) transliteration would probably be <tt>in sbA nwr</tt> or <tt>in sbi nwA</tt>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In my admittedly limited knowledge of Hebrew it means something like "Well of Seven Lamps" 'En = Well,Sabah = Seven</li>
</ul>
<p>Nur or Ner meaning lamp,the more recognizable meNORah containing a form of it. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESochwa_f52c.html" title="User:Sochwa">Sochwa</a> 10:34, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The literal translation of "En Sabah Nur" in the Arabic would be "Of the morning light," and the word "en," as far as I know with my limited knowledge of the Egyptian dialect, can best be translated as "of" or "by." "Sabah" literally means morning, and "Nur" means light in modern standard Arabic.</p>

<p>The given translation of Apocalypse's name, the First One, into Ancient Egyptian would be most closely approximated by <tt>wa tpi</tt> (prononuced approximately as <i>wah teh-peh-ee</i>). Decidedly not En Sabah Nur.</p>

<p>There is a term <tt>zbj</tt> which means <i>send</i>. There is a term <tt>sbA</tt>, which translates to <i>star</i> or <i>gate/doorway</i>. It is also the verb <i>to teach</i>. Interestingly, there is another term <tt>sbnw</tt> (pronounced seh-beh-nu) that means <i>to go off course</i>, and bears an obvious similarity to <tt>sbA nwr</tt> and variants thereof. When one sees <tt>n</tt> as a suffix to a verb, it conotes the Perfect tense (i.e. has heard, has done). <tt>sbA.n</tt> might be <i>has taught</i>.</p>
<p>It's also possible this is two terms combined. <tt>z</tt> is <i>man</i> and <tt>zA</tt> is <i>son</i>, <i>protection/safeguard</i>, or <i>phyle.</i> <tt>sA</tt> is <i>back.</i> To connect with this term, <tt>bA</tt> is the <i>soul</i> or <i>personality.</i> <tt>bjn</tt> can mean <i>bad</i> or <i>evil</i>. Interestingly, <tt>bnr</tt> means <i>sweet.</i></p>

<p>There is no direct term that resembles <tt>nwr</tt> or <tt>nwA</tt>. The closest to the front portion is <tt>nw</tt>, which can mean '<i>time</i> or <i>to look after/see to</i>. The closest to the rear portion is <tt>wr</tt>, which can mean <i>great, elder, important.</i></p>

<p>Given the preceding, "by (the) great star" (<tt>in sbA wr</tt>) might be one translation, though it omits the <tt>n</tt>. Another might be "by (which the) elder has taught" (<tt>in sbA.n wr</tt>) though it disregards the rule that <tt>in</tt> must be succeeded by a noun phrase. Yet another might be "by (the) great son (of) evil" or "by (the) protection (of) great evil" (<tt>in zA bjn wr</tt>). It's this last one that I think most closely resembles the name, phonetically.</p>

<p>In Rise of Apocalypse En Sabah Nur's mutation seemed to be nothing more than disfigurment and possibly some enhanced physical abilities; he didn't seem to have access to any shape shifting abilites. I was basically under the impression that pretty much all his powers are the result of Kang's technology and the Celestials tampering with him. Is it stated somewhere that the shape shifting is a true mutation and not an ability Kang's technology or the Celestials gave him? Additionally, why under the "first mutant" section does it state that Apocalypse was immortal for centuries before being enhanced? I may be missing some information, but I was under the impression that he used Kang/Rama-Tut's technology to keep himself alive even before the Celestials altered him.<a href="../../../d/1/p/User%7ED1Puck1T_7199.html" title="User:D1Puck1T">D1Puck1T</a> 22:46, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I recall him growing to a fairly large size during <i>Rise of Apocalypse</i>, so that at least could be an innate Mutant power. I don't recall readig anywhere where it's ben said he used Kang's tech to keep himself alive for centuries (he didn't encounter the Celestial Ship until many centuries after his slave days in Egypt)... but I'm probably missing something, since I don't recall any mention of him using Kang's tech at all, but surely he <i>would</i> have.</dd>
<dd>I was also under the impression that the Celestials didn't alter him, he altred himself using their tech. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Archeville_f114.html" title="User:Dr Archeville">Dr Archeville</a> 02:12, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The art didn't help <i>at all</i>, but I was under the impression that he maybe grew a little, but mostly just upped his strength, and that was what made the Egyptian slavers notice him. But again, I don't know if he was growing or if that art was just being messy in showing he got stronger. Still, I thought it was pretty clear that he took Kang/Rama-Tut's technology for his own use, until the Celestial involvement gave him even better toys.<a href="../../../d/1/p/User%7ED1Puck1T_7199.html" title="User:D1Puck1T">D1Puck1T</a> 02:41, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I recently got ahold of the Rise of Apocalypse. Apocalypse's power increased a few times over the course of the story. He had superhuman strength, rapid healing (he recovered from his chest being smashed with a very large boulder within a week), the ability to survive at least 5 weeks without food or water, and the ability to increase his size (although the comic implies that his ability to grow is in fact part of his ability to shapeshift, or at least related to it). He also did not seem to age in a 50 year period, hinting at his longevity.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is possible that his immortality is a side-effect of his shape-shifting/regenerative powers, similar to Mystique and Wolverine.</p>
<p>The best example of Apocalypse increasing his height and mass, that I've seen, wasn't in any comic but rather the X-Men animated series back in the 1990s. I think the episode was titled "Obsession" and it involved Archangel searching for a way to destroy Apocalypse and all that. Anyhow, Apocalypse grew to a height that had to be in the vicinity of 100 feet. I don't know if he's capable of growing anywhere close to that height in the comics or if it was just a little creative license used on the show since it wasn't part of the X-Men comics. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a> 17:08, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Apocalypse looks somewhat similar to Darksied from the DC comics in his second incarnation and, in crossovers, might even be related to him." I'm not seeing the similarity (other than possible skin tone and basic build), and I'm not familiar with any crossover that's implied they're related. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Archeville_f114.html" title="User:Dr Archeville">Dr Archeville</a> 23:30, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Only problem is that crossovers between the two universes aren't considered to be canon. Take the DC Vs. Marvel crossover back in the mid 1990s, it's not considered canon since it gives each universe an excuse as to why their own characters were defeated in fights. To my knowledge, Darkseid and Apocalypse have never met in any Marvel/DC crossover. Darkseid has come several Marvel characters during crossover events, most notably his Marvel counterpart Thanos and Galactus. Despite how Apocalypse has turned out, he was born on Earth in ancient Egypt. He's human but is also believed to the world's first mutant. Darkseid is an extraterrestrial. They have similar personalities in the sense that they're both tyrannical, ruthless, and similar personal philosophies. They're often considered to be "godlike" because of their powers and intelligence, but there's no real connection between them. <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a> 16:27, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's what I was thinking; I'll remove that Trivia. Though, I believe the last Marvel/DC crossover -- the <a href="../../../j/l/a/JLA_Avengers_e58f.html" title="JLA/Avengers">JLA/Avengers</a> thing -- is considered canon in both. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Archeville_f114.html" title="User:Dr Archeville">Dr Archeville</a> 18:34, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've heard that as well, but I'm not really sure. I've browsed over the discussion area over some of the articles, such as Thor, and some say it's canon and some say it isn't. I don't really know if it is, but I'm not gonna disagree if someone says it's canon. Why would that one be canon, however, and not all the others though? <a href="../../../o/d/i/User%7EOdin%27s_Beard_da35.html" title="User:Odin's Beard">Odin's Beard</a> 22:38, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first is just a theory and if there isn't anything to back it up should it really be in the powers and abilities section since it is just a "fan" theory?</p>
<p>Also, I know Apocalypse is powerful, but considering the seemingly large number of other beings whose powers dwarf his such as the abstracts, Celestials, primary mystical entities, skyfathers, etc. should this statment really be in there? <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeekquaze_f177.html" title="User:Seekquaze">seekquaze</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The first one, as a theory with nothing to back it up, should definitely not be included. The second is definitely a stretch. One of the most powerful mutants in the MU? Definitely.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/o/Talk%7EApocalypse_%28comics%29_7c0e.html" title="Edit section: The Twelve">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Twelve</span></h2>
<p>The story of the Twelve begins with a young mutant by the name of Tanya Trask, who would later become Madam Sanctity. Adrift in the timestream, Tanya was rescued by Rachel Summers, in her guise of Mother Askani, and took her to the future, where she healed her mind. The future, under the rule of Apocalypse, was somber and grim, and Tanya sought to change it. She traveled back in time, three years before the formation of the X-Men, despite Mother Askani's warnings not to do so, and attempted to contact her father, Bolivar Trask. Rachel followed her and stopped her from revealing herself to her father, but not before Tanya could tamper with her father's creation, Master Mold, and upload a program called "The Twelve".</p>
<p>Years later, as Cyclops pondered his relationship with Madelyne Pryor in Alaska, he was attacked by Master Mold, who claimed Cyclops was one of the "strong" one of the Twelve and had to be killed. Master Mold was stopped, but not before revealing several other possible members of the Twelve, such as Charles Xavier, Apocalypse, Storm, Jean Grey, and Franklin Richards among others.</p>
<p>Master Mold survived the encounter and later faced Power Pack in an attempt to kill Franklin Richards. As the youngsters fought the demented robot, he revealed the nature of the Twelve: "The dozen mutant humans who will one day rise up and lead all of mutantkind in war against homo sapiens in the twilight of earth." He was stopped, but not before revealing several other possible candidates, including Danielle Moonstar, Cannonball and Psylocke.</p>
<p>The subsequent mention of the Twelve came from Apocalypse himself, claiming that not only he was one of the "fabled Twelve" but so too were all five original X-Men, Charles Xavier, Storm, Cannonball and Cable.</p>
<p>As the new millenium approached, a series of events led to the return of Apocalypse. Cable was witness to said events-- the darkening of New York City, the arrival of the Harbinger of Apocalypse, and several other signs. Mother Askani's astral form revealed herself to Cable, implanting the knowledge of who the Twelve were. Sadly, he never had the opportunity to find them.</p>
<p>Apocalypse began his attack by planting a fake Wolverine among the ranks of the X-Men. This led Xavier, who suspected of infiltration, to disband the X-Men. The X-Men parted ways, and soon after, Rogue and Shadowcat found themselves protecting Mystique from Japan's military, the Yakiba. As Rogue fought Sunfire and his men, Kitty "babysat" Mystique and found, unwillingly, Destiny's diary. The diary itself had a very criptic description of a "thirteenth" and told that the Twelve would be involved in the destruction of the world.</p>
<p>With the death of Wolverine's imposter, the X-Men reunited at the mansion, only to discover it wasn't truly Wolverine who had died, but a Skrull. The infiltrator had been found. To save Polaris from adbuction, Cyclops took her place using an image inducer, and the X-Men followed him to the Skrulls' lair, where they were attacked by Death, Apocalypse's most lethal and fiercest Horseman, the same person responsible for the death of the fake Wolverine. After a heavy battle, Death was unmasked by Colossus. The X-Men were surprised to see their newest enemy was in truth the real Wolverine. Death escaped, leaving the X-Men with half-truths and enigmas that needed solving.</p>
<p>Soon after, Xavier revealed the "List of Twelve", for it was clearly written in Destiny's Diary. The Twelve were: Cyclops, Phoenix, Storm, Magneto, Polaris, Living Monolith, Bishop, Cable, Xavier, Iceman, Mikhail Rasputin and Sunfire. But whatever part they had to play was not revealed.</p>
<p>The Horsemen of Apocalypse kidnapped Cable, Mikhail Rasputin, Iceman, Sunfire and the Living Monolith. The X-Men, with Magneto's help, rushed to Egypt, to Apocalypse's lair. They were soon attacked by an army of Skrulls and followers of Apocalypse. Amidst the battle, Bishop, who had been trapped in an alternate future reality, appeared out of thin air, furthering the confusion. Thanks to illusions and lies, the agents of Apocalypse were able to kidnap all remaining members of the Twelve. Their true role was then explained at last. Placing the Twelve inside containment cells, part of an ages-old Celestial machine, Apocalypse revealed his plan was to siphon the energies of the "Eleven of Power" through the Living Monolith to start the machine, which would grant him omnipotence. The role of each mutant was clearly explained by Apocalypse. Polaris and Magneto were opposing magnetic poles. Storm, Iceman and Sunfire were extreme forces of nature. Cyclops, Jean, and Cable represented the unity of family. Bishop and Mikhail provided control over time and space, and Xavier provided the power of pure thought. However, Apocalypse knew his frail, centuries-old body would not be able to withstand such power. And that's when he revealed the thirteenth mutant, the X-Man, Nate Grey. He intented to transfer his consciousness into Nate's young body and then use the energies of the Twelve to evolve.</p>
<p>He began the process, but Magneto's then-recent power loss was something Apocalypse had not counted, and soon his energies were depleted, creating a break in the chain of power. Apocalypse increased the flow of energies, attempting to bypass the break, but this drove the Living Monolith insane, destroying his containment unit and starting a rampage that unwillingly released the X-Men. While half of the team battled the Monolith, the other half attempted to stop Apocalypse. Jean Grey exposed the true nature of Apocalypse, showing his rotting body inside his armor. As he tried to enter Nate Grey's body, Cyclops took his place, sacrificing himself to save Nate. Jean attempted to contact her husband's mind, but Xavier claimed there was nothing of Cyclops left inside Apocalypse. Using the energies of the Twelve, Apocalypse re-made reality twice, attempting to re-create the process once more and finish his transformation. He was unable to do so, for the X-Men fought him both times, in the past and the future. His energies spent, he and the Living Monolith escaped. The X-Men had prevented Apocalypse from becoming a god, at the seeming expense of Cyclops' life.</p>
