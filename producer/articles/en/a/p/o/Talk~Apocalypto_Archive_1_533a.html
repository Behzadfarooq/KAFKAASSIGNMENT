<h2><span class="mw-headline">Plot</span></h2>
<p>Any ideas as to what this movie will be about?</p>
<p>It's about this guy who doesn't want to be sacrificed, so he goes on an adventure. I found that out on wikipedia! <a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAugustulus_4295.html" title="User:Augustulus">Augustulus</a> 01:02, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Microsecond Cameo</span></h2>
<p>The article mentions a "microsecond" cameo in the first teaser trailer; but where in the teaser could he be seen? It would be better for the article to be more specific, so that those who wish to see the brief appareance can go look for it. And if it is too brief to be caught with the naked eye, without some kind of frame-by-frame viewing, then that should be noted in the trivia section.</p>
<p>I agree -- it should be in the trivia section. It's not in all versions of the trailer AFAIK, just some. Here's a link to a page where you can see it: <a href="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee/forums/a/tpc/f/34709834/m/928000596731" class="external free" title="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee/forums/a/tpc/f/34709834/m/928000596731" rel="nofollow">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee/forums/a/tpc/f/34709834/m/928000596731</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What nobody seems to notice</span></h2>
<p>Gibson is doing a huge cultural benefit to humanity by making movies in dead languages and rescuing them like arameic, latin and qüiché. You may call him a conservative, but he is definetly not an idiot. Definetly one of the most important film directors ever. Now thanks to him, this languages may live forever for future generations to study.209.124.117.47</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apocalyto was not film in K'ché, wich it is in fact a mayan root language in Guatemala, but Yucateco from the Yucatan peninsula in México, also a mayan language, both well know alive idioms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just for your information, the Mayan language is not dead. But yes, I do agree with about Mel Gibson. Although I personally despise his religous beliefs, he is an excellent filmmaker. I hope more directors begin to use ancient languages in historical films, it would add so much more dimension to them.</dd>

<dd>I hate his bigotry, and I think his films are cheesy and mindless. But I still love the use of ancient languages - it's fascinating to hear them being spoken. 129.173.96.91 15:24, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You're suggesting that Aramaic suddenly isn't dead simply because Mel Gibson made a movie where people (including, inexplicably, Roman soldiers) speak it? Despite the fact that Jews have been praying in Aramaic for twenty-five hundred years? But I suppose that Jews aren't in the purview of Mel Gibson's philanthropy. I should note also that no modern filmmaker has used ancient Greek more illiterately. -Maggie --70.50.79.164 14:25, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I share many of his poltics, anyway.

<dd>I apologize if I was in the wrong, but you created <i>five</i> unnecessary sections on this talk page (see your own link) to make one point (which struck me as vandalism), and you did not seem to make that point clear.

<p>What did I see? "hostile"? "spam"? My hostility was a humorous comment on this movie, "pap", et al. Have you even read any of the weblinked article? Have you commented on the relevance to the primary article, &amp; the movie, &amp; your hostile deletion, &amp; your accusations?</p>
<p>Your compatriots' implementation of "hostile" &amp; "spam" are significant influences on why there are several eforts akin to &lt; <a href="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://eng.anarchopedia.org/Main_Page</a> &gt;.

How is this related to the film <i>Apocalypto</i>?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Contradiction</span></h2>
<p>This article contradicts itself when mentioning when the film takes place:</p>
<p>1. In the opening paragraph it says: "set in Central America 600 years ago" 2. Under Plot Outline we read: "Apocalypto is a mythic historical drama set more than 1000 years ago"</p>
<p>Someone familiar with the story and historical setting should fix this.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Maxedesa (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maxedesa_ba5d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maxedesa">contribs</a>) 5 September 2006.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the appearance of the <i>conquistadores</i> at the end should definitively indicate the setting as nearly 500 years ago. However other practices and the types of monuments in use are more akin to the Classic era, ie a little over a thousand years ago. It would be important to note that this film is completely <i>fictional</i>, and as such the film-makers habitually take whatever liberties they think fit with historical chronology.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No-one ought really to expect films such as this to have much historical veracity behind it. One would hope (doubtless in vain) that folks do not come away from the film thinking they've seen a genuine depiction of pre-Columbian Maya culture at work, and they recognise it for a rather conventional mainstream concoction (despite the setting and the novelty of the language).

<dd>May be it is jargon. What do you define as jargon? Anyway, a pre-screening is when a director exhibits a movie before it is finished. When the film is finished, it is simply a screening. Gibson has not finished the movie yet. He claims that he is still editing down the film to get to the final product. The movie is set to open on December 8th.

While many cities of the central lowlands had been abandoned since the end of the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesoamerican_chronology.html" title="Mesoamerican chronology">Classic Era</a>, there were still active Maya cities, but it was a time of warfare between small states.

<dd>Still, the depiction of the "Mayan" civilization in this film seems much more in line with the Aztecs at the time. The Maya did exist during the film's setting (and still do, to some extent), but they did not have the thriving temple-city culture depicted in this film at the time the film is set, and many of the practices represented in the film fit more with those associated with the culturally similar but distinct Aztec/Mexica. If anything, the concept of "ravaging" neighboring villages for warriors to sacrifice during a time of percieved turmoil fits in with the last Flowery War of the Aztecs (a few decades earlier). It's also possible the communities seen here are not Aztec or Classic Mayan, but of one of the many related cultures in the area. Given the proximity to the coast, I was sugesting to my wife that this might be part of the early Spanish conacts with the Yucatan, rather than the more obvious assumption that the city is Tenochtitlan. Of course, it is just a movie, and I'm fine with a little historical inaccuracy if it brings greater popular attention to Mesoamerican cultures. Plus, the epic nature of the story allows for stretching of plausability (a chase that lasts several days without rest, a pregnant woman and child waiting with little food or water for days) and the combining of historical events (the conquest, the flowery war and the Classic Maya). - <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevingarcia_7e7c.html" title="User:Kevingarcia">Kevingarcia</a> 08:59, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes the maya had flourishing cities and built monumental architecture at the arrival of the spanish. They also practiced human sacrifice and wrote in hieroglyphs at the time of the spanish conquest.

<p>Can anyone comment on the accuracy of this movie in depicting the Maya as heavily involved in human sacrifice which was esp used by the Aztecs, not the Maya.</p>
<p>If error, that would be typical Gibson gibberish and blurring histoyr as he did e.g. in Braveheart depicting all normal, country side Scots as hugely filthy and starving (all inaccurate) and in Passion, blurring history again to depict huge flaying of Christ's skin on and on, which has no known documentation (except surely he WAS beaten severely , just not mostly entirely deflayed of his skin which would hae killed hiim before the cross) ... all Gibson gibberish , intened to use massively sadism to make a buck. (anon)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please sign your talk page comments. There was certainly human sacrifice in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, including by the Maya, and some of it was by rituals of gory theatricality. However I've seen some discussion already disputing the amount at the time and place depicted. The architectural look is a constructed "Maya" look made of elements from different geographic regions sometimes more than 1k years apart. Zhou and Ming dynasty combined, or a Gothic tower on a Doric temple. From Gibson's interviews I've read, his knowledge of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica seems rather shallow and not particularly accurate. I expect a more detailed review of such questions by some Mesoamerica scholar will be published in a form we can link to some time soon. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 11:36, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the link. However I have to take issue with the statement in the Ardren article "in the real world the Spanish arrived 300 years after the last Maya city was abandoned"! I wonder if the original said something like "Maya cities of the central lowlands" and an editor pruned it into inaccuracy? Certainly in northern Yucatan and highland Guatemala, such cities as Ti'ho, Izamal, Gumarcah, possibly, Tulum, etc, were still occupied when the Conquistadores arrived! -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 02:27, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Racism and colonialism</span></h2>
<p>When I heard that "Apocalypto" ends with the arrival of the Spanish, I just about died. I had this verified and am now utterly outraged. I figured Gibson was a racist from "Passion", given his prediliction for "evil" people being darker than "good" ones. Now this movie comes out to show the Mayan culture as disgusting, bloodthirsty and depraved and needing to be "rescued" by the kinder, gentler Spanish. Gag.</p>
<p>-- A wonder it is that you are still writing after your near death experience&#160;:) All the PC crap and phoney rightous indignation aside, in almost every single instance when colonial powers went any where (India, Central and South America, Africa, and many parts of the Far East), they had active support of the people they supposedly "enslaved". Many native Americans joined the Spanish in their wars of conquest against Incas and Aztecs, as well as in missions into modern US territories. The British conquered and ruled India with massive military and administrative support of native Indians. The white Rajas of Borneo and Sarawak were almost deified by the people they ruled. All these socieites where based on some sort of super-rigid social structure and often very opressive economic systems. Many lower caste or second class citizens actually ended up being better off under the colonial rule (lack of natural immunity against Eurasian disease in Americas aside) then before. The colonialism ended when there was no economic justification left for it with the growth of international trade in 19th and 20th century, not becuase of some heroic struggle of poorly armed and often badly led insurgent armies. The British never had any problem putting down the Indian mutiny, but once holding India became costly after the WWII, they granted the subcontinent independence. At that point, Indian people were not benefitting from the British rule, nor did the British benefit from holding to a very poor colony. South and Central AMerica gained independence once the people there did not need the court in Madrid to decide where and how to sell their goods.</p>
<p>So yes, presence of the Spaniards in late Classical Maya period is anachronistic, and it may have a grain of Christian (especially Catholic) bias to it, but let's face the facts: dominant native american political structures were opressive enough to make the Spaniards welcome when they arrived. <a href="../../../m/r/j/User%7EMrjahan_6771.html" title="User:Mrjahan">mrjahan</a></p>
