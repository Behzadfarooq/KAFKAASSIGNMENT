	    <p>When I set the framework with <i>To speak historically and dispassionately, rather than entirely from within orthodox Christian tradition,</i> I didn't mean to do anything except step outside, in the usual NPOV way. There are other threads of continuity from the 'sayings' and actions of Jesus beside the one Pauline thread that historically became the only non-"heretical" one. This NPOV can't be as diminished as it is in, say the <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i> etc. I meant to hurt no feelings, but a position from the <b>outside]</b> is the NPOV one. <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 02:01, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)~</p>

<dd>Your point is well taken. I wonder if the opening sentence wouldn't read smoother while retaining essentially the same meaning if it were slightly shortened, something like: <i>The Apostolic Fathers historically were a group of Christian authors who lived and wrote in the 1st and 2nd centuries.</i> The rest about being dispassionate and outside the orthodox Christian tradition is fine, but seems like we should be able to take it for granted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would also question the assumption in this article that Pauline Christianity is to be equated with Gentile Christianity, and that this Christianity is drastically different from that of James the Just. I know that's a widely held POV, but it certainly isn't undisputed fact. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 07:13, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only thing is, that as soon as one begins to take "for granted" that one is speaking dispassionately from outside the orthodox Christian tradition, that one need not even mention such a position, someone is certain to come along and suggest that any facts about the Christianity of the (now silent) James the Just are "disputed." Thus orthodoxy is enforced in silence. Why not make the first sentence smoother, without suppressing the <i>caveat</i>? Since "Gentile" Christianity is by definition preached to non-Jews, indeed it is not a mere synonym for Pauline Christianity. There is more than a little overlap, you'd probably agree. Arian Christianity is an example of Gentile conversion that is outside Pauline traditions. Why don't you make the edit? <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 13:21, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not so sure. Most early New Testament manuscripts have the Pauline Epistles after the other Epistles. The Syriac Church didn't even accept them as scripture until the fifth century or so. Even in very early liturgies the Book of the Gosples seems to have been handled with much more reverence than the books of epistles. The first christian writers to delve deeply into Paul's writings was John Chrysostom, only in the late fourth century. The Elevation of Paul to the be-all-and-end-all of early christian theology seems to be a product of the Reformation more than anything else, and seems to be related to the simple fact that his surviving writings are more voluminous than those of the other apostles. So if you throw out the tradition and admit only the New Testament (which of course is also a tradition), it is only natural the Paul receives more stres. -- 84.57.14.9 18:06, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I like Wesley's first line.<br />
I feel that an article explaining "Pauline Christianity" would also shed a <b>lot</b> of light on this article.<br />
The other option would be to drop the term "Pauline" altogether. I'm surprised that Blacklite depended upon that term so much.<br />
I understand "Pauline christianity" to be Protestant Christianity, not simply Gentile Christianity. (Though that may be from some bias).<br />
Perhaps we should also add links to the theological topics dicussed by these Fathers (Trinity, Christology, etc). --<a href="../../../o/s/p/User%7EOsprey_d1be.html" title="User:Osprey">Osprey</a> 16:56, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was going to turn <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_Christianity_2d94.html" title="Pauline Christianity">Pauline Christianity</a> into a stub, on Osprey's suggestion. but <i>"lo!"</i> there it already was: quite unlooked-for, apparently. Dreary topic, really, and attracts such humorless company... Never mind, when the subject is <b>Apostolic Fathers</b>, the subtext is that these boys offer the only authentic connections to the apostolic generation, is it not? "Apostolic... fathers." Quite authoritative. That's part of the meaning of the termâ€” and of its usefulness in manipulating discourse. Thus a <i>possible</i> motivation for its use, anyone would have to admit. The expression <b>Pauline Christianity</b> suggests that there might be other strains: <i>Gnostic Christianity</i> <i>Petrine doctrine</i> or <i>Johannine Christianity</i> can't be novelties to virgin ears. "To drop the term "Pauline" altogether" would suppress even the possibility of alternatives, wouldn't it? What a very revealing suggestion. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 17:57, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't done any major editing to this article at all. It looks like the Pauline stuff was added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostolic_Fathers&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=2878208" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostolic_Fathers&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=2878208" rel="nofollow">here</a> by Wetman.</dd>
<dd>I don't object to any specific mention of anything, Pauline or whatever, but the article just doesn't seem very coherent to me. It isn't broken up into sections at all, and it doesn't seem to present a really solid picture of the subject from all angles -- it may, I guess, but it just doesn't seem to flow well, or be really well organized.</dd>
<dd>Also, re: the introductory sentence, it sounds really odd to me because when one reads an encyclopedia article one expects that the subject will always be discussed dispassionately. NPOV should not have to be declared in a disclaimer, it is the way things should be written and should be assumed by the reader. "Step[ping] outside, in the usual NPOV way" is an instruction from the wikipedia community to itself, not something that the reader should be hearing about, I think. As a pretty strong example, the article about <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> does not have any such stepping-outside disclaimer sentence. Something like that just seems to mess up the flow.</dd>
<dd>Despite all my opinions, however, I know I'm not nearly as informed about the Apostolic Fathers than some or perhaps most practicing Christians, so that's why I added that "Attention" template.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Whether or not the term "Apostolic Fathers" perpetuates the Pauline discourse or not, I don't know if it's our responsibility as wikipedia writers to write articles that warn the reader of such so explicitly -- it seems to me like overcompensation. Can we not just point out that it is just that, a term, used by some (? most?) Christian churches to refer to a group of authors whom they believe were directly involved or strongly influenced by the original Apostles, letting the reader connect the dots if they are so inclined?</dd>
<dd>The meat of this article, in my opinion, ought to be: who the Apostolic Fathers are -- and whether this varies from church to church, or historically; what they historically did, if we know any solid historical facts about them; what they are believed to have done by the churches; how their writings affected Christian thought and the controversies etc surrounding the interpretations of their writings; etc. The meta-discussion about the veracity of the term itself and the implied authority it brings etc and the fact that some Christians do not accept that they are the only true link to the Apostles should be a section, not the focus. Whether or not one believes the Pauline Christian idea of the importance of the Apostolic Fathers, this article is about them. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacklite_d2f8.html" title="User:Blacklite">Blacklite</a> 07:43, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
