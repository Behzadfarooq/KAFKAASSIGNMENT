<p>"<i>There's the almost endless list of song lyrics and obtuse references to video games, bits of film script and random TV shows. I don't see what any of that stuff adds, but I am not a fan of bloated "trivia" sections in any article.</i>" - I respect your point of view that you are not a fan of trivia, but pop-culture references are important to some people, indeed, who are we to judge whether or not pop-culture references are the most important thing? Scholars of popular culture will value the section more highly than the science. This is what NPOV means when it comes to editing - we cannot make value judgments about the importance of factual, verifiable information based on our own prejudices. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 17:10, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For certain classical music pieces, for example the William Tell Overture, the Ride of the Walkyries and Beethoven's Ninth, there are separate "trivia" or "pop culture" pages due to the large quantity of them. There is also a separate page for the Statue of Liberty in pop culture. It becomes a judgment call as to the relative size of that section vs. its importance to the main point of the article. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:33, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>lol! There is more than a comedy argument there - I saw in the archive a discussion about framing the article as a "social phenomena". In many ways it would be easier to write in that context, and (if I may be so bold) represent the majority viewpoint of the topic (not trying to troll, just stating it as I see it). For the avoidance of doubt, I am not planning to go there again. Also, an article/list of "cultural references to the moon landing hoax social phenomena" does not exactly trip off the tongue, sadly. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeG_3209.html" title="User:LeeG">LeeG</a> 19:18, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I was just checking the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loch_Ness_Monster_861a.html" title="Loch Ness Monster">Loch Ness Monster</a> page, and I see it has a separate popular culture page also. I could argue that there is more evidence for Nessie's existence than for the moon hoaxsters' "theory". However, the "social phenomonen" approach was tried before and was shot down by the hoaxsters, as it's one of those things that's patently obvious but also (1) hard to cite calmly-written references for and (2) hard to write about without it sounding like POV-pushing. It's similar to the debate over "conspiracy theory". In fact, it's essentially the <i>same</i> debate: conspiracy theorists don't like being called conspiracy theorists. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 19:41, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

A number of groups and individuals have advanced alternate historical narratives which tend, to varying degrees, to include the following common elements:</p>

<li>The Apollo <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronaut.html" title="Astronaut">Astronauts</a> did not land on the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a>;</li>
<li>NASA and possibly others intentionally deceived the public into believing the landing[s] did occur by manufacturing, destroying, or tampering with evidence, including photos, <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telemetry.html" title="Telemetry">telemetry</a> tapes, transmissions, and rock samples;</li>
<li>NASA and possibly others continue to actively participate in the conspiracy to this day.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to a 1999 poll conducted by the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gallup_Organization_9c42.html" title="The Gallup Organization">The Gallup Organization</a>, 6 percent of the US public believes the landing was faked, while what Gallup termed an "overwhelming majority", some 89 percent, did not.<sup id="_ref-gallup1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gallup1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The hoax claims are widely dismissed as baseless by mainstream scientists, technicians and engineers, as well as by NASA and its astronauts.

<li>I would say that a few key individuals could be mentioned. Kaysing, certainly, as he seems to be the most often quoted hoaxster.

<dd>It's important that the list be comprehensive. The ones that have their own article can be cut to a couple of sentences, but I'm still concerned that we should keep the biographic info on the bio pages, and the hoax stuff on this page.

<dd>They could all be listed here, as long as it's sufficiently brief.

<dd>I know I have not been accused of this for a minute, but I am not trying to remove any data or hide anything, I am trying to shorten this article, and have several sub articles where the big sections used to be. Looking at the bio article in isolation I have here an exact duplicate of the information on that page for all names after (and including) Renee. I appreciate from the text that Renee seems to be more than a bit player, so I would propose that we zap all those after that, replacing with something along the lines of "several other individuals make further claims doubting various aspects of the landings. They, and their claims are explored in more depth on the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Moon_landing_hoax_accusers_c30d.html" title="Apollo Moon landing hoax accusers">Apollo Moon landing hoax accusers</a> page." If that is too much to bear, can we just have names and occupations rather than an information repeat? It's also an opportunity here to expand the bio page for these guys if we have any more information.</dd>

<p>I am also concious that the "accused" section is repeated on the other page, my vague plan for those guys (will post some text in a bit) was just to list out name and position at NASA (or wherever) at the time of the landings.

<dd>Good news. There are two more sections that can (to my mind) be spun out in similar manners. The blow by blow debunking, and the cultural references. The first of these is the hardest to do fairly, but has the compensation of being an interesting article in its own right, as I think it's well written and it covers a lot of science, photography and other topics. The first stage of pulling it out would be to have a page dedicated to itself, and leave this article intact until we are happy with that page. Even the title of that page is fraught with problems. "rebuttal of the moon landing hoax arguments" is not a great title. "Examination of claims..." smacks of original research. The next issue would be how to frame the article. It needs an introduction, the text from this article would be fine, and I think it needs a quick bit on Occam's Razor, and the burden of proof, and the two stories bit. That would give it some context. Then do the "apparent anomaly" followed by "explanation" section.</dd>
<dd>More of an issue is to decide how this page should remain. There is lot of stuff here, and a simple list will not shorten the article, as it needs the explanation attached to it. Could we "group" the accusations as (e.g.) Photographic anomalies - hoax protagonists claim several anomalies within the photographic record that they claim prove the landings were a hoax. Each of these is explained with a basic understanding of the Lunar environment and photography. I'm sure couching it like that will be dubbed as POV pushing, but it's a start, and it's here on the discussion page not the article. I note that two regular denizens of this page are currently blocked, I await their return and input on this (and the last edit) with interest. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeG_3209.html" title="User:LeeG">LeeG</a> 18:22, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The cultural references could definitely be spun off, as many other articles do. That part is basically "fluff" that doesn't add any information except as an amusing sidebar, anecdotally demonstrating peoples' reactions to the hoax accusations. They could be interpreted by hoaxsters as adding to the criticism to NASA, while they could be interpreted by conventionalists as ridiculing the hoaxsters. They could also be doing <i>both</i> at the same time. Regarding the question-answer stuff, there is already a spinoff page that goes into the picture-related questions in great detail; again, a situation where it used to be in the primary article. It is hard to label this stuff in a politically correct way, but it's worth a try. I tried at one time, by replacing "accusations" and "claims" with more neutral wording like "challenges" and "responses". As long as the page doesn't have just the questions without the responses, it could be fair. Then the long, detailed list could be in a spinoff. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 19:07, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that the debunking of the hoax claims should be removed.

<dd>I didn't spot the spin-off photography article. This has spawned articles all over the place - seemingly more than the articles on the landings themselves. That amazes me, but if it makes people read it and learn some real science, then it's worthwhile I guess. It's important that the claims and debunking remain on the same page. I would even contend that this is as good a manner as any to do it, separate sections may make a lazy reader just see one side. I was trying to work out how to reduce the size of this article, and that section takes up vast swathes of it; it's an "easy" way to reduce the page. I'll have another think tomorrow. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeG_3209.html" title="User:LeeG">LeeG</a> 00:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I like to think that wikipedia has an opportunity to be one of the few sites (or maybe the only one) that tries to present this topic without going off on a rant in <i>either</i> direction. That's what most of the defenders of this page want, I think. It would be nice to do a brief overview, or maybe just the most-frequent complaints about the NASA saga, with more details on the spinoff page, if it can be agreed on how to do that without the hoaxsters accusing anyone of censorship. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:29, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is video footage of Armstrong allegedly descending the ladder to walk on the moon's surface for the first time. But if so, then how was a camera placed there to record him? Did Armstrong climb down, set up the camera, then climb back up, and pretend he was doing it for the first time?

<dd>Arguing with Landing Believers is like talking to Young Earth Creationists. There's no reference to evidence by either. Wouldn't it be simpler to admit that the descent was filmed in a studio? You can see the 'hot spots' of studio lights as he descends, and the lighting is all wrong for the Moon. I'm not saying that the whole landing was faked, but this piece of footage definitely was - and you can understand why - "a remote control robot arm filmed him"? Please.

<dd>The famous black and white video of Armstrong going down the ladder was from the TV camera. The original SSTV was recorded as data, onto the "missing" tapes. After conversion for standard TV, it was recorded on kinescope, videotape, or both. (Probably each network recorded it onto videotape, since they replayed it shortly afterward. But I've also read of it being recorded on kinescope, with is a 16mm camera pointed at a TV,) There is also color 16mm film taken out the right LM window which shows the descent (and much of the walk) from above. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 03:30, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Aha. So they had a film camera right next to the TV camera, so they could get a live picture and also a more permanent record, especially in case the TV hookup failed. Backups R us! Here's a funny coincidence: The "classic 39" <i>Honeymooners</i> episodes were shot that way, with a live camera and a film camera right next to it... the point of the coincident being Ralph's oft-used but of course never implemented threat to slug his wife: "To the moon, Alice!"&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:02, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>NASA would gain more credibility if they came clean on this one. The hot-spots from studio lights are clearly visible. The 'original' tape is 'missing' - it's a shambles.

<dd>Wahkeenah, the TV camera was on the side of the LM (until they dismounted it and put it on the tripod). A 16mm color film camera filmed the scene from above, through the window of the LM. I'm pretty sure that both videotape and <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinescope.html" title="Kinescope">kinescope</a> copies of the TV broadcast were made. When I read about the kinescope copy being made, it described two copies being made so that when the reel of film had to be changed on one, the other was still filming. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 23:17, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note, only part of the 8mm film is of the pre-conversion SSTV. The US TV networks recorded it on videotape.

<p>Why is the USSR putting the first woman in space added in this section? Does it require greater technological capability to put a woman in space than it does to put a man in space? 212.140.167.99 12:47, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
