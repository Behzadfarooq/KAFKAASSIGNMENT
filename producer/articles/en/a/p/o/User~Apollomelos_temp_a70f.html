<p>The first known appearance of the term <i>homosexual</i> in print is found in an anonymously published <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a> German pamphlet written by <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl-Maria_Kertbeny_a256.html" title="Karl-Maria Kertbeny">Karl-Maria Kertbeny</a>. <a name="Usage_and_related_terms" id="Usage_and_related_terms"></a></p>

<p>Although some early writers used the adjective <i>homosexual</i> to refer to any single-gender context (such as an all-girls' school), today the term implies a sexual aspect. The term <i>homosocial</i> is now used to describe single-sex contexts that are not specifically sexual.</p>
<p>Derogatory terms include <a href="../../../f/a/g/Fag.html" title="Fag">fag</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/g/Faggot.html" title="Faggot">faggot</a>, which generally refer to gay men; <a href="../../../p/o/o/Poofter.html" title="Poofter">poofter</a>, used mostly in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>; <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queer.html" title="Queer">queer</a>, generally inclusive of anyone who is not exclusively heterosexual, but also reclaimed as a "pride" word by many gays and academics; <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homo</a>; and <a href="../../../d/y/k/Dyke.html" title="Dyke">dyke</a>, which refers to lesbians. <i>See <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">Homophobia</a></i></p>
<p>The term <i>homosexual</i> can be used as a noun or adjective to describe persons as well as their sexual orientation, sexual history, or self-identification. However, many recommend that the term <i>homosexual</i> be avoided, for its use can cause offence. When referring to a person (as opposed to a sexual behavior), <i>gay man</i> or <i>lesbian</i> are preferred.</p>
<p><i>Homosexual</i> places emphasis on sexuality and is to be avoided when not describing such. Some people also feel the term is too clinical and thus somewhat dehumanising. Another pejorative term, although falling out of use since the 1930s is 'Turner'. There are two theories as to the origins of this slang word for homosexual: 1. Late 19th century east London slang in homosexual circles, signifying an ostensibly heterosexual young man who may be induced to experiment with homoeroticism and ultimately to ‘turn’ (i.e. to become a fully-fledged practising homosexual). This usage appears in Dickens’s ‘Pickwick Papers’, when Tupman explains to Snodgrass, ‘It is said he will not bend, though you may find, sir, that he may yet be a turner’. 2. A more discreet version of the slang pejorative ‘bender’, signifying a homosexual male. ‘Turn’ here signifies ‘turning around’, or ‘turning one’s back’ in order to receive phallic penetration.</p>
<p>The term "<a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a>" may refer to all homosexual people, or only to homosexual men, which is why "gay man" may be preferred. Some people find the use of the term "gay" when used to refer to both men as women as offensive. "<a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">Lesbian</a>" refers to homosexual women.</p>
<p>Given how confusing and overloaded these various terms can be, when specificity is important, new terms are starting to be pressed into service. For example, <a href="../../../m/e/n/Men_who_have_sex_with_men.html" title="Men who have sex with men">Men who have sex with men</a>, or MSM for short, is sometimes used in the medical community when specifically discussing sexual behavior (regardless of orientation or self-identification).</p>

<p>Many studies, most notably the Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>) and the Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>) by <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Kinsey_07a5.html" title="Alfred Kinsey">Alfred Kinsey</a> have found that the majority of humans have had homosexual experiences and are bisexual. Only a minority of people were found (5-10%) to be exclusively <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexual.html" title="Heterosexual">heterosexual</a> or homosexual. Conversely, an even smaller minority of people appear to have had equal sexual experiences with both genders indicating an attraction scale or continuum. Other studies have suggested these reports exaggerated the occurrence of <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a> and homosexuality in human populations. However, his idea of a sexuality continuum still enjoys wide acceptance today and is supported by findings in the human and <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_kingdom.html" title="Animal kingdom">animal kingdoms</a> as well as biological studies of structural brain differences between those belonging to different <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_orientations.html" title="Sexual orientations">sexual orientations</a>. Many argue that the discrepancies between public and private admissions regarding sexual orientation are due to negative societal attitudes regarding same-sex intercourse.</p>

<p>Researchers in the McFadden and Breedlove studies have found evidence correlating pre-natal hormones to both female and male homosexuality. They have found that females and males exposed to high levels of the sexual hormone <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androgen.html" title="Androgen">androgen</a> as fetuses are pre-dominantly homosexual. This may provide explanation of gay men having a greater number of lifetime sexual partners as well as their larger <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> sizes when contrasted to heterosexual males. Auditory systems and fingerprints, both related to androgen levels have also had such results when distinguishing homosexuals from heterosexuals.</p>

<p>Homosexuality on an <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolutionary</a> scale consists chiefly of two theories.

<p>Homosexuality is common in the Animal Kingdom, especially in species closer to humans on the evolutionary scale, such as the <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">great apes</a>. Some believe that this behavior has its origin in male social organization and social dominance.

<p>The great majority of workers in medicine and the sciences, as well as gay organizations, claim that sexual orientation is innate, fixed and unchangeable, and that it is impossible to change homosexuality into <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexuality.html" title="Heterosexuality">heterosexuality</a>, or vice-versa. They hold that the innate factors that in the majority of cases direct male sexual arousal to females (and vice-versa), in the case of the gay minority direct arousal toward those of the same gender.</p>
<p>To support this argument, they point to the many reports of both straight and gay-identified individuals who claim having discovered their orientation at an early age (often in pre-adolescence). In the case of queer youth, many report initial distress in response to this realization. Their claims are consistent with statistics showing that gay-identified youth are several times more likely than non-gay youth to attempt suicide .</p>
<p>Some scientific studies suggest gay men's anatomical brain structure is similar to that of heterosexual women and different from their heterosexual male counterparts. Other studies such as the March 2000 Breedlove finger length report <a href="http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/~mos/stats2000/results/fingerlengthrap.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/~mos/stats2000/results/fingerlengthrap.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and the July 2000 University of Texas study of neurological auditory response <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/00newsreleases/nr_200007/nr_brain000712.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/00newsreleases/nr_200007/nr_brain000712.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> suggest that while lesbians show characteristics intermediate between heterosexual men and women gay men are "hyper-masculinized". Some researchers have found that if one of a set of identical twins self-identifies as a gay man or lesbian, the chance of the other identifying as gay is increased to 50%, although other researchers' twin studies have found widely differing percentages.</p>
<p>Attempts to modify sexual orientation (known as "conversion therapies" and so far targeted only at queer-identified individuals) have been condemned by numerous professional organizations in the scientific field for causing depression - sometimes leading to suicide - and being of little value. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> Dr. Robert Spitzer, professor of psychiatry at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> announced a study indicating that reparative therapy has a failure rate on the order of 99.98%. The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychological_Association_357c.html" title="American Psychological Association">American Psychological Association</a> in 1997 passed a resolution declaring therapists in these groups engaged in such conversion therapies to be following <a href="../../../u/n/e/Unethical.html" title="Unethical">unethical</a> and unhealthy practice.</p>

<p>Various psychologists, anthropologists and sociologists including <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Frued_f1d7.html" title="Sigmund Frued">Sigmund Frued</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Mead_da68.html" title="Margaret Mead">Margaret Mead</a>, and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Foucault_f02b.html" title="Michael Foucault">Michael Foucault</a> have held that neither exclusive heterosexuality nor exclusive homosexuality are innate and only exist due to the effects of outside societal or developmental influences on the individual. In the same vein writer <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gore_Vidal_7281.html" title="Gore Vidal">Gore Vidal</a> once remarked that "there is no such thing as a homosexual or heterosexual person. There are only homo- or heterosexual acts. Most people are a mixture of impulses if not practices, and what anyone does with a willing partner is of no social or cosmic significance". The lesbian-feminist movement has historically held the position that sexual orientation is socially and psychologically created and openly encouraged women to choose <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbianism.html" title="Lesbianism">lesbianism</a> over "compulsory heterosexuality"(as <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrienne_Rich_921c.html" title="Adrienne Rich">Adrienne Rich</a> put it in her 1980 essay "Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existance") for the sake of women's liberation.</p>
<p>Conservative religious congregations maintain that being gay is a self-indulgent transgressive choice, like being a fast driver, and state it is learned behavior. Thus it is their position that <i>all</i> homosexuality is of a preferential nature. Some of the organizations that believe homosexuality is a choice and a violation of their religious creeds offer <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reparative_therapy.html" title="Reparative therapy">"conversion therapies"</a> for lesbians and gay men in an attempt to change their sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Utilizing a secular approach, the American <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Association_for_Research_and_Therapy_of_Homosexuality_aaeb.html" title="National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality">National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality</a>, and some non-Western organizations, also maintain that "conversion therapy" can change sexual orientation. They claim that sexual orientation is not genetic, that it is changeable, and to regard sexual orientation as permanent is incorrect. The implications of this view on the construction of heterosexuality have not been fully explored.</p>
<p>Apart from the issue of the changeability of one's basic orientation, the manifestation of one's sexual orientation seems to be liable to a great amount of variability. Thus it is common for homosexual individuals in hetero-normative societies to love, marry, and have children with individuals of the opposite sex, a practice done for social reasons in intolerant environments, as a cover for one's orientation (such relationships are known as a "beards.")</p>
<p>The opposite situation seems to obtain in homo-normative societies, where men whose primary attraction may be to the opposite sex nonetheless engage in - and enjoy - the homosexual practices prescribed by their respective culture. Both of these adaptations are forms of <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situational_sexual_behavior.html" title="Situational sexual behavior">situational sexual behavior</a>.</p>

<p>A number of researchers into the social construction of same-sex love and sexuality have suggested that it is not correct to speak about homosexuality. Instead they point out that same-sex relations have been constructed in various ways by different societies. These classifications are grouped by anthropologist <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_O._Murray_7103.html" title="Stephen O. Murray">Stephen O. Murray</a> into three different categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Egalitarian, exemplified by modern forms of relationship between partners of similar age and gender. <i>See <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_minority_cultures.html" title="Sexual minority cultures">Sexual minority cultures</a></i></li>
<li>Age structured, exemplified by the erotic apprenticeship enaged in by novice samurai with the more experienced warriors. <i>See <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shudo.html" title="Shudo">shudo</a></i></li>
<li>Gender structured, exemplified by shamanic gender-changing practices seen in native societies. <i>See <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-Spirit_bbfb.html" title="Two-Spirit">Two-Spirit</a></i></li>
</ul>
<p>Though in any society one particular form of homosexuality usually predominates, other forms are likely to co-exist. As historian <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rictor_Norton_cc38.html" title="Rictor Norton">Rictor Norton</a> points out in his <a href="http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/social19.htm|" class="external text" title="http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/social19.htm|" rel="nofollow"><i>Intergenerational and Egalitarian Models,</i></a> in Ancient Greece egalitarian relationships co-existed (though to some extent "in the closet") with the institution of <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">pederasty</a>; and a fascination with adolescent youths continues to be a part of modern queer culture, just as a fascination with adolescent girls continues to concentrate the minds of straight men.</p>

<p>In the west, same-sex love practices have been the subject of a continuing debate dating back at least to Classical Greece. Arguments against and in support of homosexuality have been varied, and some basic arguments listed below were previously used in these debates. Recent advances in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociological studies</a> and other <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discourse.html" title="Discourse">discourse</a> such as <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queer_theory.html" title="Queer theory">queer theory</a> have brought a measure of scientific rigor to what had been mostly a philosophical debate.</p>
<p>Some of these arguments have some basic elements which lend themselves easily to analysis. It is a perception by some that homosexuality is unnatural, though this view has been refuted by some describing homosexual behaviour in other animals. Arguments relating to the religious and moral nature have been the subject of much discussion, sometimes based the relevance or irrelevance of religious scripture, such as in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, the reasons behind the destruction of <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodom_and_Gomorrah_832d.html" title="Sodom and Gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a>. Homosexuality has been associated with hedonism and promiscuity by some, along with a perception that homosexuality is somehow a choice, thus leading to a perception that homosexuality is immoral behaviour. However, many refute the argument of choice, and mention that not all homosexuals are promiscuous, and note that heterosexual couples can be similarly promiscuous. Other arguments include sociological perspectives, as homosexuality in men is sometimes associated with effeminacy and homosexuality in women is associated with masculinity, however it is not true all homosexual men are effeminate and all homosexual women are masculine, see for example <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lipstick_lesbian.html" title="Lipstick lesbian">lipstick lesbian</a>.</p>

<p>The relationship between the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral.html" title="Moral">moral</a> condemnation of the gay community and its legal status is complicated. For instance, in England <a href="../../../b/u/g/Buggery.html" title="Buggery">buggery</a> was a crime under medieval <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_law.html" title="Canon law">canon law</a> because it was banned by the Church. However, prosecutions for this offence died out. Sexual activity between those of the same sex was formally banned by Parliament in the 19th century as one of a range of sexual offences, alongside sex with under-age girls, as part of an expression of a general moral outrage related to events of that time.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-industrial.html" title="Pre-industrial">pre-industrial</a> western societies same-gender sex was generally accepted by the lower classes and the upper class, less so among the bourgeoisie, though most professed to consider it <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immoral.html" title="Immoral">immoral</a>.

<p>By the 19th Century most areas adopting the <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_Napoleon_a352.html" title="Code Napoleon">Code Napoleon</a> (French-based civil law) had no specific ban on same-gender sex, while many areas with British-based Common Law systems had anti-sodomy statutes and executed gay men and lesbians as late as the end of the 1800's.</p>

<p><i>Main article: Homosexuality in the military</i></p>
<p>Homosexuality since ancient times has been documented to be more common in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">militaries</a> with their strict sex-separation contrasted to society at large. Official attitudes towards this form of sexuality have varied, reflecting their culture’s views. <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">Ancient Greece</a> among others, as well as <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shudo.html" title="Shudo">pre-modern Japan’s</a> military traditions openly encouraged them as a form of male bonding. Many modern countries (such as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>) welcome homosexuals in the armed services. Others, such as the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_Ask%2C_Don%27t_Tell_dcf9.html" title="Don't Ask, Don't Tell">United States</a> systematically purge them from the force in the belief that they are a threat. This negative attitude was common in the European Middle Ages when the Medieval <a href="../../../t/e/m/Templars.html" title="Templars">Templars</a>, a prominent Christian brotherhood of knights during the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusades.html" title="Crusades">Crusades</a> was destroyed on accusations of homosexuality.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouts.html" title="Scouts">Scouts</a>, a group of paramilitary youth organizations, often emulate the attitude of their home country's military.

<p>Sexual customs vary greatly over time, and those shifts, as well as the orientation of particular pre-modern figures are the subject of ongoing study. However, modern Western gay culture as it is currently understood is largely a product of <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a> as well as the years of post-<a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonewall_riots.html" title="Stonewall riots">Stonewall</a> <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_liberation.html" title="Gay liberation">gay liberation</a>. It is generally not applicable as a standard when investigating same-gender sex and people's views in past ages.</p>
<p>It may be accepted, for example, that the sex lives of historical figures such as <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadrian.html" title="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgil.html" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_da_Vinci_1ee9.html" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelangelo.html" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Marlowe_6b85.html" title="Christopher Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a> (who coined the term 'quean') and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> included or were centred upon relationships with people of their own gender. Terms such as "gay" or "bisexual" might be applied to them in that sense. But many regard this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a modern social construction of sexuality sub-culture that is foreign to their times. For example, their societies might have focused upon the sexual role one took in these encounters, namely active, passive, both, or neither, as a key social marker. This particular system of designation is currently the norm in many areas of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>.</p>
<p>It could be noted, on the other hand, that when evidence that a particular historical figure's sexuality pointed exclusively toward an attraction to people of an opposite gender describing them as having a heterosexual orientation rarely evokes such controversy. This tendency among Western historians, to view heterosexuality as an acceptable norm while regarding arguments that a particular historical figure may have had been gay controversial or requiring more evidence than a claim of opposite-sex attraction might warrant, is often attributed to homophobia on the part of historians and is referred to within queer studies as <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heteronormativity.html" title="Heteronormativity">heteronormativity</a>.</p>

<p>Though denied or ignored by early explorers, homosexual expression in native Africa was widespread and common, and took a variety of forms. Representative examples:</p>
<p>Anthropologists Murray and Roscoe report that women in <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesotho.html" title="Lesotho">Lesotho</a> traditionally have enaged in socially sanctioned and celebrated "long term, loving and erotic relationships" named <i>motsoalle.</i></p>
<p>E. E.

<p>In North American Native society, the most common form of same-sex sexuality seems to center around the figure of the <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-spirit.html" title="Two-spirit">two-spirit</a> individual. Such persons seem to have been recognized by the majority of tribes, each of which had its particular term for the role. Typically the two-spirit individual was recognized early in life, was given a choice by the parents to follow the path, and if the child accepted the role then it was raised in the appropriate manner, learning the customs of the gender it had chosen. Two-spirit individuals were commonly <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamans.html" title="Shamans">shamans</a> and were revered as having powers beyond those of ordinary shamans. Their sexual life would be with the ordinary tribe members of the opposite gender. Male two-spirit people were prized as wives because of their greater strength and abvility to work. <i>See <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-spirit.html" title="Two-spirit">Two-spirit</a></i></p>

<p>In <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> same-sex love has been a central feature of everyday life since the dawn of history. Early western travelers were taken aback by its widespread acceptance and open display.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, known as the <i>pleasures of the bitten peach,</i> <i>the cut sleeve,</i> or <i>The southern custom,</i> same-sex relations have been recorded since at least <a href="../../../6/0/0/600s_BCE_25fe.html" title="600s BCE">600 BCE</a>. These euphemistis terms were used to describe behaviors, but not identities. The relationships were marked by differences in age and social position.

<p>Similarly, <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> had no concept of homosexuality until the late 20th century. <i><a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathoey.html" title="Kathoey">Kathoey</a></i> or ladyboys have been a feature of Thai society for many centuries. They were men who dressed as women. They were generally accepted by society without much question, although a family was often disappointed if one of their sons became a Kathoey. The teachings of Buddhism, dominant in Thai society was accepting of a third gender designation.</p>

<p>The earliest western documents (in the form of literary works, art objects, as well as <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">mythographic materials</a>) concerning same-sex relationships are derived from <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a>, where same-sex relationships were a social institution variously constructed over time and from one city to another. (See <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">Pederasty</a>) The practice, a system of relationships between an adult male and an adolescent coming of age, was often valued for its pedagogic benefits and as a means of population control, and occasionally blamed for causing disorder. <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a> praised its benefits in his early writings, but in his late works proposed its prohibition, laying out a strategy which uncannily predicts the path by which same-sex love was eventually driven underground. (See <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederasty.html#Philosophical_discourses" title="Pederasty">Philosophy of pederasty</a>)</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, cities in northern Italy, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence.html" title="Florence">Florence</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a> in particular, were renowned for their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a majority of the male population and constructed along the classical pattern of Greece and Rome <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html#References" title="Homosexuality">(Ruggiero, 1985; Rocke, 1996)</a>. But even as the majority of the male population was engaging in same-sex relationships, the authorities, under the aegis of the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Officers_of_the_Night_258a.html" title="Officers of the Night">Officers of the Night</a> court, were prosecuting, fining and imprisoning a good portion of that population. The eclipse of this period of relative artistic and erotic freedom was precipitated by the rise to power of the moralizing monk <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girolamo_Savonarola_1f45.html" title="Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a>. Throughout all of Europe, fierce conflicts, dating back to the early <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, raged between proponents and opponents of same sex love. In northern Europe the artistic discourse on sodomy was turned against its proponents by artists like <a href="../../../r/e/m/Rembrandt.html" title="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a> who in his <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganymede_%28mythology%29.html#Renaissance_and_Baroque_Ganymede" title="Ganymede (mythology)">"Rape of Ganymede"</a> no longer depicted <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganymede_%28mythology%29.html" title="Ganymede (mythology)">Ganymede</a> as a willing youth, but as a squalling baby attacked by a rapacious bird of prey.</p>

<p>Continuing the ancient tradition of male love in which <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganymede_%28mythology%29.html" title="Ganymede (mythology)">Ganymede</a>, cup-boy to the gods, symbolized the ideal boyfriend, Muslim - primarily <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufi.html" title="Sufi">Sufi</a> - poets in medieval <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> lands and in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Persia</a> wrote odes to the beautiful wine boys who served them in the taverns and shared their beds at night. Among some Muslim cultures the practice of pederasty was widespread, if not universal (as documented by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Francis_Burton_67ea.html" title="Richard Francis Burton">Richard Francis Burton</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andr%C3%A9_Gide_8e19.html" title="André Gide">André Gide</a> and many others), and has survived into modern times. It continues to surface despite efforts to keep it quiet, as it did after the American invasion of Afghanistan, when the same-sex love customs of <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kandahar.html" title="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>, in which adult men take on adolescent lovers, became widely known.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>, on the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silk_Route_b4fa.html" title="Silk Route">Silk Route</a>, the two traditions of the east and the west met, and gave rise to a strong local culture of same-sex love. This was centered around the bachá (a Turkik <a href="../../../u/z/b/Uzbekistan.html" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbeki</a> term etymologically realted to the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Persian</a> <i>bachcheh,</i> catamite), typically an adolescent male entertainer and sex worker who donned resplendent attire and makeup and sang and danced erotic songs. These <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> bachás were trained from childhood and carried on their trade until their beard began to grow. Though the tradition eventually succumbed to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalinist</a> repression and western morality, early <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> explorers were able to document the practice.</p>

<p>In many societies of <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanesia.html" title="Melanesia">Melanesia</a> same-sex relationships are an integral part of the culture.

<p>In 1973, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) removed homosexuality as a mental disorder from the manual.</p>
<p>During the last few decades, in part due to their history of shared oppression, gays in the West have developed a shared <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queer_culture.html" title="Queer culture">culture</a>, although not all gays participate in it, and many gay men and women specifically decline to do so. The various approaches to the question of what queer culture should be are exemplified by the <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_pride.html" title="Gay pride">gay pride</a> and the <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_shame.html" title="Gay shame">gay shame</a> movements. Gay pride aims at equality and social and economic integration. Opposition to this comes from the gay shame movement, which holds that being gay can lead to liberation from restrictive social constructs.</p>
<p>Shortly after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> the <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_community.html" title="Gay community">gay community</a> began to make advancements in <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> throughout much of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_World_97bb.html" title="Western World">Western World</a>. With the advent of the <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> outbreak; organizational structures of these groups became much more sophisticated. At the start of the <a href="../../../2/1/s/21st_Century_ad84.html" title="21st Century">21st Century</a> four countries had granted access to <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_marriage.html" title="Same-sex marriage">civil-marriages</a> and many more countries; the majority of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> had established <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_unions.html" title="Civil unions">similar legal arrangements</a>. Gay men and women had risen to numerous posts of power within many governments that had only a few decades ago previously <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodomy_laws.html" title="Sodomy laws">imprisoned</a> or even in some cases <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Gays_during_the_Holocaust_ea37.html" title="History of Gays during the Holocaust">exterminated</a> them.</p>
<p>The overall trend of greater acceptance of gay men and women in the latter part of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_Century_9dae.html" title="20th Century">20th Century</a> was not limited to <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular.html" title="Secular">secular</a> institutions; it was also seen in many <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_homosexuality.html" title="Religion and homosexuality">religious</a> institutions. <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Judaism_1877.html" title="Reform Judaism">Reform Judaism</a>, the largest branch of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> outside <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> had begun to facilitate religious <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_marriages.html" title="Same-sex marriages">weddings</a> for gay adherents in their synagogues. The <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Communion_20fc.html" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a>, the world’s second largest <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> Church in terms of members had nearly fractured due to the Churches in the Western World ordaining gay clergy and blessing same-sex unions against the wishes of those in the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Developing_world.html" title="Developing world">developing world</a>, where a morality first adopted in colonial times still predominates. (See <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-colonialism.html" title="Post-colonialism">Post-colonialism</a>) Other Churches such as the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist_Church_51da.html" title="Methodist Church">Methodist Church</a> had experienced trials of gay clergy who some claimed were a violation of religious principles resulting in mixed verdicts dependent on geography.</p>
