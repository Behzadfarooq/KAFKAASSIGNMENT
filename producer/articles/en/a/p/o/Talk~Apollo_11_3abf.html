<p>The Soviet Union, which also had a space tracking network and their own outer-space tracking infrastrurture. This was the 1960s, height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union had no reason to let the U.S with a hoax of that magnititude.</p>
<p>Okay, fine they could only track if SOMETHING was on a path between the earth and moon, or perhaps metallic objects on the lunar surface. It wouldn't be conclusive evidence of <i>manned</i> landing.</p>
<p>If there was manned capsule in Earth orbit and the 'bogus' package was on the way to the moon. Wouldn't the Soviet space tracking network have discovered this?</p>
<p>But the video and audio signals containing the video coverage of astronauts would be easily triangulated as sourced from outer space (radio tracking). Of course, you theorists would argue the probe carried a beacon transmitted the pre-recorded footage.</p>
<p>How about the thousands, nay, tens of thousands of people who would have to know that the landings were faked? Why has no one spoken up for the last 40 years?! Why has the KGB not discovered a single piece of evidence that the landings were a hoax?</p>
<p>The only way you theorists would believe it is if you got the chance to go up there and see the footprints for yourself. Or would you prefer to think they sent boot-wearing robots?</p>

<p>I think it should be mentioned that evidence exists pointing to the falsification of the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations_8812.html" title="Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations">Apollo moon landing</a>.</p>
<p>Is the folklore about the couple arguing about sex really necessary? It just doesnt seem to impact the story in any way, nor is it relevant to Apollo 11. Seriously, it should be removed. Some 5th grader doing a school project is going to try and look up information regarding the moon landing, and is going to get barraged with links to Wikipedia Oral Sex. At least remove the link, so that this page doesnt directly lead to that topic...</p>

<hr />
<p>This might not be appropriate for a Talk page, but ...</p>
<p>Much has been said in the USA lately about the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks being one of those moments where people will one day ask, "do you remember where you were when you heard the news?" For me, the biggest event that warranted that sort of response in the past was the first lunar landing. I was five years old, crowded into my grandmother's living room with perhaps every relative on the planet, trying to see the television, and eagerly chatting with everyone about what we were seeing. Thinking about the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_program.html" title="Apollo program">Apollo program</a> lately has been therapeutic for me; a reminder of the heights to which humanity can reach, and a memory of being able to share in that experience, in however small a way.</p>
<p>So where were you when they walked on the Moon?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>I don't think September 11 should be mentioned in the same paragraph as the achievement of Apollo- I ask only that you remove that comparison- because Apollo represents all that is great about America. The men that perpetrated September 11 could only destroy and murder the innocent people and their families in their thousands because it was made easy for them to do so. Their first action was to slit the throat of an innocent defenceless stewardess.</b></p>
<p>Please don't link the two even in the "where were you" context- it gives a bad taste!!</p>
<p>Again, apologies if this is not appropriate; willing to remove it if so. -- <a href="../../../r/j/l/User%7ERjLesch_f374.html" title="User:RjLesch">RjLesch</a></p>

<dd>The photo above is actually of Apollo 11, so I'm putting it back in. Here's the photo I'm removing, which must be from a later mission that included the rover:</dd>

<p>im french, sorry for my english....i come from french wikipedia for download picture of space. All Nasa picture are free&#160;?</p>
<p>I surprised, rover is use only for apollo 15, 16, and 17...i think its apollo 15 mission with james irwin on it.</p>
<p>And the picture on this page is apollo 11,12, or 14 because we dont see the deployment structure of the rover (some plastic on one side and root)...but also, we dont see the big parabolic reflector of apollo 12...and i dont recognize standard module of ALSEP in foreground...Apollo Lunar Scientific Experiment Package, use only after Apollo 11.</p>

<p>I thought I'd put the text of the "Phone call" here for consideration. My thinking was that as this was the what Nixon actually said to the world it would be more appriopriate to quote than what he might have been called on to say.</p>
<p><b>Houston</b>: ...We'd like to get both of you in the field-of-view of the camera for a minute. (Pause) Neil and Buzz, the President of the United States is in his office now and would like to say a few words to you. Over.</p>
<p><b>Armstrong</b>: That would be an honor. <b>Houston</b>: All right. Go ahead, Mr. President. This is Houston. Out.</p>
<p><b>Nixon</b>: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you (garbled). For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they, too, join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one; one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth. (Pause)</p>
<p><b>Armstrong</b>: Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here representing not only the United States but men of peace of all nations, and with interests and the curiosity and with the vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.</p>

<dd>Agree. Also stuff like the orbital heights and periods aren't that useful. In the case of a mission like <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_15.html" title="Apollo 15">Apollo 15</a>, the CSM had six different "orbits" -- the one they entered into on LOI, a circularised orbit, a lowered orbit for when the lunar module was set to land, a trimmed version of this, a circularised orbit again and a plane-changed orbit.

<p>To satisfy the conspiracy theorists and pseudohistorians, don't you think we should add a "disputed" tag?

<dd>No. There is, to say the least, overwhelming evidence that the moon landings took place. This takes the form of both tangible evidence (photographs, rocks, etc.) as well as personal testimony by the persons involved and those who watched live coverage of the event (including myself). It is simply not credible that this could all have been faked, even given the resources available to NASA and the US Government. If these allegations are to be taken seriously, then most of the rest of Wikipedia would also have to be tagged as "disputed". 86.7.20.251; 19:05, 03 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think what the pseudos claim should also be placed in a separate article, along with the evidence that contradicts their claims. Just a few years ago, one such individual got into Buzz Aldrin's face about it, and to his credit, Aldrin hit him in the mouth! <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 17:04, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've always wondered why this has never occurred to anybody else. The date usually quoted, 20 July 1969, is an entirely arbitrary one, because this event occurred on a world where time and calendars have never been defined. It is not unreasonable to try to date the event using the main (but by no means only) calendar from Earth, the Gregorian Calendar, even though that date is meaningless in relation to anything that happens outside the Earth. But at the moment the landing happened, it may have been 20 July in the eastern states of the USA, but it was a different date in other places on Earth. Since Armstrong talked about one giant leap for "mankind", not just for Americans, I think something needs to be said about the arbitrary choice of the date. Not sure what, though. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 06:51, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Time isn't expressed as being "defined" anywhere; time is expressed in relation to a single point of reference. In all official documents, NASA used either the time in central England (GMT) or the time elapsed since the LV stack left the ground (GET). From an engineering standpoint, any other frame of reference is unnecessary and would merely confuse calculations. <a href="../../../y/i/n/User%7EYingPar_9318.html" title="User:YingPar">YingPar</a></dd>

<p>I have heard several times that Buzz Aldrin, upset that he was not going to be the first person to walk on the moon, "forgot" his camera on Earth. As a result, only Aldrin's photo could be taken by Armstrong. I have not found any definitive proof of this, but it would definitely be a nice one-liner under trivia if it can be collaborated.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There were a number of cameras on board, though only one was used on the surface; it was mostly carried by Armstrong, and intended for technical purposes - photographing rock samples in situ before they were collected, inspecting equipment, and so on. However, a number were taken of the astronauts, both for historical reasons and for "engineering" ones; it was helpful to be able to see how the dust settled on the suits, that sort of thing. However, it never occured to anyone at NASA - astonishing though it may sound - that there would be a need to take photographs of individuals as individuals; as such, they didn't really plan for Aldrin to take any photographs of Armstrong <i>as photographs of Armstrong</i> - there were some, but they didn't take care to note them as important, or make sure to list them as photographs of Armstrong. As the suits on Apollo 11 were identical, they couldn't tell the two astronauts apart.</dd>
<dd>When they got back and started going through the photographs, someone noticed that almost all the photographs were of Aldrin, and remembered that Armstrong had carried the camera most of the time, and it became generally thought that <i>all</i> the pictures were of Aldrin. However, there are a couple with Armstrong in - not significant ones, but they're there - which were discovered by some very, very patient archive work (going through the mission timeline with a fine-tooth comb) relatively recently. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 00:13, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That was the reason for the red stripes on the commanders' suit in later missions - made it easy to tell which was which in the photos.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 04:22, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a mistake (one I used to make...). The LEM was not down when the contact light came on; it was triggered by a "tether" of sorts, as a warning to shut down the descent engine &amp; let the LEM drop the last meter or so. Recall, the next words were, "Okay, engine stop."</p>
<p>I also corrected the parenthetical "[a]" in Neil's famous quote. He did say it, &amp; (fairly) recent digital cleanup of the tape showed it; it didn't get heard on the '69 TVcasts (or the tapes since, including Hanks' reconstruction in "FTETTM") because of static.</p>

<p>I changed several items related to the low fuel situation during final descent. There's a lot of incorrect and misleading information on this. First, although technically the term is "propellant" the astronauts themselves often call it "fuel", so that term is OK.</p>
<p>There were no low fuel warnings from the computers. The fuel gauges could only read accurately down to about 5%. At that point a "quantity light" illuminated. From that point they had about 94 seconds flying time left, plus a 20 second buffer, or about 114 seconds until the engine quit. The actual time remaining varied based on engine throttle -- the descent propulsion system was throttleable. A <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_controller.html" title="Flight controller">flight controller</a> manually calculated in real time the revised fuel remaining based on throttle position and clock time. There was no gauge or indicator from the 5% point to zero -- it was just manually calculated by hand, and the resulting flying time remaining radioed back to the crew.</p>
<p>The Eagle landed about 10 seconds after the "30 seconds" fuel remaining call. Some concluded only 20 second fuel remained at that point and some network broadcasts shortened this further to 15 seconds. In fact the "30 seconds" call was time to "bingo", which means abort or land immediately (within 20 seconds). Later analysis indicated they probably had about 50 seconds fuel remaining at touchdown, or about 30 seconds to bingo. Backing up from this it appears the low fuel "quantity light" came on about 10 seconds too early: 50 sec (actual fuel remaining) minus 30 sec (last fuel call) minus 10 sec (time from 30 sec call to touchdown) = 10 sec discrepancy. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoema_807b.html" title="User:Joema">Joema</a> 02:08, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>NASA didn't want to take any chances. However unlikely, they thought it at least possible that there would be living organisms on the moon, and it was considered prudent to isolate the astronauts and observe them. Apollo 12 astronauts were the only other lunar explorers subjected to this process. Apollo 13 astronauts were to be the first to not undergo quarantine, but even if the quarantine was still in effect, 13's crew never landed on the moon. Expect a similar quarantine for astronauts that visit any other planet for the first time, unless the space agency(ies) figure the long flight time back to Earth is sufficient to detect problems.</p>
<p>As to living organisms on the Moon, maybe not so farfetched, from a scientific/evolutionary point of view. Seen the movie "The Andromeda Strain"? The fictional movie concerned the discovery of a life form perfectly suited to survive in space. And how about nanosized robots small enough to enter our bodies? (think the Borg of Star Trek and the movie "Moontrap" with Walter Koenig!) I'm sure NASA was thinking more of the Andromeda Strain type of potential, however. <a href="../../../g/c/a/User%7EGcapp1959_07ea.html" title="User:Gcapp1959">GBC</a> 03:52, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In actually, Apollo 11, Apollo 12, and Apollo 14 underwent post-flight quarantines. Apollo 13 did not undergo the post-flight quarantine due to the tank malfunction and the last three Apollo crews did not have to do the same because the samples returned to Earth, as well as the previous three quarantines, revealed that the Moon was a lifeless body. Also, only Apollo 11 required its crew to wear the biohazard suits while the crews of 12 and 14 only wore gas masks. <a href="../../../r/w/b/User%7ERwboa22_ad9b.html" title="User:Rwboa22">Rwboa22</a> 18:04, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's nothing wrong with having articles on these bizarre notions. There are <b>already</b> Wikipedia articles on <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_moon_landing_hoax_accusations.html" title="Apollo moon landing hoax accusations">Apollo moon hoax</a> , <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_Society_b62d.html" title="Flat Earth Society">Flat Earth Society</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abduction_phenomenon.html" title="Abduction phenomenon">alien abduction</a>, etc. That many people often believe in these ideas is noteworthy, and <i>these articles are where to mention that, not other places</i>. In the related articles, there's nothing wrong with a simple link to these, like the Apollo 11 article has a link to the moon hoax article. But to go beyond that and insert prominent statements questioning the validity of well-established events -- even in the guise of other's opinions -- is not an encyclopedia's mission. <i>That's why you don't see it in other encyclopedias, and it doesn't belong in this one.</i> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoema_807b.html" title="User:Joema">Joema</a> 21:09, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed the line "Secondly, a less well known urban legend suggests that they were being 'watched' while on the Moon, and had seen alien vehicles there." in the trivia section. While they didn't see anything but rocks on the actual surface of the moon, on the third day of the flight, they actualy did observe an object moving alongside them. The astronauts on board didn't tell mission control (until they returned) because they feared that someone might want them to turn back because of aliens or some stupid crap. They figured that it was most likely the <a href="../../../s/-/i/S-IVB_b9de.html" title="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> (Saturn V 3rd stage) that separated from them 3 days earlier, so they asked mission control where it was, and they responded saying that the S-IVB was actualy 6,000 nautical miles from them, therefore the object that they observed couldn't have been the S-IVB (mind you, I'm not saying it was aliens or some stupid crap like that, it was probably just space junk (what little there was in 1969) or even (though much less likely) the Soviets spying on them). I looked all through this article, and there is no mention of it, and I think that it deserves to be discuseed. Someone should look into it and write about it. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Warren_e2ce.html" title="User:Nick Warren">The QBasicJedi</a> 17:41, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've had a quick poke around and can't find anything in the Mission Report, or the Flight Evaluation Report. Any idea where we might be able to find a source for this? The most likely hypothesis, if indeed it did happen, would be something shaking loose after separation from the S-IVB and gradually diverging; an insulation panel or the like. It seems odd that experienced Gemini crews would misinterpret something as a booster stage, though; they'd done Agenda rendevous before. Hmm. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 18:21, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure the Chappaquiddick info has any relevance here other than the fact it happened at the same time. Heck, the success of the Chicago Cubs at the same time probably distracted some baseball fans. It is true that NASA withheld news of the accident in their radio news reports to the astronauts but that's the only link I can see and that's not mentioned. <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBear_f64f.html" title="User:DrBear">DrBear</a> 12:00, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I guess I should have mentioned where I heard this. It was on a show on the Science channel called "First on the Moon: the Untold Story". I know it did happen because they had Buzz Aldrin on there and he was talking about it and everything. Furthermore, they actualy showed a video of a similiar object from a latter flight (so this wasn't the last time this happened). Please don't treat me liek a crazy conspiracy theorist dumbass. This really happened and it should be mentioned in the article.&#160;:) <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Warren_e2ce.html" title="User:Nick Warren">The QBasicJedi</a> 21:54, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>On pages 430 to 432 of my copy of <i>First Man</i> it talks about the sighting. On the evening of the third day Aldrin saw an object that moved relative to the stars. They radioed mission control who told them the S-IVB was 6000 miles away, that being their first guess as the cause. Armstrong is described as being confident what they saw was one of the SLA panels (<a href="../../../a/s/7/Image%7EAs7-3-1545.jpg_bdc8.html" title="Image:As7-3-1545.jpg">Image:As7-3-1545.jpg</a> has a nice shot of them still attached on Apollo 7. On Saturn V flights, they disattached after it was decided that they could pose a hazard to getting the LM out during later flights). The object is also mentioned in section 6.40 of the mission report (<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11tcdb.html#0610" class="external text" title="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11tcdb.html#0610" rel="nofollow">scroll down from here</a>). <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Monkey_6b08.html" title="User:Evil Monkey">Evil Monkey</a> - <a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvil_Monkey_65b0.html" title="User talk:Evil Monkey">Hello</a> 04:35, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I remember what Neil Armstrong's words were when he first set foot on the moon. They were, "It's a kind of a soft powdery stuff, I can kick it with my boot." I destinctly remember him speaking about the moon dust adhering to his suit (I think from static electricity). In fact he spoke for what seemed like several minutes from the ladder, before he put the second foot on the moon and said his famous line.

<p>I am new to editing Wikipedia, but have closely followed Space exploration efforts since the announcement of Sputnik, when I was four years old. I also have some experience manipulating wave files with Cool Edit and Goldwave (the program used by Ford to analyze Armstrong's statement). I also have pretty good hearing, and have listened to Armstrong's words over and over. There is no room to fit the word "a" between "for" and "man". As nice as it would be if Armstrong had said what he meant to say, the evidence is that he did not. I assert that Ford's analysis is erroneous, and so should be treated as tentative until others have confirmed or refuted it. Jeff Root 01:48, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Several concerns. In general, the article doesn't feel tidy. There are incidences of bad text formatting, e.g. ".<sup>[3]</sup>).", and the article contains several lists that might be better converted to prose or sent to the "See also" section. Standard recommendation with galleries seems to be to have it at the end of the article. In this case, I would suggest taking the best photographs from the gallery into the main text, and putting the rest at the end, or making sure it is listed on the Commons page. The structure of the article is not that great, with the short section on the contingency address stranded in the middle of the article, before the details of comms. Even the mission insignia are probably more important, although I might agree that the contingency address is important enough to not end up in the trivia section. In fact, you ought to consider spinning the "trivia and urban legends" section out into a separate article, leaving behind just a brief summary of one to three paragraphs. "See also" needs to be alphabetic or in some other structure that makes sense. Finally, it is not clear which reference(s) support(s) the comms section; this is probably the gravest problem. I'm fairly confident that if you address these concerns and reapply, you'll get through.</p>

To give undue weight to a significant-minority view, or <i>to include a tiny-minority view</i>, might be misleading as to the shape of the dispute</b>. Wikipedia aims to present competing views in proportion to their representation among experts on the subject, or among the concerned parties. This applies not only to article text, but to images, external links, categories, and all other material as well.</dd>

<p>To begin with, "settled gracefuly to the ground" doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. Second, I question this qualifies as "from the surface"; unless the pads were down, I'd suggest it's not "from the surface". Third, "reportedly forgot to shut the engine off"? Sez who? I recall Neil promptly said, "OK, engine stop." What was said <i>next</i> qualifies as "first words spoken from the surface" (and now we can quibble about whether Neil had to be standing on the surface or not...), because CapCom said, "OK, we copy you down, <i>Eagle</i>."--&amp; "Contact Light" didn't get it.

<dd>Well, looking at the video: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4166049933953240830&amp;q=45017" class="external autonumber" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4166049933953240830&amp;q=45017" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> it is hard to tell for me as they were wearing these quarantine suits with sort of gas masks that cover their faces, but maybe you still are able to identify them - in the video the scene is at 24:55. In the context of the whole mission this question doesn't seem to be that important for me, though. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProofreader_0bac.html" title="User:Proofreader">Proofreader</a> 19:00, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The caption of the TV picture claiming to show Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon is incorrect and repeats a common mistake. This picture shows the large step from the bottom rung of the ladder to the foot pad of the lunar module. The first step to the surface of the moon was a small one off of the foot pad. It occurred a moment later than the picture that is shown, after Armstrong announced, "I am going to step off the LEM now," and is concurrent with his "One small step ..." statement. The actual step is probably not even visible to the TV camera, but might be visible in the slow frame rate film taken by the camera in the lunar module window above.</p>

<p>I feel that the section relating to the hoax accusations should be removed.

<dd>I agree about removing it. I'm not sure it should be moved over to the other article.

<p>Amazingly, I am of the opinion that info about the conspiracy theory should be kept, but not here in this article. I deeply regret this, since I think the theories are pure and utter bollocks, yet they should be kept since the theories are "widespread" and a part of history. Nevertheless I think it should be moved to <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon_landing.html" title="Moon landing">Moon landing</a>, since that article covers the landing and this article covers the Apollo 11 mission. Maybe keep a link to the hoax article here, though. By the way, any of you guys know what the hoax people thinks of the other moon landings, Gagarin, and all orbit missions? Are they conspiracies too? Where do they draw the line?

<p>Buzz Aldrin admitted that they knocked over the American Flag when the crew left the moon. The now 77-year old astronaut said this in a lecture he gave at the Technical University of Delft, on 13th march 2007. He, Armstrong and Collins decided not to tell this, because of the controversy it might cause in America. Please add this fact to all the moon articles. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.126.160.35_a10a.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.126.160.35">80.126.160.35</a> (talk) 13:29, 14 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
