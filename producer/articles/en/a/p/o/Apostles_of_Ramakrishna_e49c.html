While studying at the Metropolitan Institution at Kolkata, he met Narendranath Dutta in a gymnasium. He was influenced by Narendranath to join the Brahmo Samaj. In 1880, his brother-in-law, Manmohan Mitra, took him to Paramahamsadev. He was so impressed that he became a disciple and was subsequently known as the ‘spiritual son’ of Paramahamsadev. He was a wandering monk for some time. He spent most of his time at Puri and Bhubaneswar. He set up a math at Puri. When Ramakrishna Mission was formed, he was the first president.</p>

Mahendranath Gupta, was closely associated with Ramkrishna Paramahamsadev and later became famous for his Ramakrishna Kathamrita.

<p>Swami Yogananda (1861-1899), whose original name was Jogindranath Chowdhury belonged to an aristocratic family that had declined. His father was a devout Brahmin and he was devoted to religious affairs from a young age. Popular as Jogin, he came in touch with Paramahamsadev when still at school but his family did not approve of his touch with Paramahamsadev and forced him into marriage. He joined Paramahamsadev subsequently. He had a critical mind and often criticised Swami Vivekananda’s actions. He remained with <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarada_Devi_5709.html" title="Sarada Devi">Saradama</a> till his death.</p>

<p>Swami Niranjanananda (died 1904), whose original name was Nitya Niranjan Ghosh, had clairvoyant powers. When he came in touch with Paramahamsadev at the age of eighteen, he told him, “If you let your mind dwell on ghosts, you'll become a ghost yourself. If you fix your mind on God your life will be filled with God.” That brought about a change in his thinking and he joined Paramahamsadev. He was devoted to both Paramahamsadev and Saradama. He died of cholera.</p>

When Swami Vivekananda advised him to take up work in the West, he met him in London in 1896 and then sailed for New York. There he remained head of the Vedanta Society until his return to India in 1898. Back in the country, he was engaged in different types of work and later became the first Secretary of Ramkrishna Math and Mission.

He established the Shanti Ashrama in the San Antonio valley, Santa Clara County, California to be used a monastery of retreat. In 1902, he was returning to India but Swami Vivekananda died before he set foot in the country. A heart broken man he spent time in meditation and spiritual austerities.

He was initially attracted towards Christianity but turned towards Hinduism after listening to the lectures of Brahmo leaders. Having become fascinated by the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, he was eager to find someone who could teach him to follow the methods of meditation they prescribe. On the advice of a friend, he went to Dakshineswar and learnt the practice of yoga from Paramahamsadev. In 1896, Swami Vivekananda wanted him in England. He went and from there on to New York after a year and took charge of the Vedanta Society there. He stayed in America until 1921 teaching and lecturing.

In 1896, he became a monk. Swami Vivekananda entrusted him with the task of building the Math campus as also preparing suitable plans for a memorial temple for Paramahamsadev. He prepared it in consultation with a noted European architect of Kolkata and Swamiji approved of the same. However, due to the sudden demise of Swamiji and lack of funds, the project had to wait for a long time to be taken up. It was completed and dedicated by Swami Vijnananda himself on the 14th of January 1938. He was President of the Ramkrishna Mission in 1937-38. He established Ramakrishna Sevasram at Allahabad.</p>
