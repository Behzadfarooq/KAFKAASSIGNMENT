<p>Let's get something clear. Tesla was a Serb and i agree with that. Boscovich was Croat/Italian to say he was Serb is Serbian POV. Andric was Croat by blood but was a Serbian by choice.</p>
<p>If people have some link to a backgtound they should be mentioned on Wiki. You should see how many people are linked to being Jewish and will openly mention it in the first paragraph..even if only 1/4 Jewish...eg Harrison Ford etc....</p>
<p>Maradona has Croatian blood from his mothers side, Marco Polo is debated as being either Croatian or Italian or even both, Haydn is from an Austrian town were mostly Croats live and his Croat background would be probable. Denise Richards, John Malkovich etc...do have a Croatian parent.</p>
<p>I know you're a very proud Serb and dislike all things Croatian but please don't accuse anyone of fabriaction when you don't know all the facts.</p>

<p><i>At first I thought that the Serbs were the aggressors in the Balkans. Boy, was I ever wrong. After doing some research I learned that you guys are Nazis who mercilessly killed Serbs living in Croatia during the Second World War. How the hell can you people live with yourselves?

<p><i>Apollo Creed 04:16, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><i>Retrieved from "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jagoda_1" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jagoda_1" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jagoda_1</a>"</i></p>
<p>When I was going to post a response on Jagoda's talk page, I noticed your post. I have to say that I was surprised with the antagonism and judgementalism your post seems to contain. Allow me to elucidate some points;</p>
<p>'<b>The Flag'</b> The current flag of Croatia is more similar to the one used by the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banovina_of_Croatia_1e8e.html" title="Banovina of Croatia">Banovina of Croatia</a> in the first Jugoslavia. The Coat of Arms on the flag and the crown are centuries old - see [<a href="http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/coat.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/coat.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>].</p>
<p>'<b>WWII'</b> Your judgement on the basis of collective guilt ignores;</p>
<ul>
<li>the high contribution of Croatian Partisans in the struggle against fascism - Tito and many prominent anti-fascist were Croats;</li>
<li>that most occupied Europe had indigenous fascists and quisling regimes that committed crimes. W.r.t to the Croat-Serb conlfict during WW2, pls look up Milan Nedic and the Banjaca concentration camp of Serbia. Belgrade was also the first capital to be declared Juden frei;</li>
<li>the crimes of the Chetniks were matched in ferocity to those of the Ustashi - it was a fratricidal conflict fuelled by the respective ideologies of Greater Serbia and Croatia;</li>
<li>There were trials for the respective crimes at the end of WW2 by the Partisans involving extra-judicial killings such as the Bleighburg massacre.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Thus this leads to three Conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crimes from WW2 do not justify modern day killings - such a mindset only perpetuates the cycle of violence - it is akin to saying that Ethiopians would be justified killing Italians and destroying Italian cities b/c of what happened during WW2;</li>
<li>Justice was already served with trials at the end of WW2;</li>
<li>The existence of Nazis and massacres by both sides during WW2 means that according to your logic, both sides have the right to kill each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, you can make your point about Marco Polo and Andretti w/o having to resort to ethnic pejorative.</p>

<dd>The same logic would apply if the showed the flag of the Banovina of Croatia within the first Yugoslavia, or flag of the Triune Kingdom, or the coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Croatia.

<dl>
<dd>From the same website you quoted [<a href="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/hr-hist.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/hr-hist.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]:</dd>
<dd><i>Croatian horizontal tricolour of red, white and blue inherited it's colours, of course, from the Croatian coats of arms: Croatian chequered red and silver, Dalmatian blue with three golden leopards, and Slavonian blue with red field with black marten bordered with two white wavy lines, and golden star above. All of the three coats were, in fact, used in different times for all the land, as it is with the name also. Later in 19th cent. the geographical meaning of these names was finally firmly established. The land was named in 19th cent Triunar (meaning one made of three) Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia. Therefore, it is not unusual that the flag was made of all three colours.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The first time that it was officially proclaimed was in 1848 and under the influence of revolutionary movements in Europe, a simple tricolour was made. The flag was, of course, without any coat. However, it was used as local flag in a big empire, so it remained more or less internationally unknown, but it became one of the most important symbols of the Croatian people. Very often it can be seen on old postcards, most often together with Croatian coats (normally not on the flag, but from time to time as a part of the flag).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>After the end of the World War Croatia proclaimed independence, and a tricolour became the state flag, again without coats. The collision with the Dutch flag didn't became, as a matter of fact, a problem, because the state was short living. After a short time, Croatia was united with Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in the State of Slovenians, Croats and Serbs (not to be mistaken with the later Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians), and a month later occupied by Serbian forces united in a Kingdom under Serbian dynasty which already had annexed Montenegro. This state was then named Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and took a neutral combination of pan-slavene colours blue white red (both Serbia and Montenegro had red blue white and Slovenia white blue red).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Croatian flag again remained as local flag, highly respected by the people, but half illegal, as the Belgrade government tried to unite all nations into a Yugoslav nation. These efforts didn't succeed, and in 1938 a separate province (banovina) of Croatia was made. It took, as one can expect, the red white blue tricolour and in official use the coat of the province in the middle. By this time many Croatian political parties used the Croatian tricolour with their respective symbol in the middle. The best known was the Croatian Peasant Party, HSS, with a chequered red white field bordered green.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>====Interpretations of the Colours====</dd>
<dd><i>One of interpretations of colours dating from late 19th century is Red Croatia, White Croatia, and Kingdom of Slavonia (blue). Red and White Croatia are Croatian states from early middle age, approximately in today's Dalmatia (Red) and central Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (White).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>And finally to mention an interpretation of colours of the Croatian flag made by Miroslav Krleza, a great national writer, saying that the colours represent the three symbols of Croatian history and people: blood of Croatian martyrs, Croatian peaceful lamb like nature, and Croatian devotion to God.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>The connections were not minor. See [<a href="http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/serbia/serbian-gestapo/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/serbia/serbian-gestapo/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>], and [<a href="http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/serbia/chetniks/pecanac/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/serbia/chetniks/pecanac/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>], and [<a href="http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/serbia/government/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/serbia/government/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>]. Is it any wonder that the allies abandoned their support for the collaborationist chetniks (despite the lobbying of the royal family and govt in London) in favor of Tito's (a Croat) partisans.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>I was also not impressed by your Bleiburg counter; acting as if that was a giant Croatian killing conducted by Serbs. You even stated yourself that many Croats were partisans. By taking a look at the Bleiburg massacre article, I learned that many Serbian fascists were also killed in this massacre. Therefore, the Bleiburg massacre was a mass killing of Yugoslav fascists (Croats, Bosnians, and Serbs) conducted by Yugoslav antifascists (Croats, Serbs, and whatever)!</i> I will admit that most Bleiburg massacre victims were Ustasha Croats, but you can’t compare that with the number of INNOCENT Croatian Serbs that were butchered. Its like comparing a drop of water to an Ocean!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If it is a ledgerbook that you are keeping, pls also consider the murders of opponents to the hegemony of the Serbina royalist dictatorship (during Jugoslavia Ver1) &amp; the chetnik massacres of Croats/Muslims in places like Lika and Eastern Bosnia as apart of the ethnic cleansing plan of Chetnik formations.</dd>
<dd>From the article on the history of ethnic cleansing:</dd>
<dd><i>At the same time, on 30 June 1941, the lawyer Stevan Moljević from Banja Luka, the main ideologue of the Serbian nationalist organization, the Chetniks, and Mihailović’s most trusted confidant, published a booklet with the title On Our State and Its Borders. Moljević assessed the circumstances in the following manner: One must take the opportunity of the war conditions and at a suitable moment take hold of the territory marked on the map, cleanse [očistiti] it before anybody notices and with strong battalions occupy the key places (...) and the territory surrounding these cities, freed of non-Serb elements. The guilty must be promptly punished and the others deported - the Croats to Croatia, the Muslims to Turkey or perhaps Albania - while the vacated territory is settled with Serb refugees now located in Serbia.[6]</i></dd>
<dd>It mainly b/c of this chetnik policy that the Partisans opted for a federative Jugoslavia as the vehicle for best ensuring the rights of the non-Serb nation from the threat of Greater Serbia hegemony.</dd>

Was Columbus like most say Spanish...or as some say Italian ..or as few even say Portuguse??? Evidence is there for all theories you just have to read more and make up your own mind. Nothing can be ruled out ...so saying Polo was a GINO is silly. Sure maybe Polo and Columbus were Italian...but some proof tells you otherwise. It's not propaganda.</p>
<p>How can an Italian label anyone a Nazi. Italians were Nazis ...you forgot Benito Mussolini... Read up on Croat Tito and the Partizans before you label all Croats Nazis in WW2. Croat Nazis = Minority in WW2........Italian = Majority in WW2.</p>
<p>Study WW2 a bit more...with respect to you.</p>
<p>PS I think your Serb ...god speed</p>
