<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/i/Apirana_Ngata_7360.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Ngata was born to a Māori family in Te Araroa (then called Kawakawa), a small coastal town about 175 kilometres north of <a href="../../../g/i/s/Gisborne%2C_New_Zealand_a737.html" title="Gisborne, New Zealand">Gisborne, New Zealand</a>. His <a href="../../../i/w/i/Iwi.html" title="Iwi">iwi</a> was <a href="../../../n/g/a/Ngati_Porou_73f6.html" title="Ngati Porou">Ngati Porou</a>, and his father was considered an expert in traditional <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folklore.html" title="Folklore">lore</a>. Ngata was greatly influenced both by his father and by his great-uncle <a href="../../../r/o/p/Ropata_Wahawaha_96e2.html" title="Ropata Wahawaha">Ropata Wahawaha</a> (who had led Ngati Porou forces in the <a href="../../../m/%C4%81/o/M%C4%81ori_Wars_de2c.html" title="Māori Wars">Māori Wars</a>). Ngata was raised in a Māori environment, speaking the <a href="../../../m/%C4%81/o/M%C4%81ori_language.html" title="Māori language">Māori language</a>, but his father also ensured that Ngata learned about the <a href="../../../p/%C4%81/k/P%C4%81keh%C4%81.html" title="Pākehā">Pākehā</a> world, believing that this understanding would be of benefit to Ngati Porou.</p>
<p>Ngata attended primary school in Waiomatatini before moving on to <a href="../../../t/e/_/Te_Aute_College_2e72.html" title="Te Aute College">Te Aute College</a>, where he received a Pākehā-style education. Ngata performed well, and his academic results were enough to win him a <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholarship.html" title="Scholarship">scholarship</a> to Canterbury University College (now the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Canterbury_cad3.html" title="University of Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a>), where he studied <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_science.html" title="Political science">political science</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a>. He gained a BA in politics in 1893 before completing an <a href="../../../l/l/b/LLB_571a.html" title="LLB">LLB</a> at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Auckland_8d16.html" title="University of Auckland">University of Auckland</a> in 1896. Ngata's success marked the first time a Māori person had completed a degree at a New Zealand university.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/i/Apirana_Ngata_7360.html" title="Edit section: Marriage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marriage</span></h2>
<p>In 1895, a year before finishing his law degree, Ngata had married Arihia Kane Tamati, who was also of the Ngati Porou iwi. Ngata had been betrothed to Arihia's elder sister, Te Rina, but she died before the wedding. So as consolation, Apirana was given the younger sister who was only 16 at the time of their marriage.</p>
<p>Apirana and Arihia had 15 children together, of whom three boys and one girl died in infancy, while six girls and five boys survived into adulthood.</p>
<p>Shortly after Ngata's legal qualifications were recognised, he and his wife returned to Waiomatatini, where they built a house. Ngata quickly became prominent in the community, making a number of efforts to improve the social and economic conditions of Māori across the country. He also wrote extensively on the place of Māori culture in the modern age. At the same time, he gradually acquired a leadership role within Ngati Porou, particularly in the area of land management and finance.</p>

<p>Ngata's first involvement with national politics came through his friendship with <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Carroll_%28New_Zealand_politician%29_cfc8.html" title="James Carroll (New Zealand politician)">James Carroll</a>, who was Minister of Native Affairs in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Liberal_Party_1c8b.html" title="New Zealand Liberal Party">Liberal Party</a> government. Ngata assisted Carroll in the preparation of two pieces of legislation, both of which were intended to increase the legal rights enjoyed by Māori. In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1905_ed03.html" title="New Zealand general election 1905">1905 election</a>, Ngata himself stood as the Liberal candidate for the Eastern Māori seat, challenging the incumbent Wi Pere. He was successfully elected to Parliament.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/i/Apirana_Ngata_7360.html" title="Edit section: Early political career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early political career</span></h2>
<p>Ngata quickly distinguished himself in Parliament as a skilled orator. He worked closely with his friend Carroll, and also worked closely with <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Stout_6862.html" title="Robert Stout">Robert Stout</a>. Ngata and Stout, members of the Native Land Commission, were often critical of the government's policies towards Māori, particularly those designed at encouraging the sale of Māori land. In 1909, Ngata assisted <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Salmond_cd18.html" title="John Salmond">John Salmond</a> in the drafting of the Native Land Act.</p>
<p>In late 1909, Ngata was appointed to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Cabinet_4434.html" title="New Zealand Cabinet">Cabinet</a>, holding a minor ministerial responsibility for Māori land councils. He retained this position until 1912, when the Liberal government was defeated. Ngata followed the Liberals into <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_Opposition_5f85.html" title="Parliamentary Opposition">Opposition</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a>, Ngata was highly active in gathering Māori recruits for military service, working closely with <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Reform_Party_4b81.html" title="New Zealand Reform Party">Reform Party</a> MP <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maui_Pomare_ecdd.html" title="Maui Pomare">Maui Pomare</a>. Ngata's own Ngati Porou were particularly well represented among the volunteers. The large Māori commitment to the war, much of which can be attributed to Ngata and Pomare, created a certain amount of goodwill from Pākehā towards Māori, and assisted Ngata's later attempts to resolve land grievances.</p>
<p>Although in Opposition, Ngata enjoyed relatively good relations with his counterparts across the House in the Reform Party. He had a particularly good relationship with <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Coates_1764.html" title="Gordon Coates">Gordon Coates</a>, who became <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand_9eee.html" title="Prime Minister of New Zealand">Prime Minister</a> in 1925. The establishment of several government bodies, such as the Māori Purposes Fund Control Board and the Board of Māori Ethnological Research, owed much to Ngata's involvement.</p>
<p>During this time, Ngata was also active in a huge variety of other endeavours. The most notable, perhaps, was his involvement in academic and literary circles - in this period, he published a number of works on significant Māori culture, with <i>Nga moteatea</i>, a collection of Māori songs, being one of his better known works. Ngata was also heavily involved in the protection and advancement of Māori culture among Māori themselves, giving particular attention to promoting the <a href="../../../h/a/k/Haka.html" title="Haka">haka</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poi.html" title="Poi">poi</a> dancing, and traditional carving. One aspect of his advocacy of Māori culture was the construction of many new traditional meeting houses throughout the country. Yet another of Ngata's interests was the promotion of Māori sport, which he fostered by encouraging intertribal competitions and tournaments. Finally, Ngata also promoted Māori issues within the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_a5cf.html" title="Anglican Church">Anglican Church</a>, encouraging the creation of a Māori <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishopric.html" title="Bishopric">bishopric</a>. Throughout all this, Ngata also remained deeply involved in the affairs of his Ngati Porou iwi, particularly as regards land development.</p>
<p>In 1927, Ngata was awarded a <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knighthood.html" title="Knighthood">knighthood</a>, only the third Māori (after Carroll and Pomare) to receive this honour.</p>
<p><a name="Ministerial_career" id="Ministerial_career"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/i/Apirana_Ngata_7360.html" title="Edit section: Ministerial career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ministerial career</span></h2>
<p>In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1928_eab4.html" title="New Zealand general election 1928">1928 elections</a>, the United Party (a rebranding of the old Liberal Party, to which Ngata belonged) won an unexpected victory. Ngata was returned to Cabinet, becoming Minister of Native Affairs. He was ranked third within Cabinet, and occasionally served as acting <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand_ee7f.html" title="Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand">Deputy Prime Minister</a>. Ngata remained extremely diligent in his work, and was noted for his tirelessness. Much of his ministerial work related to land reforms, and the encouragement of Māori land development. Ngata continued to believe in the need to rejuvenate Māori society, and worked strongly towards this goal. In 1929, both Ngata's wife and eldest son died of illness - this had a great impact on Ngata, but he eventually returned to his former level of activity.</p>
<p>In 1932, however, Ngata and his Department of Native Affairs were coming under increasing criticism from other politicians. Many believed that Ngata was pressing ahead too fast, and the large amount of activity that Ngata ordered had caused organizational difficulties within the department. An inquiry into Ngata's department was set up, and in the course of the investigation, it was discovered that one of Ngata's subordinates had falsified accounts. Ngata himself was criticised for a disregard for official regulations, which he had often felt were inhibiting progress. It was also alleged that Ngata had shown favouritism to his Ngati Porou iwi, although no real evidence of this was ever presented. Ngata, while denying any personal wrongdoing, accepted responsibility for the actions of his department and resigned from his ministerial position.</p>
<p>Many Māori were angry at Ngata's departure from Cabinet, believing that he was the victim of a Pākehā attempt to undermine his land reforms.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/i/Apirana_Ngata_7360.html" title="Edit section: Later life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later life</span></h2>
<p>Although Ngata had resigned from Cabinet, he still remained in Parliament. In the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1935_36b1.html" title="New Zealand general election 1935">1935 elections</a>, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Labour_Party_8ef8.html" title="New Zealand Labour Party">Labour Party</a> was triumphant - Ngata went into Opposition, although the new Labour government retained many of his land reform programs. Ngata remained in Parliament until the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1943_0e64.html" title="New Zealand general election 1943">1943 elections</a>, when he was finally defeated by a Labour-<a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratana.html" title="Ratana">Ratana</a> candidate, <a href="../../../t/i/a/Tiaki_Omana_11c8.html" title="Tiaki Omana">Tiaki Omana</a>. He stood again for his seat in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1946_379d.html" title="New Zealand general election 1946">1946 elections</a>, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Despite leaving Parliament, Ngata remained involved in politics. He gave advice on Māori affairs to both <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Fraser_6d1d.html" title="Peter Fraser">Peter Fraser</a> (a Labour Prime Minister) and <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Corbett_c401.html" title="Ernest Corbett">Ernest Corbett</a> (a National Minister of Māori Affairs), and arranged celebrations of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Waitangi_7fce.html" title="Treaty of Waitangi">Treaty of Waitangi</a>'s centenary in 1940. In the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, he once again helped gather Māori recruits. In 1950, he was appointed to Parliament's upper house, the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislative_Council_6fa0.html" title="Legislative Council">Legislative Council</a>, but was too ill by this time to take his seat.</p>
<p>Ngata died in Waiomatatini on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_14.html" title="July 14">14 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>. He is remembered for his great contributions to Māori culture and language. His image appears on New Zealand's <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_dollar_1210.html" title="New Zealand dollar">$50</a> note.</p>
