<p>I seem to remember a very good April Fools day prank by London based Capital radio. April fools day fell on a saturday. They broadcast a show using Chris Tarant who was the then host of the Breakfast show which was normally broadcast Monday to Friday. The show followed the exact same format. I believe that many people turned up at their place of work on Saturday only to find it not open. Does anyone else remember this and could it possibly be a prank that has been played by other radio stations? --<a href="../../../c/o/c/User%7ECockers_71f0.html" title="User:Cockers">Cockers</a> 15:07, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone should include Google's annual April 1st jokes: PigeonRanking (I think from 2003) - last year had the 'moon base' announcement, and 2005 they are 'introducing' a line of "Google Gulp" drinks. The comic strip switcheroo only happened once, but many online cartoonists continue to do some sort of gag on April 1st (see: UserFriendly, PC Weenies).</p>
<p>Software Development magazine's April 2002 issue contains a hoax article about an AI program that "writes programs" based on a natural language conversation with the user. "Successful" examples range from writing an unbeatable tic-tac-toe program to writing FAA aircraft control software.</p>
<p><i>Sports Illustrated</i> did a hoax a few years back where they wrote an entire article about a rookie pitcher for the Mets who had studied philosophy in Tibet and had an amazingly fast fastball. I wish I could remember the details. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>

I really don't think so. A holiday is a day off such as New year's day or Christmas.

<p>Does a holiday need to be a day when you don't have work? There are plenty of Catholic holidays that aren't recognized by the US government, and so don't result in a day off.

<p>I have heard from a rather non-Xian source, that the Fool's Day has to do with the Xian belief that a baby was born without a father. Assuming a baby is born on December 25, and working with an average 269-day gestation period, the conception happens on April first. So, a nonbeliever would consider a believer a "fool" for believing that a baby is born with no male, and that belief would be on April first. The source is some obscure book a friend of mine has. No other sources i know of, so i don't think it's prime stuff for the front page. -- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacham_b1ee.html" title="User:Chacham">Chacham</a> 09:08, 2005 Oct 10 (UTC)</p>

There's no truth to that claim.</p>
<p>Anyway, the non-Christian could just as easily be considered the fool in that story. More so in fact, if there were any truth to the story. That would make far more sense since we are talking about Christian countries. It would never be popularized if it was the other way around.</p>
<p><br />
What the crap does Xian mean? If you mean Christian, then do the proper way of abbreviating it: ☧-ian (with the Greek letters together). The ☧ is short for Χριστός. Check out <a href="../../../x/m/a/Xmas.html" title="Xmas">Xmas</a>. Also, there is no ☧-ian belief that babies are born without fathers. Even Jesus Christ himself had a Father, just not the normal biological kind. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoopsix_a854.html" title="User:Poopsix">poopsix</a> 09:05, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm confused by the last sentence in the first paragraph. The text reads "In some countries, April Fool's jokes (also called "April fools") must only be made before midday." Does this mean in some countries, they prohibit the jokes after midday or is it just a tradition?

<dd>Hm, seems clear enough to me with that single sentence. It's one of the unwritten rules on how to prank people, possibly made up by people to prevent excessive pranking and such. The unwritten rule applies where I live, and I'm pretty sure it's elaborated further on in the article.

<p>During the TV special for the movie BttF2 (making of?), Zemeckis (I think, don't remember exactly) claimed that they had used real hover skateboards that were based in a technology that was discovered a while ago and patented but was not used because it was considered dangerous and hard to control. Supposedly the things used two magnets and created some weird magnetic effect that levitated the board. Allegedly, the actor or stuntman or whatever had an accident and broke some limb while using the "dangerous" device.</p>
<p>They had to issue a clarification the next week or month or so that it was an april fools' joke, because many people had called asking where they could get their flying skateboards.</p>

<ul>

<ul>
<li>Unreferenced, not really interesting or funny. It would be like saying "sometimes people send virus warnings on 4/1"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Wrapping Televisions in Foil</b>: In another year, the Dutch television news reported that the government had new technology to detect unlicensed televisions (in many European countries, <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_licence.html" title="Television licence">television license fees</a> fund public broadcasting), but that wrapping a television in <a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminium_foil.html" title="Aluminium foil">aluminium foil</a> could prevent its detection.

<li><b>Free wine for all</b>:The Norwegian newspaper "Bergens Tidende" announced in 1987 that the state's alcohol monopoly had 10,000 litres of illegally smuggled wine that had been confiscated. The inhabitants of Bergen were invited to the main store in town to receive their share of the goods, rather than to spill good wine down the drain. That morning staff were met by about 200 men &amp; women with bottles, buckets, and other suitable vessels for carrying the prized goods. Legislation in Norway causes alcohol to be relatively expensive and have limited availability.

<li>I guess you missed out on previous Wiki celebrations of April Fool's Day. Wiki has previously allowed some joking around on this day (for example, fake AfD's on various articles as pranks). Part of editing in the true spirit of Wiki is knowing when to relax; as shown by your smug replies and decidedly unpleasant attitude on this topic, this is clearly a skill you've yet to master. Apologies to Atomic and the others who wanted to experience the lighter side of Wiki; sorry this wasn't a more positive encounter. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarryKosmos_2508.html" title="User:GarryKosmos">GarryKosmos</a> 08:28, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Chug is exactly right. Aritcle vandalism does not become funny on the first of April every year.

<dd>I'm not saying vandalism is pleasant (for one, a fake AFD is not considered vandalism on this day given that admins have done so before). I'm saying your rude and uncivil reaction to their statements was out of line. I'm not sure if you intended to, but you came across as more than a little elitist and as ignorant of the day's celebration. Statements like "This is not a play-ground. It is an encyclopedia" are condenscending and flat-out inappropriate. If you're going to correct someone, do so in a more polite, mature manner. Otherwise, don't say anything at all. Most editors I know phrase things with greater care, please try to learn from your peers on this matter so you can improve.

<dd>You are mistaken and you are being uncivil. What was being discussed here was whether or not this article should be protected against vandalism. This had nothing to do with AfD or other jokes on non-article pages. It is perfectly appropriate to remind people that this is not a playground, a social networking site, the unencyclopedia, or any of the other things that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipeida is not</a>.

<p>I've lived in Canada all my life, and I've never heard of this "jokes must be played before midday" thing. Maybe the entry itself makes the fool? 142.167.95.179 23:35, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm from Ontario and I've always heard it was only before noon. Perhaps there are differences in other regions? Merc 2k 02:51, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm from the UK and I was told as a child that jokes had to be played in the morning - after noon and the fool is on you.

<p>"The Great Iceberg" On April 1, 1978 a barge appeared in Sydney Harbor towing a giant iceberg. Sydneysiders were expecting it. Dick Smith, a local adventurer and millionaire businessman, had been loudly promoting his scheme to tow an iceberg from Antarctica for quite some time. Now he had apparently succeeded. He said that he was going to carve the berg into small ice cubes, which he would sell to the public for ten cents each. These well-traveled cubes, fresh from the pure waters of Antarctica, were promised to improve the flavor of any drink they cooled. Slowly the iceberg made its way into the harbor. Local radio stations provided excited blow-by-blow coverage of the scene. Only when the berg was well into the harbor was its secret revealed. It started to rain, and the firefighting foam and shaving cream that the berg was really made of washed away, uncovering the white plastic sheets beneath"</p>
