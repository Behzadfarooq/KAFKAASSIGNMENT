<p>Winchell's official website, a replacement for the emailed newsletter ("The Winchell Wiper," nee "The Winchell Factor") sent to her KFI listeners, has chronicled a surprising breadth of the actress' life, including her professional, personal and romantic life. Her success at attracting visitors to the site can be gauged by the thousand of dollars she raised in the period when she solicited donations from visitors to support her (and the large bandwidth bills generated by the site) in a period of unemployment.</p>
<p>She has also made multiple impacts on the YouTube community with her postings of a computer-voiced and animated scene from <i><a href="../../../w/h/e/When_Harry_Met_Sally_00fe.html" title="When Harry Met Sally">When Harry Met Sally</a></i> and her rebuttal to actress Patricia Heaton's campaign ads against stem cell research, with voices re-dubbed by Winchell. Each posting earned over 100,000 views.</p>

<p>Winchell is the daughter of American ventriloquist <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Winchell_5bd7.html" title="Paul Winchell">Paul Winchell</a>. In her weblog writings and appearances on radio, she describes her childhood with many references to the great talent of her father as well as the many disturbing incidents owing to his mental health issues. Ms. Winchell did not speak publicly about his mental illness and drug use for many years, due to the "tremendous responsibility" she felt to his fans, and the people who had fond childhood memories of his work from the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> through the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. But her silence ended in March <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> after her father published his autobiography <i>Winch</i>, in which he openly criticized his ex-wife, Nina Russell, and other family members.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_19.html" title="August 19">August 19</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> she announced on her website that she was diagnosed with <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> and underwent successful surgery and radiation treatment. To promote solidarity during her radiation treatment, she issued her own rubber wristbands. Where <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Armstrong_8148.html" title="Lance Armstrong">Lance Armstrong</a>'s wrist bands were yellow, April's "Glow in the Dark" so one could "glow along" with April.</p>
<p>Winchell is also widely known as a supporter of various charity causes, including Project Angel Food, a Los Angeles-based service providing meals for homebound people living with AIDS.</p>
