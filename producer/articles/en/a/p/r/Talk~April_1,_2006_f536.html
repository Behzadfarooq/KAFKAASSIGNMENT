<dd>One thing I wondered about earlier was categorising as 1st party and 3rd party hoaxes, so those "about someone or something other than the hoaxer" could be split apart from more insular hoaxes (e.g. BMW) that are really focussed on the self. Perhaps this is not possible because from an encyclopedia's point of view, all parties must be considered; so with the BMW ads (which imply the involvement of a government), the government could be considered a 1st and 3rd party as could BMW - I'm sure someone with more encyclopedic experience will catch my drift. --<a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEar1grey_5966.html" title="User:Ear1grey">Ear1grey</a> 21:52, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whatever we say, its going to keep coming back... as it is back again now&#160;:-( Thing is the link points to a site that is dated 25/26 of March 2006... April Fools jokes are really supposed to be played on April 1st. But I agree a "misidentified" section might be a good idea. Mehargp 07:37, 1 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The original Apple story was circulated one week prior to Apple's 30th Anniversary (2006-04-01). It was conceived and written as an april fools day joke. The truth that it was a hoax was revealed on April 1. It seems like an April Fool to me. To say anything else would be to require beard-stroking philosophy.

<dd>Hi (just caught this in my referrer logs) - I wrote the article as an AF Joke that needed time before AFD in order to spread to my friends and family - it grew very big very quickly, and a reporter asked me about it. I told it straight, but rather than waiting, he reported it immediately (duh?). Happily few people seem to have read the story so the majority of people only discovered today, on Apple's anniversary, that it was an AFDay joke, when I switched the Google Earth placemark to be the one with the AF message. AFAIAC it's an AF joke cause that's what I wrote. Rgds, <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEar1grey_5966.html" title="User:Ear1grey">Ear1Grey</a> 10:29, 1 April 2006 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>Well, a large number of people would have found out about it via Digg.com when it was reported there around the 25th... And it was revealed as a joke on the 28th... At best it could be described as a failed AF joke (blame the reporter)... Mehargp 10:44, 1 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>... er... you just concurred that it <i>is</i> an AF joke, so whether or not you found it funny or consider it "successful" seems irrelevant to it's inclusion in the on-the-internet section.</dd>
<dd>I've just had a go at re-writing it's entry in the past tense sicne I think the original version wasn't particularly encyclopaedic and may have (did?) cause uncertainty. --<a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEar1grey_5966.html" title="User:Ear1grey">Ear1grey</a> 17:19, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is quite clearly a fake, there are at least 3 other similar (though not quite as big) structures on the same page on the google map image. Peter
<dl>
<dd>I'm lost in ambiguity here sorry Peter. Are you suggesting that the image is a fake, or that the story is a fake and is an AFJ (i.e. my opinion, see above), or that the whole story was a fake, and that the april fool was in fact, that the story never existed (which I <b>wish</b> I'd thought of now)? Also, I notice that in the massive revert to the uncategorized version of the page (described below) the more objective description that I wrote has been lost; you might want to read that version, because it talks about the joke rather than repeating it. --<a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEar1grey_5966.html" title="User:Ear1grey">Ear1grey</a> 08:41, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The second entry, about foul Swedish fish, does not seem like an April Fool's joke to me.

<p>Just like to mention that the story about finding the new source of the Nile, as reported in the Times, was also in the Daily Mail. I can't imagine two rival papers corroborating on an April Fools. There was also a story in the Mail about investigating the powers of prayer for healing (£1.5mil funding). That's gotta be a joke. Hellfire83 10:15, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this was a news prank or a real prank - Fox 5 in NY claimed that somewhere in the midwest someone put up Mario "question-mark boxes" all over town and the bomb squad was called out. I can't find a reference to corroborate this story so I don't kno if it was a news hoax or a real prank.</p>

<p>This probably needs a new section.. And I don't have a wiki account.. But the article says: "New York rock band Morningwood advertised an interactive game in which users would participate in a virtual wet t-shirt contest, only to discover the game does not exist and the player is identified as a "pervert" in a mocking manner." But they had that up before April Fool's.. I know because I played it&#160;:P</p>

<p>Someone needs to put some order in this article. Who cares that this or that message board went postal on April 1st? Place the funniest hoaxes at the top of the list, along with the well-known Internet websites.</p>

<dd><b>Response:</b> The pranks are divided into sections. However, some people are not sticking to such categorization, and some idiot deleted the portion at the top which made it easy for the reader to go to each category. (Update: Now it is back, thank God.)</dd>

<dd>Somebody put in a NOTOC, NOEDITSECTION command (it was at the very end of the article). It was probably intended to force everyone to see the "we're gonna delete your non-notable crap additions, so don't bother" message (okay, it was more polite, but that was the gist at the very top. It probably wasn't the most helpful approach, because at least with sections we could organize and look at the items being furiously added. That was more like waving a white flag, saying "add what you want, have a party, we'll clean up later". --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 13:04, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I generally agree, but... The internet is a publishing medium, and one man's joke may be better and more noteworthy than that of a corporation; for example, very few people noticed this year's subtle use of anagrams of "april fool" and "april fools day" instead of journalists real names on one fairly well known media corporation, and this is (rightly) excluded from the list because it's not noteable: but <em>if</em> this "wizards" thing (et.al.) was noteable (by whatever definition noteable is) then excluding it because it's not by a corporation or because it was published via a weblog perhaps misses the point of the encyclopaedia, which is surely just to record what the noteworthy April Fool Jokes were.</dd>

<dd>Adult swim is noteworthy and already added. The other is not. "videolan.org" is not a well-known website. Even though Microsoft is a well-known company, the list of sites claiming to have changed their name to Microsoft-something or claiming to be bought out by Microsoft is enormous.

<dd>A nice enough idea, but, what do you search for? The domain itself? A specific page from the domain? References to the domain that also contain the words "april fool" and/or "hoax". It's a difficult (perhaps impossible) metric.

<dd>I think it's safe to say that if a domain has say, 10 hits on Google, as a lot of the personal blogs that people have tried to add/advertise on this page have, it's okay to delete it.

<p>I'm not a big fan of nu-metal but claiming that this genre is deceased is ridiculous. Actually most of metal music played on radio and TV stations are nu-metal (Korn, Slipknot, P.O.D, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit ...). It was renamed to nu-metal because often hardcore metal fans think that nu-metal doesn't belong to metal at all, so this proclamation made them angry.</p>
