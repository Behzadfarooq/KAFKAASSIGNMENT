<p>In the past, various <a href="../../../u/n/u/Wikipedia%7EUnusual_articles_dd7d.html" title="Wikipedia:Unusual articles">unusual articles</a> have been improved to <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_7cf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article">featured article</a> status. These include <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploding_whale.html" title="Exploding whale">exploding whale</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_umlaut.html" title="Heavy metal umlaut">heavy metal umlaut</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_toilet.html" title="Japanese toilet">Japanese toilet</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoo.html" title="Spoo">spoo</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua_A._Norton_8e48.html" title="Joshua A. Norton">Joshua A. Norton</a>. People seeing some of these articles listed on the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> sometimes believe that it is a joke, when in fact, these articles are well-written and quite deserving of featured article status.</p>
<p>An unusual article (such as <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploding_toad.html" title="Exploding toad">exploding toad</a> or <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.html" title="Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch">Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch</a>) will be edited up to Featured article status and listed on the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">1 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>. The "recently featured" sentence could be changed to "other featured", and link to the above-mentioned unusual featured articles.</p>
<p>Given the amount of time it takes to bring an article up to Featured article status, an alternative solution would be to use an article that has already been made a Featured article, but has not yet been listed on the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> (such as <a href="../../../n/o/_/Read_my_lips%7E_no_new_taxes.html" title="Read my lips: no new taxes">Read my lips: no new taxes</a>).</p>

<p>Raul is willing to consider any article for April fools day, as long as it meets three requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be a featured article by April 1, 2007</li>
<li>It must not have already been used as the main page featured article.</li>
<li>It is not too risqu√© (more so than any other article that would be used on the front page)</li>

<ol>
<li>What are we going to write/promote? We need to pick either a new topic or an existing article to nominate for FA. I think we need half a dozen nominees - then we vote/get consensus on which one is most suitable.</li>
<li>We have to work hard to get it up to featured status. This may be very difficult and might take several attempts.</li>
<li>We have to usher it through all of the phases leading up to FA.</li>
<li>We need to make sure it's on the front page on April 1st. This means starting in on it fairly soon.</li>

<li>If brought up to FA status, this definitely would be an AFMP 2007 FA candidate. Spoo was good for AFMP 2006 because all the text on the main page probably left the reader shaking their head. Exploding frog seems to have enough odd factual information so that its main page entry could be written in a way that also leaves the reader wondering whether it is true. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 18:57, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> - It has all the right attributes. We can find references - we can get photos - we can bring it up to the required standard to be an FA. When it's up on the front page, people will read the blurb and go "Oh - right - an April Fool story." then they'll click on it - perhaps expecting a big "APRIL FOOL!" banner or something - and discover it's a perfectly serious article about a real subject. Then they will know that they have truly been April-fooled - but in an encyclopeadic and Wikipedia-ish way that is uniquely ours. I'd like to see more suggestions like this one - but if we don't find anything better, this is good enough for me. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 13:25, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Oppose</b> - The trouble with this one is that while it may be OK for US readers, people in the UK (I'm British - I live in Texas) are very familiar with this place - we've all known about it since we were children - most of us have photos of ourselves standing in front of the famous railway station sign. British people wouldn't find it funny, surprising or unusual in any way whatever. Americans aren't familiar with it and probably would be very surprised. I have no idea about other English speaking countries - but the UK thing would ensure that it will not be considered anything other than a normal day's FA for a large fraction of our readership. Nope - this one won't do. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 13:29, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Oppose</b> - I'm an American and the name is pretty funny when you're unfamiliar with it, but if you say that UK users will be too accustomed to it to find it funny, I'll have to agree that it's not right for the Main Page. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemosthenes_1_c4f4.html" title="User:Demosthenes 1">Demosthenes 1</a> 19:24, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've created an uncyclopedia subpage that could be used to bring the page to featured article status.

<p>I'm all for Uncyclopedia if we can create a mainpage description that meets the unusual or unbelieveable requirements for the project. I don't think Uncyclopedia is unusual like an exploding whale. That means the eight or so sentences addressing <i>Uncyclopedia</i> appearing on the mainpage need to be manipulated in a way as to sound unbelievable and yet be true, just as <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoo.html" title="Spoo">Spoo</a> was for AFMP 2006. I think we need to come up with a draft for the main page before deciding on the FA article. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 16:22, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Uncyclopedia should be chosen, not because of the article being unbelievable and amazing, but because it's being on the main page is unbelievable and amazing. People will think that it's not a well written article, only a joke.

<dd><b>Oppose</b> - I strongly believe that Uncyclopedia would be a disasterous choice. Firstly, I don't think it's possible to write a properly referenced article about this. Remember we have to get this through the incredibly difficult 'Featured Article' and 'Front Page Featured Article' processes. If you've never tried to do this you have no idea how hard it is. (I have one successful FA - and one failed - so I have been through this both ways). Secondly, there are a lot of people here who really, deeply <b>hate</b> Uncyclopedia. Putting that on the front page will ruffle a lot of feathers...plenty of people won't find that funny at all. Those people are going to be fighting our FA all the way. Trust me - this is a terrible choice for April Fool. Also, it's too obvious. We want to make the <i><b>subtle</b></i> - you need to read the article and think "Surely this is an April Fools joke."...but in fact, it's not - it's a dead straight story. <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploding_toads.html" title="Exploding toads">Exploding toads</a> would be perfect for that. You'd read the blurb on the front page and say to yourself "Those funny guys" - click on the article and be amazed to find that it's all perfectly true. That's the plan here. Uncyclopedia can't do that. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 00:53, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I do not think that the 'unbelievable reaction' we want is one where someone reading the front page says, 'I can't believe that a few editors got together and were able to get this content on main page.' Spoo had a different kind of unbelievable aspect to it. In addition to the AFMP unusual or unbelievable content requirement, Steve makes good points regarding AFMP diplomacy policy. I believe that this is only the third time the main page will have an April Fool's theme, so we might want to tread lightly (baby steps per <a href="../../../w/h/a/What_About_Bob__4e90.html" title="What About Bob?">Bob</a>, if you will). -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 03:51, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Oppose</b> - There has been a lot of support for that article over on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_Creation_and_Improvement_Drive_eaa3.html" title="Wikipedia:Article Creation and Improvement Drive">Wikipedia:Article Creation and Improvement Drive</a> where it currently has 53 votes and looks like it could easily become the focus of a lot of effort real-soon-now. However, there is a Wikipedia rule: <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a> which says that we shouldn't make references to Wikipedia inside Wikipedia. I think it's very wrong to put more emphasis on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> than we do on (say) <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> or <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a>. Worse still, I very much doubt that anyone who edits Wikipedia can be said to have a NPOV with respect to Wikipedia - so writing a fair article on the subject would be exceedingly difficult. Both of these problems might make it very tough to get this through WP:FA and thus onto the front page. But what makes you think an article on Wikipedia on the front page would be thought to be unlikely or funny? People are going to assume that we are merely self-centered and perhaps immodest because we writing about ourselves. They aren't likely to say "Eh?

<ul>
<li>Too complicated?? I don't see that as a problem - even in principle. It's no more complex than many front page FA's - and even a fairly unsophisticated reader would see the blurb on the front page saying "twelve leeches hitting a bell with hammers to predict the arrival of a storm" - assume that it's bogus and then find that no, there is in fact a full article about it and that it's completely true. I don't think you need to read or understand the article to be amazed by it. I don't think our average readers would have any problems - and in any case, we have at least a month to improve and clarify the article to make it more approachable. My main concern is whether we could hit FA with it successfully. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 01:01, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> I like this one for the On this Day section. That's a pretty funny article I had no idea that happened. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemosthenes_1_c4f4.html" title="User:Demosthenes 1">Demosthenes 1</a> 22:10, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>After thinking about it a bit more I realise that this definitely can't be used as the FA. The two pictures in the article are both 'Fair Use' - they won't be allowed onto the front page - so we couldn't possibly raise this up to FA quality. But I still recommend using it in OTD. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 02:55, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Support</b> - I agree. It was so long ago. Besides, we aren't trying to make fun of it. We'd put it on the front page because it's hard to believe not because it's funny.

<p>This was suggested over on the main page. I think it has a similar (but not so serious) problem as the improbably long railway station name in Wales - that is that British people are already well aware of this.

<p>This may be too obscure, but in the film <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_Dynamite_8c84.html" title="Napoleon Dynamite">Napoleon Dynamite</a>, Napoleon is at one point drawing a cartoon that's a half-lion, half-tiger. He calls it a "liger." It turns out that ligers have, in fact, really been bred, so it's a moment of "No. That can't possibly really exist." I'd only support it if we could get the cartoon doodle that Napoleon was doing for its Featured Article image -- but if we can, the rest of the article is pretty well on its way to FA status, and needs rather little work. -- <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrostie_d983.html" title="User:Drostie">Drostie</a> 17:18, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see lots of <b>Oppose</b> comments that center around the amount of work needed to get up to FA status for some of these articles. I don't think the amount of work is seriously a problem - we'll have at least a month to do the work and maybe a half dozen experienced editors. You can write an awful lot in a month! What bothers me most is whether the data exists to expand some of the more obscure articles. To make FA, we need lots of references and a reasonably long article. We probably have the effort to do this - but only if there is enough referenced material to write about. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 02:12, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suppose we ought to put a deadline on submissions so we have time to vote, pick an article and push it through the FA process. I think we should be able to complete the FA process in under a month - but there is always a risk that the article fails in some horrible way and we might have to make a second run at it with a different article. How about we shoot for making a hard-and-fast list of submissions by Feb 1st and finishing up the selection process by Feb 8th? That gives us an entire week to come up with suggestions and another week to debate, vote and reach some kind of a consensus - leaving seven weeks for getting a featured article out the door? That should be plenty of time to go around and do it again if the first effort fails. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 00:55, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was just about to suggest this!

<dd>Yeah - but only for the FA section - I think the other parts can leave it for longer. OTD, ITN and DYK don't need to make final nominations until the last week of March.

<dd>Sorry, should clarify, what I mean was we should make everyone aware on AFMP project page that there is a vote for the featured article, as I said, it would make more people aware and therefore go for the vote.

<dd>Oh - I see. Announce when we are voting on the main list - not announce the schedule there. OK - yeah - actually that's a really good idea. I suppose we should really try to do things the Wiki-way and seek a consensus before literally counting votes. Let's just collect ideas for a week - accumulate the usual <b>Support</b> and <b>Oppose</b> comments as we go - then when we close the submissions, we can dump the obvious "consensus" losers and <i><b>if</b></i> we don't have an obvious consensus winner we can throw it open to the entire group for a straight line vote. At least that way we'll have tried to get a consensus first and only take it to an actual vote if we can't all more or less agree.

<p>As you can see, we have only one proposal that has no opposition (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_K_Foundation_burn_a_million_quid_2598.html" title="The K Foundation burn a million quid">The K Foundation burn a million quid</a>) - however, I wasn't living in the UK at the time this story broke and my family say it was all over the news and is now no longer either novel or funny - so I might well be inclined to switch my vote to an oppose. Two other articles (<a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploding_toad.html" title="Exploding toad">Exploding toad</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/m/Tempest_Prognosticator_9d6d.html" title="Tempest Prognosticator">Tempest Prognosticator</a>) have only one 'oppose' on the grounds that we can't raise them to FA in time. However, that's a risk for all of the articles that aren't already close to FA already - and all of those are opposed for other reasons.</p>
<p>On this basis, I think we need to reduce the list to those with no opposes except for the 'can we do it in time' concern in order that we can seek consensus. I propose this shortlist:</p>

<p>Zzzzz's complaints that we won't make it to FA in time are well taken - but I'm inclined to discount this reason for an 'oppose' vote. We have almost two months to do it. I've gotten articles through FAC before - and I strongly believe that if we can do it at all, we can do it in a month with half a dozen committed editors doing the work. I suggest that we push hard on one of these with the goal of getting it to WP:FAC by the end of February and if it looks like it'll get shot down in flames, we have another whole month to either do more work on it and try again - or pick a different one and start over.</p>
<p>Now - how do we choose which one? I propose we each rank them in order of preference and see if a clear ordering appears. To that end, I vote:</p>
<ul>

<li><b>K Foundation, Exploding toad, Tempest Prognosticator</b> - but why not try all 3? dont see why it has to be only one, and with 3 if one doesnt make it to FA there are automatically 2 backups. <a href="../../../z/z/z/User%7EZzzzz_e5d0.html" title="User:Zzzzz">Zzzzz</a> 15:57, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Put it on the supporters of the articles to overcome the "can't be made FA in time" charge... let's have one in the can that IS FA quality, certified as such (maybe bring Raul in on this a bit more tightly) and if we can then get more there, choose later...

<p>Hmmm - all three images in the K-Foundation article are 'fair use'. That's going to be a big problem for getting onto the front page. We can't put a fair use picture on the front page and if we don't have a picture of some kind, we won't get on the front page either. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 23:06, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>actually you can put a fair use picture on the front page (see the recent featuring of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_%28film%29.html" title="Halloween (film)">Halloween (film)</a> for example). In fact that article *only* has fair use images. Same with all the Star Wars articles that have appeared.

Although <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_rain_in_Kerala_5ce2.html" title="Red rain in Kerala">Red rain in Kerala</a> is quite close to A class status, the last edit to it occurred on 14:58, 2 March 2007, and I doubt it will reach FA status in time. RyanPostlethwaite, Nichalp provided some interesting feedback to your peer review request which might help you improve it. I'd love to collabrate if you're interested. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 17:05, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also prefer Red rain to the penis article. It seems more unbelievable, and it's less repulsive (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, I know, I know...) ¬∑ <a href="../../../a/o/_/User%7EAO_1bc5.html" title="User:AO"><font face="Papyrus" color="black" size="1"><b>AO</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/o/_/User_talk%7EAO_439f.html" title="User talk:AO"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><i>Talk</i></font></a></sup> 16:03, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>We can get the K Foundation featured before April 1st, trust me. It's about 90% done already; all it needs is for myself and Vinoir to work hard on completing it (consider that done), and a few of you folks helping out with copyediting and expediting the FAC process. The fair use image is fine and can go on the front page as obviously nobody was around to snap a GFDL picture of them throwing money onto the fire&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 12:59, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreement with kingboyk's assessment. If people still want that article for the front page, it can be done. --<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVinoir_4d5a.html" title="User:Vinoir">Vinoir</a> 18:11, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Given that we had a front page recently, I'd be more comfortable batting for next year's front page. However, it's your call. We'll try and get the article to FA regardless. Drop us a line at <a href="../../../k/l/f/WT%7EKLF_e57e.html" title="WT:KLF">WT:KLF</a> if there's any interest; if not, thanks at least for considering the article and for the nice comments&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:28, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, one other thing, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_flying_saucer_9294.html" title="British Rail flying saucer">British Rail flying saucer</a> is a crazy but true article. <i>That</i> would make a wonderful April 1st article I think, but whether it could be beefed up to FA I don't know. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:30, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem with that article is that it's <b>way</b> too short. It would certainly be possible to add more info from the patent - except that the link to the patent doesn't work. I've tried searching for it at the European patent office site - by name, by the numbers in our (defunct) link and by searching for ANY British Rail patent from around that time - and I don't see it anywhere. Unless we can turn up the patent, this one is doomed. We'd also need a non-fair-use picture for the front page and we're not going to get one because there aren't any. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 00:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Correction</b> there seems to have been some kind of a glitch at the patent office - the link is working again now. There is a lot more that could be said about this from reading the patent. But it's still a very thin story from the point of view of reaching FA status - and we still lack a non-fair-use picture. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 00:56, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
