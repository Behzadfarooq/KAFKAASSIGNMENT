<p>Whoa... for April 3 it has "1968 - Elvis Presley sings "Heartbreak Hotel" on the Milton Berle Show, with an estimated 25% of the United States population viewing." That can't be right. I'm pretty sure that Elvis made his comback special in 1968; it couldn't have anything do with Milton Berle, whose show ended long before 1968. Maybe the person means 1958? And Ed Sullivan?</p>

<p>The following entry under the "Events" header was twice removed: "<a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> - <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokusatsu.html" title="Tokusatsu">tokusatsu</a> television series <i><a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamen_Rider_4aed.html" title="Kamen Rider">Kamen Rider</a></i> premieres at 7:00 AM, marking the beginning of the long-running <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamen_Rider_%28franchise%29_d565.html" title="Kamen Rider (franchise)"><i>Kamen Rider</i> franchise</a>." Now, based on my reading of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Days_of_the_year&amp;oldid=55532401#Criteria_for_Events_-_A_Suggestion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Days_of_the_year&amp;oldid=55532401#Criteria_for_Events_-_A_Suggestion" rel="nofollow">this</a>, there is a general agreement that the initial broadcast of television programmes, the release of films, albums, video games, etc. should not be included on these pages. The given reasoning (that these events are not "globally important") is very weak, however; it is demonstrably untrue in many cases, and, in addition, is true of numerous other events that remain on the page.</p>
<p>Beyond this more general issue, however, I must take issue with the removal of this event specifically. As my edit clearly indicated, the premier of <i>Kamen Rider</i> was the beginning of an entire franchise of television programmes and theatrical films that continues to this day, and is one of the most popular and well-known in Japan. If that isn't enough to convince you, then I will note that the programmes have been aired in Brazil, France, and the United States, the original series lasted an unheard of (at the time) three years (150+ episodes), as well as being adapted into three theatrical films. Beyond that, there has been a new programme produced virtually every year since the original, as well as multiple television specials and straight-to-video films during the times when a new series wasn't produced. Essentially, the franchise has been a more-or-less constant premise since the premier.</p>
<p>Please note that I completely understand the aversion to television and film releases, as these are usually insignificant. However, I think that there are exceptions to this rule, and that removing these things wholesale without proper research (even, seemingly, reading the Wikipedia article) and consideration is unproductive.</p>
Thank you for taking the time to reading this.</div>

<dd>Star Trek is a bigger franchise,<s>and it isn't listed in date articles, either.</s>. Star Trek's cultural footprint is huge - with thousands of Wikipedia articles linking to the main Star Trek article. Here's another example, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> have over 5,000 cross-links. In order to argue that a franchise beginning rates mention in a date article, it really should have a big cultural footprint. You've mentioned movies, and a couple of countries, but what's the actual impact? How does Kamen Rider compare? After checking "What links here", we can see that Kamen Rider has as about many cross-links as <a href="../../../e/l/m/Elmo.html" title="Elmo">Elmo</a>. And that's just not a big enough foot print. With Elmo as the standard, date articles would be flooded with such "events" and rendered nearly useless. There is talk of setting up additional types of date articles to cover entertainment, weddings, etc. So don't give up hope. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 00:02, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The only thing the 'what links here" data indicates is that Wikipedia is lacking in coverage of <i>Kamen Rider</i>, which is something I already knew and am attempting to rectify. Please provide valid reasoning that actually make sense.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">SB</a> | <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black">T</a> 17:23, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like to mention that the number of cross-links of an article does not provide credence to the cultural impact of something. It's evident, to me at least, that Kamen Rider has had something like the impact of Star Trek, albiet not in the United States. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique"><b>B</b>astique</a><span class="Unicode" style="color:#FF72E3;">▼</span><b><sup><a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBastique_d47c.html" title="User talk:Bastique">parler</a></sup></b> <sub><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bastique_7452.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bastique">voir</a></b></sub> 17:31, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think, frankly, to continue to reject pure nonsense or complete non-notable events, and judge the remainder on a case-by-case basis, then everything will be all right. That's the way it's been done, correct?</dd>
<dd>I don't question your judgment Rklawton, you <i>are</i> a valuable contributor. I simply believe that leaving this item off may not adequately reflect a worldview. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique"><b>B</b>astique</a><span class="Unicode" style="color:#FF72E3;">▼</span><b><sup><a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBastique_d47c.html" title="User talk:Bastique">parler</a></sup></b> <sub><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bastique_7452.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bastique">voir</a></b></sub> 21:22, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I appreciate your concerns regarding world view. I used Google to support my conclusions. Unless there's something self-selecting about this particular fan-base that would preclude them from mentioning Kamen Rider on the web, then it's a reasonable measure. Of course, I've overlooked an important aspect. I've only searched on "Kamen Rider." Are there other permutations or character sets that should be included? After all, if this is a Japanese phenom, then it seems appropriate to search using the various Japanese character sets as well. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 21:38, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I just checked "仮面ライダ" (from the article page) on Google and came up with only 86,000 hits. However, I think "Masked Rider" translates as "仮面". This returned 7 million hits. "Star Trek" returns 47 million hits - illustrating my point about footprint. If you can recommend a different search, that would be useful. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 21:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I actually watched this show when I was a kid growing up on the other side of the planet in the 1970s where it was and still is known as 幪面超人. It's very notable. 星空奇遇 (Star Trek) was not as popular back then. Both shows were dubbed in Chinese, in case anyone is wondering. I support the inclusion of the premiere in the events list, and even as a Selected Anniversary on MainPage, as long as the date &amp; time is verifiable. -- <a href="../../../p/f/h/User%7EPFHLai_0319.html" title="User:PFHLai">PFHLai</a> 04:57, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>BTW, language aside, I don't think checking the internet is that useful to determine the notability of things most popular before the internet age. The first 2 waves of 幪面超人-mania in the Far East (at least in Hong Kong &amp; Taiwan) took place in the 70s and 80s (no internet), roughly the time between when Captain Kirk left and Captain Picard appeared on TV screens. Star Trek then kept going strong, with subsequent spin-offs and movies coming on as the internet grew. This may explain the big difference in Google counts. The numbers would be quite different if people were able to build websites and blogs in the 70s. -- <a href="../../../p/f/h/User%7EPFHLai_0319.html" title="User:PFHLai">PFHLai</a> 06:53, 10 August 2006 (UTC) [P.S. Thanks for bringing back some interesting childhood memories.&#160;:-) ]</p>

<dd>So the show was greatly popular during its run - in one country - and had minimal lasting impact afterwards. It sounds like you've got the makings for a great article, but not for any entry of events with a global historical magnitude. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 14:32, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a>, I hope this is just a careless mistake. But to lump China and Japan as one country (<a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere_befb.html" title="Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere">Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere</a>???) is rather offensive.

<dd>I can't say much about things after the 80s, as I've moved to the other side of the planet. But I'd say 幪面超人 is still a East Asian cultural phenomenon. (Ditto for <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultraman.html" title="Ultraman">Ultraman</a>.) It's not <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godzilla.html" title="Godzilla">Godzilla</a>, but it's high up there in terms of notability.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, please consider regional historical magnitude, instead of global. Back then, things didn't spread that widely. While the event lists are often loaded with non-notable items that deserve to be trimmed off, let's not over-do it with the trimming. The first appearance of 幪面超人 is a worthy item for the events list. --<a href="../../../p/f/h/User%7EPFHLai_0319.html" title="User:PFHLai">PFHLai</a> 19:20, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>On a different note, I'm a big fan of <i>Ultra Man</i>, <i>Godzilla</i>, and <i>Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot</i>. My poor parents had to contend with a kid who thought stomping on his toys was all part of the fun. I doubt they ever understood. They never ever considered helping me build a model train set. Just as well, I suppose. It wouldn't have lasted. I finally did learn how to fly, though. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 19:36, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good for you.&#160;:-) BTW, I was never a fan of 幪面超人. But I have childhood friends who would jump off their bicycle, pretending to be 幪面超人 flying off his motorcycle. --<a href="../../../p/f/h/User%7EPFHLai_0319.html" title="User:PFHLai">PFHLai</a> 20:51, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
