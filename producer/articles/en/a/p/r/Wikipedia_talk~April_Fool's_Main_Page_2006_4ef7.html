<h2><span class="mw-headline">DISCUSSION SECTION STARTS HERE</span></h2>
<p>To sum up, I'd like us to make the Main Page as factual as possible, but with unusual facts and articles to convince readers that we are pulling their leg on April Fool's Day. However, the joke's on them: we are actually presenting the truth, not a bunch of jokes!</p>
<p>This is in response to last year, when we had a discussion on the mailing list leading up to <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">1 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. I made a proposal somewhat like this, and some folks in general were quite supportive of it. Now, I'd like to put this forward earlier so we have more time to work on it. Please provide any feedback you may have on this proposal. Thanks! --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">athphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 22:10, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Awesome Idea</span></h2>
<p>It seems rather meta to turn the joke around, I love it. Great idea. Just one question: How do we keep it a secret from the casual readers until "the day" ... can we count on most not knowing about all these other namespaces? <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 22:55, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, good idea. I doubt many casual readers will find this in the next couple weeks, most don't know there <b>are</b> namespaces, but a handful who are in on the joke can spread rumors so people actually come look on the day. ("Vut goot eest a Doomsday joke eef nobody knowz abowt eet!?"). For extra fun, throw in exactly one totally serious DYK, make people crazy looking for the joke in a sober article. For weirdness in the news, plagiarize Olbermann "Oddball" entries from a day or two before...&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 23:33, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lame</span></h2>
<p>I consider this basically lame, in that April Fool's is not about News Of The Weird. It's about pulling off pranks. Ideally this effort would be the official April Fool's celebration while a secret cabal of planners works on a real prank (TINC). --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cunctator_a9b6.html" title="User:The Cunctator">The Cunctator</a> 23:41, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ya, this <i>could</i> be the cover story. Or the secret cabal could be the cover story. OR they could BOTH be cover stories for yet a third nefarious plot. Whichever. Fnord. The QE2 story is NOT "News of the Weird", IMHO, it's a straight story that looks pranked. Whether there are more like that out there or not, who knows... <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 01:15, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, it's much more lame than, say, opening up an arbitration case requesting that Jimbo, Angela, and Danny all be banned from Wikipedia, deleting <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, or writing an article about Encyclopædia Britanica taking over Wikipedia (to become Wikipædia Britannica, which I thought was hilarious). But this is a prank we can pull on the readers while not messing up the main articlespace with unencyclopedic information. Perhaps it's lame to try and maintain the illusion that we provide truthful information while trying to pull a fast one on our readers, but I'm still trying anyway; hence, this proposal.&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">athphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 06:54, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the reasons set out on the Village Pump (Policy} I strongly oppose the idea. Those who wish to engage in the foolishness of this day by changing or adding to the internal contents will never be deterred, but no serious newspaper or other media outlet would lead with a joke and this site, which aspires to being a serious attempt at providing accurate information, should not play with the lay readers' expectations (even by offering strange but true material). If the opening page is a joke, what does that make the rest of the pages? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid91_7ed4.html" title="User:David91">David91</a> 08:14, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most newspapers lead on April Fools jokes every year. See for example <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Grauniad's</a> front-page story <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/country/article/0,,1449948,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/country/article/0,,1449948,00.html" rel="nofollow">New Labour lines up countryside role for Charles</a>.

<dd>If people are going to pull jokes with or without your approval (which I suspect they will), would it be better to channel them a certain way which is less harmful to reputation, or to just put up with whatever comes up? My thinking is channel, and this proposal does that, IMHO. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 11:21, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are correct that my approval is completely irrelevant but I doubt that changing the front page will, to any real degree, channel any activity. This is one project. No doubt, many other editors will hatch their own projects on the day. Which does rather beg the question — whose day are you going to pick. My timezone is not your timezone. So which 24 hour period are you all going to choose and enforce? Is this going to be a U.S.-centric or a U.K.-centric or some other -centric project. Who decides which day is the "day" for these purposes? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid91_7ed4.html" title="User:David91">David91</a> 12:47, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To respond to your original post above, according to my proposal, everything on the page is as close to 100% true as we can make it. In fact, The Cunctator doesn't think my proposal is "pranky" enough, and you think providing truthful information is too "pranky"? There would be nothing false about the Main Page at all. Even the featured article must be a genuinely-approved featured article. My template for this is <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploding_whale.html" title="Exploding whale">exploding whale</a>, a very unusual article, but also very well written, and clearly of FA quality (indeed, it <b>is</b> an FA). People are going to be pulling pranks and writing joke articles anyway, but at least with an official April Fool's Day policy, we can easily revert any harmful edits to the main articlespace and be able to point to the Main Page as evidence that yes, you can channel all your April Fool's efforts somewhere. As for time zones, last year, it was UTC. Wikipedia is run by UTC, all the logs are done by UTC, and the AfDs are closed by UTC. As for a normal daily Main Page, it would be run by UTC. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">athphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 12:55, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a great idea and a great image, but does the Main Page allow for repeated FPs?

<p>I dislike it all. There should be no special treatment for April Fool's Day above any other day. I argued the same thing last year. This is a reference site; there must be zero tolerance for anything that even comes close to any kind of tricks or mischief regarding information. People shouldn't even get the <i>idea</i> that we get involved in that kind of thing, because it will devalue our reputation. And I think we need to get a policy in place beforehand to block immediately anybody who pulls any nonsense that misinforms our readers. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 11:50, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see anything wrong in having unusual articles on the main page that day, but I remember with horror all the vandalism that occured in article space last year. It seemed like every regular editor, and then some, thought they had the right to edit in april fools jokes everywhere. April 1'st last year was the day where I would not trust the content on wikipedia. And it shouldn't be like that. So I would prefere the whole site was simply made read only that day. Let that be our april fools joke, as boring as that may be. It will save many of us a lot of work, and I'm sure the developers could make good use of a day with a locked database for upgrades or database clean ups or something. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 19:21, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One of the beneficial side-effects of having an article mentioned on the Main Page is the article will usually see a flurry of improvements to the article.

<dd>That's a great idea, I really love it, but given how resistant some people are just in following normal Wikipedia procedure aspects of this proposal, I think there will be extremely heavy resistance to listing a stub on the Main Page.

<p>I quite like the idea for normal usage, to be honest. Why shouldn't we list things that need improvement? It's just as important as the things that don't; more so, in fact. This is an encyclopedia, and a wiki; let's be flexible and show both the good and the bad. It's quite possible our improvement rate would go up; <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> maintains that featured articles benefit from being on the main page, so perhaps a simple little stub would, too. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> 16:34, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reason that I thought about the idea is from the bunch of edits that happened after my one and only "did you know" showed up on the Main Page. The idea of having a box on the Main Page with five new stubs day for improvement I think is something worth exploring. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 17:31, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made an article, <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doorknob_%28game%29.html" title="Doorknob (game)">Doorknob (game)</a> that I think embodies the spirit of April Fool's Day for Wikipedia. It was a bitty stub, and I expanded it a great deal. In keeping with this discussion, it is an article that is "fact" but it is quite absurd. The "Fool" part of April Fool's Day, in my opinion, is that someone is being made a fool of. In the case of the article, the fool is clearly me (the author) for spending time writing something so irrelevant. But then.. is it? Isn't it encyclopedic for documenting a game that many of us played as children (or in my case, 31 year old children)? Aguerriero 19:43, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Poor show. Wikipedia is not Uncyclopedia. It is our job to present things in an informative way, and your revision of Doorknob really didn't do that. What we do to celebrate April Fools' must be restricted to places where misinformation may be expected, or to forms which are not misleading, such as choosing a wacky TFA, or where the joke is quickly apparent, such as the "you have new messages" idea, or stamping the joke with an April Fools' tag. You can't do that to a real article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 20:03, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Eh. I respectfully disagree. The article is informative - it outlines the rules of a game. If someone witnessed others playing doorknob and were confused by it, they could look up my article and achieve enlightenment. Just because I lent a comical tone to it doesn't mean it's not useful information. There is a rather lengthy article about <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tag_%28game%29.html" title="Tag (game)">tag</a> - how is mine any different? And I'll give you the "Pain Reference" revert - that was just a joke and I may put it back in tomorrow with the April Fool's tag. Aguerriero 20:13, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Is this going to happen? I was so excited! <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECathryn_0f5a.html" title="User:Cathryn">Cathryn</a> 03:07, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems that no one bothered to make any of the necessary arrangements. (This has never been anything other than a "proposal.") It probably is too late now. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 03:31, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoo.html" title="Spoo">spoo</a> is a featured article, as is already known, and I added a few entries to the Selected anniversaries, but it seems that they chose a very boring picture to be featured. I thought someone said that the medieval Mickey Mouse picture was going to be the featured picture for April 1, but I guess that person was mistaken. I put in this proposal too late: I actually planned to do it two months before April 1, but a lot of things happened in my life so I completely forgot. However, a few elements are in the Main Page, but onyl that which is already in line with Wikipedia policy. I am hesitant to place any of the DYKs because the ones we have in this proposal are all from older articles. Well, the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_flying_saucer_9294.html" title="British Rail flying saucer">British Rail flying saucer</a> one was created in 13 March 2006, so maybe that's new enough for a mention. I'm going to look at the age of the rest of the articles on this day and if the flying saucer one is about the same age, I'm putting it in. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">athphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 06:21, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Nope, as it turns out, 28 March 2006 is the oldest of the DYK entries, so I'm not going against Wikipedia policy to put this in. However, the "latest news" could be worth mentioning. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">athphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 06:25, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Never mind, the process for adding news is a little too long: they must be added to <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> first. Any other ideas? I think maybe on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_2.html" title="April 2">2 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, I should devote this space to planning out April Fool's for 2007, but the problem is keeping it active for the next twelve months minus a day. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">athphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 06:32, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
