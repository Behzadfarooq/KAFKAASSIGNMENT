<p><b>April Fool's Main Page 2007</b> (which may be referred to as <b>AFMP 2007</b>) provides idea development space for the proposed presentation of the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> on April Fool's Day 2007. The proposed components of the Main Page may be presented on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">1 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, and if deemed a success, may be a guideline for presenting the Main Page on future April Fool's Days. See <a href="../../../a/p/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EApril_Fool%27s_Main_Page_2006_4ef7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:April Fool's Main Page/2006">2006 archive</a> for last year's discussion and <a href="../../../a/p/r/Wikipedia%7EApril_Fool%27s_Main_Page_2006_e220.html" title="Wikipedia:April Fool's Main Page/2006">result</a>, which now may be considered a guideline for presenting the Main Page on April Fool's Days 2007. Although less important to the direction of AFMP 2007 than AFMP 2006's results, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Fools%27_Day_4e24.html" title="April Fools' Day">April Fools' Day</a> may help provide some direction as well.</p>
<p><u>Changes limited to truthful changes</u>: The <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> should be kept to the same high standard as for other days, but with a special caveat: that the Main Page be composed of facts and articles that are true, but either unusual or manipulated in a way as to sound unbelievable. While readers may sometimes come to Wikipedia expecting some joke article for April Fool's, the proposal is to make the Main Page so unusual or unbelievable that the reader will conclude that the Main Page is presenting jokes as fact, but the joke is actually on the reader: everything on the Main Page is as close to 100% factual as we may make it.</p>
<p><u>Truthful whimsy is OK</u>: Traditionally, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Fool%27s_Day_5641.html" title="April Fool's Day">April Fool's Day</a> (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">1 April</a>) is a day of fun and practical jokes in some cultures. While it is fine to follow in the spirit of good fun when editing Wikipedia, we must not forget that Wikipedia is above all an encyclopedia that people will read for information. At the same time, Wikipedia should not be so formal and humorless that it cannot show some whimsy in how it presents itself to its readers.</p>
<p><u>Scope of project:</u> Wikipedia is divided into hundreds of departments, six of which are classified as <a href="../../../d/e/p/Wikipedia%7EDepartment_directory_f4d1.html" title="Wikipedia:Department directory">Main Page departments</a>. The Main Page departments include (i) <a href="../../../d/i/d/Wikipedia%7EDid_you_know_b520.html" title="Wikipedia:Did you know">Did you know (dept.)</a>, (ii) <a href="../../../i/n/_/Wikipedia%7EIn_the_news_section_on_the_Main_Page_2b6c.html" title="Wikipedia:In the news section on the Main Page">In the news (dept.)</a>, (iii) <a href="../../../p/i/c/Wikipedia%7EPicture_of_the_day_405e.html" title="Wikipedia:Picture of the day">Picture of the day (dept.)</a>, (iv) <a href="../../../s/e/l/Wikipedia%7ESelected_anniversaries_88c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries">Selected anniversaries (dept.)</a>, (v) <a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_featured_article_6658.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article">Today's featured article (dept.)</a>, and (vi) <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_Page_649b.html" title="Talk:Main Page">Main Page design discussions</a>/<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Usability_Main_Page_727e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Usability/Main Page">Main Page Redesign Project (closed)</a>. The first five departments control the changeable sections on the main page (e.g., "content") and the sixth department controls the fixed design surrounding the changeable sections (e.g., "design"). April Fool's Main Page 2007 is limited to working with the first five departments to coordinate the content appearing on the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">main page</a> from 00:00 to 23:59 on 1 April 2007 (UTC).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/p/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EApril_Fool%27s_Main_Page_749e.html" title="Edit section: Coordinators and Members">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Coordinators and Members</span></h2>
<p><u>Main page administrator coordinators:</u> April Fool's Main Page 2007 project affects all five changeable sections on the main page. To have an April Fool's content appear on the main page on April 1st, some of the department rules for these changeable main page sections may need to be bent. Thus, the project may need the approval and agreed upon cooperation from the appropriate main page department. Mostly, this may involve deciding which main page rules could be bent in their respective section and in fact bending those rules, reviewing proposed main page content to ensure it meets that sections main page requirements, and ensuring that this content made its way to the main page on April 1st. The following is a list of administrators who have agreed to serve as AFMP 2007 main page department coordinators:</p>

<p>How about we do something like put a link to a page in wikipedia but instead it takes you to a completely different page. i.e. having a link that says "tree" but it takes you to something like "Alexander Gram Bell" <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmartdude123_37b4.html" title="User:Smartdude123">Smartdude123</a></p>

<dd>I respectfully disagree. I believe that it does hold up Wikipedia's standards while being whimsy. Although the joke is on the readers, the language play is on the editors, not the readers. It shows Wikipedian's can laugh at themselves. The statement that 'even those without a sense of humor can edit Wikipedia' is true, is a whimsy clarification to Wikipedia's often cited, trademark phrase "the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit", and is an aid to help the reader conclude that the Main Page is presenting jokes as fact. Wikipedia should not be so formal and humorless that it cannot show some whimsy in how it presents itself to its readers, such as by maintaining the site's normal setup and present this subtitle addition to the site's normal setup. The dynamic link to the April Fools' Day page may help those whose culture does not have April Fools. In any event, the link easily can be eliminated or redirected. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 16:00, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. Editors <i>are</i> readers, and to imply that someone who doesn't appreciate April Fools' Day has no sense of humor is an unkind, unprofessional insult. Making fun of people on the main page (whether through your suggestion or last year's <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;diff=46420971" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;diff=46420971" rel="nofollow">similar nonsense</a></span>, which unwittingly doubled as a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html#M" title="List of ethnic slurs">racial slur</a>) is absolutely unacceptable.</dd>
<dd>2. As you know, there shall be no fake content on the main page (unless a sysop wishes to be blocked for the remainder of the day). We won't actually be "presenting jokes as fact," and while someone might arrive at such a conclusion (because some of the content will seem unbelievable), it would border on an outright lie to directly imply that this is the case.</dd>

<dd>After rereading your posts and the above AFMP rules, I agree that any addition to the fixed main page text that is directed at people in a less than positive light is not in keeping with the fun spirit behind the AFMP. Also, qualifying the positive phrase "that anyone can edit" with a negative leaning phrase "even those without a sense of humor" is not unusual or manipulated in a way as to sound unbelievable, which AFMP requires. Thus, I withdraw my masthead request. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 00:58, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well there's always parody, copy an famous encyclopedias just avoid the lawsuits. lol. Or make the page full of one subject and change the main page accordingly. For example, "Wikiendo" can be this year's subject. The main page would be filled with everything Nintendo related - like a crazed fanboy took over. The hues of gray &amp; white in the background would be changed to hues of red &amp; white, etc. This is something that can easily be done I guess. I'm that experienced with Adobe Photoshop. Changes done at the adjacent page seem a little too discreet for someone looking for a quick find here.

<dd>What he said -- we're not looking to <b>mislead</b> the viewers. Let me tell you a simple story. When I was in the Netherlands, I didn't know the Dutch name for a "duck-billed platypus." And so I described it to my housemates -- "It lives in Australia. It's maybe kind of like a rat, but it's about half a meter long or so. It has this big brown duck bill but it's all furry all over, like an animal. But it lays eggs. It has these big floppy webbed feet, with big poisonous claws on it, and this big beaver tail."</dd>
<dd>Now, what did they say when they heard of this duck-billed marmot that lays eggs thing? They said, "you're making that up."</dd>
<dd><b>That</b> is the reaction that we want to instill in people.</dd>
<dd>(To finish my tale, after my housemates claimed that I was making it up, I asked around the faculty at the technical university I was working, still trying to find out the Dutch name of the platypus. Again, nobody knew the word "platypus," so I described it, and again, nobody believed me that such a thing could exist. I couldn't convince <i>anybody</i> that such an absurd creature existed until I found out that the Dutch word for "platypus" is "vogelbekdier." Then people started going "oh, yes, een vogelbekdier, I've heard of those before.")</dd>

<li>The discussion actually helped clarify how the AFMP project can change the Main Page design. Once the AFMP project comes to a consensus on a change to the Main Page design, we would submit that change to <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_Page_649b.html" title="Talk:Main Page">Main Page design discussions</a>. If the Main Page design discussions reach a consensus to go forward with AFMP's proposed Main Page design change, someone from the Main Page design discussions either would make the change themselves or they would open up a new Main Page Redesign Project and submit the AFMP's proposed Main Page design change for a vote by all Wikipedians. The kinds of changes that are made by <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_Page_649b.html" title="Talk:Main Page">Main Page design discussions</a> can be judge by reviewing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Main Page history</a>.

Another observation: <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_Page_649b.html" title="Talk:Main Page">Main Page design discussions</a> serves as a buffer that would protect our political capital should AFMP consensus decide to go forward with a less than ideal change to Main Page design (e.g., they would save us from ourselves should there be a need). -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 18:35, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is text on the mainpage that does not change from day to day.

<p>Each section on the mainpage that periodically change has certain rules that usually are met before an entry makes its way onto the mainpage. The five mainpage sections affected by this are (1) Featured article, (2) In the news, (3) Selected anniversaries/On this day..., (4) <a href="../../../d/y/k/WP%7EDYK_3118.html#The_Rules" title="WP:DYK">Did you know...</a> and (5) Today's featured picture. The issue to be decided is whether the AFMP project needs to comply with these rules or may these rules be bent slightly given the whimsy nature of the AFMP project and the added difficulty of meeting some of the rules to post on a particular date (here April 1st). Approve means you approve bending the mainpage rules as part of the AFMP project. Disapprove means that you do not approve bending the mainpage rules as part of the AFMP project. Please provide your reasoning below with an <b>Approve</b>, <b>Disapprove</b>, or some other position. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 19:58, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Disapprove</b> - The mainpage rules should not be bent as part of the AFMP project.</s> AFMP 2006 started so late that it may have been necessary to bend the mainpage rules to develop the AFMP 2006 page. We've got three months to develop AFMP 2007, so I don't think last years rule bending is applicable for AFMP 2007. Since the present approved rule is that the Main Page should be kept to the same high standard as for other days, bending the mainpage rules would not <u>seem to</u> keep the usual same high standards. If we cannot put in the extra effort need to produce an AFMP page <s>and comply with mainpage rules</s>, then that the AFMP page for that year should be skipped. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 19:58, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Approve</b> - within reason. For example, whilst (within the rules) we could write a great featured article - to stay within the rules we'd have to wait our turn to be featured on the front page. We'll have to bend the rules very slightly in order to have our article pre-empt the queue to hit April 1st. So a certain amount of rule-bending is definitely needed. However, I think we should strive to minimise the amount of bending we need - if only because we KNOW that a lot of humorless/bone-headed folks will get in our way if we push this too hard. I just don't want us to write in stone "Thou shalt not bend any rule". <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 20:41, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I see your point. Instead of a vote, I think we need to review the rules for each of the sections and come to a consensus on which rules for each of the five sections are required to be bent to achieve an AFMP page. As for the humorless/bone-headed folks, I'm still amazed that AFMP 2006 occurred. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 00:15, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>As noted above by SteveBaker, a certain amount of rule-bending is required. As for the actual qualification criteria, I personally believe that they should be upheld, with the possible exception of <i>DYK</i>. Displaying a non-featured article as <i>TFA</i>, a non-featured picture as <i>TFP</i>, unimportant news in <i>ITN</i>, or insignificant events in <i>OTD</i> would compromise the encyclopedia's integrity, but including some non-new articles in <i>DKN</i> would not. Furthermore, while it would be fine to create new articles in advance and move them to the article namespace within five days of 1 April (as SteveBaker suggested), this is the exploitation of a technicality (which is no different in spirit than simply using pre-existing articles). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 20:50, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>We can get stuff into DYK under the letter of the law. I agree that we may prefer to bend the rules here - but we really don't have to. ITN is the major problem though. To find items that are 'important' yet also surprising or funny <b>and</b> to have them happen within the usual 'couple of days' timescale of ITN - that's really tough. So if any rules are to be bent - then the highest priority is to get some kind of agreement-in-principle to bend the ITN rules. There seem to be few guidelines about what goes into ITN, mainly it seems that the purpose of the section is not to relate to new articles - but simply to throw up a bunch of links to existing articles that someone who is interested in breaking events might want to read. How the heck do we do THAT at short notice? Another problem with ITN is that unlike all the other sections, it's a useful service to people who come to Wikipedia seeking background to news items. It could well be argued that by subverting this section for the purposes of humor, we are depriving millions of people of access to our usual deep background to important breaking events. It could be argued that we should leave ITN alone. A reasonable compromise might be to try to get just ONE really off-the-wall event into the list and leave the others well alone. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 02:14, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Objection</b>, the entire premise behind the rejection of my idea to include a link to a "normal" main page or to the "Tomorrow's Edition" page at the bottom is that the AFMP is really 100% normal and could easily be any other day.

<p>In cold reality, there are strict limits beyond which we cannot stray before the more boring members of our community will get very, very upset indeed. I think we should stop thinking in terms of anything that changes how Wikipedia works - or how it looks - or anything that changes the structure of the front page.</p>
<p>We have to live 100% within the bounds of what a normal Wikipedia front page is.</p>
<p>Hence we need to find things that are funny - or very hard to believe (but still true) - and get them through the standard review processes so that they all come together on April 1st.</p>
<p>So, let's please stop wasting time trying to think of ways of subverting the thing - it's not going to happen.</p>

<dd>Iorek85 is right. Is there any point in doing this? April Fools Day is a day of playing practical jokes, not bending the line of truth. Please count the number of suggestions that have been shot down will you? Perhaps the ones that haven't may be easier to count... <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJaser_12345_9ffd.html" title="User:Jaser 12345">Jaser 12345</a> 14:28, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I respect your position - and I agree that changing the Wikipedia logo into a whoopie cushion or something would be rather neat. But as I said in the title of this section - we need a dose of reality here. If you believe it will be possible to pursade those who maintain the front page to do this then I strongly recommend you head over to wherever they discuss front page design changes and present your case. Personally, I think you don't stand a snowball's chance in hell of succeeding - but if you're so sure you can - then please try! I'm not against doing this (in principle) - it's just that I've dealt with these folks and I'm a realist and I don't want to get into protracted arguments with those folks. Perhaps your stamina and pursuasive powers are greater than mine. But for sure I don't want to waste everyone's time with something that I strongly believe won't come to fruition...but feel free to try. I would ask though that you obtain agreement <i><b>in principle</b></i> to change the front page design in some way before we fill up this list with suggestions that are really unlikely to come to fruition. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 18:17, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>A secondary mainpage that plays April 1 completely straight, no different from March 31 or April 2, with a link at the bottom of the AFMP (I know the consensus on fixed text additions was not to do that, but the consensus was based in large part on a condemnation of one specific suggested addition as vandalism). Reasoning: It is traditional and expected for websites that have april fools jokes to make the "real" front page available by an alternative means. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandom832_2ea5.html" title="User:Random832">Random832</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Random832_9c40.html" title="Special:Contributions/Random832">contribs</a>) 15:23, 23 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>The discussion actually helped clarify how the AFMP project can change the Main Page design. Once the AFMP project comes to a consensus on a change to the Main Page design, we would submit that change to <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_Page_649b.html" title="Talk:Main Page">Main Page design discussions</a>. If the Main Page design discussions reach a consensus to go forward with AFMP's proposed Main Page design change, someone from the Main Page design discussions either would make the change themselves or they would open up a new Main Page Redesign Project and submit the AFMP's proposed Main Page design change for a vote by all Wikipedians. The last <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Usability_Main_Page_727e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Usability/Main Page">Main Page Redesign Project</a> involved the opinions of 943 participants over an 18-day poll/discussion.

<dd>There's no need for a "secondary mainpage that plays April 1 completely straight." The whole point of this project is to compile a page that captures the essence of April Fools' Day without compromising our usual standards. In other words, all of the content would be suitable (at least in spirit, even if not in letter) for display on any other date. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 19:04, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So what? Some people didn't want to read about <i>The <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_saffron.html" title="History of saffron">History of saffron</a> cultivation in Southwest Asia</i>...but that was the FA for today. Should we have provided a 'backup' article for people who aren't interested in the details of crocus stigma? On every single day of the year our readers get an essentially random article (chosen just by whatever happened to be recently accepted as being of high enough standards) - a random set of Did-You-Know facts (chosen by whatever articles have been created recently) - a quasi-random list of things that happen to have happened on this day in the past and a picture that happens to be one that we recently decided looked quite nice. There is no concerted effort to be interesting and relevent on the front page...whatever is recently considered to be well written and well researched gets onto the front page...not matter how weird, how obscure or how irrelevent to our readers.</dd>

<dd>So long as our articles are true and up to the required standards, we aren't asking people to read anything that's any more or less relevent to them than our usual daily offerings. The only thing that's different is that we're trying to find articles that <i>seem</i> like they are April Fool jokes when you read about them on the main page. The actual articles will be just as true, just as well written - and about as relevent - as any other day. Good grief - we've had articles about Pokemon on the front page on a normal day. Surely we can pick an article on exploding toads without having to provide a different random article for the benefit of the humor-impaired. The key thing here is that we don't tell lies - we don't put in a hastily written or poorly researched article. It's just like any other day <i>except</i> that in the minds of our readers, it'll <b>seem</b> like we're putting up nonsense articles. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 02:47, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are we committed to not bending the rules? Well, I think we'll ask the DYK folks to bend the rule that the article has to be less than 5 days old (I think we have tacit agreement from one of the DYK people to do that). I'd hope that we could get something into the ITN section - despite it not perhaps being the most newsworthy story of the day. We'll ask the FA and FP folks to preferentially choose our nominations for the front page on April 1st - bumping whatever other FA/FP was scheduled for that day. Beyond that, no - no bending of any rules, no change of format, no extra links, no backup page, no changing the Wikipedia into a whoopie cushion, no nothing. That seems to be the general consensus. But even if we agreed here to change something - it's not something that <b>we</b> can just decide to do - hundreds of other people would have to agree to it. That's a major deal - and I for one don't want to have to fight that battle. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 15:16, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

We already have Toilet-related injury - but 0.99999999999... isn't an option because it's already been on the front page just a few months ago. The monster raving looney party candidate is a good suggestion. I think a lot of American Monty Python enthusiasts would be really surprised to find that there really is a Monster Raving Loony party in England and that they actually put up candidates for elections and actually come close to winning some of them! The only downside is that British people are very aware of this - so it wouldn't be anywhere near so surprising to them. But this is definitely the kind of thing we need. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 20:13, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah - that is the ENTIRE point of what we are talking about. We plan to put up articles that are 100% true, correct, properly researched, well written, etc. The only thing that is in any way abnormal is that we'll try to pick things that seem incredibly hard to believe. If you are someone who understands what April Fools day is all about then the hope is that you will naturally assume that this is a hoax page and that all the stories are fictional - but when you read them, it will slowly dawn on you that, no, this is all true. In a sense, they prank themselves. For these hypothetical "international readers" who don't understand April Fools day, they may never know that anything unusual was done - they'll just see some hard-to-believe things - but why would they assume they weren't true?

<p>Over on the five sub-pages (see top of this page for links), we've been suggesting topic and debating their merits. We are now down to less than two months to do the work - so we have to start voting and making firm decisions.</p>
<p>So far:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>On This Day</b> - has a reasonable number of good candidates that need some clever rewording to make them sound less credible - but we're in good shape. We'll definitely have six surprising things that happened on April 1st that can be on the front page.</li>
<li><b>Did You Know</b> - No shortage of great suggestions. I think its harder to choose between them - and we have to actually push some of them up from stubs into real articles - but this seems do-able so long as we don't leave it to the last minute.</li>
<li><b>In The News</b> - Basically, there isn't much we can do about this until the last couple of days of March when we have to look really hard for bizarre news items.</li>
<li><b>Todays Featured Picture</b> - Here we are in <b>huge</b> trouble. I don't see a single useable picture in the list of suggestions and nobody is talking about it on that page. We need help here folks! This is by far the most worrying thing.</li>
<li><b>Todays Featured Article</b> - I think we have three strong candidates for which we can reach consensus. We need to pick one and start work on getting it up through peer review, WP:GAC and then WP:FAC in plenty of time so that if we fail to get it through FAC, we have time to make a second attempt - or go with a different choice. This is where the most work remains to be done - but I'm quietly confident that we can do it if we try.</li>
<li><b>Other things</b> - I see lots of people making all sorts of suggestions to change the masthead, logo, to put navigation tricks into the interface and other wild stuff. I don't personally believe that any of these things are possible - but I don't see anyone even trying to get it through the various committees that decide these things. Well, it's "put up or shut up time". If you guys really think this can be done - you'd better get off your butts and start pushing the right buttons in these committees.</li>

<p>As you know, non-admins cannot edit the mainpage, they see "View Source" instead of "Edit" at the top of the screen - it would be good, if for April Fools Day, the mainpage <i>appeared</i> to be editable - his would work like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone showing up to add jokes/vandalism would see "Edit" at the top of the screen</li>
<li>Any edits they made would be saved, but not to the real mainpage</li>
<li>The servers would use login info (or IPs for users who hadn't logged in) to serve the edited mainpage to the user who'd made that edit</li>
<li>Any users who hadn't edited it would see the real mainpage</li>
<li>30 minutes after a user had made an edit, it would cease to show - this would reduce the chances of a shared-IP user seeing a vandalised mainpage</li>
</ul>
<p>I like ths idea as it would play a joke on those who would play a joke on Wikipedia - also if vandals think they can vandalise the main page, they may not vandalise othr articles.

<li><b>No.</b> Short of making custom changes to the MediaWiki software (not gonna happen), the only way I can think of doing this is by replacing the main page with a version using some complex ParserFunctions which transclude a shadow main page, or a user-custom page if available. The problem with this is everyone who "edited" the main page would create a separate copy in their user space which would need to be cleaned up later. Lots of work, huge potential downside. —<a href="../../../d/g/i/User%7EDgies_d44c.html" title="User:Dgies">Dgies</a><sup><a href="../../../d/g/i/User_talk%7EDgies_d02f.html" title="User talk:Dgies">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dgies_24b2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dgies">c</a></sup> 22:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree that this is probably a bad idea due to the amount of cleanup that would be required, but it <i>is</i> techinically possible; <a href="../../../m/o/n/MediaWiki%7EMonobook.js_362e.html" title="MediaWiki:Monobook.js">MediaWiki:monobook.js</a> could be changes to change the 'view source' link to an 'edit' link, using the InputBox extension preloading code (the sort of thing used in the AfD process) to automatically generate the code for a page in the editor's userspace identical to the Main Page; script could also be used to fake the 'Editing Main Page' title. The view of the mainpage would switch back to normal if they returned to en.wikipedia.org, or clicked on a 'Main page' link or the logo, but that would be less of a problem. The main problem, which is what invalidates the proposal, is that we'd end up with a large number of speedy-worthy pages in userspace (and it would take a while to delete them unless an adminbot or devscript was used, and April Fool's Day is not major enough to use hefty processes like this.) --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 10:01, 26 March 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</li>

<p>I realise that a consensus appears to have already been reached regarding April Fools Day this year, but I felt compelled to add my opinion. Two years ago, with the "Britannica takes over Wikipedia" hoax, we gained attention on other websites. A friend of mine found it amusing enough to forward me the article - it was the first time I'd actually been to Wikipedia (although I'd heard of it previously). I read the hoax with intrigue, and went on to look up articles on everything else I could think of, eventually starting to edit, and later becoming an administrator.</p>
<p>It somewhat disappoints me that consensus now appears to have been "reached" which all but rules out practical jokes such as this appearing on Wikipedia on future April Fools days. I realise that Wikipedia is an encylcopedia, and as such strives for accuracy and correct information - and rightly so. However, I think it's a real shame we can't be a little more light hearted about the situation - even respected newspapers, who on any other day would pride themselves on being factually accurate, frequently publish hoax articles for comedic value on April Fools Day. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaghetti_tree.html" title="Spaghetti tree">Spaghetti trees</a> were an April Fools joke introduced by <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panorama_%28TV_series%29_8720.html" title="Panorama (TV series)">Panorama</a> - on any other occasion a factual, current affairs documentary series.</p>
<p>I appreciate that cultural differences may mean that not all of our users make a celebration of April Fools Day. However, since this is the English language Wikipedia, I would presume that the vast majority of them would do. For those that aren't interested in more of a jokey sentiment for one day - surely that's tough. Afterall, not all of us are interested in Botany but that's no reason for <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banksia_integrifolia.html" title="Banksia integrifolia">Banksia integrifolia</a> not to be today's featured article. Not all of use are interested in major sporting events, but again, that's no reason for them not be included in "In the news...".</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong - I'm not encouraging introducing random acts of vandalism, or changes that could overly annoy people making use of our excellent resource. I do, however, think that dispensation from normal policies, and suggestions to introduce changes more April-fools like in nature than a "strange but true" featured article, set of news items, did you know facts etc... exactly like last year... should be given more consideration. Far from damaging our reputation, I think the right joke could portray Wikipedia in a good light - gain us attention, and possibly encourage others to join our "community". <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 19:44, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

In fact, I view this as a compelling reason to rise above the nonsense. 1 April is a day on which much of the Internet is more or less broken, and we should embrace our responsibility to inject some sanity into the day.

<dd>I know that the overwhelming majority of people expect some kind of a joke on websites on April Fool's Day. They won't perceive or conclude that Wikipedia as a joke if the front page is an April Fool's day joke. Vandalism will run rampant on Wikipedia that day no matter what is on the front page. David Levy seems to be the major opponent of an April Fool's tomfoolery. Google and Yahoo each run a April Fool's Day joke each year, and it doesn't hurt their credibility at all.

Stating that a special mainpage would cause sysops to "vandalise the main page" is David's opinion which I do not share.

<dd>While having appropriately themed material available for everyone during their local April 1 is an admirable goal, from a logistical standpoint this would create too large a work load to realistically accomplish. Due to the technical implementation, most of the Main page automatically changes over at 24:00 each day. To make this suggestion work would then require two to three times the material be available to meet the needs of the increased time frame (three appropriate Featured articles and sets of <i>On this day</i> material while <i>Did you know</i> would require 48 hours worth of themed material). Given the difficulty in accumulating 24 hours of material for the Main page, it seems unlikely that a multi-day April fools is realistic at this time. --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 21:38, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
