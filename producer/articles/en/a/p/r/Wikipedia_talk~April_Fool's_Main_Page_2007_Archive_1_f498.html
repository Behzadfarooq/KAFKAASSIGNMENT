<p>There is text on the mainpage that does not change from day to day. An example of adding truthful, whimsical text to fixed mainpage text would be adding the phrase "(even those without a sense of humor!)" below "the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit." in the Masthead (see proposal above under the Masthead section). The five mainpage sections affected by this are (1) Masthead, (2) Donation section, (3) Other areas of Wikipedia, (4) Wikipedia's sister projects, and (5) Wikipedia languages The issue that needs to be resolved is whether truthful, whimsical text can be added to fixed mainpage text as part of the AFMP project. Approve means you approve adding text to the fixed mainpage text as part of the AFMP project. Disapprove means that you do not approve adding text to the fixed mainpage text as part of the AFMP project. Please provide your reasoning below with an <b>Approve</b>, <b>Disapprove</b>, or some other position. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 19:58, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Will wait on other comments</b></s> <b>Disapprove</b> - my Masthead addition seemed like a good idea, but on reviewing what I just wrote to propose this issue for discussion, allowing truthful, whimsical text to fixed mainpage text seems too open ended. You could end up with so many additions to the AFMP mainpage that the look and feel to the mainpage would change and the AFMP April fools intent would be lost. We could limit the addition to fixed mainpage text to one addition. <s>I would like to review the reasoning of others before posting my conclusion (vote).</s> -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 19:58, 20 January 2007 (UTC) OK, I'm convinced.

<dd>You seem to be under the impression that this matter is up for discussion. It isn't. Placing silly and/or degrading remarks on the main page is <b>vandalism</b>.

<dd>At present, there are no approved guidelines specific to AFMP. One editor telling another editor you cannot do this has not been sufficient to keep this page under control and seems to have driven away some of those who otherwise would have been willing to help with content. An objective of these consensuses is to develop consensus rules quickly that may be utilized to politely inform people that, although their idea is appreciated, it does not meet the AFMP rules approved by consensus. This should help us retain volunteers and keep this page under control so that we may better focus on AFMP content. More in particular to your post, limiting this vote to silly and/or degrading remark additions to fixed mainpage text still leaves open the question of non-silly and/or non-degarding remarks additions to fixed mainpage text. It is important that this consensus come to a decision that covers all possible situations, not just some. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 23:56, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't class it as such. "Vandalism is any addition, removal, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia" - <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL</a>. Altering the format of the main page is not intrinsically vandalism - adding, for example, "(even those without a sense of humor!)" would not be a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia. That isn't to say that such an alteration is a good idea, but surely this discussion (which seems to be heading for 'disapprove' in any case) can be had on a rational level, rather than reduced to labels? (WP:VANDAL: "If a user treats situations which are not clear vandalism as such, then it is he or she who is actually harming the encyclopedia by alienating or driving away potential editors".) <a href="../../../t/s/p/User%7ETSP_05ce.html" title="User:TSP">TSP</a> 04:04, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. I disagree. Adding a disparaging comment to the main page as a joke (a proposal that Jreferee has withdrawn) <i>is</i> "a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia." The problem is that some people (including sysops) believe that it's okay to compromise Wikipedia's integrity if the date happens to be 1 April, and they often cite the fact that we don't have a specific rule against April Fools' Day pranks. My point is that we need no such rule; vandalism is a policy violation on any date.</dd>
<dd>2. The passage regarding "alienating or driving away potential editors" refers to newcomer tests. Excepting 1 April 2006's anonymous edit (enabled by a sysop who decided that it would be funny to unprotect the main page), anyone capable of editing the page is an experienced user who should know better than to engage in such nonsense. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 04:43, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><small>SOME fixed text on the main page itself (like the you can edit message mentioned in the lead of this section) is not one of the 5 major thematic areas. Jreferee is trying to determine who or what group controls (or drives/determines consensus, however you care to put it) the fixed text specific to the main page. I support the effort to identify and document the main page fixed text things for the benefit of the AFMP 08 and beyond teams... I also support the apparent consensus that we not change any of the main page fixed text this year. (Steve B's note on political capital is spot on) I also urge helping Jreferee document this stuff if you know.

As I'm all too aware (because of my prominent involvement), it took months of nightmarish debate (with every minute detail analyzed, re-analyzed, and re-re-analyzed). This culminated in a similarly nightmarish 18-day poll/discussion with over 900 participants (and eventual consensus).

<dd><small>Thanks for the reminder! &lt;shudder&gt; I well understand how hard it would be to get special stuff put onto the front page for April 1st. In a rational world the nature of the change (subtle - hopefully) and the short duration and special occasion (one day - April 1st) ought to make this easy to do. The general public would of course see this as a 'normal' thing that websites do on April 1st and not use it to judge our standards for the other 364 days out of the year. Such upstanding organisations as <a href="../../../b/m/w/BMW_bcb4.html" title="BMW">BMW</a> and the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> have produced the most outrageous April Fools events in history - but many of our more boring members would see this as an unforgivable lowering of standards and would debate it into oblivion.

<dd><small>I agree - but also, the rule about only pulling pranks in the morning is only a part of the tradition in some countries. Here in the USA, the entire day is available. In the UK, the morning-only rule has not been much observed since maybe the 1970's. Add to that (as <a href="../../../t/s/p/User%7ETSP_05ce.html" title="User:TSP">TSP</a> points out) that Wikipedia is read all around the world - and we really have no hope of correctly observing this part of the tradition. Heck, a good proportion of the planet will see our efforts on completely the wrong day. Worse still, if we reverted to normal Wikipedia after 12 hours, everyone would have to prepare TWO front pages - and the poor folks who have their hard-fought-for front-page-featured-article/photo up on the front page for only 12 hours would be suitably aggrieved. Finally - technically, we aren't pulling any pranks. We're trying to make everything we do factually correct - so anyone who <b>thinks</b> we are pulling a prank is merely fooling themselves - that's the beauty of it.

<dd><small>In the above scope of the project, I listed that AFMP is from 00:00 to 23:59 on 1 April 2007 (UTC). However, this largely depends on how often the five departments change their section on the Main Page. Do they coordinate their changes and make them all at once or do they make them independent of each other? Is the Main Page set up in advance by the five departments to permit a bot to switch out the old Main Page at exactly 00:00 (UTC)? It would help this discussion to have an explanation of how often the five departments change their section on the Main Page, whether this effort is coordinated, and any other relevant information regarding Main Page timing. Thanks. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 18:23, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small><i>Today's featured article</i>, <i>Today's featured picture</i> and <i>On this day...</i> are prepared in advance and automatically change at 00:00 (UTC). <i>Did you know...</i> and <i>In the news</i> are not tied to specific dates; they're updated manually throughout the day.</small></dd>
<dd><small>For our purposes, we won't be able to contribute much to <i>In the news</i> (though we might be able to find a suitably noteworthy story to throw in), but we can easily set up a special <i>Did you know...</i> section that automatically appears at 00:00 (UTC) on 1 April and reverts to the standard transclusion at 00:00 (UTC) on 2 April. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 19:04, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>
