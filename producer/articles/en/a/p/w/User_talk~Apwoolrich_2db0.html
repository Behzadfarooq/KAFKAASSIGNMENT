I've been rewriting the article for awhile (I'm about halfway done) because I think the current one is a complete mess and doesn't at all talk about the development of the [i]study[/i] of the history of science. The text as it currently sits (I haven't had time to add to it systematically lately) is at <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_HST_dcc2.html" title="User:Fastfission/HST">User:Fastfission/HST</a>, if you have any edits/suggestions/comments they would be greatly appreciated! I know the development of the history of science as a field a lot better than I do the development of the history of technology, so I'm afraid I may miss some things that you might be able to give suggestions on. If you get the time and feel the inclination, of course! Thanks! --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 03:09, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi! Sorry this took a day to get back to you on. I think your ideas are good, and I'd be more than happy to add more details of the history of technology into the HST article. I think that it ought to be kept together with history of science in one big article, personally, only because that's how its academically usually packaged, and (as you know) because the line between history of technology and history of science can be so fuzzy. But I'm not wedded to the idea, and if a full-fledged history of technology article were to evolve at some point, that would be excellent as well. In the US, there is a lot of history of technology though it often gets done in STS programs (here I'm thinking of David Mindell at MIT, for example) and there aren't too many programs dedicated *only* to history of technology (Georgia Tech has one, but I don't know of too many others) -- usually history of science and technology are packaged together, again in part, I believe, because the line can be difficult to define especially when doing "externalist" history of science (as a case in point, I'm currently reading Peter Galison's book on Einstein, Poincare, and the coordination of telegraphic time; Galison is firmly known as a historian of science, physics to be precise, but the work covers the entire spectrum: history of science, history of technology, history of philosophy, history of physics, history of mathematics, etc. It's an excellent read, as well). Also, I think the Beckmann article is very good. I think there is a serious lack of HST topics on Wikipedia, and agree that the rest of the web is full of mostly twice-repeated junk on these topics, but that's what makes it a fun effort, yes? --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 16:27, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good to see that someone else thinks that <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> is a yawning chasm in Wikipedia. I started trying to work on the entry itself, but found that there was just no supporting material already out there that I could stitch together: I've now been sidetracked into remedying that first. I've created <a href="../../../i/n/d/Category%7EIndustrial_Revolution_f7af.html" title="Category:Industrial Revolution">Category:Industrial Revolution</a> into which I'm loading all the topics to be worked on. Please help! I'm also creating pretty much the same list on <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">User talk:Noisy</a> (which you can add to as well, if you feel the need&#160;;-) ). That list will also contain peripheral topics.</p>
<p>I notice that you mentioned conflicts over historical facts, somewhere. In the little bit of research on the web that I've done, I am starting to see that Arkwright and Hargreaves get trumpeted as having done things that they didn't, purely because they're more well known. I'll be relying on you to steer me clear of these <i>faux pas</i>. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">Noisy</a> 14:42, 8 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Tony, discussions on the village pump are removed at least every few days.

Since most of that discussion was focused on one user, I didn't think it would be appropriate to copy that anywhere.

<p>I knew I was taking a chance picking on the one statement.&#160;:-) I don't personally doubt that what you wrote is correct, but in the article it stood out as something a future less-knowledgeable editor might delete as "POV". Dunno if it's happened to you, I've been hit with it a number of times, one gets into an argument and you have to haul out your sources anyway. So published source citing is partly a defensive/preemptive measure to discourage bad edits. On the plus side, it also gives you the tools you need to stop the nutjobs from adding pet theories about Goodrich being in the Illuminati or whatever. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 18:55, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Looks much better. But I am questioning the term, or its importance. I have left a note on the talk page for this article. I would suggest we talk about which historians have used the term "Second Industrial Revolution" because it doesn't seem to have such general currency, and the dates would be different in many places in the world where there was industrialization. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 05:42, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

The main problem with the article is the complete lack of sources, particularly for the criticisms section.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m a historian working at the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University (<a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/" class="external free" title="http://chnm.gmu.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://chnm.gmu.edu/</a>) and as part of our project on the History of Science, Technology, and Industry we are very interested in digital historical works, including people writing history on Wikipedia. We’d like to talk to people about their experiences working on articles in Wikipedia, in connection with a larger project on the history of the free and open source software movement. Would you be willing to talk with us about your involvement, either by phone, a/v chat, IM, or email? This could be as lengthy or brief a conversation as you wish.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

<p>I have just created a proper article on the "<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_patent_law.html" title="History of patent law">History of patent law</a>". The early history of UK patent law could probably fit in this article. If you wish to improve the article, that would be excellent. I will try to gather what I know as well (and I will (proof-)read of course what you have written). Feel free to add sections to the article, this often helps to make things clearer. The section "history of patent law" in <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent.html" title="Patent">patent</a> should be summarized now I think.

<p>Thanks for your Firefox advice on Village Pump; even though I wasn't the one to ask the original question, I definately got some good ideas. I went to check for Firefox extensions and I found the greatest thing ever: an extension called OCD that automatically refreshes your browser window for you! Now I don't have to constantly whack the reload button on my watchlist. And it's all thanks to you! I hereby award you this <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html#For_Good_Students" title="User:Essjay">plenary indulgence</a>! <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 10:41, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're welcome! I always try to show my appreciation; I use the indulgence because 1) it's so very <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html#Professional_Qualifications" title="User:Essjay">Catholic</a>, and 2) nobody else uses it. I figure, who knows when I may do something stupid, I'd better build up support beforehand!</dd>

It is presently in the Causes section, and begins "From about 1100, the population of Europe rose, which is because there was recovery from the disorder in the early medieval times..." and runs to the end of the section.</p>
<p>It looks to me suspiciously like a school paper, stuffed, without a lot of thought, into the article. It could, I suppose, be salvaged, but this is really not my field. I thought perhaps you might see fit to clean it up, or just delete it again?</p>

<p>Hi Tony: Thanks for the vote of confidence. I think I would be better at copyediting than what the Wikisource project is doing, namely becuase, I don't have a scanner and I also don't have a copy of EB11 at home. I do have access to the handy edition at work. The type is small but manageable to read. I would be happy to help in other ways (see copyediting above). Let me know how you want to procede.

<p>I'd love to help with the 1911EB project. I've moved hundreds (it seems!) from the online OCR version to Wikipedia. However, I don't have a copy of the original. I could fix some obvious things, but I'd not be able to make it final without a copy or facsimile, because, as you saw with the "Viel-Castel" thing, some stuff is so tricky to identify. But yes, I love doing this kind of editing. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 20:37, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tony, thanks for the invite to join your efforts on Wikisource. I've just created an account there (as you already know&#160;;-) ), but I wouldn't rely on too much activity from me. My editing lately has been pretty much restricted to maintenance work here, and I'm afraid that I've let Wikipolitics suck me in, which is pretty depressing. I'll try and rekindle some enthusiasm to make some positive contributions soon.</p>
<p>I have two tasks sitting in the back of my mind, that you might have the answer to, or can point me in the right direction. One is to track down the birthplace of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Babbage_3810.html" title="Charles Babbage">Charles Babbage</a> (although even his biographers seem uncertain, from the comments I've seen so far). The second (and perhaps something which has a more definite answer) is to find out what is the difference between a tilt hammer and a trip hammer. I did some hunting a while back, and there does seem to be a difference because some foundries are documented as having both, but I couldn't discern a clear definition. In my mind, it started to seem that a trip hammer was in constant operation, whereas a tilt hammer was 'on demand'. Any interest?</p>
<p>Finally, an apology. You left a message on my talk page some time ago regarding looking at the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> article after some changes that you made, and I failed to respond. I treat the internet in quite a different way than I treat interactions in real life, so I'm sure I come over as quite rude on occasion. Hope you didn't take offence.

<dd>I have added the same formatting to the text on the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatrice_Warde_d344.html" title="Beatrice Warde">Beatrice Warde</a> page -- please let me know if it displays all right on your end. (I know Internet Explorer displays it in an ugly sans-serif font instead of that lovely Perpetua; I'm looking for an answer to that.) I'll be happy to implement any changes you might suggest.</dd>

<p>I am glad that my essay at an essay led to an improvement for Wikipedia; Beatrice and her contemporaries were definitely deserving of coverage! The article is really looking good now.</p>
<p>As for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Taylor_7cd9.html" title="John Taylor">John Taylor</a>, I just set out to write an article for <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigel_John_Taylor_bc92.html" title="Nigel John Taylor">John Taylor</a> of Duran Duran, on my second day here. (I got hooked on Wikipedia because I know a lot about Duran and the article here was pretty skimpy then.) I knew there was a <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Taylor_%28jazz%29_d175.html" title="John Taylor (jazz)">jazz musician</a>, whose discography sometimes got mixed up with Duran's Taylor on various sites, so I looked around the help pages, learned the word "disambiguation", and created a page with two names on it. When some other people added names to the list, it occurred to me to do a thorough search of Wikipedia, and I found many more JTs that I added to the disambiguation page. Many of their articles were substandard, even by 2003 WP standards, so I began doing research improving them. In doing research in various sources, I found even more John Taylors who ought to have articles.</p>
<p>So trying to improve this one little corner of Wikipedia, I have now learned about <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Taylor_%28poet%29_72ea.html" title="John Taylor (poet)">17th century poets and the Thames watermen's guild</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Taylor_%281781-1864%29_3b52.html" title="John Taylor (1781-1864)">pseudoscience and the pyramids</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Taylor%2C_VC_5c7c.html" title="John Taylor, VC">bravery under fire</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnnie_Taylor_cb6b.html" title="Johnnie Taylor">underappreciated musicians</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Taylor_of_Caroline_75f3.html" title="John Taylor of Caroline">important scholars</a>, many politicians and preachers, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Taylor_%281808-1887%29_5374.html" title="John Taylor (1808-1887)">The Mormon Church</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Taylor_%28baseball_player%29_ec30.html" title="Jack Taylor (baseball player)">early baseball history</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Edward_Taylor_d357.html" title="John Edward Taylor">The Grauniad</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Taylor_%28Taylor_Ham%29_3248.html" title="John Taylor (Taylor Ham)">pork byproduct</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Taylor_%28Velocette%29_382f.html" title="John Taylor (Velocette)">Velocette motorcycles</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Albert_Taylor_8480.html" title="John Albert Taylor">murder</a>, not to mention a zillion different things about how Wikipedia works. So, in short, John Taylor has been very good to me!</p>
<p>But please, by all means, add another to the list..... &#160;:) — <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineMunro_0200.html" title="User:CatherineMunro">Catherine</a>\<sup><a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECatherineMunro_06c5.html" title="User talk:CatherineMunro">talk</a></sup> 20:47, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
