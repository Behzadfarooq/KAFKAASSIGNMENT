<dd><b>Rebuttal</b> Simply posting someone's name on the VIP page does not "document" him a vandal. I could easily put your name on there and later claim you are a "documented" vandal, after all. I'm sure the evaluation of my entire corpus of contributions will show that they are, on the whole, more helpful than harmful, a few minor indiscretions aside, for which I have apologised. And my German grammar is <i>Ausgezeichnit,</i> thank you!SamuraiBoywithaDrugProblem 05:47, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Rebuttal'</b> It is obvious Casito is too biased to be the arbiter of who's contributions are worthwhile and what is vandalism. Just look at what he said about his over-zealous and stifling over-reactions on HIS OWN TALK PAGE: "I realize that it would be in the best interest of both Wikipedia and my sanity if I stay away from Recent Changes and similar pages which put me in the office of Wiki-cop. Without fail, I eventually get upset and bite the newcomers. The previous talk messages should reinforce that point. Furthermore, RC tends to stress me out and I would rather play it cool. I have decided that, at least for now, I'm not the best person to police recent changes and I could be much, much more constructive working in other areas." Now, in the legal world, we call that a "party admission," and hardly the type of person you'd want policing what is supposed to be an open arena of ideas.SamuraiBoywithaDrugProblem 06:03, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Rebuttal</b> First, I don't pretend to be an arbiter, I am simply documenting all of your misdeeds; think of me as more of a procurator. Second, the comment on my talk page is not relevent, since it refers to my actions on <a href="../../../r/c/_/WP%7ERC_d77e.html" title="WP:RC">WP:RC</a>, not <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a> or <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a>. I never found any of your crap by using RC, I ran across <i>it in the wild</i>. Furthermore, you are not a nai-ive newcommer, but rather an established troll. Also, my admision shows that I recognize my "over-zealous-ness" and that I conceded to more experieced users who I knew were correct. The opposite could be said of you. Finally, considering your "interpretation" of copyright law at <a href="../../../a/i/n/Ainu_people.html" title="Ainu people">Ainu people</a>, I doubt anyone here believes your insights into the legal world. -<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasito_3c90.html" title="User:Casito">Casito</a>⇝<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECasito_0bf9.html" title="User talk:Casito">Talk</a> 18:39, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Rebuttal</b>. Actually, I was temporarily blocked for "sock puppetry," not vandalism, and I can have my account reinstated whenever I want. I just have to notify an administrator which account I want to keep. So I'm not "banned," and about what, my boy, did I ever lie? You seriously need to chill out, brah.SamuraiBoywithaDrugProblem 06:07, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>:You are a vandal; your whole history is only vandalism. You are banned; you cannot have your account reinstated.

<dd><b>Rebuttal</b>. You are obviously of narrow mind, perhaps angry at some unspecified longings in your subconsience. Just because someone else propounds views contrary to yours does not make him a "vandal." And say what you will about my methods, it is obvious that I started a quite positive development on this article, namely, calling attention to the outdated and racist banality of the piece so that all our friends on Wikipedia can begin to improve it.SamuraiBoywithaDrugProblem 15:53, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> You have an unusual editing history for someone concerned about racist attitudes toward the Ainu, having repeatedly inserted a line about the "inherently superior culture" of ethnic Japanese into the article. If you wish to reform your vandalism, this is not the way to do it; but we are, and I am, open to reformed vandals. If you change your "methods" you can still become a fully respected member of the Wikipedia community. BTW, I notice it has been a while since you last made the ridiculous claim about "international thievery", that we are violating copyright on a 1911 publication. Have we at least moved beyond that now?--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 16:23, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b>. You seem to be quite a bit more civilised and reasonable than that bloody Casito fellow, who most recently implied the threat of an Interpol sting operation in response to my enlightened editing. As far as the copyright issue goes, copyright law is statutory in nature, and not common law (another thing Casito bolloxed up), and I would have to do some research on the issue and get back to you. It would simply be malpractice to render an opinion straightaway without doing the proper reflection, after all. God forbid a nice young man such as yourself might rely upon my snap judgment and wind up getting yourself sued or something horrible like that. Keep up the good work!

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Pharos, my friend, your fellow user Casito has persisted in making legal threats against me in violation of Wikipedia policy. Please see his talk page. I have taken your offer to heart and have only made constructive edits as of late, and I would appreciate it if you would tell this cloying Casito fellow to lay off. I think an apology might be needed as well.<a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainbowwarrior1977_bac3.html" title="User:Rainbowwarrior1977">Rainbowwarrior1977</a> 03:39, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Casito has made legal threats against you? Perhaps he told you this meeting you on the street, because all he said on Wikipedia was "Website defacement is a crime in many countries", so I cannot intervene on your behalf here. Perhaps instead you should complain to the Rt. Hon Sir Henry Swindon-Cocksburn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cathy_Cox&amp;diff=19058238&amp;oldid=19056688" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cathy_Cox&amp;diff=19058238&amp;oldid=19056688" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<ul>
<li>You don't get a vote. And apparently you don't understand how deletion works here. If we delete this article, we are saying that the Ainu people should not have an article, period, which is a decision we could not override without a successful vote for undeletion.

<ul>
<li>Actually that is not correct. If an article is validly deleted, a different article on the same topic and under the same title can indeed be created, unless the article is protected in a deleted state, which typically only happens if there is a persistant attempt to recreate the article as it was prior to deletion.<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 08:45, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>There are cases in which that could be the case, for instance if I wrote an article called "Ainu people" that had little to nothing to do with the Ainu, but if the only issue is a POV complaint, then the content is going to be roughly the same, since both versions would about the Ainu. If this was deleted and someone wanted to start over they'd have to go through VfU, plain and simple.

<li><b>Comment</b>. That being said, we should STRIKE Everyking's comments as misleading and prejudicial, for he gave a procedurally incorrect and perhaps dishonest reason to vote to "keep." It is clear that you CAN vote to delete and STILL have a future, better, less racist article on the Ainu People. Therefore, vote early and often for **Delete!**15:53, 18 July 2005 (UTC) <small>(Posted by SamuraiBoywithaDrugProblem who has already voted, and who's edit history is limited to articles that Musachachado has vandalized )</small>
<ul>
<li>No you can't. We delete articles based on a judgment that they are unencyclopedic. You vote based on whether an article on the Ainu is encyclopedic. You mostly definitely <i>do not</i> vote based on a POV complaint you have, unless you feel the entire notion of having an article on a certain topic is POV. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:16, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. Could do with some minor cleanup but this is an encyclopedia topic. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesBurns_5f2a.html" title="User:JamesBurns">JamesBurns</a> 03:16, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Note: I've begun a <b>cleanup</b> on the article to try to fix at least the most egregiously wrong parts of it. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 03:18, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It certainly needs some updating, but so do many articles. Unwarranted nomination. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChamdarae_de35.html" title="User:Chamdarae">Chamdarae</a> 21:30, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Why is this VfD still open? It was clearly not a valid VfD candidate. Move this page's contents to <a href="../../../a/i/n/Talk%7EAinu_people_cacf.html" title="Talk:Ainu people">Talk:Ainu people</a> and let's move on. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 23:38, July 19, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree. This article was clearly nominated in bad faith. Furthermore, this page has strayed too far from its purpose of deciding whether to keep the article. Unless someone can offer a good reason why it should stay here, I will move it to a sub-page in the <a href="../../../a/i/n/Talk%7EAinu_people_cacf.html" title="Talk:Ainu people">Talk:Ainu_people</a> namspace tomorrow. -<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasito_3c90.html" title="User:Casito">Casito</a>⇝<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECasito_0bf9.html" title="User talk:Casito">Talk</a> 00:23, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
