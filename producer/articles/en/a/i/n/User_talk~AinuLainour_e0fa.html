	    <p>A tag has been placed on Canadian team, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable</a>, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add <code>{{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}}</code> on the top of the page and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.</p>

If you read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> you will find that this also should not be things like the groups website, it should be only major articles such as a national newspaper that show this. Have a look at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_criteria_219a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability criteria">Wikipedia:Notability criteria</a>, the group totally fails this and specifcally fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations%29_0596.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)">Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)</a>.

This is a team heavily involved with Games Workshop activities such as Golden Demon, so you may look that up. You must realize that this kind of group isn't going to be well-known, it will only be well-known within figure painting. It deserves a page.</i></p>
<p><i>I'll explain a few things, wikipedia has rules and guidlines that must be followed for creating new pages. I've already directed you to the links that show notability on wikipedia and I quote you "You must realize that this kind of group isn't going to be well-known" - you admit yourself that it is never going to be well known - therefore it fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>.

<p>That just proves what you know about the subject and my point! That is most certainly NOT miniature painting! Miniature painting is figure painting, and this group is an organization that is competitive, helpful, and it is also for awareness. I think that it is something if you're deleting an article that you know nothing about.</p>
<p>Just because it is not mainstream does not mean it doesn't deserve an article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>figure painting can be found <a href="../../../f/i/g/Figure_painting.html" title="Figure painting">here</a>, again your group does not need an article to bring knowledge to the subject, it already appears on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. You state that the group "is competitive, helpful, and it is also for awareness," however this does not make any difference - it does not make them notable!!

<p>I apprecciate you trying to find the correct Wiki, but once again you're wrong (thought this time you typed my words in, which is alright. That's just not the type of miniature painting. Try "Model Painting"). If you clicked at least one of the links in the article (thus taking the time to review what has been written, what it means, and what the article is actually about) you would have a deeper understanding.</p>
<p>Anyways, this is not the point. I will try to find a 'notable source' but can't garauntee you anything just yet.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Recreate the article in the following space: User:AinuLainour/Canadian team (at present there isn't an article there). This will not get deleted as it is in your userspace. You need to get some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> in though to show <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>.
