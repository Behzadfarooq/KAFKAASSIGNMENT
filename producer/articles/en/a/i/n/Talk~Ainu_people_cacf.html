<p>What is all that nonsense at the beginning of the article? It apparently is (1) trying to explain (poorly) what is a Mongoloid and (2) to suggest that somehow Japanese and Ainus are more Mongoloid than Han Chinese or Koreans.

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, this article, its tone set by work nearly 100 years old, is so far below the standard Wikipedia article I was startled. The pre-genetic-era racial classifications alone are extraordinary.</p>
<p>I fear that Japanese contributors turning here will be shocked, and will distrust Wikipedia afterward. Imagine a Westerner picking up a Japanese encyclopedia, deciding to check it by looking up "African Americans," say, and finding entries written in 1911, reflecting racial understanding then!</p>
<p>I hope scholars in Japan will completely rework this. I'll try to interest my department's Japanese scholars in revamping this. I certainly don't know enough. This advanced topic needs someone who knows not only ethnic cultures of Japan and Japanese politics, but also the latest genetic findings. Best wishes.</p>

<dd>The estimations given for Ainu population and especially for the number of Ainu speakers are apparently out of date. Ainu is NOT spoken any more. I have myself talked to a linguist who worked on Ainu grammar in the 1990ies. His only informant was an old woman in her eighties, bound to bed in a hospital with a dozen of linguists and anthropologists swarming around her. And her command of the language was actually somewhat limited. Ethnologue.com states 15 active speakers at 1996. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDmitry_Gerasimov_8c88.html" title="User:Dmitry Gerasimov">Dmitry Gerasimov</a> (<a href="../../../d/m/i/User_talk%7EDmitry_Gerasimov_c9d1.html" title="User talk:Dmitry Gerasimov">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmitry_Gerasimov_a82e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmitry Gerasimov">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>I'm not sure what section this would go in, but a Japanese friend and I were discussing the etymology of the word "Ainu".

<dd>In 1865, an English naturalist and his staff stole Ainu people's bones at 13 graveyards in Otoshibe, Hokkaido for his anthropological study. The bones went back home two years later. However, this is a rare case; many Japanese and Westerners, most notably KODAMA Sakuzaemon, stole buried bones and items later.

<dd>Why can't you people get over this stupid habit of classifying every ethnic group as either "Caucasoid," "Mongoloid," "Negroid," or whatever? It's really ridiculous, especially when considering an ethnic group that, like the Ainu, has an extremely long history of isolated evolution. The Ainu are a Paleolithic branch (i.e., they branched off from some mainland Eurasian population prior to the Neolithic revolution and the coalescence of modern "racial" groups) off of a (probably) Central Asian population related to many of the ancestors of modern <a href="../../../t/a/j/Tajiks.html" title="Tajiks">Tajiks</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibetan_people.html" title="Tibetan people">Tibetans</a>, and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turkic peoples</a>. If you look at any photograph of a group of Tajiks, Tibetans, or <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karachay.html" title="Karachay">Karachay</a> Turks, for instance, you can see a strong resemblance with the modern Ainu people; genetic studies also suggest that the morphological similarity between the Ainu and these (generally southerly) Central Asian peoples is more than just a coincidence.</dd>

<dd>As for the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_people.html" title="Japanese people">Japanese</a> proper, they clearly have a multi-layered ancestry, with the oldest major genetic contribution being provided by the Ainu or people very closely related to (most of) the ancestors of the Ainu.

<dd>Yes, that was me on the Tupac Amaru II page who started the debate over whether make mention that Tupac Shakur's name was in honor of Amaru. You might have though that was 'trolling' at first glance, but in effect, my contributions DID lead to a productive expansion of the article, and now not only Tupac Shakur is mentioned, but Amaru's inspiration of many leftist/indigineous causes is included in the article, and rightfully so. Just because you might not agree with someone does not make him a "vandal." This article in question is almost 100 years old and a lazy, uninspired word-for-word copy nonetheless. We need to fix it. You don't want some middle school kid to come to Wikipedia to look up "Ainu" and come away with a slanted, dated, Edwardian racist view of the topic I take it? This is a place of debate, not an antiquarian society. Thank you. Musachachado 15:52, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The Ainu people are neither Mongoloid nor Caucasoid: they comprise their own morphological and genetical group, which is often eponymously titled "Ainoid." The Ainu genepool has been mostly isolated from other human populations since the Paleolithic era; thus, they have not had the chance to be the source or recipient of significant gene flow since a time prior to the formation of the macro-populations partially inbred according to geographical proximity (i.e., "races") that are generally recognized in the world today, i.e. Negroid (better called "Africoid," because it originally formed due to inbreeding within the African landmass), Caucasoid (better called "Western Eurasoid"), Australoid (better called "Paleolithic Oceanoid," which is an ancient branch off of proto-Eurasoid-Americanoid-Australoid), Mongoloid ("Eastern Eurasoid," a branch off of proto-Eurasoid, probably with some admixture with older branches from the proto-Eurasoid-Americanoid stem, such as the Ainu), and Americanoid (a distinctive branch off of proto-Eurasoid-Americanoid). The Ainoid race is just as distinctive as any of these other "races," although it displays certain affinities (mostly cranial) to the Caucasoid race and other affinities (mostly post-cranial) to the Americanoid and Mongoloid races. To put it in laymen's terms, the Ainu are simply "the Ainu" and they don't belong to any other people's "racial group," but their heads and faces tend to be relatively similar to the Caucasoids (Western Eurasians) and their body shapes tend to be relatively similar to the Americanoids (Native Americans) and Mongoloids (Eastern Eurasians). They appear to descend mostly from a very ancient Paleolithic branch of proto-Eurasoid-Americanoid peoples. The only ethnic groups with which the Ainu share any significant amount of recent ancestry are the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_people.html" title="Japanese people">Japanese</a> (including the <a href="../../../r/y/%C5%AB/Ry%C5%ABky%C5%ABans.html" title="Ryūkyūans">Ryūkyūans</a>) and the <a href="../../../n/i/v/Nivkhs.html" title="Nivkhs">Nivkhs</a>. As an aside, it can be noted that the inhabitants of the Japanese Archipelago, including the Ainu, Japanese, and Ryūkyūans, display certain odd genetic archaicisms that appear to descend directly from Paleolithic African "proto-humans." Thus, for example, the Japanese display some proteins and other genetic, immunological, and morphological characteristics that are absent from all extra-African populations except the populations of the Japanese Archipelago. They are definitely <i>not</i> just another version of East Asian Mongoloids, although the Japanese and the Ryukyuans, at least, do appear to share some recent ancestry with certain East Asian ethnic groups. <a href="../../../e/b/i/User%7EEbizur_aeba.html" title="User:Ebizur">Ebizur</a> 19:31, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, it may sound like vandalism, but traditionally, some Ainu women got clitoral tatoos as a rite of passage IIRC. There're quite a few sources for this. I don't know that you can find pictures of Ainu clitoral tatoos, but you can certainly find photos of facial tatoos on Ainu women -- it looks a lot like a mustache, and you have to read a lot about the Ainu before you get used to it. I'm not sure how many living Ainu women have traditional tatoos _at all_, but I know that somebody of the age of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shigeru_Kayano_b721.html" title="Shigeru Kayano">Shigeru Kayano</a> most likely wouldn't have them... I believe they were outlawed at one time or another. They're no longer illegal, I don't believe, but it doesn't seem to me that Ainu women are rushing to get tatoos -- Japanese society has told them that it's ugly, contrary to the more traditional Ainu concept of beauty, and even the most independentist and traditionalist of young Ainu are hugely influenced by mainstream Japanese society and would probably be repulsed by facial or clitoral tatoos, or at least not want to have them on themselves. As a side note, it was traditionally the grandmother who did the tatooing, and it was over a long period of time, bit by bit (not in one sitting!). In Japanese society, clitoral tatoos are already sort of freaky, but if you add the idea of them being done by old ladies (<a href="../../../o/t/a/Otaku.html" title="Otaku">Otakunese</a>: <i>obaasan</i>), people would be absolutely revolted. --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 08:00, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It somewhat depends on your point of view. The Japanese had contact and trade relationships with a people known as the Emishi, the forefathers of the Ainu, as early as 300 AD. However, they weren't viewed precisely as an entirely different race, but as a more barbaric Japanese group. It was in the Heian period (794 - 1185) that a particular Emishi group was identified, the Watarishima Emishi, which had what later on was described as typical Ainu cultural features. At the end of the 12th century, the Japanese had eliminated or pushed back all the Emishi groups into the north of Honshu and to Hokkaido. At this time, the Japanese began calling the remaining Emishi, Ezo. This name was also a shortened use of a word (Ezogashima)to describe "barbarian lands" in the north, such as Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kurils. By the 15th century, the people known as the Ainu today, claimed most of this territory as their homeland and bloodily repulsed initial Japanese attempts to control southern Hokkaido. Perhaps I'll attempt to add some to the article in a bit later. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelAt_3723.html" title="User:RebelAt">RebelAt</a> 16:04, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Looking at old photographs of Ainus, they look a lot more similar to depigmented Australian aborigines and Papuan than any other people. Ainu today may be a genetic mix of the first Ainus and mongoloid Japanese (heavily in favour of the Mongoloid) but the first Ainus were Australoids rather than Caucasoids or Mongoloids.</p>

<p>Well, they certainly do not look East Asian on this picture: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:AinuGroup.JPG" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:AinuGroup.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:AinuGroup.JPG</a> Some of these faces could be seen in any city in Europe.

<p>I can tell they are east asian in that pic; perhaps you expect asians to always have over-exaggerated asian features? i've met some ainu people, and they look no diff. from japanese or siberian people to me. <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Anh-Huy_5e6c.html" title="User:Le Anh-Huy">Le Anh-Huy</a> 21:34, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The culture section of the article is a constant back-and-forth of present and past tenses. Not knowing enough about the Ainu to know how many of these cultural aspects are still practiced or observed, I thought I'd leave a note rather than trying to edit it myself. The way it reads now is slightly awkward; unless it truly represents the current state of things, it could benefit from a bit of consistency.

<p>--- "Han expansion"? That's pretty dumb. "Han" is a cultural label, it's not some kind of racial designation.</p>

<p>I've read before that Chinese used to call the inhabitants of Japan 'dwarf barbarians', barbarian being the usual translation for the word they used for foreigners.</p>
<p>Now, in Mandarin, that sounds like 'ai nu', 'ai' being short, 'nu' being dwarf/slave.</p>
<p>Is this just a coincidence? I do not think the chinese spoken centuries ago would sound much like mandarin. and I do not know if the pronounciation for 'short dwarf' is similiar to 'ainu'. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.126.164.65_4b6e.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.126.164.65">71.126.164.65</a> (talk) 07:30, 26 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
