<p><b>Ainscough</b> (Ayscough/<a href="../../../a/s/k/Askew.html" title="Askew">Askew</a>/Ascough) - a Catholic family with origins in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincolnshire.html" title="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, where, as Ayscough, they owned estates around <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stallingborough.html" title="Stallingborough">Stallingborough</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedale.html" title="Bedale">Bedale</a>. <a href="../../../a/y/s/Ayscoughfee_Hall_c45b.html" title="Ayscoughfee Hall">Ayscoughfee Hall</a> was a manor house reputed to have belonged to the family in the early part of the 16th Century. In the 15th Century the Ayscoughs had supported the Lancastrian side during the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_the_Roses_8104.html" title="Wars of the Roses">Wars of the Roses</a> and later held posts at the Courts of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VII_4982.html" title="Henry VII">Henry VII</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_1afb.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a>. Sir William Ayscough of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stallingborough.html" title="Stallingborough">Stallingborough</a> was knighted in 1513 during the reign of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_1afb.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a>, his son Edward Ayscough was cup-bearer to <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_1afb.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a>, another son Sir Francis Ayscough was knighted "at the wining of <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boulogne.html" title="Boulogne">Boulogne</a>" and was Sheriff of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln%2C_Lincolnshire_34d3.html" title="Lincoln, Lincolnshire">Lincoln</a> in 1545, 1549 and 1554. He is buried at St Mary's Church, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Kelsey_7253.html" title="South Kelsey">South Kelsey</a>, Lincolnshire. <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Askew_d8f2.html" title="Anne Askew">Anne Askew</a> (Ayscough) Kyme (1521-1546), the English Protestant and persecuted heretic was also the daughter of Sir William and sister to Sir Edward and Sir Francis. Sir <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> is also from this family line, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannah_Ayscough_e5aa.html" title="Hannah Ayscough">Hannah Ayscough</a> being his mother and James Ascough born 1585, <a href="../../../o/r/m/Ormskirk.html" title="Ormskirk">Ormskirk</a>, Lancashire, his grandfather. It is speculated that James' father was John Ayscough b.1565, son of William Ayscough b.1542, son of Sir Francis Ayscough b: ABT 1509 of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Kelsey_7253.html" title="South Kelsey">South Kelsey</a>, Lincolnshire and Elizabeth Dighton b: ABT 1513 of Shurton.</p>
<p>The family participated in the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincolnshire_Rising_cd1a.html" title="Lincolnshire Rising">Lincolnshire Rising</a> in 1536, a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> uprising against <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_1afb.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a> of England, against the dissolution of the monasteries. Following this they lost their estates, and migrated west to <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, where they settled in the area around Mawdesley, near <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croston.html" title="Croston">Croston</a>, bleak wastes in the 16thC, as Farmers and Millers. Branches of the family developed around <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackrod.html" title="Blackrod">Blackrod</a>, and by the 19thC, across <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. As industrialisation came to Lancashire, the women taking work in Cotton Mills and the men on the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railways.html" title="Railways">railways</a>, particularly the <a href="../../../l/%26/y/L%26YR_e18f.html" title="L&amp;YR">L&amp;YR</a> and the <a href="../../../l/m/s/LMS_66a8.html" title="LMS">LMS</a>.</p>
<p>The Catholic tradition was maintained during the 300 years till religious tolerence eased in the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteenth_century.html" title="Nineteenth century">nineteenth century</a>, members of the family being charged with <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recusancy.html" title="Recusancy">recusancy</a>, as recorded in "Return of the Papists". Many became priests, most prominently Anthony Ainscough, Prior of <a href="../../../a/m/p/Ampleforth_College_20d9.html" title="Ampleforth College">Ampleforth College</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006 several Ainscoughs featured in the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_Times_Rich_List_a472.html" title="Sunday Times Rich List">Sunday Times Rich List</a>.</p>
<p>Name variations include, as identified in Reaney's Dictionary of British Surnames: Ainscough, Ayscough, Ascough, Askew, Anscow, Askow, Ascow, Ascoe, Arscow Anescoe Aniscoe Anscow Ascoughe Aynstowe Askoes Asckoe Askoe Askowes Aynscow, Ainscowe and probably many mor, though it must be remembered that bearers of these names are not all necessarily descended from the family. Early records come from the Churches of <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croston.html" title="Croston">Croston</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/m/Ormskirk.html" title="Ormskirk">Ormskirk</a> and Standish in <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. It is thought that the name is derived from the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Norse_language_82eb.html" title="Old Norse language">Norse</a> words "ask skog". The o is pronouced as oo (food) even now in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>—thus Askoog, <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_English_fee1.html" title="Old English">Old English</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Norse_cc89.html" title="Old Norse">Old Norse</a>) meaning <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ash_tree.html" title="Ash tree">ash tree</a> / forest. Although other sources suggest that Aiskew is a corruption of the words "Eiki Skogr" translating to <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oak.html" title="Oak">Oak</a> Wood. In Medieval English the name was pronounced - Akeskeugh.</p>

<p><b>Lancashire Ainscoughs</b></p>
<p>Whether the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> Ainscoughs had their origins solely in the migration of members of a particular family from <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincolnshire.html" title="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, as the main article asserts, is an interesting debate. Some genealogical sources give the English-Scottish borders as the origin of the family, others claim <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> as the source. Given the various theories on the derivation of the name, it is possible that there were other, independent lineages with the same surname, and that Ainscoughs may have existed in <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> prior to the migration from <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincolnshire.html" title="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>. Ralph Ainscough (b.1899 in <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horwich.html" title="Horwich">Horwich</a>) recorded his grandfather Ralph (b.1841 in <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspull.html" title="Aspull">Aspull</a>) telling him that older generations of the Ainscoughs - e.g. William (b.1816 in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackrod.html" title="Blackrod">Blackrod</a>) had pronounced the name as “Ainsker”. There is some documentary evidence for this as William’s younger brother Charles (b.1818 in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackrod.html" title="Blackrod">Blackrod</a>) gave his name as “Insker” on moving to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staffordshire.html" title="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> in the 1840s. Some <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> names acquired an internal “n” when crossing the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennines.html" title="Pennines">Pennines</a> into <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. “Ainsker” may well have originated as “Aisker” - which is not far removed from the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_English_language_2d72.html" title="Old English language">Anglo-Saxon</a> “Aiks keogh” or oak wood. Given the common nature of places as surname origins, it is possible that there was more than one distinct line with the same surname.</p>
<p>Evidence of origin from the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Genealogical_Index_de37.html" title="International Genealogical Index">International Genealogical Index</a> (IGI) is mixed and inconclusive. The IGI itself is a valuable but flawed resource. The current online database - which I shall term “IGI 2” - contains records contributed by members of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_ff27.html" title="Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS), many of which are questionable. The original pass through Britain’s parish records by LDS members was free of personal contributions and was available on microfiches in such centres as the library of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Genealogists_7d5e.html" title="Society of Genealogists">Society of Genealogists</a>. I shall term this database “IGI 1”. This original database excluded many <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> records, owing to the reluctance of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> priests to allow their records being transcribed by the LDS. It also failed to record some <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nonconformist_register.html" title="Nonconformist register">nonconformist register</a> entries. Given these caveats, an examination of the 1,623 records of Ainscoughs in <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> in the original IGI 1 shows that the earliest recorded event was the christening of Thomas Ainscough - son of John - on 27th April 1549 in <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chorley.html" title="Chorley">Chorley</a>. The next was the marriage of Kateryn Aynscow to John Brindill (Katherine Ainscough &amp; John Brindle) on 17th January 1550 in the parish of <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chorley.html" title="Chorley">Chorley</a>. In the same year, on the 20th January and in the same parish, Richard Aynscow married “Jone Leeds”. John, Katherine and Richard may have been siblings and quite possibly were born in the 1520s. The records in IGI 1 are drawn almost exclusively from <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> records, but these three Ainscoughs may well have come from the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincolnshire.html" title="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> connection.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> or otherwise of the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> Ainscoughs in general is also open to speculation. Prior to the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a>, of course, all <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English people</a> were <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> by default. It seems clear that, while the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincolnshire.html" title="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>-based line maintained its <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> through the turbulent <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_period.html" title="Tudor period">Tudor</a> religious periods and beyond, many other lines did not. Many Ainscoughs, for example, were baptised in the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> churches of St. Katherine in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackrod.html" title="Blackrod">Blackrod</a>, and St. Peter in <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolton-le-Moors_a4f5.html" title="Bolton-le-Moors">Bolton-le-Moors</a> (now modern <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolton.html" title="Bolton">Bolton</a>). <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan.html" title="Wesleyan">Wesleyan</a> <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodism</a> also appealed to many working-class people in the mid-19th century, who saw the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_church.html" title="Anglican church">Anglican church</a> as a bastion of the upper, ruling class, and there were <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan.html" title="Wesleyan">Wesleyan</a> chapels in many towns - such as <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chorley.html" title="Chorley">Chorley</a> - in <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> - where Ainscoughs were married.</p>
<p>In the early 1800s, most male - and some female - Ainscoughs in the villages of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackrod.html" title="Blackrod">Blackrod</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haigh.html" title="Haigh">Haigh</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspull.html" title="Aspull">Aspull</a> were <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal_miners.html" title="Coal miners">coal miners</a>. They started as drawers, pulling coal carts, at the age of ten (until this was stopped by legislation), graduating to miners at around the age of sixteen. The area was rich in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannel_coal.html" title="Cannel coal">cannel coal</a>, a high-grade, rich but volatile coal, and many mines were on the estate of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Crawford_3cfa.html" title="Earl of Crawford">Earl of Crawford</a> and Balcarres who lived at <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haigh.html" title="Haigh">Haigh</a> Hall. All but one of the five sons of Ralph (b.1782 in Blackrod) were miners - and nearly all male descendants of these Ainscoughs were also miners, as censuses from 1841 to 1901 attest. In the 1850s and 1860s, some of the Ainscough miners moved further afield to <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westhoughton.html" title="Westhoughton">Westhoughton</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pemberton.html" title="Pemberton">Pemberton</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindley.html" title="Hindley">Hindley</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/c/Ince.html" title="Ince">Ince</a>, with some members of their families going into the silk and cotton weaving industries.</p>
