<p>tr.v. con·sum·mat·ed, con·sum·mat·ing, con·sum·mates</p>
<pre>
  1.
        <b>1. To bring to completion or fruition; conclude: consummate a business transaction.</b>
        2. To realize or achieve; fulfill: a dream that was finally consummated with the publication of her first book.
  2.
        <b>1. To complete (a marriage) with the first act of sexual intercourse after the ceremony.</b>
        2. To fulfill (a sexual desire or attraction) especially by intercourse.
</pre>
<p><br />
These are two possible meaning for the word consummated. Almost everyone thinks it's about sex. Consumated can aslo mean complete. Remember in early days of Arabia. A women was a tool. If a family got a daugther when they wanted a son they could bury her alive but doing that for a son was considered murder. Alot of people the Prohpet(PBUH) married were widowers who lost their husbands mostly from the battles. He married alot of them but he didn't have sex with all of them. Frankly this issue with Aisha is over blown by Anti-Islamists who look for reasons to discredit Islam.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Almost everyone thinks it's about sex."</i> If this is a misunderstanding, it could quite possibly be easily cleared up by going back to the original texts. The double meaning of the English word is not likely to exist also in the arabic word.</dd>

<p>a Sugestion:</p>
<p>no more of the honey. For this, the Prophet is addresed in a revelation with the rethorical question "why do you prohibit yourself" and answered in the same verse with "it is to please your wives, whatever had been made lawful by Allah was his to eat". Later (Qur'an 66:1). The viwes are then rebuked rebuked and warned in the folowing verses as "your hearts are inclined (to oppose him)"</p>

<p>I have rewritten Striver's version. The article still needs some work. It's now quite long, and there's too much verbatim quoting of hadith. I hope that Striver will accept my rewrite as a faithful representation of the Shia viewpoint, even if not as long and detailed as his. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:23, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thx for you time. May i propose to make a second version of the diffrent subjects att the end of the article where i can add all the details i want? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 23:34, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, no. You can't add all the details you want. Or if you do, I'll trim them. Articles should be short, readable and NPOV. If you want complete control over an article about Aisha, you should write it and put it up on your own web page. If it's good enough, we'll link to it &lt;g&gt;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is also possible to write what are called "breakout" articles. If one particular issue threatens to take over an article, it can be given its own page. <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad%27s_marriages.html" title="Muhammad's marriages">Muhammad's marriages</a> were given just such treatment, as it would have swamped the main <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> biographical article. I don't think there's any issue relating to Aisha that deserves its own article, however.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As you seem to be quite interested in the early history of Islam, up through the Abbasids, you might want to look over the Wikipedia pages on these topics and make sure that the Shia viewpoint is well represented. I think there IS a Sunni bias to some of the articles. There are also a lot of early Islamic topics that need to be filled out in much greater detail. We could certainly use help there, especially from someone who reads Tabari. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:23, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thx for the tips, ill try to get there when i feel i have done an acurate and comprehensive work on representing the Shia view on Aisha in this article. I work that way, on thing in depht, then the next.</p>
<p>About this article. Why is it a problem in having realy big articles? I dont get the point of restrictiong it. If its about readability, then why not have a short and then a detailet version of the same topic?</p>
<p>As it is i realy feel that i dont get to add all the hadith that show why we argue as we do.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia tries to keep articles under 31 or 32K. That's why when you edit the Aisha page now, a warning pops up saying that it's too long. If an article starts to get too long and complicated, we do breakout articles. Also, we try to link to web pages, or give references to books, that take up the issue in greater detail. Wikipedia is the starting point for research, not the end of it. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 04:37, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In my oppinion ther is a great deal to tell to show what she felt and why she felt so in regards to manny diffrent people. For example Fatimah, Ali, Abu Bakr, Umar and so on...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then write a novel about Aisha. Actually, that would be very interesting. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 04:37, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As you can gues, ther are several persons and several diffrent ocasions (spellin?).</p>
<p>Whe Shia dont have a simplistic view of the people, that is "they alla loved eachothered and came along as great friends", no, we see theme more like in a soap oprah version where evreybody hade difrent views and angles on evereybody else, and in my oppinion its important to cover all importan persons that Aisha interacted with and how she did that to give a good picture of her aligeances. Its almost imposible to understand her psycology and why she rebeld agains Ali without having a simpistic view if we arent suposed to thuroughly go thruogh the background.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The background should be covered in OTHER articles about Islamic history. That's why we put links to the other articles in the text, so that someone who wants to find out more about Shia or Ali or Fatimah can do so easily, without having to conduct a separate search. That's why you really really should look at the other Islamic articles, not just this one, if you want to be sure that the Shia viewpoint is adequately represented in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 04:37, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You didn't tell us what subject and what details. The policy of wikipedia is NPOV (i.e. neutral), not Shi'a bashing of Aisha <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 01:29, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course its not, but would'nt you agree that its within the NPOV to acurratlý describe the Shia stance on the topic and also why we belive as we do and what our arguments are? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 03:07, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, wikipedia is supposed to be NPOV. It's not the place to justify and promote Shi'a beliefs. It's not the place for Aisha bashing by Shias. Imagine a Christian apologist arguing that he would like to show why Islam is a false religion and Christianity is true. Would that be acceptable? Absolutely not. You need to take your pro-Shi'a apologetics to your own website <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 03:20, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Whell, ther is no problem having a christan saying his mind as long as he is stating that it is the cristian view. Anyway, i dont get the problem since i only quote Sunni sources. I mean, c'mon, why is the Sunni version supposed to be the correct one? Why is are the Shia not equally entiteled to give the Shia version?</p>
<p>Sunni vesion = evereybody are best friends. Shia version = they loved some and hated som people.</p>
<p>Whats whrong whith telling both sides?</p>
<p>Im not saying i want to take over the artikel, no at all. I just want to tell my version. Anybody else are welcomed to tell theirs.</p>

<p>This article is supposd to be about Aisha, yet is reads like a venomous debate between Shia and Sunni. Everytime some thing is mentioned about Aisha, there is another para nitpicking it. Every single historical figure has controversy surrounding it. But when writing about it one writes about facts. Here, the venom especially from the shiite side makes the article read like one of those "Opposing viewpoint" series essay. The article doesn't seem to inform about Aisha as much as it wholly bashes her character and the controversies surrounding this historic feminist and leader of Muslims. There should be only one section labelled "Controversies surrounding Aisha" thats it. It would give it more cohorence, NPOV and not read like a venom laden garbage that it currently reads like. IMO, the sunni historians read more like modern day secular western historians, where the purpose is pursuit of the truth rather than maligning a personality for one's favourite side and beleif system.</p>

<dd>The problem is that Aisha is an extremely controversial figure. We can't just decide that one version of the history is true, and disregard any other versions. Wikipedia tries to be NPOV -- neutral point of view. If there's a a dispute, we step back and try to give all sides in a neutral fashion, with links to outside sites and books if possible. That way a reader can look for more evidence and make up his/her own mind.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do think that our Shia critic tried hard to turn this article into a critique of Aisha and that there's perhaps too much of that left. I'll take out some of the endless hadith "evidence" when I have time. But we can't just ignore the Shia point of view. To do so would be unfair to encyclopedia users, who might offend Shias out of ignorance if they assume that the Sunni view of matters is undisputed fact. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:34, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, OneGuy, NPOV means taking account of minority views, not just majority ones. Not only are 10% of Muslims Shias, but Shias are in the news these days. I don't think the Shia views should take over the article, and Striver 'is' long-winded, so balance has to be restored. But at least he doesn't try to delete everything he doesn't agree with.</dd>

I will start a bunch of articles on early Islamic history which are NOT biographical; you can too. You've already been doing some of this with your work on the Caliphs. Let's move Islamic history out of the biographies and into event-centered articles.

<p>Im sorry OneGuy, but i have told several times, im quoting history books and more ore less established facts. You have not argued even one time with me on the validity of ANNY topic, only forwarded your opinion that im an "apologetic biased shia POV pusher". Get real and argue the topic, prove me wrong, tell me that Ali did NOT opposed Abu Bakr instead of raision votes for delition. Bukhari says that Umar said that Ali DID oppose Abu Bakr, so ´who are you to disagree? What does it matter if 90% of the Muslims dont want to aknowlege facts stated in their own books? Here we state facts, not Sunni POV, and, for example, Bukhari Says Ali DID oppose Abu Bakr.</p>
<p>Start seing the diffrens betwen Sunni POV and what Sunni books says.</p>
<p>And by the way, i usualy dont say "sunni says" or "muslim says", only "bukhari says" or "history of <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabari.html" title="Tabari">tabari</a> says"</p>

<p>Omerlives, its not my intent to bash umm ul-momeenin Aishas character, rather its to stop the sunni sides "Aisha is best" aproch. And i use all Sunni sources to show facts about her, i dont give any single oppininon. An strangly some people, like OneGuy are critizing me for my efforts to include establishd historical facts, in for example, the article about Mohammed.</p>
<p>I mean, c'mon, since when is it bias to portray established facts? Im genuinly hurt by the fact that my efforts to include established, non-disputed facts from sunni sources are dissmised as "biased shia apologetic POV". *sight*</p>
<p>I mean, since when is "man kuntu mawla, alion mawla" a Shia POV? FFS, that makes me so mad and makes me feels poorly treated. So what that the Sunni OPINION is that mawla means friens, is that an excues to exlude that FACT that he said so? Since when do Sunni OPINIONS ´have bigger levereage that FACTS?</p>
<p>Like the fact that Aisha recruited Hafsa and two other wives to harras the Prophet, somthing that made the Prophet leave them for one month and at the end, for the SECOND time, made him think on terminating the marriage to Aisha. Even Umar admits it and gives some <i>very</i> heavy words to Hafsa for it, but still sunnis rather forget the whole thing, only because it remninds them to the fact that Aisha was not an angel. Anyway, the honny episode is now included, no thanx to the Sunni contrubutes. I mean, all of Surah of "the prohibition" is due to this incident, but still Sunnis whant it to be forgoten. I glad that OneGuy isnt here as well, otherwise he would have dissmised the whole honny episode as well as "Biased irrelevant shia apologetic POV.&#160;:(</p>
<p>And i havent even started talking about why she is called "Humayra". "The red lady". Use your imagination. Or Aisha hand her fatwa on nursing male adults. *sight* THAT would make Sunnis go berzerk if i started showing what Aisha realy said about that.</p>
<p>Fact: Aisha hated Ali, Fatimah, and Hasan (pbut). ITS FACT. Its all over sunni books. Sunnis dont want to aknowledge that, so instead of being facts, its "biased Shia POV".</p>
<p>Let me aske one thing: If one day, the "Flat Earth Society" would make 85% of the world to belive that the earht is flat, would the FACT that the earth is round to become "irrelevant, biased apologetic Ruond-Earther POV"?</p>
<p>Im talking ESTABLISHED FACTS in SUNNI BOOKS!</p>
<p>Geting tired of this. Only cause Sunnis dont like it, dosnt make it POV! Its SUNNI POV in that case, NOT SHIA POV!</p>

<p>FACT FACT FACT FACT! stop labelling everything about your selective POV as fact. Unfortunately I donot have the time being a superbusy undergrad to start and correcting your article. My god! Books by most Western Historians read so much more better as one sees that they have made an HONEST attempt to present an NPOV. Just consider what if Ali by any happenstance was a controversial figure (which he too is) and say Sunnis had angst against him (which they dont) the way Shias do about virtually every other muslim figure save Ali's family. There could be produced a gazilion hadiths and rawayat's about Ali's incompetence, failure, impotence and what not. Just like any figure against whom any community has decided a negative mindset from the beginning. If you dont beleive it, ask any Chritian fundie about Mohammad and let im give you a course bout the vile Muhammad based on FACTS FACTS FACTS from sunni shia hadith quran and what not sources. Yet that article would NOT be balanced, neutral, honest by any chance even if countered in the second para by sunni writers. Read for example the acount on MOhammad by M. Hart in his book THE 100 in which he declares mohamad the most influential person and goes neither in overt sycophancy nor his personal POV. THAT is the honest attempt and that's the way an encyclopedia should read.</p>

<p>There is a non-NPOV in the article, first it says that tabari was an "early" chronicler (what an ingnorance!), second it clearly makes a logical mistake&#160;: the tilte says aicha married when she was 9, and in the text it says 6!!!! if the word marriage doesn't suits you, change it! the reader has to know that Aicha ACCEPTED to marry when she was six.

<dl>
<dd>Agurzil, please be polite. Early is relative. Tabari is later than Ibn Ishaq and Waqidi, but not all that much later, and he's a primary source for much of what we know about early Islamic history. As for your insistence that Aisha was married at 6, using "marriage" for the ceremony that occurred is misleading -- betrothal would probably be more exact, as the marriage wasn't consummated and Aisha continued living with her family. Insisting on using "marriage" in this context is irresponsible, especially as this is a contentious question.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"early" was used in a misleading manner, insinuate that tabari lived before Boukhari or muslim, and that it was him who reported the hadith, whereas he just reported the work of Ibn Ishaq... and Tabri lived FOUR centuries after the death of Mohamed.</dd>
<dd>Consumed or not consumed, a marriage is a marriage, and it was explicitely said that she had sexual relations 3 years later after the marriage the reader cannot be mislead. in my family the same thing happens, sometimes couples start living together for one or two years after the marriage... it's not just a betrothal that could easily be cancelled, and the reader HAS to know that Aicha <i>agreed</i> when she was only 6 years, this is a very important fact that should not be disguised. --<a href="../../../a/g/u/User%7EAgurzil_7b94.html" title="User:Agurzil">Agurzil</a> 17:23, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will explain why I did a confusion in writing that aicha lived with mohamed before having sexual relations (Only for 4 minutes as noted by Stereotek): it was because of this hadith</dd>
<dd>I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Apostle used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fateh-al-Bari page 143, Vol.13)</dd>
<dd>'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married her when she was seven years old, and he was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and <b>her dolls were with her</b>; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old.Book 008, Number 3311:</dd>
<dd>I couldn't imagine a man having sexual relations with a girl still playing with dolls, that is why I thought she lived with him between 6 and 9 years old, I think we should add these two hadiths because it is a good evindence of her non-puberty (physically and psychically) at the age of 9.--<a href="../../../a/g/u/User%7EAgurzil_7b94.html" title="User:Agurzil">Agurzil</a> 17:21, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC</dd>

<dd>A 14 year old girl can also play with "dolls." In the US, there are older women who collect dolls. In any case, like Striver, here we have another POV pusher who is turning the article into unreadable mess by copying and pasting repetitive hadith that he thinks will push his POV. What's the point of cutting and past the exact similar hadith narrated by the same person and from the same hadith collection? If Aisha or Bukhari are wrong/lying in one place, they are wrong/lying everywhere. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 18:45, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>First of all, please, let's not start calling each other too many strange names. (POV pusher and such...). Another thing is that the hadiths that you just deleted, was not all from Bukari and all of them was not narrated by Aisha. As a matter of fact two of them was not...</p>
<p>1) Sahih Muslim Book 008, Number 3310: 'Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house when I was nine years old.</p>
<p>2) Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 88 Narrated 'Ursa: The Prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with 'Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).</p>
<p>I just added these two again. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStereotek_fc8d.html" title="User:Stereotek">Stereotek</a> 19:39, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually the situation is even worse. All of these hadith on Aisha's age were reported by Urwa (also known as Abu Hisham). If you look at the chain of narration, even the hadith where the first narrator is claimed to be Aisha, the person who is quoting Aisha (in the chain see <a href="../../../i/s/n/Isnad.html" title="Isnad">Isnad</a>) is Urwa (or Abu Hisham). I was correct. It's basically a repetition of the same information from the same source (Urwa) and should not be repeated <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 19:46, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>All the hadith on Aisha's age include Urwa in the chain of narration? That surprise me! Anyway, out of interest, could you please mention your source for that information?</p>
<p>Another ting is that you changed <i>Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 88</i> from <i>Narrated Ursa</i> to <i>Narrated 'Urwa</i>. I find it a bit hard to track down a source that support that specific change. Maybe you could mention yours? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStereotek_fc8d.html" title="User:Stereotek">Stereotek</a> 09:19, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Legal age for brides lifted to 13<br />
24jun02<br />
IRAN'S arbitrating body has approved a reformist law increasing the <b>minimum marriage age</b> from 9 to 13 for girls and from 14 to 15 for boys. The new law stipulates that marriage of girls under 13 and boys under 15 will require court permission, the government-run daily Iran has reported. It gave no further details.</p>
<p>The law's approval is seen as a victory for Iran's reformists, who have sought to promote women's rights. The elected legislature passed a similar Bill in August 2000, but the hard-line Guardian Council rejected it as contradicting Islamic sharia law. Now, the Expediency Council, which arbitrates between parliament and the Guardian Council, has passed the measure into law. Officials were unavailable for comment. "This is yet another fulfillment of promises of reformists, especially female lawmakers, who had promised to protect women's rights," said lawmaker Fatemah Khatami. "Still, we have a long way to go to provide adequate legal protection for women." <a href="http://www.ageofconsent.com/iran.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ageofconsent.com/iran.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>Some anon editor with a strong <i>attitude</i> is trying to revive the "Muhammad is a pedophile" controversy. He seems to be intent on removing one portion of a sentence in which it is noted that some Muslim commentators insist that Aisha was post-pubescent at nine. I was the one who wrote that; I was the one who read exactly that defense on several Islamic web pages. I recall some wording like "girls grow up faster in the desert". Now I think this would be a symptom of a severe hormone disorder myself, and thus highly unlikely, but I was just reporting what I read.</p>

<dd>OneGuy simply reverted without bothering to discuss it, besides garbled comments in the edit summary. He reverted 4 times and has been reported. I originally put back in there that it was highly unlikely that Aisha was post-pubescent at the age of 9. It was there for months and only removed two days ago. As soon as I put it back OneGuy went on the attack. And I am not trying to revive the "Muhammad is a pedophile". I simlply said some critics say that is a possible reason, just as some islamic apologists think aisha was post pubescentn at the age of 9. I didn't add the pedophile part to the article though, I just asked him why only put one point of view in there. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168.209.97.34.html" title="User:168.209.97.34">168.209.97.34</a> 08:25, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You might want to check your "facts". Most muslims don't believe Aisha was 9 year old, so they don't even touch on the issue of if she was post-pub at the age of 9.

<p>this happened in the 7th century, man. You were not there. We only even know about it through 'muslim sources'. It's very simple. The sources should be listed, it should be put into the proper 7th century Arabian context (i.e. nobody even raised an eyebrow, at the time!), and usual interpretations (she was post-pubescent etc.) should be given. We are not discussing whether she was indeed post-pubescent, this would be futile. We are just citing authorities on the subject. OneGuy, the removal of the "post-pubescent" passage is not strictly vandalism. Especially since "usual response" seems a bit weasly. But if it is indeed the usual response, it should of course be here, and I'll help putting it back. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 09:06, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>How about this. We put it back to the way it has been for months on end. It used to say something to the likes of "the usual response was that Aisha was post-pub (although medically it is unlikely) ...". It was that way for months and then was removed 2 days ago.

<dd>Just because there are a few freaks of nature doesn't mean it's a normal occurrence. It is simply speculation. One could also speculate that Muhammad was sterile because despite all of his wives he only had one child, who died shortly after birth. We could also speculate the mother of that child was sleeping around (like Aisha is accused of) and the father wasn't even Muhammad. We could also speculate that Aisha never had children because of internal damage she received when having the marriage consumated at an early age. I'm not saying any of that is true, all I'm saying is the fact that Aisha was post-pub is speculation and is not supported by any authentic scripture or any other valid source. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168.209.97.34.html" title="User:168.209.97.34">168.209.97.34</a> 07:46, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

fine. can we also do some actual, unbiased research on it? I would be interested about the history of this in islamic writing. I.e. was it even seen as an issue, were there disputes about the puberty thing, and who are the authors who advanced either view? "usual response" somehow just isn't good enough. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 09:38, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>It would be a monumental task to track down the history of this controversy. My suspicion is that it's fairly recent. It's reminiscent of the 1980s and early 1990s hysteria over multiple personalities/satanic ritual abuse/pedophile rings/day care trials &amp;c. I would guess that this criticism was first raised by Christian polemicists and then the Muslims started responding to it. Several of the sites I found referred to this as a recent slander by Orientalists.</p>
<p>I found three websites where the "early menarche" explanation is given:</p>

<dd><i>Prophet’s marriage to `Aisha, the Mother of the Faithful, has always been a subject of attack and criticism by the enemies of Islam.</i> seems to gesture at a longer history of the controversy, but I doubt it has been brought up before modern times, but maybe we can dig up some 16th century Christian rants about this? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 11:59, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>well, then the whole thing is not very notable, is it? A short paragraph saying that internet proselytizers recently have been calling 'child abuse' should suffice.

<p>An anon editor added another item to the list showing that Aisha was post-pubescent. Some of the information in that item simply duplicated info already given.

I find the assertion that Asma lived to the age of 100 a little hard to believe. It seems more likely to me that neither Aisha nor Asma knew precisely how old she was, given the way people dated at that time, and the frequent controversies re dating various events in early Islamic history.</p>

<p>It seems that more context is needed here. What were common practices around the world, especially with arranged marriages? What were common practices with the nobility class? My belief is that whether the age was 9 or 14, in the age of survival of the fittest, in the age before female education and autonomy, before the development of modern medicine and psychology, the ancient notion was that there was likely nothing wrong with this practice. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 21:35, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>About the only context we have is anthropological, for various pre-modern societies. Many of them marry off females at an extremely early age, while they are still pre-pubescent. However, my understanding is that these marriages are not consummated until the bride is post-pubescent. Early marriage is usually seen by the parents as a kind act, assuring the girl's future. It can also be a way of ensuring that arranged marriages go ahead as planned, while the girl is still young and docile, and hasn't formed her own preferences. Both nobility and peasants practice early marriage.</p>
<p>Since what counts, socially, is the marriage, that's what is recorded. I would guess that recording the date and time of consummation would be much less common, and much harder to document -- especially for societies we only know through fragmentary records and archaeological evidence. I dunno how much physical anthrologists can figure out from bones -- age certainly, having born children, possibly -- but virginity is NOT something they could possibly deduce.</p>
<p>I need to get a copy of Robertson-Smith, <i>Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia</i>, and put it through Distributed Proofreaders.

<dd>I was reading a "hadith" in which some contemporary denounces Ibn Ishaq as a liar the other day. The reason he gave was that Ibn Ishaq claimed to have heard a hadith from the contemporary's wife, who, supposedly, had never spoken to a strange man since her marriage at the age of nine. From the tone of the narration, I think we can safely assume that early marriage was considered fairly normal in Ibn Ishaq's time. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 23:46, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't know what you're objecting to. You say you dislike it when "we look at yesterday through the knowledge and values of today."

You complain that I offer no context...of course not, I'm affirming your point about the importance of context; surely the importance of context is true regardless of context, no?

<p>Actually, both points refer to <i>marrying</i> nine-year-olds. As Zora notes, finding information on the age of consummation is much more difficult.

<p>Babajobu is very confused about many things. You are attacking me and you don't even have any idea of what ideas you are attacking. My point is that Muhammad's behavior in this particular aspect was the product of <i>his times</i>. People were commonly betrothed prior to the age of 9, even at birth, see the entire history of European prince and princesses. Kings ran countries and executed people by this age. It was not a time where you needed to be 18 to get a driver's license or drink a beer. Sickness felled a large percentage of families and they did things early. Even though I am a Christian, I am no bible expert, but I bet you would find a lot of passages in the Old Testiment where it was pretty normal to marry and, presumably, consumate the marriage, early. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 19:32, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Betrothal is not the issue here; we're talking about sex with a small child. How young a child was Aisha when first Muhammad copulated with her? Traditional answer: nine years of age. It is this simple fact that neocon presentist fanatics like Noitall insist on condemning as "unenlightened," even as they acknowledge the importance of cultural context in understanding and evaluating an individual's actions. When will the judgmental madness end?? <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 01:06, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<hr />
<p>Yabbut, the same people who insist on believing the hadith that she was nine also assert that she was post-pubescent, because "Arabian girls matured earlier". Yes, this is bogus, because all the evidence is that the age of menarche in traditional societies was higher than it is now, in these days of good nutrition. But that seems to me to be good evidence that:</p>
<ul>
<li>For religious reasons, the traditionalists cannot doubt the hadith, because so much of Islamic law is derived from Aisha-sourced hadith.</li>
<li>They want to believe that Muhammad is the pattern of human perfection.</li>
<li>They think sex with pre-pubescent females is squicky.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only possible solution is claiming that Aisha was post-pubescent at nine. This says more about the ulema, IMHO, than it does about Muhammad. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:59, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Zora's assessment is right on the money. There is no earthly reason to suspect that Aisha would have been post-pubescent at nine years of age; the plainsense truth is that she was likely to be far less physically developed than today's girls of wildly early menarche (eleven or twelve years old, in many modern cases). The inevitable jerry-fix is that Allah expedited Aisha's physical development so that Muhammad could get his freak on. However, this is not of encyclopedic value.

<p>I just want to address <b>personal attacks by Babajobu</b>. I don't mind personal attacks, I am a big person. But please make them somewhat relevant to the issue. I have made no edit here on this article, and only initiated a discussion to find out other POVs and other people's research or knowledge. Thus Babajobu's cannot be based on some edit he fundamentally disagrees with or the fact that I reverted his cherished bit of words or POV. Babajobu has called me all sorts of names, and I really do not know why, and made all sorts of scattered assumptions based on the articles I have edited, not on the what I have actually edited in those articles. Basically, all Babajobu has proven here is that he/she virolently leaps to conclusions without thinking.

<dd>What does it matter what age Aisha was when she was married to Mohammmed (peace be upon him). To imply that Mohammed was a very very bad man is offensive. Many people back then were very young when they got married. Many times, marriages in Europe of Kings were at a young age. <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESaduj_al-Dahij_f7a2.html" title="User:Saduj al-Dahij">Saduj al-Dahij</a> 13:51, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Narrated 'Aisha: "I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Apostle used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) 8:73:151</p>
<p><br />
Here is some research on this subject using more than one references:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.muslim.org/islam/aisha-age.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.muslim.org/islam/aisha-age.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.muslim.org/islam/aisha-age.htm</a></p>
<p>I quote</p>
<p>"<i>Later research</i></p>
<p>Research subsequent to the time of Maulana Muhammad Ali has shown that she was older than this. An excellent short work presenting such evidence is the Urdu pamphlet Rukhsati kai waqt Sayyida Aisha Siddiqa ki umar (‘The age of Lady Aisha at the time of the start of her married life’) by Abu Tahir Irfani.[4a] Points 1 to 3 below have been brought to light in this pamphlet.</p>
<p>1. The famous classical historian of Islam, Ibn Jarir Tabari, wrote in his ‘History’:</p>
<p>“In the time before Islam, Abu Bakr married two women. The first was Fatila daughter of Abdul Uzza, from whom Abdullah and Asma were born. Then he married Umm Ruman, from whom Abdur Rahman and Aisha were born. These four were born before Islam.” [5]</p>
<p>Being born before Islam means being born before the Call.</p>
<p>2. The compiler of the famous Hadith collection Mishkat al-Masabih, Imam Wali-ud-Din Muhammad ibn Abdullah Al-Khatib, who died 700 years ago, has also written brief biographical notes on the narrators of Hadith reports. He writes under Asma, the older daughter of Abu Bakr:</p>
<p>“She was the sister of Aisha Siddiqa, wife of the Holy Prophet, and was ten years older than her. … In 73 A.H. … Asma died at the age of one hundred years.”</p>
<p>This would make Asma 28 years of age in 1 A.H., the year of the Hijra, thus making Aisha 18 years old in 1 A.H. So Aisha would be 19 years old at the time of the consummation of her marriage, and 14 or 15 years old at the time of her nikah. It would place her year of birth at four or five years before the Call.</p>
<p>3. The same statement is made by the famous classical commentator of the Holy Quran, Ibn Kathir, in his book Al-bidayya wal-nihaya:</p>
<p>“Asma died in 73 A.H. at the age of one hundred years. She was ten years older than her sister Aisha.”</p>
<p>Apart from these three evidences, which are presented in the Urdu pamphlet referred to above, we also note that the birth of Aisha being a little before the Call is consistent with the opening words of a statement by her which is recorded four times in Bukhari. Those words are as follows:</p>
<p>“Ever since I can remember (or understand things) my parents were following the religion of Islam.”</p>
<p>This is tantamount to saying that she was born sometime before her parents accepted Islam but she can only remember them practising Islam. No doubt she and her parents knew well whether she was born before or after they accepted Islam, as their acceptance of Islam was such a landmark event in their life which took place just after the Holy Prophet received his mission from God. If she had been born after they accepted Islam it would make no sense for her to say that she always remembered them as following Islam. Only if she was born before they accepted Islam, would it make sense for her to say that she can only remember them being Muslims, as she was too young to remember things before their conversion. This is consistent with her being born before the Call, and being perhaps four or five years old at the time of the Call, which was also almost the time when her parents accepted Islam.</p>
<p><br />
Maybe retards here should try to know the true meanings of word "research"</p>
<p>From the link you posted about Aisha being Mohammed's wife: "Such a person would need to possess the following qualities: an excellent, precise memory to retain a vast amount of detail accurately"</p>
<p>Yet she couldn't remember how old she was when her marriage was consumated? Or are you saying she lied? Rhm01 23:47, 23 Sept 2006</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't SEE your comment until now. His brother? Whose brothers? That is not clear at all. Nor is it at all clear that Muawiya killed Aisha. The more hadith I read, the more conspiracy theories I find. Anyone who is said by one faction to have died of illness or old age is said by another faction to have been poisoned. At this time, unless we could find the grave, exhume the body and test it to see if any poisons have survived the millenia, we can't be sure about ANY of the poison theories. I don't see that there's any point in mentioning them.</p>
<p>As for the point re Shi'a not considering Aisha-sourced hadith reliable for law, that's a good one, I'll make changes. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:15, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I found one reference in Madelung to Aisha's rage at Muawiya's murder of her brother, and desecration of his body -- only the one brother cited. Wasn't the other brother killed by Marwan, not Muawiya? Would take some research to dig up. Madelung has nothing re the death of Aisha. After much googling, I came up with one Shi'a account saying that Muawiya dug a pit for Aisha, into which she fell and was killed. This was held up to Sunni derision on the talk forum where I found it. Re poison, you may be remembering stories that Muawiya had Husayn ibn Ali poisoned, by bribing his wife -- also a Shi'a story, denied by Sunni.</p>
<p>This is a period not covered by my Ibn Ishaq. My copy of Ibn Sa'd isn't here yet, and I only have one volume of Tabari, for a different period. I can't find any record of an English translation of al-Waqidi. Do you have any cites OTHER than late, Shi'a oral traditions? It sounds to me as if the claim that Muawiya murdered Aisha is just one more attempt to blacken the name of Muawiya. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:21, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

I have no first hand sources regarding this, only shia books in shia sites. And the book calims Mauwiya also poisoned the second brother and also gives a context to it. You can find a link to it in the brothers article. Wheter its true or not is irrelevant, we are not here to judge its auteticity, only to report it. You can write "shia cite sunni sources claiming Aisha was burried alive by Muawiya".</p>

<p>Right now i cant offer more proof that all shia i have talked to and all shia sources i have read, whenever they have mentioned her death, they have claimed Muawiya did it. That is good enough for me. Sister, i cant find a "scholarly" referens for every single thing i know, in this case it should suffice that al-islam.org, answerig-ansar.org and shianews.com claim it.

<p>It's good that Zeno brought up the alternate explanation of sura 66. I wasn't aware of the two explanations until now, but I think this makes perfect sense. I think the two explanations should be explained in more detail, rather than just a link to the concubine/wife Maria being given. I'll do it when I can. However, I don't think it's true that the Shi'a reject the story of the honey, since it was a Shi'a, Striver, who added it in the first place. Of course, Striver does not necessarily reflect the views of all Shi'a.

<dd>Im a little bit unsure, i have seen a shia mentione the alternative version, but i was prone to see it as a rare stance, since i have not seen other shia oppose the honey version. I judge that most shia also belive the honey version to be accurate, but i might very well be wrong. I have mentioned the honey version in front of very educated shia, and nobody even hinted that it might be incorect. More investigation is needed to prove that shia belive in the alternative version, and how manny of them do so.

<p>Zeno, you reverted to your version of the Maria note, and I can't see why. Is it just that you like the look of your own prose? I don't see why we can't explain the alternate theory in the Aisha article and repeat the explanation in the Maria article. I can see asking users to click to another article when the explanation would be too long -- such as dealing with the whole succession to Muhammad problem -- but one para is not too much to add. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 02:05, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Stevertigo spent a lot of time giving the Muslim apologetic gloss, as well as removing the earlier note re the use of Ayesha as a woman's name. I removed the gloss, and here's why:</p>
<p>This article has been a hotly contested area for years. It is the scene of ugly clashes between anti-Muslim bigots (Muhammad was a pedophile, nyah nyah!) and pious Muslims (nothing that makes Muhammad look even remotely human or fallible can be included). Not to mention the Shi'a versus Sunni wars.</p>
<p>After a great deal of editing work, we had arrived at what seemed to be a stable NPOV version, one that all sides could accept. Stevertigo's edits threatened to return us to that state of all-out war. I don't feel that they added any information -- they just insisted on the Muslim version of Aisha's history.</p>
<p>Stevertigo, I know that you think you're defending Islam with your edits, but your efforts would just plunge us back into the wars and lead to the posting of more scurrilous interpretations of Muhammad's behavior. Please, unless you have extra information to add (which I don't think is possible, since we've covered the earliest sources), let this version be. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:04, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe that <i>notabilty</i> is a relative term. In order to be fair, Ali Sina is not notable enough to be quoted in Wikipedia. You've got plenty of notable writers, journalists, scholars, experts that can be found at Critics of Islam's Category. 99% of people belonging to that category are notable enough to be quoted in these kind of articles. Someone who runs a website from <i>behind the curtains</i> doesn't merit to be referenced in Wikipedia.

<dd>My view is that FFI is not notable and definitely not scholarly. The problem I have is that some of the other sources here aren't either. So, if we are going to cite cheap Islamic sites we can use FFI. Once we rise out of the gutter we can scrap both of those. (Note: If the cite is being linked to for a notable book that's another matter... but remember; choose the least partisan site when linking to an online book. We don't link FFI over Gutenberg). <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 05:38, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>well that is one way of looking at it gren, though I just don't see what people object to with Ali Sina ,he is just an apostate encouraging Muslims to leave Islam by presenting them with an alternate view of Islam which they may not have been presented before. He does his best to provide factual and accurate information and testimonies from ex-muslims.Whats wrong with that? And whats wrong with saying what you think about anything that exists in the world?

<dd>CltFn, you have to understand that this is not a political forum or podium to make people more notable. There are guidelines in Wikipedia. We don't accept controversial websites, blogs and forums like this one or the ones belonging to Al-Qaeda, ETA, etc... to have predominant referencing in Wikipedia for controversial religion-related articles. People are entitled to exercise free speech but we mainly here are guardians of this free speech against hate speech. As explained above, notable critics of Islam or Paganism are accepted. His bio intro does not help this case as it says nothing if you compare it with respected and notable critics. Just a note; there are plenty of similar rants from other opponent websites. We do not accept to participate on that battle between people who <i>pretend</i> to advice others.

<p>The article that we have an external link to is written by Ali Sina but it's subject is not ALi Sina, so how notable he is or not, is not very interesting in this case. The article is about the Aisha/Muhammed pedophilia controversy which is obviously very well known, and of course worth mentioning in this article. I don't see any reason why there should be any resistance to having a link to an article that clarify and provide information to our readers, about one of the POVs that exist regarding this issue? Other articles re this issue can of course be added to add some balance and provide information about other POVs re this, however I don't see any reason to remove the external link. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 21:07, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, Karl. When you say that it is written by him than we have to go back to discuss his notability! Regarding the question about the <i>resistance</i>, I must say "why not insert a reference to a more acceptable and notable authour/website"? I am totally with a balance but we should agree about issues like notability (is he or his site usually quoted or referenced in the mass media or even in the specialist media?). As I said above, there are plenty of well notable critics of Islam. Ali is no different than <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Shamir_9e98.html" title="Israel Shamir">Israel Shamir</a> and his website.

I would never use his site. Completely ignoring the fact that I'm a Muslim, he insults and lies a LOT. Every Muslim on the site he calls a "cult member" along with other numerous insults to Islam, the Prophet Muhammad (as), and the Muslim.</p>
<p>He lies, also. For example, he says that in an authentic Hadith there is a creation story that Muhammad (as) told. That Hadith doesn't exist! It was completely made up by Sina but he tried to pass it off as authentic and as if it existed. He also has numerous other lies.</p>
<p>It's one thing to be a "scholar" who is critical of Islam. It's another thing to lie about what you're supposedly a "scholar" of. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmyrifle9_e75f.html" title="User:Armyrifle9">Armyrifle</a> 14:06, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fine but this is still inaccurate.

<p>Sir/Madam this has nothing to do with neutrality but to do with accuracy. What you are stating is simply incorrect and artificial. The dating from the Islamic calander is extensively used in other articles on Islamic history...and may I say entirely appropiately. Had the dating in this article been based on the islamic calander I would have no argument.

<p>We've had CE there for ages -- I put it there when I extensively rewrote the article a year and a half ago, something like that. We have CE in numerous articles throughout Wikipedia. We've had an Arbcom case rebuking a date crusader, and an era ruling to the effect that editing an article JUST to change the date notation is wrong. I don't see why we have to remove the notation for someone who's breaking rules just with his date crusading. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 09:12, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've noted the above discussion with interest. I am not sure what date crusading is. But I do agree with the chap who has pointed out the inconsistancy of having references to the Islamic calender (I have to admit that I too am a Muslim) and artifically removing all references to the Christian Calander. Simpily because this error has been perpetuated in the past does to signify validity. Compromise is important. And it would seem that if CE creates as much annoyance as AD then we should remove both.

<p>Marriages occured much earlier at that time because the life expectancy almost 1500 years ago was less than half of that today [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>]. What's wrong with that statement? The sentence before says that early marriages were common at that time &amp; the life expectancy is probably the reason for that. I don't understand what you mean by the shorter on European Demographics. <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajab_046f.html" title="User:Rajab">Rajab</a> 10:36, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Life expectancy is an average, and infant deaths pull the average way down. People who survived to age one or two lived longer than 25, I believe. The Wikipedia article you reference explains that. Furthermore, life expectancy has no necessary connection to age at marriage. Different societies have had different marriage strategies. In societies with early marriage, early marriage has meant high fertility rates. When resources are limited, that can lead societies to resort to abortion (Tokugawa Japan) or infanticide (ancient Hawai'i, pre-Islamic Arabia) in order to keep the population in line with available resources. It can also result in highly pronounced demographic cycles: explosive population growth, succeeded by civil war and epidemics, succeeded by explosive population growth. Various social scientists have claimed that European society got out of that "trap" by adopting a "European family system" characterized by the oldest son inheriting a whole farm or firm (keeping productive assets together), late marriage, and younger sons and extraneous daughters being sent away as servants, craftsmen, or monks and nuns. I thought that it was Edward Shorter who popularized these ideas, but I was wrong -- he writes on the "modern" family system. Other authors wrote about earlier marriage patterns. See <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_3_35/ai_84678632" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_3_35/ai_84678632" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and <a href="http://www.iussp.org/Activities/scc-his2/his2-emreport.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iussp.org/Activities/scc-his2/his2-emreport.php" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You seem to be assuming that most people died by the time they were 25, therefore people had to marry early in order to keep up population levels. This is simply NOT true. The problem for pre-industrial societies was curbing population growth, not enhancing it. You are presenting an original argument that is not supported by what we know of demography. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:08, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So you are saying that people lived to the same age 1500 years ago as we live today? This is simply NOT true. Just look at peoples who live in primitive societies today - in these countries someone who's 40 is really elderly. On the other hand the number of people who live to age 100 or older increases every decade!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For this reason I suggest the following compromise: [... early marriages were common] One reason for this is that life expectancy almost 1500 years ago was much less than today [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>].</dd>
<dd>What do you think? <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajab_046f.html" title="User:Rajab">Rajab</a> 11:22, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Why should I compromise? The WP way is to give all sides of an issue -- when the sides are notable. Your "explanation" is your original theory; it is not supported by any demographer. Lower life expectancies, yes -- but this does NOT translate directly into lower age at marriage. Your theory is not notable, so far as I can tell. Come back with cites from reputable sources and then we'll add your theory.</p>
<p>What's relevant is "age at marriage". This has tended to be fairly low in many pre-modern societies, with women married off as soon as they were pubescent. But not all societies! It varies. However, in no societies that I know is sex with pre-pubescent females approved. Nine is pre-pubescent, very much so. Puberty actually comes later to undernourished women, not earlier. (See Aisha's account of the necklace for a comment on how little she weighed, and how thin women were in those days.) That's why I think, personally, that Aisha was bragging and exaggerating her youth at marriage. But that's just MY theory. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 11:35, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anon, I removed the last part of your edits re Aisha's age at marriage. You can't argue that "Muhammad would not have done anything nasty", as that assumes that Muhammad is perfect. There are many non-Muslims who would not accept that argument; it does not belong in a secular encyclopedia. The argument that marriage to a pre-pubescent child would have been shocking is unreferenced, and would be hard to demonstrate. We know very little, really, about marriage customs in pre-Islamic Arabia, though there is much speculation.</p>
<p>If you want to research an article on Pre-Islamic Arabian society, that would be wonderful. But until we have something like that, we can't really make statements about what was or wasn't accepted. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:50, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anon, I moved your edits re Urwa to the "arguments for greater age" category, which is where they belong. Also, I reversed your change of heading from "consummation" to "marriage". All accounts say that the marriage/betrothal ceremony preceded the actual consummation of the marriage by several years. It's the "consummation" part of this that bothers critics. I think the article is inconsistent in this regard and needs a cleanup edit to make sure that we distinguish carefully between marriage and consummation. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:27, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Zora, please don't remove the extra piece of information I added concerning Urwa. It is an important piece and it took quite a while to research. Ibn Abbas is a renowned and trustworthy figure, and the work Tazeeb al Tazeeb is very recognized as well. And I agree with Anon that the Qur'an would not allow child marriages and that that piece of information is NOT AT ALL insignificant! And whether Muslim or not, nobody would deny that Muhammad acted according the the Qur'an. Had he not, that would have been a thing of great controversy among Muslims and an easy point of criticism for his opponents! Many tried to include that but you always deleted it!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Where in the Qur'an does it say that child marriages are not allowed? I don't think you can come up with a cite.

<p>In this case, Ibn Ishaq can be used to prove that Aisha was older than nine, and avert a scandalous interpretation of Muhammad's behavior. What does it profit a Muslim to criticize him here? Are you trying to argue that Aisha was indeed nine years old?</p>

<dd>I am not the one who introduced Ibn Ishaq to this article. I merely noting that the article claims Ibn Ishaq is "convincing", and am noting what the implications of that are.

He was, after all, collecting stories of things that happened many years ago, and while he might have been as honest as he could in reporting what he heard, those giving him information might have been deluded. In some cases, Ibn Ishaq gives two contradictory accounts of something and says, "But Allah alone knows the truth".

<p>This may be an unpopular proposal, but I think we should remove everything which is not sourced from this article. I had a difficult time tracking down many of the facts, but its probably undesirable to mark every other sentence with {{fact}}. These generic references like "according to some hadiths" are especially troubling.

<dl>
<dd><i>Aisha has become known for having at the side of Muhammad in the battle of Badr (see for example hadiths by Muslim) as well as in the battle of Uhud (see e.g. hadiths by Bukhari). Bukhari also reports (Kitâb al-maghâzî, Bâb Ghazawat al-Khandaq wa-hiya l-Ahzâb) that the Prophet did not allow 14 year olds to participate but allowed them to join on their 15th birthday. Common sense would also forbid that the Prophet Muhammad would take children into his fighting ranks which would only be a hindrance not to mention that this would clearly be against the spirit of Islam.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This seems like the definition of original research. So what if Muhammad didn't let 14 year olds join the army? That says nothing about Aisha's age. Clearly, she would be a special case. The rest of it is even worse. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 07:23, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I pulled these out, put feel free to put them back in if you can back them up with cites.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Evidence that Aisha was much older comes from many sources, which thus reinforce each other. But all hadith supporting an early age at marriage and consummation can be traced to Urwa (also known as Abu Hisham) and date back to the period after he migrated to Iraq at the age of 71. There are no such hadith collected while he still resided in Medina. Ibn Abbas and others (see Tazeeb al Tazeeb) consider Urwa's hadith from Iraq to be weak; his memory is presumed to have weakened as he aged.</i> <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>I will put the above back into the text. This is the most crucial information. Just counting hadith does not give any information. A citation is not needed. All the hadith arguing for a young age are listed. If you have doubts, go and look yourself if you find one without Urwa in the chain of narration. It's not that many. You can do that!</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Some scholars say that the hadith collectors Bukhari and Muslim applied less stringent standards to hadith relating to history than they did to hadith relating directly to prayer and family law.

<dd>Hey -- I pored over my copy of Ibn Ishaq to confirm that. Muhammad started preaching publicly in 613, but there were three years before that in which he gathered converts, including Abu Bakr. Aisha is listed as one of the earliest converts. If she was old enough to walk and talk, she must have been three or four when she accepted Islam -- or older. There are nine years between 613 and 622, so 9+3 is at least twelve, with the likelihood that she was older.</dd>

<p>I have removed the following paragraphs from the "young age controversy" section. They are replete with POVs and unsourced material. The most prominent of which is the paragraph about Sunni principles of Shari'a being threatened if we assume Aisha was incorrect regarding her age. I would say most Sunni muslims, and scholars, would find this hard to believe. Feel free to reinsert the paragraphs with sources and reword it so that it doesn't represent a deduction or a POV.</p>

<dd><i>However, other Muslim scholars point to other traditions that conflict with those attributed to Aisha in this matter. If the other traditions are right, this would imply that Aisha was either confused in her dating, was exaggerating her youth at marriage, or that her stories (which were not written down until more than 100 years after her death) had been garbled in transmission. If we believe traditions that say she was post-pubescent when married, then these other traditions, from <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Ishaq_cd6c.html" title="Ibn Ishaq">Ibn Ishaq</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabari.html" title="Tabari">Tabari</a> and others, seem much more convincing.</i></dd>

<p>To Zora, you removed the section I added about the previous engagement right after my addition. I don't check my edits religiously for reverts so I have just came to notice. You mention that it is in a bad place and is repeated, both are not correct. Including the first engagement in the section about the "young age controversy" lends support to the ideaa that her engagement to the prophet (PBUH) was not unique at that time regardless of her age (even if we accept she was young by our standards, the fact that she was already engaged tells us it was not strange for her to be so). I agree the section I had was long, instead I have added the following to the "young age" section: "regardless of her age at the time, Aisha was already engaged to another man before Muhammad" Ahmedayad 06:17, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My argument is that in light of the previous engagement incident, age is irrelevant (it is neither FOR nor AGAINST her being 9 at the time). I am personally inclined to think that she was older, but my personal beliefs are also irrelevant. Ahmedayad 00:48, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I asked other editors if they wanted to split the marriage age controversy off into another article, and no one wanted to do so. Recently there's been some back-and-forth about introducing the controversy in the birthdate section.</p>
<p>Usually the intro para is where we state why someone is notable. So I took the controversy out of the birthdate, and moved it right up to the top, along with the Shi'a critique. Now no one can say that we're hiding anything. Look OK to other editors? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:11, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's a good idea to get it out of the way at the beginning. It's not something to hide and it is a big issue with her. (I thought the wording could be tweaked but I didn't come up with anything better). I would, however add a sentence about her from a fans... to many Sunnis she was a favorite wife and that's one reason she's notable. Also, she is used by many Islamic modernists and feminists as an example of a very assertive Muslim woman from the beginning in an attempt to prove that Islam isn't misogynistic. Most intros are supposed to be short and I think we can include those two things making it a quick overview that's not longer than the intro guidelines.</dd>

<dd>Hmm, when it comes to the part about feminists and modernists I really should get out my Wadud book and some of the other stuff that mentions her and actually add that to the article. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 01:29, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mani, we can't state in the intro that she was a child bride when there is controversy about her age. If you look at the section below, you see that there is a wide range of estimates of her age. WP doesn't state as fact matters that are in dispute; we just give all sides.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that my reversion is going to immediately be trumpeted in the Aucaman arbitration case as proof that I'm a unregenerate edit warrior, who should be banned from WP. I had to think for a moment as to whether or not I'd revert what I guessed was a deliberately provocative edit. Then I figured that if I could be intimidated into NOT doing something that I thought was fair, I would be a coward. So, I did it.</p>

<p>I have reverted ManiF's changes because, as far as I can see, there has been no consensus reached to add "young bride" to the intro.

<p>I’m sorry to see there is an edit-war here, and I apologize if Muslims are offended, in any way; I’m being sincere. Nevertheless, with all due respect, how can you say Aisha`s age was of no controversy? It is perhaps one the most well argued, and notorious hypothesis, backed with a lot of academic views, from Arabic books itself, in the religion Islam. I read this article when I joined Wiki anew in Feb/06, and I had no idea about this issue; yet, the article had not mentioned anything. I read a book by accident mentioning the enormity of this issue two weeks ago, then came back and added [one] sentence, stating she may have been a child at marriage, so at least the reader would have an idea about what is going-on. The reader deserves to know that. Am I incorrect?

<p>Anon, there are two things wrong with the version you like. One, if you want the controversy highlighted, then having it at the top is even more salient than having it in the second para. Two, that link accuses Muhammad of pedophilia. Putting it at the top, by itself, without any link to a competing viewpoint, gives it an unfair advantage. You're trying to use this article as a soapbox.</p>
<p>I could let you revert one more time and get banned, but I'll try to play nice: you've reverted three times and if you do it again, you'll get blocked. So don't.</p>
<p>Ashmoo suggested reorganizing the article and I think he's right. So sometime this weekend (after I finish the freelance editing work I'm doing), I'll try to reorganize the article so that the controversy represents all THREE sides of the argument, that is,</p>
<ul>
<li>Aisha was nine, because hadith don't lie, but she was pubescent. This is the predominant traditional Muslim POV, I think.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Aisha was nine, she was pre-pubescent, and Muhammad was a pedophile. This is a common anti-Muslim view.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Aisha was older than nine, as proved by other documents, such as sira. The hadith, in this case, can't be trusted. This view seems to be held by liberal Muslims, and possibly a few non-Muslims (though most non-Muslims wouldn't care one way or the other).</li>
</ul>
<p>The link you want to insert would go in the second group.</p>

<p>It seems that the date of the marriage is pretty vague. On the page, it mentions 622, but no exact date. Are historians sure that the marriage took place in 622 rather than 624?</p>
<p>Also, according to Tabari, Alisha was born in the Jahilyyah (before Islam), so she may have been born in 610 or earlier. So, one could argue that she was 14, or older, when she was married.</p>

<dd>Aisha was at the Battle of Badr, I believe, and she was already married to Muhammad. All the sources I have say that she was married to Muhammad soon after the Hijra, in the first or second year afterwards; I'm still trying to find the references for that in sira (I have Ibn Ishaq, but I don't have all the relevant volumes of Tabari).

<p>The article read that Shi'a dislike Aisha; an anon erased that, and wrote that since Ali forgave her, they forgave her. I wrote the "dislike" bit, based on several Shi'a websites. However, the anon may also be correct. There might well be a difference of opinion among Shi'a. I rewrote to say that and added a citation tag. We need some quotes, if any is up for getting them. If we can't get quotes, we should erase any unreferenced views. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:27, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For some reason, FairNBalanced seems to feel it's fair and balanced to respond to my edit summaries a. "rm <i>or pedophile</i>; one does not <i>become</i> a pedophile through actions", and b. "rm irrelevant reference to Ibn Ishaq being 100 years after Muhammad; Bukhari and Muslim were even later" with "rv". Rather than edit warring, I'd ask that he explain clearly the reasoning behind including the entirely unreferenced claim that "Critics insist [...] that Muhammad [...] became a [...] <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophile.html" title="Pedophile">pedophile</a>" in this article. (I think the "child molester" thing is ridiculous too — I expect most reasonable people would recognise this as an outrageous and provocative statement unsupported by mainstream opinion; wikipedia is not a venue for original research depicting the central figures of major world religions as criminal deviants — but the "became a pedophile" is just surreal.) We can deal with the well-poisoning of Ibn Ishaq later. —&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">JEREMY</a> 16:22, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having given it some thought, I agree with you, Jeremy. While the "evidence" that Aisha's age was other than as directly stated by hadith is highly interpretive, having sexual relations with a child does not make one a <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophile.html" title="Pedophile">pedophile</a>, based on the most standard definitions of this term. There can be no doubt that Muhammad enjoyed sex with adult women, and there's no reason to believe that he <i>preferred</i> children.Timothy Usher 19:33, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for that, Timothy. While I believe it's illogical to say that there "can be no doubt" about the personal details of a historical figure whose life is documented almost exclusively in first millennium religious texts, and that almost all "facts" about such people will <i>necessarily</i> be highly interpretive, I appreciate your thoughtful consideration of the issue. —&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">JEREMY</a> 04:50, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Further, "child molester" presumes that the child is unwilling. The western assumption that the child is <i>by definition</i> unwilling, and is thereby being <i>molested</i> rests more upon jurisprudence that a principled philosophical concept of free will. There's no indication that Aisha herself felt molested, except our own assumptions of how we think she must have/ought to have felt. In any case, it's unnecessary: even were a historical figure known <i>primarily</i> for sex with children, we could just state that and let readers judge for themselves.Timothy Usher 05:02, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree. However, I suggest we deal with one description at a time, and right now, I think we should concentrate on the term "pedophile". If nobody provides reliable sources supporting it, we can remove it in a day or two, and that will provide a strong precedent to help prevent its unwarranted reintroduction in future. Then, we can discuss "child molester". —&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">JEREMY</a> 06:33, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The fact is is that Muhammad (as) never had sex with Aisha. Period. There is a doubtworthy Hadith (according to Shias) that he did, but this was when she was a fully grown adult. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmyrifle9_e75f.html" title="User:Armyrifle9">Armyrifle</a></p>

<p>I propose we remove <i>all</i> the unsourced material and original argument here, on "both" sides. It's not quite nonsense, but it <i>is</i> unencyclopedic. Do we really need an "age controversy" section? Wikipedia isn't a debate club, and this article isn't (or shouldn't be) "Criticisms of Muhammad". I honestly, in good faith, believe that the correct way to deal with this is to simply and without prejudice state and attribute the ages to Hadith (as this is the only direct statement which doesn't require our original research or a link to an unreliable source to parse), include some of the apparent contradictions (e.g. Tabari) in a footnote, delete all the weak sources and just leave it at that.Timothy Usher 06:49, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Timothy, again I agree with you in principle but not in practice. Indeed, the "age controversy" is a figment of wikipedia's collective imagination, and is irrelevant in the context of everyday, mainstream and academic understandings of Aisha and Muhammad. However, this viewpoint unfairly dismisses certain editors with a good faith intent to add what they see as truthfulness to the article as cranks promoting fringe POV, which I don't think is fair to them. Instead, we need to discuss the changes thoroughly and explain carefully why they're being made, and whittle away at the egregious bias bit by bit. The establishment of clear and cogent explanations for our decisions regarding push-button populist issues such as this will improve the project in the long run. —&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">JEREMY</a> 11:12, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, the internal link for Muhammad should be sufficient as to who he was. Also, the <i>Aisha is controversial</i> part seems to veer off in some areas.

<p>A reference to role of Muhammad in muslim community was needed, as it is important to contextualize the role of Aisha and her position as Umm ul Momineen in the muslim commmunity.</p>
<p>They are part of her historical identity, and easily slipping two words <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet.html" title="Prophet">prophet</a> infront of Muhammad acheives all of this without having a read veer off to another link to work it out. Remember readers can come via random processes and exploration of links they do not have to be either looking for the information specifically or even be aware of her in relation to the appropiate Muhammad. The objection being raised is NPOV, because NPOV applies to honorifics but not to descriptors. Linking the use of the word with <b>Islam</b> when used appropriately here can be modified to an NPOV tone enabling it to be used to describe and provide descriptive information that will allow the reader to easily align himself towards the correct frame of reference, without clunking the sentence as in this case. Removing all reference to the term prophet would be doing the wikipedia's purpose of dissemination of information a disservice and actually impedes the readibiliy and comprehension of articles, the Wiki policy acknowledges that and distinguishes between its use as a honorific and otherwise and using the term Islam or Muslim <b>IS</b> following the recommendation of the policy.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigeroo_ae66.html" title="User:Tigeroo">Tigeroo</a> 12:29, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This argument is why the page protection was initiated by Pecher. Pecher you are talking about what editors know not what readers will know. Play it safe especially it does not hurt but improves and enchance the amount of information dispensed by the article, as it stands it is not user friendly relevant details deserve mention at least cursory on this page and the link can be followed for greater information on many other things. Plus mentioning prophet ties in with the role/status of Aisha in the muslim community and is directly related to her title. It is even allowed by the wikipedia style manual on islam you love to use. It is not used as a honorific, I do understand why when properly contextualized and NPOV'ed according to Wiki guidlines you have an aversion to even stating that he is a prophet of Islam.

Here is the complete story:</p>
<p>1. The historical accounts to Aisha's age state she was married to Muhammad at age of six or seven. She then stayed in her parents' home till she had reached puberty. The traditions say this happened at nine (or maybe ten according to Ibn Hisham) and then her marriage with Muhammad was consummated. ONE PART OF THE STORY IS FINISHED NOW.</p>
<p>2. There are several other historical references (quotes from Aisha'a father, etc) however that contradict Aisha being married to Muhammad at the age of nine. Spelberg points out the contradictions but discredits those traditions rather than other traditions on Aisha's age. Some other scholars do otherwise. That's it. Zora has interesting theories of the motivation for possible production of Aisha's age traditions. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 04:28, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mike18xx, I don't really have the energy to get into discussion. I quote something from Watt and quit this discussion right now: <i>"From the standpoint of Muhammad's time, then, the allegations of treachery and sensuality cannot be maintained. His contemporaries did not find him morally defective in any way. On the contrary, some of the acts criticized by the modern Westerner show that Muhammad's standards werehigher than those of his time. In his day and generation he was a social reformer, even a reformer in the sphere of morals. He created a new system of social security and a new family structure, both of which were a vast improvement on what went before. By taking what was best in the morality of the nomad and adapting it for settled communities, he established a religious and social framework for the life of many races of men.

<dd>Aminz, if you're too tired to defend your position, don't edit contentious articles. The issue is <i>far</i> from solved. Every aspect of the historicity of Muhammed and Aisha (like that of Jesus) is debatable. Why should one set of hadiths be more respected than a set which contradicts them? Because they favour the political position of one Muslim denomination over that of another? You seem to have mistaken history for Truth, rather than accepting that it is simply not possible — without the assistance of some magical device — to know "what really happened", if anything. As such, the only way we can present an encyclopaedic treatment of this subject is to present <i>every</i> point of view, in proportion to the commonality of that view. —&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">JEREMY</a> 08:01, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You really do need to read and <i>understand</i> what the <b>Argument from Ignorance</b> logical fallacy *is* -- because you're indulging in it; your "History is not science" is simply a confession that you don't want to do any hard work in the matter of verification. I shouldn't have to point out that no <i>credible</i> encyclopedia will give truth and error equal-time (because, after all, that's what differentiates a credible encyclopedia from a slap-dash one), and that those who haven't the vaguest idea what's true have no business helping write them.

<p>Jeremy, I don't get how my comment above shows my own POV (that which set of hadiths are more respected). I just reported the views of both parties. My third comment was also quite correct. I'll take it back if you can find for me an 7-8-9th century critic who has criticized Muhammad for his marriage to Aisha. I have a vague memory that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_Damascus_1926.html" title="John of Damascus">John of Damascus</a>,in his book, The Fount of Wisdom, does criticize marriage of Muhammad with Zayd but I don't remember anything about Aisha. It is possible that I am wrong.

<dd>Original research, Aminz. You must quote reliable secondary sources that say how old Aisha was.

<p>Western academics believe that most of them are fabricated. Islamic scholars put more trust in them, but even they battle over which hadith should be trusted and which rejected. Sheesh. Sometimes you insist that Western academics are right, Islamic scholars are unreliable -- when it serves your purposes. But now, it serves your purposes to ignore all of Western academia and say, "Yup, these hadith are true."

<dd>Zora, you're making a straw-man argument by mis-charcterizing the arguments of the other side. The only important thing is how academic and Muslim scholars have interpreted the hadith relating to Aisha's age at the time Muhammad consummated marriage with her. So far, the consensus view of both academic and Muslim scholars is that she was nine (at most, ten). If you ahve credible sources saying otherwise, cite them, but a general response that hadith are not reliable will cut no ice.

<dd>Pecher is right that most Muslims believe that Aisha was married at very young age. But <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> is also right that if you criticize traditions of Muslims (which can be read in <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a> literature), then why can't we criticize these hadith for which some people have found very reasonable explanations. Wikipedia is a place where arguments for minority are also entertained, otherwise for a novice reader, he will never be able to see the other side of the picture.

<p>"They adduce the following episodes as proof that Muhammad and Aisha's marriage did not always go smoothly." needs to be clearified.</p>
<p>It is directly followed with adultery issue, implying that Shi'a argue She was guilty. Shi'a do no such thing, and it needs to be clearfied. It is acctualy one of the missconseptions against the Shi'a that Shi'a belive she was guilty, Sunnis are known to quote the Qur'an to "Correct" the Shi'a stance.</p>
<p>So the article needs to state that Shi'a do not regard her as guilty, and that Sunnis have not understood this, quoting the Qur'an to try to "overprove" Shi'a on a stance they do not even hold.</p>
<p>The acctual Shi'a stance is that due to their non-perfect relation, Muhammad (pbuh) did not immediatly dissmissed the allgations.</p>
<p>There is a <b>big</b> difference. We do NOT belive she was guilty, but we POINT OUT that the allegations were not outright dissmissed, and that she was not even supported. In fact, Muhammad wondering what to do about it summms it upp quit well. Also, the article needs to state that Ali did not try to defend her, rather adviced Muhammad that there are other women.</p>
