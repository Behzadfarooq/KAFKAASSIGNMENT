Approximate territory of the Ais tribe in the late 17th Century</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>Ais</b>, or <b>Ays</b> were a tribe of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native Americans</a> who inhabited the Atlantic Coast of <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>. They ranged from present day Cape Canaveral to the St. Lucie River Inlet, in the present day counties of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brevard_County%2C_Florida_c9a2.html" title="Brevard County, Florida">Brevard</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_River_County%2C_Florida_1235.html" title="Indian River County, Florida">Indian River</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Lucie_County%2C_Florida_6d1a.html" title="St. Lucie County, Florida">St. Lucie</a>. They lived in villages and towns along the shores of the great lagoon called <i>Rio de Ais</i> by the Spanish, and now called the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_River_%28Florida%29_8dd7.html" title="Indian River (Florida)">Indian River</a>.</p>
<p>Little is known of the origins of the Ais, or of the affinities of their language. The Ais language has been tentatively assigned by some authors to the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muskogean_languages.html" title="Muskogean languages">Muskogean language family</a>, and by others to the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arawakan_languages.html" title="Arawakan languages">Arawakan language family</a>.</p>
<p>Observations on the appearance, diet and customs of the Ais at the end of the 17th Century are found in <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Dickinson_cb9b.html" title="Jonathan Dickinson">Jonathan Dickinson</a>'s <i>Journal</i>. Dickinson and his party were shipwrecked, and spent several weeks among the Ais in 1696. By Dickinson's account, the chief of the town of Jece, near present day <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vero_Beach%2C_Florida_2fdb.html" title="Vero Beach, Florida">Vero Beach</a>, was paramount to all of the coastal towns from the <a href="../../../j/a/e/Jaega_%28tribe%29.html" title="Jaega (tribe)">Jaega</a> town of Jobe (at <a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupiter_Inlet%2C_Florida_cea9.html" title="Jupiter Inlet, Florida">Jupiter Inlet</a>) in the south to approximately <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Canaveral_6e9e.html" title="Cape Canaveral">Cape Canaveral</a> in the north (that is, the length of the <i>River of Ais</i>).<sup id="_ref-journal_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-journal" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Ais had considerable contact with <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europeans</a> by this time. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> had established some control over the coast, with the Ais regarding the Spanish as <i>comerradoes</i> and non-Spanish Europeans as enemies. A number of Ais men knew a little <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>, and a patrol of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> soldiers from <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Augustine%2C_Florida_ac4e.html" title="St. Augustine, Florida">St. Augustine</a> arrived in Jece while the Dickinson party was there. There was one man in Jece who had been taken away on an English ship to work as a diver on a wreck east of <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>. He got away when the ship put in for water in Cuba, and had made his way back to his home via <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havana%2C_Cuba_18bc.html" title="Havana, Cuba">Havana</a> and St. Augustine. The Ais had many European artifacts from ship wrecks. As there was a group from another English shipwreck in Jece when the Dickinson party reached the town, it may be presumed that European and African survivors of shipwrecks were fairly common along the coast. There was also some trade with St. Augustine. Dickinson reports that one man of Jece had approximately five pounds of <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambergris.html" title="Ambergris">ambergris</a>, and that he "boasted that when he went for Augustine with that, he would purchase of the Spaniards a looking-glass, an axe, a knife or two, and three or four <i>mannocoes</i> (which is about five or six pounds) of tobacco."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Ais did not survive long after Dickinson's sojourn with them. Shortly after 1700 settlers in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolina.html" title="Carolina">Carolina</a> started raiding the Ais to capture slaves. By 1743, when the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> established a mission among them, the Ais numbers were declining due to slave raids, disease and <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rum.html" title="Rum">rum</a>. The Ais were gone from the area by 1760.</p>

<p>Dickinson stated that the Ais "neither sow nor plant any manner of thing whatsoever" (p. 36), but fished and gathered <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmetto.html" title="Palmetto">palmetto</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocoplum.html" title="Cocoplum">cocoplum</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seagrape.html" title="Seagrape">seagrape</a> berries. Dickinson described the fishing technique of the neighboring Jaega people of Jobe thus:</p>
<dl>
<dd>[T]he <a href="../../../c/a/c/Cacique.html" title="Cacique">Casseekey</a> [of Jobe] ... sent his son with his stiking staff to the inlet to strike fish for us; which was performed with great dexterity; for some of us walked down with him, and though we looked very earnestly when he threw his staff from him could not see a fish at which time he saw it, and brought it onshore on the end of his staff. Sometimes he would run swiftly pursuing a fish, and seldom missed when he darted at him. In two hours time he got as many fish as would serve twenty men[.]<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Ais boiled their fish, and ate them from 'platters' of palmetto leaf:</p>
<dl>
<dd>About noon was some fish brought us on small palmetto leaves, being boiled with scales, head and gills, and nothing taken from then but the gut[.]<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Dickinson also recorded a gift of clams to his wife:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This day the Cassekey [of Jece] ... made presents to some of us, especially to my wife; he gave her a parcel of shellfish, which are known by the name of clams; one or two he roasted and gave her, showing that she must serve the rest so, and eat them.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Ais dried some of the berries they gathered for future use:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This week we observed that great baskets of dried berries were brought in from divers towns and delivered to the king or Young Caseekey [of Jece.]<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Dickinson does not say anything about the Ais hunting, but they did use deer skins, and the neighboring Jaega people of Jobe gave the Dickinson party a hog they had killed.</p>
<p><a name="Clothing" id="Clothing"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/s/Ais_%28tribe%29.html" title="Edit section: Clothing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Clothing</span></h2>
<p>The Ais men wore a "loincloth" of woven palm leaves. Dickinson describes this as:</p>
<dl>
<dd>being a piece of platwork of straws wrought of divers colors and of a triangular figure, with a belt of four fingers broad of the same wrought together, which goeth about the waist and the angle of the other having a thing to it, coming between the legs, and strings to the end of the belt; all three meeting together are fastened behind by a horsetail, or a bunch of silkgrass exactly resembling it, of a flaxen color, this being all of the apparel or covering that the men wear.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>He has little to say on how the women dressed, recording only that his wife and female slaves were given "raw deer skins" with which to cover themselves after their European clothing had been taken away. Women of the Tequesta tribe, to the south of the Ais, were reported to wear "shawls" made of woven palm leaves, and "skirts” made from draped fibers from the Spanish dagger (<a href="../../../y/u/c/Yucca.html" title="Yucca">Yucca</a>), similar to the "grass" skirts of Hawaii.</p>

<p>Dickinson states that the town of Jece "stood about half a mile from the seashore within the land on the sound, being surrounded with a swamp, in which grew <a href="../../../l/a/g/Laguncularia_racemosa.html" title="Laguncularia racemosa">white mangrove</a> trees, which hid the town from the sea."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dickinson describes the <a href="../../../c/a/c/Cacique.html" title="Cacique">Cacique</a>'s house in Santa Lucea as "about forty foot long and twenty-five foot wide, covered with palmetto leaves both top and sides. There was a range of cabins, or a barbecue on one side and two ends. At the entering on one side of the house a passage was made of benches on each side leading to the cabins."<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
