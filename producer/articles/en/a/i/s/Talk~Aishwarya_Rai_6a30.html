<p>I put in an IPA transcription of her name, but I've never written in IPA before so it's probably wrong. Someone should check out how I've done it and see if I've written it correctly. Here's how her name is pronounced.</p>

<dd>I've always heard it pronounced with a 'sh' sound. When I've said it with a 'sh' sound, people have always known who I am talking about. I'm sure that in Hindi it's a 'sh' sound.

<dd>The way it is pronounced and written in South Indian languages is with a -ce sound and since she is a South Indian, I guess that the Hindi pronunciation you refer to can be considered non-standard. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 18:30, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK then. I accept that 'ce' is how it's pronounced in S Indian languages but I'm still a little wary about putting that down as its pronunciation. Call me stubborn, but I'd like a third opinion. Do you know of any sources which back up your 'ce' claim. (Not that I'm calling you a liar, but indulge me. Hehe) BokuAlec 19:22, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certainly I am not an authority. Just a big fan who has followed Aishwarya quite a lot, even having an website on her. Point is, I have never heard her being called with the 'ice' sound - it has always been with 'sh' sound. Unfortunately, I have always heard her name being used in Hindi or English context (interviews, news reports, and award functions, where she herself is present). I am not sure if the logic is correct that since she is South Indian, she should be called with her South Indian name (quite apart from the fact that I am not so sure she is pronounced with the 'ice' sound in South India) - the word is basically Sanskrit! So going by how most people in India call her, I think her pronounciation should have the 'sh' sound. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPriyatu_9ccc.html" title="User:Priyatu">GrubStreet</a> 13:26, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not familiar with IPA. But I know for sure what the pronunciation is. It should be 'eye-sh-were-ya <b>rye'</b>. Somebody please change it to reflect the correct pronunciation. As for Gurubrahma's assertion that it is pronounced 'ice' in S Indian languages, I can tell you that it is <b>WRONG</b>. It may be true of telugu and tamil and maybe malayalam, but it is certainly not true of Kannada and Tulu. Both these languages use the Kannada script and we read/pronounce what we write and write what we say/pronounce.</dd>

<p>Hi, Anorion -- I removed your update, and also the sentence re "highest-paid actress in Bollywood". Since the pay was said only to be rumour, and since you have a counter-rumour, it's probably prudent to remove the sentence. But the update was also a series of rumours. Rivalry with Sushmita Sen? Romance with Vivek? I dunno. Shabd may not be a hit, but that doesn't mean her career is on the skids. She's still being treated like the queen bee by Rediff.com and Sepia Mutiny, the sites I read. Not to mention all the fanboys on rec.arts.movies.local.indian, on Usenet &lt;g&gt;. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 18:42, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>actually i tried to edit something someone else had already done... were you that guy? Anyway, I knew it didn't come out too well... the thing with sushmita, if it is a rumour, then it is a long standing rumour. She is known for that, it is a part of all the things associated with her, and therefore, it must be put. What about, "it is rumoured that, there has been a rivalry..." A line like "she is currently dating Vivek Oberoi" would not be too much out of place, as both of them have almost agreed to it on media... especially vivek oberoi. and the line "highest paid actress" remains.</p>

<dd>As for rumors re rivalries, romantic involvements, etc. -- I don't think that Wikipedia is the place for gossip-column stuff. That is just too easily available elsewhere. I do agree that sometimes it's important. We've got the Nargis-Raj Kapoor liason noted in their articles, because it was long-standing and it helps to understand the films they did together. I don't think Dharmendra-Hema Malini is noted, but that might be relevant. Amitabh-Jaya Badhuri is relevant, and noted. Aishwarya-Salman Khan is noted on Salman's page, just briefly ... hmmm. How about saying something like, "Aish has many fans, and Aishwarya gossip is a staple of entertainment columnists. She is one of the best-known bachelorettes in Bollywood, and her romantic adventures (romances with Bollywood stars Salman Khan and Vivek Oberoi) have been followed with breathless interest."</dd>

<dd>I gather that she had an uncle who had blue eyes, I've seen pictures of her brother and parents and certainly by Indian standards they are very fair although not as fair as she is - but they appear to have dark eyes and hair unlike her, she has chestnut hair. The genes for Blue eyes (in fact hers are a sort of Blue Green but the genes for Green eyes while dominant over Blue and Grey eyes are recessive to the genes for Yellow, Hazel, Brown and Black), broadly speaking there are 2 main types of gene one for Blond eyes and the other which is normally dominant for Dark Eyes - there are further genes which sort of fine tune the colour - anyway there have been cases that clearly are not due to <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adultery.html" title="Adultery">adultery</a> in which parents have apparently had children which do not fit conventionally into the pattern thought to be likely to be due to failures in recombination resulting in dominant genes not working properly resulting in fairer eye colours, apparently usually in the next generation as a result of recombination occuring correctly then someone with 2 Blue Eyed Parents could end up with a Brown or Black eyed child, because the genes for blonder eyes are recessive someone with dark eyes can have one and yet have Hazel\Yellow\Brown\Black eyes themselves so it might be that both of her parents have the genes that would cause this or that one does and there has been a problem during recombination or that there has been a rather freakish occurence of more than one gene failing to recombine properly, the probability is one of the first 2, anyway there is a Wikipedia article here on the subject of <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eye_Color_9b40.html" title="Eye Color">Eye Colour\Color</a>.--<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_of_the_Isles_87b7.html" title="User:Lord of the Isles">Lord of the Isles</a> 18:18, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I edited the first part about her "being hailed as the most beautiful woman in the world on 60 Minutes". This statement was highly inaccurate as neither Bob Simon, nor the producers of 60 Minutes were "hailing her as the most beautiful woman in the world"; they were giving their viewers a chance to judge for themselves. She was, in fact, only interviewed, and not "hailed" by Simon. Also, her interview on 60 Minutes, The Oprah Winfrey Show, and David Letterman, was in fact, generated by the international media's curiosity in all things Bollywood AND of Ms. Rai, since Gurinder Chadha made it world-known that she was to star in her next venture. The West's curiosity in Bollywood is only an astute observation due to the fact that Indian films are thrust into the midst of Western culture by way of television (asian channels), musicals/parodies (Lloyd Weber/Rahman production of Bombay Dreams) and world/popular music (rifts of Indian music within rap, and other genres of Western music). However, it is chronologically true that Aishwarya Rai was interviewed on 60 Minutes AFTER her fans (mostly Indian; there is an article which provides substantial evidence, <a href="http://ww1.mid-day.com/news/world/2004/january/74149.htm" class="external free" title="http://ww1.mid-day.com/news/world/2004/january/74149.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ww1.mid-day.com/news/world/2004/january/74149.htm</a>) propped her status to #1 in the rankings in the Hello! Magazine poll. After watching the segment on 60 Minutes, it was perfectly clear that she was not being "Hailed as..." but was being interviewed in the same context as any "novelty" would be introduced if it had a certain status somewhere else which generated enough interest to be examined by others outside of the novelty's normal realm. It is much to the discredit of her overly zealous fans who blur the lines of reality and write exultations and falsities for the sake of masking their adoration of her as "fact" or for the sake of condensing the actual facts, as they were. This is an encyclopedia and the facts need to be adhered to in all forms. Note: beauty never becomes a fact, it is ALWAYS an opinion no matter how many people proclaim it, and that too only in the eyes of the beholder(s). i.e. it would be wrong of me to write a Wikipedia entry on Audrey Hepburn exulting her, writing that she was one of the only actresses in her time who's natural beauty exuded onto her visage, something which one does not see in today's actresses. No matter how much I (and others) think this is true, it does NOT become a fact, it is only an opinion. Encyclopedias should not become shrines for over-zealous fans who wish to contribute something about their favourite celebrity. Perhaps they should start a fan webpage or contribute to an existing one.</p>

<p>This is not to be added anywhere or taken as fact (that's why it's in the hoax section). I'd just like to say that there's no other woman in the world best fitted to be Wonder Woman in the future movie. I insert this info here because Ash has actually been mentioned by a few, so she may be a runner-up. The part would demand: a notch further than "drop-dead gorgeous" (AR is), exotic looks (AR has), stunning well-filled body (ditto), good height (AR is 1,70m), a somewhat different accent, as WW is greek (AR speaks more than 4 languages), never a totally white American woman, as WW is Mediterranean (AR has that beautiful - natural? - tan), and also an experienced actress (dunno about AR skills on that, but she sure is experienced).</p>

<dd>Dunno about the top ten list. I probably should have checked. However, I do believe that Ash is sorta big in the West. Speaking as a foreigner. If she's chosen to appear on talk shows, she has some celebrity they want to exploit. However, it's minor celebrity.

i doubt she'll have any romantic entanglements with anyone other than an indian actor. and, as far as being "big in the west", she has been blown up by the indian media (namley, the times of india publication) and therefore caught the attention of the west so quickly; before she was thrust upon the cannes film festival, no one had ever heard of her outside of the indian movie watching population.</p>

<dd>Notable isn't the most important criteria, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> is. And yes, while we don't need to include all trivia, the languages someone speaks are a reasonable biographical fact. It also takes up very little space. That not every other biography contains it doesn't make it useless. Including who she is dating depends on the source. If it is from a gossip column that clearly doesn't meet WP:V, but if it was from a highly reputable publication or from an interview with her, makes it much more reasonable to include. I don't know the source on the dating bit that was included, but I would guess it wasn't on the highly reputable side.

<p>I took away two of the pictures. One of them was from Aishwarya-forever.com (their URL is written over it) and I'm not sure if we have their permission to display it here. Also, I took away the Cosmopolitan picture, because I feel three pix are simply to many. If Ash has three pix, every other Bollywood star can have that many pictures too and we would all be drowning in pictures. I know Ashwarya is more famous, than Isha Koppikar, for example, but allowing more pictures based on popularity of a person isn't exactly a very neutral way to do things. If they show something significant, like the TIME pic and someone would add another one where you can see Ash's face properly, I think it would be okay (given the fact that the pictures aren't copyvio), but simply, because it looks nice to have so many visual evidence on one article doesn't qualify as a reason to overload it. Even it's an article on someone so beautiful as Aishwarya Rai.

<dd>I think we discussed this on the talkpage of <a href="../../../i/n/c/WP%7EINCINE_fdbd.html" title="WP:INCINE">WP:INCINE</a> - the no. of pics would be proportionate to the length of the text but would be limited to three. Also, since ppl. keep adding images from all sort of places (just see the history), it is best to leave no place by having three well-sourced images - all of them are from magazine covers. The "Time" cover, imo, does not do justice to her billing as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is needed for the article to hint at her growing international stature. Aishwarya-forever.com is not the URL but the cover story of the magazine, titled to hint that Aishwarya is going to be in the news forever, worldwide. may sound funny, but true. Also, this was the first and only image on the page when I started tracking it; I am loathe to remove it, because this would lead to clamour of rotating images regularly. I am all for removing the cosmopolitan image if we can get a well sourced image (magazine) portraying her in a saree, but till such time we need to retain these images so that it doesn't increase the janitorial work on removing other images that would surely come in. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 16:58, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On 15 March 2006 I had updated some information in the "Personal Life" section, saying that tales of her marriage to Abhishek were doing the rounds. Fact or fiction, this was very much in the news, and day after day and in paper after paper the news and pictures were shown on newspaper frontpages and inside pages, with whole magazines being devoted to the topic. Apart from movies, the alleged alliance is the most talked about topic in Bollywood right now. I don't know why this part was omitted and the section was reverted to the previous condition. Just doesn't make sense, as it might be considered 'serious' within her personal life, especially since the far less talked about Oberoi affair is displayed with whom talks of MARRIAGE were NEVER in the air. Absolutely doesn't make sense. Living in India, reading stuff on her, and being an avid fan of hers (I even have a whole website on her), I do live Aishwarya more often that people ouside might do. Besides, I do not know what "dynasty icon" means, in context of Abhishek! I understand the implication and the innuendo, but I do NOT think there is any reason to bring that aspect of the actor's identification without providing sufficient context. Besides, the context does not deserve such identification. Perhaps the adjective could be removed. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPriyatu_9ccc.html" title="User:Priyatu">GrubStreet</a> 07:41, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

However, the 2006 image is GNU-licensed, while the 2005 image is copyrighted by the AFP under claim of fair use. I think the fair use is solid, but I also think we should opt for licensed images when possible; in fact, the ready availability of a licensed option weakens the argument for fair use. Besides, I don't think it's any worse a picture. But I thought it was a close enough call to get a few other opinions before settling on one image.

<dd>It appears suspect whether this 2006 image is actually covered by a GNU-license or has just been incorrectly tagged as such by the uploader. The uploader hasn't provided any information to confirm copyright ownership and anyone can obtain an image and slap a GNU license tag on it. They also uploaded a promotional photo from Mistress of Spices under a GNU-license. It's unlikely they have the authority to release this image under GNU license unless they work for the studio which produced this film. Right now, this appears to be a case of incorrect license tagging for both of the newly uploaded images. Unless the uploader can provide proof of his/her copyright ownership, I don't think the 2006 image should be considered to have a GNU license.Santress 08:10, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

She never acted in the telugu Movie called 'Mamagaru' by the character name 'Rani'. 'Aishwarya' in mamagaru' is unknown telugu actress of the 90's and has no physical or other facial similarities with the actress Aishwarya Rai as this article deals in. What Kind of Physical Evidence is to be produced before WP registered Users before they can take notice of this glaring mistake.Eventhough WP is not responsible for IMdb's accuracy of filmography it is something to be considered by all registered users and participating voters of WP when IMDb is the WP 'Standard' for reporting or citing Filmography of all actresses/actors irrespective of the actual facts which can be found on more accurate sites on Indian Cinema. <i>..Anon Alleged Vandal of DiaMirza Article.</i></p>

<dd>I did some googling on that Mamagaru movie and IMDb is not the only one who lists the movie as Ash's first.

Maybe IMDb mixed up something about because apparantly, Aishwarya Rai was only credited as "Aishwarya" and they confused her with an actress which is regularly credited as "Aishwarya". There is a comment over at IMDb which says that the movie features "a very young Aishwarya" in bad light. I think she played in that movie. --<a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumcouch_6211.html" title="User:Plumcouch">Plumcouch</a> 14:26, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>-Well i being active member of Ash-forever rented vcd of the Movie 'Mamagaru' in telugu and watched the full length of it and has seen titles and the actress. It is not her. Since Personal research is not approved means of information for WP Policy What can be done by me to prove this point..Or is it a policy of WP that it doesn't matter if IMDb has right or wrong information? One method is to contact 'Aishwarya Rai' official site to check the filmography or to contact or gather information of the movie from the Producer of the movie who today is a politician in the country. <i>..Anon Alleged Vandal of DiaMirza Article.</i></p>

<p>I never said WP violated any copyright. I only asked you will WP link copyright violating sites?(in this case there is no othe alternative). As far as i know 'fair use' is a principle invoked when somebody accuses you of Copyright violation. News papers/tc channels all others run on this principle. WP doesn't violate any copyright here by linking the said reference or by stating simply the fact. So the question of 'fair use' doesn't arise. It is only that i am interested in knowning whether WP doesn't mind copyright violation links on its page. And the answer seems to be 'yes' when there is no other verifiable source. <b>..Anon Alleged Vandal of Dia Mirza Article.</b></p>

<dd>I'd say: No, Wikipedia doesn't link sites who violate copyrights. Most sites which *do* violate copyrights are fansites anways and News Sites, such as BBC or Rediff own the pictures and texts they display, so they are accepted.

Opinions on that? --<a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumcouch_6211.html" title="User:Plumcouch"><font color="#BF7EE0"><b>Plum</b></font><font color="#FFCC00"><b>couch</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/l/u/User_talk%7EPlumcouch_4047.html" title="User talk:Plumcouch"><b>Talk2Me</b></a></sup> 19:05, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Shez, defending Rani's "title" as Queen, removed the title from Aish's article. But wait! A check with google shows 24,000 hits for the term "Queen of Bollywood" and it seems that the following actresses and singers have been dubbed "Queen of Bollywood":</p>
<p>Aishwarya, Rani, Asha Bhosle, Lata Mangeshkar, Priyanka Chopra, Kajol, Preity Zinta, and Helen. And that's only looking at the first few screens of the google results.</p>
<p>It seems to be a slang term for whoever is deemed to be the top actress/singer/dancer, a matter which is hotly debated by fans, and CANNOT be taken as belonging to any one actress. Hence I reverted Shez's partisan attack on an actress he sees as Rani's rival. I will go to Rani's article and change the language there accordingly. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:36, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Karela keeps restoring a list of trivial and ephemeral awards, without any references. I don't think awards should be listed if they're not notable and referenced. Notable means that, at the very least, the issuing organization has a WP article. If they're not notable enough for an article, then the award has no real value. I would tighten it even further and say that the award has to have an article. Filmfare awards have an article, just like the Oscars. If the organization maintains a website with lists of awards given, then no references need be given -- it's easy enough to check an entry. However, if the organization doesn't maintain a roster of awards given, then there should be a reference, online or published by a reputable press, for the award.</p>
<p>If I had an article (which I don't), then I could claim that the Homeowners' Association of Lower Makiki gave me Best Garden of the Year Award for 2006. There's no such association or award, but who could tell if references aren't required? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:53, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
