<p>I think there is confusion here over words and their meaning: In modern English, marriage mostly means consummation, or is simultaneous with it. However, it was a tradition in Arabia, as it is still in many places in the world, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, to have a legal ceremony (e.g. Ketubah in Judaism, "Half a Garland" for Coptic Christians, ...etc.). The actual consummation was done later. It could be a week later, or a few months, or even years. In the case of Aisha, it was after she reached puberty, at nine. So to say that she married at six is inaccurate, since they did not live together as husband and wife nor had sex until she was 9. Here is a reference from Sahih Al Bukhari&#160;: <i>Narrated 'Aisha: that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death)</i>. It is also clear from Ibn Hajar's commentary (Arabic) <a href="http://hadith.al-islam.com/Display/Display.asp?Doc=0&amp;Rec=5832" class="external autonumber" title="http://hadith.al-islam.com/Display/Display.asp?Doc=0&amp;Rec=5832" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> that it was Abu Bakr, Aisha's father, who prompted Muhammad to consummate the marriage, saying "what is holding you from consummating your marraige with your wife"? It was a normal thing to do in 7th century Arabia and other places in the world. -- <a href="../../../k/b/a/User%7EKbahey_fe17.html" title="User:Kbahey">KB</a> 02:58, 2004 Aug 18 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aisha was <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betrothed.html" title="Betrothed">betrothed</a> to Muhammad. This common medieval custom has passed from usage in the West. The vague references to the hadith that record Aisha's testimony are not made specific here. Why is this?

<dd>Regarding betrothal, I think that I agree with you. Marriage at age 6 was not considered marriage as we consider it today, but rather betrothal or engagement. As for the rest of your comment, there is no vague reference at all. I have included a link to the original Arabic text of the <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a> in Sahih of <a href="../../../b/u/k/Bukhari.html" title="Bukhari">Bukhari</a>, and the commentary of Ibn Hajar on it. The Sahih is considered the most authentic compilation of tradition of the prophet by <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni.html" title="Sunni">Sunni</a> Muslims, who form the vast majority of Muslims. An English translation of the Sahih exists, but not the commentary by Ibn Hajar. I added it to the article on Bukhari himself. -- <a href="../../../k/b/a/User%7EKbahey_fe17.html" title="User:Kbahey">KB</a> 22:57, 2004 Aug 30 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to some Arab sources whom I have no reason to distrust, "consummation" in this context does mean sexual intercourse.

<dd>The discussion above is to clarify that marriage is not equal to consummation, as it is common today (they are almost simultaneous, at least in Western countries). This had no 'shock effect' then and there, but does have that effect now and here, and therefore it is brought up often. It was not even raised in the centuries following that event by opponents of Islam. And the site quoted is not the most objective of all on the topic. -- <a href="../../../k/b/a/User%7EKbahey_fe17.html" title="User:Kbahey">KB</a> 17:01, 2004 Sep 8 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aisha's age is of enormous importance if she was 9 when they had sex then she was raped</p>
<dl>
<dd>If they had sex when she was 19, it still could have been rape. And if they had sex when she was 9, it wasn't necessarily rape. By today's laws, it would be statutory rape, but the laws of today didn't apply in the Seventh Century. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKairos_73c0.html" title="User:Kairos">Kairos</a> 09:15, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find it disappointing that, due to the insecurities of a minority of Muslims, the neutrality and integrity of the article is bound to suffer. The age of Muhammad and Ayesha at and later consummation of that marriage is well attested to by the most genuine/strong narrations and we are as close to undisputedness as can be. Part of maintaining Wikipedia is confronting those individuals who let their personal beliefs distort and prevent an unbiased encyclopedia. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedbook_bd08.html" title="User:Usedbook">Usedbook</a> 19:44, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Shias view</span></h2>
<p>Hi and peace to everybody. Im a shia, and added some more text to the article. I expect i to be un-appreciated by sunnis, even though i only quote sunni sources. Mostly since i bring up events that sunnis rather would like to forget. It would be intresting to get some feedback from sunnis but also from non-muslims.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Striver, you've turned the article into a brief for the Shia point of view on many issues, many of them not related to Aisha at all. Furthermore, you've completely garbled the structure AND you can't write comprehensible or grammatical English. Aargh. This is NOT a Sunni point of view -- I'm a Buddhist. Furthermore, as I've been working on various Islamic articles, I've made an attempt to include Shia viewpoints rather than just the Sunni ones usually represented in outsiders' attempts to understand Islam.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I won't revert, since you may have contributed some useful information in addition to all the polemics. But I am CERTAINLY going to remove the weird account of Aisha's death. That strikes me as one of the many stories circulated by the Abbasids to justify their revolt against the Umayyids. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:13, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Apologistic approach to Aisha</span></h2>
<p>The vast majority of Islamic scholars do believe that Aisha was indeed nine at the age of consumation, so that being the case it seems to be misleading if this article gives quotes that suggest an alternative age first, and only later on does it give quotes that the mainstream Muslim scholars believe</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, the vast majority of sunni Muslim scholars believe that Aisha was 9. That's because sunni Muslims accept Bukhari and Muslim collection as the most authentic. The secular scholars, while not necessarily rejecting Bukhari and Muslim, look at earliest sources, such as Ibn Ishaq. This is not a sunni Muslim encyclopedia. Remember the article on Muhammad? On top of the page the skeptic view about sources was posted. After that the biography started. Since most of the biography of Muhammad comes from Ibn Ishaq .. why do you want to place that earliest source at the bottom and post a latter source like Bukhari on top? Are you sunni Muslim? <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 09:00, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The vast majority of Muslims are Sunni. If you know as much about Islam as you claim, you would recognize that it is only apologist muslims who try to bump up her age over 9.. and even then they can't all agree on single age</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This Encyclopedia is not Sunni. It's a secular Encyclopedia. Secular scholars don't accept Bukhari as more authentic than Ibn Ishaq. Why are you placing earliest source like Ibn Ishaq on bottom and placing 100 years latter source like Bukhari on top? To the main stream secular scholars, Ibn Ishaq is older and more authentic.<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 09:13, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Moreover, my version of the article mentions the sunni Muslim view on top, then it gives alternative evidence that contradict that claim .. latter it gives hadith that support sunni Muslim view .. Your version doesn't even mention the contradictory evidence until the very end. That alone is strong reason to reject your version <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 09:34, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The quotes you are posting is clearly an apologetic attempt to distort and mislead people on the age of Aisha. There are very clear quotes from authentic sources that state her age. She admitted it herself. The quotes you give do not directly say she was a certain age - in fact they are not even talking about Aisha! What you are quoting is after-the-fact damage control looking for any little loophole you can to try to hide the truth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, they are not! Ibn Ishaq is more authentic (according to secular scholars) than Bukhari. Your version of the article doesn't even mention that a source such as Ibn Ishaq (the earliest) contradict the hadith in Bukhari till the very end .... My version on the hand, mentions Aisha narrations on top ... then gives alternative evidence in the next paragraph. Then it again gives counter evidence after that. Your version doesn't even mention Ibn Ishaq till the end. Why is that? <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 09:40, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why change the subject? Face it, the quotes you have do not mention Aisha. It basicly says this and this happened and this date. Then you come to your own conclusions based on that. What you are doing is exactly what a defence attorney would do during a trial when he knows his client is guilty.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Every quote mentions Aisha. Such as, According to Ibn Ishaq's (d. 768), Aisha accepted Islam before Umar ibn al-Khattab.</p>
<p>You see the word Aisha there?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but it is indirect. Yours state "if this, then that". My quotes say "I did this when I was that". Which one is more direct??</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Tabari reports that when Abu Bakr planned on migrating to Ethiopia (8 years before Hijrah), he went to Mut`am - with whose son Aisha was engaged at that time - and asked him to take Aisha as his son's wife. Mut`am refused because Abu Bakr had converted to Islam. If Aisha was only six years old at the time of her marriage, she could not have been born at the time Abu Bakr decided on migrating to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Do you see the word Aisha there?</p>
<p>You can read the read the rest of the quotes yourself. The fact is that my version is more neutral. It starts with mentioning the narrations by Aisha that she was six. It then gives contradictory evince, and ends with quotes from Bukhari. Your version doesn't even mention these strong contradictory evidence, including Ibn Ishaq .. till the very end. Obviously my version presents both sides and is balanced. Your version doesn't. It tries to hide the evidence till very end <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 10:04, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Well, the quotes in Bukhari may or may not be accurate. You didn't answer me.

<p>I agree with <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a>'s ordering of the facts, it makes more sense to allow the article to counterargument the stated facts on Aisha's age first. As there is more information supporting the initial argument to follow this up. Hiding the counterargument below a large list of sources makes it less relevant than it should be in this article. -- [[User:Solitude|<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolitude_2d63.html" title="User:Solitude">Solitude</a>\<sup><a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESolitude_6179.html" title="User talk:Solitude">talk</a></sup>]] 11:05, Nov 16, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tabari reports that when Abu Bakr planned on migrating to Ethiopia (8 years before Hijrah), he went to Mut`am - with whose son Aisha was engaged at that time - and asked him to take Aisha as his son's wife. Mut`am refused because Abu Bakr had converted to Islam. If Aisha was only six years old at the time of her marriage, she could not have been born at the time Abu Bakr decided on migrating to Ethiopia.</dd>

<dd>Tabari in his treatise on Islamic history reports that Abu Bakr had four children and all four were born during the Jahiliyyah - the pre Islamic period. If Aisha was born in the period of jahiliyyah, she could not have been less than 14 years in 1 AH.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Even if this narratives is as it was originaly written, there is no reason to discard all those strong, detailed and explicit hadithes I have quoted. People remember important things better than nonimportant things. The date of the birth of the children of Abu Bakr was not an important as Mohammad's weddings and women.</dd>

<dd>According to Ibn Hajar, Fatima was five years older than Aisha. Fatima is reported to have been born when Muhammad was 35 years old. Muhammad migrated to Medina when he was 52, making Aisha 14 years old in 1 AH.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If Aisha was five years older than Fatima, and Fatima was born when the Prophet was 35 years old, then Aisha was only thirty years younger than Mohammad. At the time of the marriage when the Prophet was 54, Aisha must have been 24 yeas old!!! This is certainly not correct!==OneGuy's quotes are not verified==</dd>

<p>Look, I can stay here for the next 24 hours. I have a lot of free time, as you must have noticed. Either you can continue this revert war or we can make a comprise. You want to add the quotes from Bukhari on top. Fine, but you need to mention the information is disputed in the first two/three paragraphs. And do not delete the sources I posted. References are clearly cited. You can check it by asking someone who has access to these sources, such as <a href="http://answering-islam.org" class="external free" title="http://answering-islam.org" rel="nofollow">http://answering-islam.org</a> <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 14:00, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Gone? But since I know you will be back next day, let me repeat it again. We can revert this article forever, or we can comprise. You can post Bukhari quotes on top.

The references are cited and can be checked. If you can't check them, ask someone, your Christian apologist friends, to check them.

<dd>I don't recommend that (continuing a revert war, I mean). I would recommend one of you taking the high road and voluntarily ceasing to revert while you discuss the matter on the talk page. 168.209.97.34, it wouldn't hurt to wait a few days and see if anyone else can verify the citations. OneGuy, it wouldn't hurt to wait a few days to try to work together to find a wording that both of you can accept. Please keep the long view in mind -- we're writing an encyclopedia that we expect to be around for decades. Allowing the article to be "wrong" for a few days isn't going to hurt in the long run. What <i>is</i> harmful is a revert war. Instead of waging war, how about asking the community at large to take a look. I'm sure you're not the only two interested or knowledgeable in this area. You can ask for outside help at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Requests for comment</a>.

<p>My take on the edit war is simple: OneGuy is right, anon is trying to suppress information from an earlier period which is rather more reliable than the hadiths in question. However, when this page gets unprotected, one thing does need to be changed: Aisha means "living", not "life". - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 09:57, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course he agrees... just look as his name... Mustafaa!!! All Islamic apologists would support those unverifiable and probably forged quotes. If I was a Muslim, I too would try to hide the fact that my prophet had sexual intercourse with a 9 year old child. Strange how ever since OneGuy showed up, half of the articles he edits ends up being protected. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168.209.97.34.html" title="User:168.209.97.34">168.209.97.34</a> 10:14, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How are the sources forged? If you don't have the books and can't read Arabic, that doesn't make them "forged." Plus, Muslims have a right to post opinion agreeing and disagreeing with material posted on wiki. And I told you I am not Muslim, but if you think I am Muslim, fine. I still have the right to edit articles, like Mustafaa.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sirat Rasul Allah</span></h2>
<p>Mr. 168 etc., this is NUTS. Of course Ibn Ishaq is a real book. I have it, in English. <i>The Life of Muhammad</i>, a translation of Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah, with Introduction and Notes by A. Guillaume. Oxford University Press, 16th printing, 2003. Available for $30.95 from Powell's. Order it and read it. That should take you a few months. I haven't finished it myself; 800 pages of teeny tiny print is a lot of reading.</p>
<p>I'm not a Muslim, I'll never BE a Muslim, I'm a Buddhist, thank you, and my only axe to grind in these discussions is accuracy and NPOV. I don't want the various Islamic articles to slip into pious brochures, as they sometimes tend to do, and I don't want them to be anti-Islamic diatribes either. This is a hard balance to strike, given the current political situation, but I think it can be done. You're not helping. Please please come back when you've read something besides various hate-filled web sites, take a username, and be prepared to compromise, if only in the usual Wikipedia way of "A says X and B says not-X". If you want to be A, let B lay out his argument instead of trying to pervert or delete it. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 11:05, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then since you have a copy can you do us a favor and look up those quotes? What do you say about the fact that the majority of Islamic scholars believe that Aisha was nine years old when the prophet had sex with her? Or do you deny that to? And why can't anyone answer my question which is why is such a supposedly authentic biography of Muhammad not available online? Please just check the book from your own personal library and see if those quotes are true to the word?</dd>

<dd>It's not online not only because it's big, but because it's still copyrighted; it was first published in 1955. I believe it's the only English translation. There might be French or German translations from the Arabic that are public domain now.

<dd>I am not trying to make this into an anti-islamic diatribe. If you look at the history, you would see that this article was happy and NPOV until OneGuy pitched up with his godly agenda. My edits of <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> was to give both sides of the man and the religion. Up until recently, <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> was very pro-Mohammad. Now it's a little more POV. As of getting a username.. why? What is the point?

<dd>Because it's the custom here. Because it's the custom online. Even if you conceal your real identity, you should have a stable, named persona online. Zora isn't my real name, but it's my username at Distributed Proofreaders and Wikipedia. When something is signed Zora, people know WHO she is. When you have a usename, you can put up a user page, to tell people about yourself, and you'll have a talk page, where people can leave you messages. The more you relate to people online as if they're real people, with quirks and foibles and unexpected strengths, the less you'll treat them like clay ducks on a shooting range. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 12:00, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

If you were to ask me who raises my blood pressure, I'd say, OneGuy. I'm fairly sure he feels the same way. If I agree with him on something, that's fairly unusual.

<dd>I didn't make the article POV. I posted some evidence that shows that there are contradictory reports. I didn't delete the hadith you posted, unlike you. For sunni Muslims, the most authentic source is Bukhari and Muslim. They will always consider that to be the most authentic source. Plus, they will never admit that Aisha would exaggerate about her age or importance. That doesn't change the fact that there are contradictory tradition about it. The clearest contradiction is in Tabari who in one place claims that all of Abu Bakr children were born in jahylia, and in other place he quotes Aisha that she was nine. Why do you want to delete these contradictory reports and present only one view? The article that I posted clearly said that most Muslims accept she was nine, but don't delete contradictory traditions <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 11:39, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why do most Islamic sites then claim she was nine when she had sex and then justify it by saying it was common at the time. The fact that there are several hadiths who say she was nine, and she said so herself, seems to go on the backburner with you islamic apologists. Do a google search for "Muhammad Aisha Consumation" - 90 percent of all Islamic sites agree with the quotes I gave. It is also strange how everyone who is trying to make Muhammad look like a saint claims they are not a Muslim! Zora is very pro-Muhammad, yet claims to not be a Muslim. OneGuy, too, tries his best to make Muhammad look like a faultless prophet, and he isn't a Muslim! Wow, where are all real Muslims! Let me gues... Mustafaa, you aren't a Muslim either??? Looks like Muhammad's best friends these days are non-Musims! The irony! <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168.209.97.34.html" title="User:168.209.97.34">168.209.97.34</a> 11:40, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I answered you why most Muslim sites wouls say she is nine. They can't deny what Aisha claims, and for them Bukhari is a religious text.

<dd>The Islamic sites that support the 9-year-old at marriage claim do so because they MUST in order to support the Sunni faith in the integrity of the hadith tradition. If they start admitting that Aisha could shade the truth, then all the traditions that depend on her get devalued, and that's more than 2000 of them. The whole edifice of Islamic law would be undermined. They don't like it, but they're stuck. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 12:00, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow! Talk about blaming the victim! The only thing Aisha would have achieved by lying about her age of consumation would be to paint Muhammad in a very bad light. Aisha spoke lovingly of Muhammad so it is very hard to believe she would make up such a story. It certainly doesn't do her any favors either... if anything one would expect Aisha to lie and say she was an older age when she was consumated, or, even better, just not mention it at all. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168.209.97.34.html" title="User:168.209.97.34">168.209.97.34</a> 12:15, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>She didn't see it as painting him in bad light. Moreover, can you post any evidence before 18th century that shows anyone ever claimed it paints him in bad light? There was a lot criticism of his marriage to his adopted son's wife at that time by his enemies, and evidence of the this criticism survives in traditions, but yet no one ever criticized him for his marriage to Aisha.

<dd>That is rather suspicious. Seeing how it debunks the orthodox view that Muhammad had sex with a child one would think the Muslims would be very quick to translate it into English and post it online. But it seems only non-Muslims like Zora and OneGuy are interested into helping Muhammad out of the Aisha issue. Perhaps one of them could be talked into learing Arabic and doing to the translation themselves. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168.209.97.34.html" title="User:168.209.97.34">168.209.97.34</a> 11:51, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your "suspicions" merely demonstrate your ignorance. The reasons you don't find more translations of Ibn Ishaq are two: one, it's extraordinarily long, and there aren't any out-of-copyright translations to rip off (like for Bukhari), as far as I know; two, it's the original source for the story of the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satanic_Verses_6cf4.html" title="Satanic Verses">Satanic Verses</a>. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 11:56, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please can you all get usernames, so it's easier to talk to all of you? It looks like you are all getting cites to back up your positions, which is well and good when controversial topics are being edited. I'm glad that the discussion here is getting somewhere, and it looks like it should soon be safe to unprotect this page.</p>
<p>I'd just like to make one request: when the page is editable again, can we put the discussion of her age at marriage and consummation further down the article, not at the start? I know that the age debate is highly contentious, and it has a place in this article for that reason (the controversy is notable in itself), but a more comprehensive biography of Aisha should precede it. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarada_595b.html" title="User:Karada">Karada</a> 11:33, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><a name="References_from_Ibn_Ishaq" id="References_from_Ibn_Ishaq"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">References from Ibn Ishaq</span></h2>
<p>On page 116 of the English version, there's a list of the people who accepted Islam after the first eight men (who included Abu Bakr). In the list are:</p>
<p>Asma d. Abu Bakr together with his little daughter Aisha.</p>
<p>So that would be sometime around 613. The narrative proceeds chronologically, and some pages later we have the emigration to Abyssinia and the conversion of Umar, sometime around 615, page 155.</p>
<p>We don't know how little is little, but presumably Aisha was something more than an infant, since she is said to accepted Islam. Perhaps she was old enough to speak? Two or three years old? If she was born in 610-611, and the Hegira was in 622, and she was married sometime in the year after the Hegira, that puts her age at anything from eleven to twelve or even older. Since 12-14 is the average age of menarche, and she is supposed to have reached puberty before she entered Muhammad's household, that would seem a likely chronology. (Re marrying at 12 -- in my biography of Guru Dutt, the famous Indian film director, the author notes that the director's mother was married at the age of 12, just after she reached puberty. This is not unusual, however strange it may seem to Westerners.)</p>
<p>The other point I should make, as an anthropologist, is that Ibn Ishaq doesn't give dates. It's just this happened and that happened, in sequence. All the dating comes later, as later Muslim commentators counted years from the Hegira, before the Hegira, correlated this and that, and finally came up with chronologies. Before universally accepted calendars, people date by significant events. (It says in Ibn Ishaq that Muhammad was born in the year of the elephant.) Or by years before and after significant events. So it's possible that Aisha might not really have known when she was born, or how old she was, and that when she said "9", she wasn't exaggerating so much as guessing.</p>
<p>I'm pushing this argument because based on a lot of reading in anthropology and history, it was extremely common for betrothals or formal marriages to be contracted while the principals were still pre-pubescent, and that consummation of the marriage would be delayed until after puberty. If Muhammad's marriage was arranged with Aisha's family, and delayed until she grew up, it seems to me extremely likely that she would have been post-pubescent and at least 12. Muslims are stuck with the 9-year-old figure because they don't dare question hadith. Other scholars can be more iconoclastic.</p>
<p>I should add that I've spent hours poring over Ibn Ishaq trying to find info re Muhammad's marriages, and it's in short supply. No one is much interested in Muhammad's wives. Instead, every single raid or military engagement is described in detail, together with lists of the dead and wounded. Apparently this is the sort of thing Muslim warriors liked to remember. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 13:40, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know how different this is from Arabic version, but as cited by Moiz Amjad, according to Ibn Hisam, Aisha was the 20th or the 21st person to enter Islam, and Umar was preceded by forty individuals. So Aisha accepted Islam before Umar (20 people in between). Anyway, the quote is correct. If you combine that with the other tradition in Tabari, where he claims that all children of Abu Bakr were born before Muhammad started preaching Islam, that clearly contradicts Hadith in Bukhari. Plus, also Ibn Hagar claims that Aisha was 5 years younger than Fatima, etc. These different contradictions should be mentioned, not removed. Especially, given some Muslims use these arguments. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 14:54, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On page 141, it says that all four of Abu Bakr's children were born during the pre-Islamic period.

<p>In light of the discussion here, I've worked off-line to revamp the article. I gave an expanded bio of Aisha first and put the debate re her age at the bottom. I gave the pro-9-year-old-versions first and the conflicting versions second. I also included Sunni and Shia views of Aisha (which are quite different).

<dd>When you read the quotes he gave did it say anothing about Aisha or was it about other matters? From what it sounds like, those quotes were talking about dates of certain other things happening and then someone else plugs in "therefore Aisha could/must/could not have been X years old" afterwards. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168.209.97.34.html" title="User:168.209.97.34">168.209.97.34</a> 10:20, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That was obvious. The facts were to certain events from which Aisha's age could be calculated.

<dd>This goes back to the problem of the original sources not citing dates. Muslim scholars had to work out a timeline that fit the greatest number of facts, and then plug events into the Muslim "year of the hegira" calendar. Basically, where the Christians put the hinge of history at Jesus' birth, the Muslims put it at the Hegira. But obviously that chronology didn't exist until much after the Hegira. Ibn Ishaq and Tabari didn't use it. So we have to try to calculate where things might fit. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 11:24, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But obviously not unversally ... Alas. But thanks for the note re dating. It makes sense that people would date from that, as one could say that it was the beginning of Muhammad's temporal rule, and dynastic periods used to be dated from the accession of kings. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:00, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've extensively rewritten the article and it's posted, temporarily on my talk page. Just click on my sig and go check it out. But please argue here, instead of on my talk page! <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:53, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This rewrite seems a much improved treatment, and its format looks to me like it will be much more able to tolerate editing regarding the controversial issues. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarada_595b.html" title="User:Karada">Karada</a> 16:28, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Looks OK. The separate age section is good, and the expansion is great, though it should have more red links... - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 19:50, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Interpretation or Quote?</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a.html" title="Shi'a">Shi'a</a> historians take a much dimmer view of Aisha. They believe that 'Ali should have been the first caliph, and that the other three caliphs were usurpers. Aisha not only supported the usurpers, she raised an army against her son-in-law. In doing so, <b>she meddled inappropriately in the affairs of men, rather than being a properly modest and retiring woman.</b></p>
<p>Who said this? Whose interpretation is it? In general, aside from that one line, this article is remarkably NPOV. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 07:13, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See the link to the Shi'a website at the bottom. The article is not quoting, but paraphrasing that website. If you'd prefer a quote, it could be done. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:29, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
