<dd>Looks good, I noticed it doesn't parse the article link correctly for 2nd nominations - Camille Anderson 2 looks to be deleted when in fact it is the second nom for <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camille_Anderson_0788.html" title="Camille Anderson">Camille Anderson</a>.

<dl>
<dd>Not sure how you currently parse the nominations but what about pulling out the link at the top of the nom (==[[here]]==) - most of the time it should be correct and if that isn't, it at least gives a possible clue as to why the AFD is still open. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 13:33, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

Since I compiled the assortment, it has been the target of a variety of attacks. The most recent of the attacks was the speedy deletion of the page without notice. You helped me undelete a couple of pages before, and I was hoping you would help me again. I lack the Administrative privileges to undelete the pages myself.

Not being an administrator, I can't verify whether this is correct or not; anyway, it's been restored now.

<p>I love your bot!</p>
<p>I am very glad to see that someone has created this bot to do exactly what I was doing manually. I was opening each categorised AfD and if the discussion was closed I would remove the tag and leave a message on the closer's talk page. I wonder if some consideration was given to leaving a message on the talk page of the closer? I guess it would mean reducing the workload of the bot, but I think it is usually better to have it done correctly by a person then leave the clean up to a bot. I have absolutly no idea how the bot works (programming wise), but thanks for creating it.

I really like the diff example lister (whatever you call it). Not only does it group edits by the page edited (rather than trying to guess by edit summary, which I don't like), but it gives a few quick examples for quick perusal. All-in-all a great tool. I think it's perfect for the talk page, but please make sure you have a noticable link to it on the voting side. I see you have at least one award for it, so I won't "burden" you with another (if you want another, though, speak up, and it's yours&#160;: )<br />

<dd>There are various possibilities. <a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_editcount_b324.html" title="User:Ais523/editcount">My edit counter</a> looks at edit summaries to determine what people are doing (welcomes and warnings, etc.) and many people write summaries in such a way that it can't pick them up (people tend not to be as predictable as scripts and bots would like, and that's a good thing IMO). It doesn't try to categories edits into 'notable' and 'significant'; you may have my counter confused with <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_a6ef.html" title="User:Voice of All">Voice of All</a>'s (which does try to calculate notable and significant edits; it also uses edit summaries, as far as I can tell).

<dd>Yeah, I should have mentioned that I bypassed the cache.

<dd>On a windows machine, it's still not working with Mozilla <i><b>or</b></i> Firefox, but it seems to work with IE. All other scripts I have tried have worked with Mozilla and Firefox on OpenBSD, Linux, and Windows, so this leads me to believe it's a browser incompatibility with your script. Have you tested it with firefox or mozilla? That's probably a stupid question, since nobody else has asked about it, and that many people seem to be running non-ie browsers, but I can't come up with another answer.

<dd>Testing your suggestion on a Win32 machine right now (I'm pretty sure that it'll be the same at home): on IE, it get a new tab "ca-test" <small>(gives a window saying "This is a test", obviously.</small> However, on firefox, where i usually have: "user page | discussion | edit this page | + | history | move | watch | purge ", i now have a second "purge" tab. (this, I know, seems quite wierd). Both "purge"s do the same thing. With this new evidence, I now think there may be a problem with another script that runs first. I'll try commenting scripts out until I find out what's causing the anomaly.

<p>I noticed that you very kindly helped Labyrinth13 by giving him advice concerning the Ouija article. Since you are already familiar with the "'case" I wanted to mention that I tried to resolve the situation from the beginning by removing any reference to The Exorcist since it seemed to cause him concern. This does not seem to be where his "real" problem lies.</p>
<p>I would ave thought that a compromise by removing any mention of The Exorcist would have resolved the issue. But he seems to want The Exorcist mentioned so that he can argue the veracity of the case the story was inspired by. That does not belong in the Ouija article but in an article about the case which actually inspired the book.</p>
<p>Going back to the above mentioned "real" problem. How does one resolve a problem when his real problem is with my religion? Yes, I am a practicing Catholic, but I have tried to fairly include information into an article composed by people with many points of views and ideas.</p>
<p>If I inadvertently lean too POV someone will add an "alleged" or something. But when I go to the extreme of actually removing an offending statement to make his objection moot, it makes not sense to me to insist upon putting both statements back in unless of course it is in order to get his bias across.</p>
<p>The only reasonable solution is to simply leave out any mention of The Exorcist one way or the other. Just my reasoned thoughts, thank you for your time. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPitchka_b625.html" title="User:Pitchka">Dwain</a> 02:01, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since I am a new user Ais523 and I am in the process of learning the ropes, but this comment you made some time ago on my talk page is a little puzzling? I mean is it not the whole idea that we are supposed to contribute in Wikipedia by "editing" and making corrections to articles if we sight them as well as adding fresh new articles?? you have lost me here, Fact Finder 14:40, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

first of all, sorry for my english, I'm writing from the far Italy.<br />
I've seen your script regarding the "category watchlist" and I've tried to import it into it.wiki. It doesn't work (don't worry, I'm not looking for some help).

<p>No, I'm having problems in general (been driving me crazy actually), being new to fiddly markup. What I would have liked is white text, black background, talk - contribs afterwards in superscript, time stamp, and if poss a serif font like times new roman. Now, all this may seem simple, but I have been trying to scrape the code together from other peoples sigs, but cant make it work.
