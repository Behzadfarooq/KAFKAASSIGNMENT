<p>I have found the following hadiths for Sahih Muslim:</p>
<ul>
<li>A'isha reported that she used to play with dolls in the presence of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and when her playmates came to her they left (the house) because they felt shy of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), whereas Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent them to her.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Hisham with the same chain of transmitters with a slight variation of wording.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/031.smt.html#031.5981" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/031.smt.html#031.5981" rel="nofollow">31:5981</a> <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/031.smt.html#031.5982" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/031.smt.html#031.5982" rel="nofollow">31:5982</a></p>
<p>and in Sunan Abu Dawud</p>
<ul>
<li>A’ishah said&#160;: I used to play with dolls. Sometimes the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) entered upon me when the girls were with me. When he came in, they went out, and when he went out, they came in." Sunan Abu Dawud vol.3:4913 p.1373</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
this does NOT say that Mohammed had intercourse with A’isha while her playmates were watching. Instead this says that Aisha's playmates played with her, then they left Aisha's house when Mohammed entered it and could come back after he left.</p>
<p>The last hadith is skipped in the USC-MSA texts <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/abudawud/041.sat.html#041.4910" class="external free" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/abudawud/041.sat.html#041.4910" rel="nofollow">http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/abudawud/041.sat.html#041.4910</a></p>

<li>this totally detracts from the focus of the article which is: what was aa'ishah's exact age at marriage and/or consumation? none of these give any exact figure and the alluding to playing with dolls to indicate young age is not specifically relevant to the section of "evidence that she was nine".</li>
<li>can you please give me the name of the publisher/edition for where you got the quote from sunan abi dawood (#4913) so i may verify it?</li>
<li>not related to the article but as for deriving conclusions from narrations in tabari, abu dawood et al. then caution is recommended because extraneous authentication is required (esp. with tabari) as a number of narrations are not considered authentic, although polemical websites do not hesitate to use them if they can be manipulated.</li>
<li>just so you know, new comments on the talk page go at the bottom, not at the top. thank you. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 03:29, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I could say the same thing about the section "Evidence that Aisha was older than nine" since none of that evidence tells us "what was aa'ishah's exact age at marriage and/or consumation" and see the post below for why these Hadiths should be included in this article.</li>
<li>"can you please give me the name of the publisher/edition for where you got the quote from sunan abi dawood (#4913) so i may verify it?" I will try, but unfortunetly the USC-MSA doesn't have the Hadith (they skipped it). <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/abudawud/041.sat.html#041.4910" class="external free" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/abudawud/041.sat.html#041.4910" rel="nofollow">http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/abudawud/041.sat.html#041.4910</a> But the verse number is given so it is possible to discover that information even without knowing the exact publisher or edition.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/s/Talk%7EAisha%27s_age_at_marriage_cc8d.html" title="Edit section: Union of Book 008, Number 3310 and Book 008, Number 3311">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Union of Book 008, Number 3310 and Book 008, Number 3311</span></h2>
<p>I object to merging Book 008, Number 3310 and Book 008, Number 3311 of Sahih Muslim. The verses are:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Book 008, Number 3310:</p>
<ul>
<li>'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house when I was nine years old.</li>
</ul>
<p>and</p>
<p><br />
Book 008, Number 3311:</p>
<ul>
<li>'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married her when she was seven years old, and he was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Verse 3311 contains the additional information: "and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old.". So it contains extra information about Aisha's age at the death of Mohammed and talks about Aisha's dolls. The dolls are important since in 8:73:151 (a verse that is being displayed on the front page) it says:</p>
<ul>
<li>"(The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fateh-al-Bari page 143, Vol.13)"</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, 3310 says Aisha was SIX years old while 3311 says she was SEVEN years old. This means that there is substantial difference of one years reported by the two Hadiths and these three facts warrent their separation. <a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelfworm_aef3.html" title="User:Selfworm">self</a> 16:21, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>another sidenote, the quote from ibn hajar is not relevant to the focus of the article of what her exact age was. to my knowledge, there exists no published english translation of fath al-baari... who exactly translated it like that? i have good reason to think the last part of that passage is a distortion (i.e. ibn hajar didn't say it but it is present in the translation due to what the author believes is implied by the arabic phrase used for "young girl" by ibn hajar, due to the inference taken from the muhsin khan translation of saheeh bukhaari in his parenthesis. however, the exact definition of what is meant by this arabic phrase is differed upon, there is no indication that ibn hajar's interpretation of the word matches that of muhsin khan's), however i could be completely wrong so i will check the actual arabic to make sure. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 03:53, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I object to merging Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64, Volume 7, Book 62, Number 65 and Volume 7, Book 62, Number 88 since Volume 7, Book 62, Number 88 has a different different narrator from the other two. Volume 7, Book 62, Number 88 is narrated by Ursa while Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64, Volume 7, Book 62, Number 65 are narrated by Aiahs. So it is not correct to put Volume 7, Book 62, Number 88 under the hadith</p>

<p>Truthspreader removed the following hadith saying that it was unrelated:</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari Volume 3, Book 48, Number 805: "Narrated Urwa bin Al-Musayyab, Alqama bin Waqqas and Ubaidullah bin Abdullah: About the story of 'Aisha and their narrations were similar attesting each other, when the liars said what they invented about 'Aisha, and the Divine Inspiration was delayed, Allah's Apostle sent for 'Ali and Usama to consult them in divorcing his wife (i.e. 'Aisha). Usama said, "Keep your wife, as we know nothing about her except good." Buraira said, "I cannot accuse her of any defect except that <b>she is still a young girl</b> who sleeps, neglecting her family's dough which the domestic goats come to eat (i.e. <i>she was too simpleminded to deceive her husband</i>)." Allah's Apostle said, "Who can help me to take revenge over the man who has harmed me by defaming the reputation of my family? By Allah, I have not known about my family-anything except good, and they mentioned (i.e. accused) a man about whom I did not know anything except good.""<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><br />
I feel that this is a related Hadith since it talks about Aisha being a "young girl who sleeps, neglecting her family's dough which the domestic goats come to eat". Why do you feel that this is unrelated?</p>

<dd>By the way, you forgot to sign your comment. This hadith is unrelated because young girl can be interpreted by many people in different way.

<p>The Islamic lunar calendar averages 354.367 days per year. That makes 9 Islamic years equal to 8 solar years and 267 days and 10 Islamic years equal to 9 solar years and 256 days. Therefore the generic Islamic "9 years old" averages about 9 1/4 solar years rather than 9 1/2 and could be slightly younger than 9 common years. Muhammad's (born 570) age of 52 in 622 is always reckoned in solar years. - Anonymous</p>

<dd>That's a good question, which we should work to resolve. I did not add the material, but am only tidying it and trying to reference it correctly.

<p><br />
Just a personal thought @pecher: It should be remembered that scholars used to regard hadith with great caution and often even did not share their collections with others whom they did not consider to have enough insight to appropriately understand them. Consequently, I think it is likely that these scholars did not get confused lightly about a couple of hadiths since they had a much more comprehensive picture in their mind. It sems to be a typical pitfall of orientalists who invariably start as outsiders, open a hadith collection and read such a hadith claiming an age of say 6 or 9 which they take at face value at first. So I suspect that the marriage age was not an issue at all among early scholars. Indeed, from my subjective, personal reading experience, a discussion seems to have stirred up only in the 19th century so.</p>
<p><br />
There usually is a lot of criticism on talk pages. Here, I can safely do the opposite and congratulate the editors to this nice article! I have seen several sources on the age controversy but each of them had gathered only a limited amount of sources and the strength of Wikipedia really came into play here where many people were aware of one argument and a lot of them could be gathered in this place. - Anonymous</p>

This is ridiculous, it's like the idea that the testimony of four women is equivalent to the testimony of one man. There is testimony from Aisha saying that she was nine in three hadiths and this was accepted until people recently started talking about child abuse. Just what do the counter-arguments amount to? Most are based on some dodgy arithmetic about when Aisha was born based on the failing memories of an old man. The next line is arithmentic based on the assumption that Aisha's elder sister really died when she was exactly 100, 73 years after 622 CE, rather than 100 perhaps being a bit of hyperbole. Or the assumption that if a boy under 15 was not allowed to fight in battles, Muhammed's young wife can't have been allowed to be there at all. It doesn't amount to anything except special pleading to get round an inconvenient conclusion. --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_d_bca2.html" title="User:Simon d">Simon d</a> 00:07, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There has been a very good book written by <b>Hakim Niaz Ahmad</b>, who is an Islamic scholar from very renowned Islamic school of thought of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/o/Deobandi.html" title="Deobandi">Deobandi</a>. His book discusses age of Ayesha at marriage. Interestingly, at one point he accepted all the hadith in Bukhari and Muslim to be valid and compared those <a href="../../../a/h/a/Ahadith.html" title="Ahadith">Ahadith</a> with Ahadith for <a href="../../../l/a/y/Laylat_al-Qadr_6ed6.html" title="Laylat al-Qadr">Laylat al-Qadr</a>, and he says that Prophet Muhammad used 5 for 25, 7 for 27, 9 for 29 because base 20 was already agreed and it is a way of talking in classical arabic language. So he argues that Ayesha told her age right, she married at 6, which is 16 and her marriage consumed at 9, which is 19. Which he believes that is also proved by all other ways. And I think, there is some credibility in this argument and many people now consider such works to be quite respectable especially I listened to <a href="../../../j/a/v/Javed_Ahmed_Ghamidi_654c.html" title="Javed Ahmed Ghamidi">Javed Ahmed Ghamidi</a> in one of his public lectures in which he mentioned it.

<p>This is going to take a long time to come to fruition but ... I've been in correspondence with an Islamist at the University of Chicago. He believes that Aisha's marriage wasn't consummated when she was nine, and would be happy to write an article on it, if he weren't too busy. He'll try to interest some of his graduate students in the topic, and help them get published.

<p>The following hadiths were removed by Itaqallah</p>
<ul>
<li>Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet was screening me with his Rida' (garment covering the upper part of the body) while I was looking at the Ethiopians who were playing in the courtyard of the mosque. (I continued watching) till I was satisfied. So you may deduce from this event how a little girl (who has not reached the age of puberty) who is eager to enjoy amusement should be treated in this respect. <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.163" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.163" rel="nofollow">7:62:163</a></li>
<li>Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Apostle used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fateh-al-Bari page 143, Vol.13) <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/073.sbt.html#008.073.151" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/073.sbt.html#008.073.151" rel="nofollow">8:73:151</a></li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
for the reason: "these narrations do not cite an age. to claim that the age of nine is implied due to her being young or playing with dolls amounts to"</p>
<p><br />
I disagree with the removal of the Hadiths because although the Hadiths do not say that she was 6 or 7 at marriage or 9 when the marriage was consummated, it does limit the age range of Aisha during which those events could have taken place. And do not forget that the main purpose of this article is "Aisha's age at marriage" and not "Evidence that Aisha was either 6 or 7 at marriage and 9 when the marriage was consummated OR evidence that she wasn't 6 or 7 .. or 9 ..". So these Hadiths are important for anyone who would be interested in this topic.</p>
<p><br />
Hence, I recommend that we first create another section which will be used to house those extra Hadiths, possibly call it "Other Evidence that Aisha was a Child". Second, we need to change the title of "Evidence that Aisha was nine" to "Evidence that Aisha was 5 or 6 at Marriage and 9 at Consummation" so that there will not be any confusion between the two sections. Although maybe a smaller name for my second point.</p>
<p><br />
Or, we can just change the name of "Evidence that Aisha was nine" to "Evidence that Aisha was a Child"</p>
<p><br />
Also please do not abruptly remove Hadiths form the main article without first discussing it since this is a major change to the article. I will do the same when adding Hadiths. <a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelfworm_aef3.html" title="User:Selfworm">self</a> 04:38, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I disagree with the removal of the Hadiths...</i>- this article is about the dispute regarding her actual age of marriage. the dispute is not whether or not she was a child. "child" is a relative term which people understand differently (some people may consider fourteen the age of a child), we are looking for reported ages. there are like a dozen narrations saying that she was nine, i fail to see how these evidences which are repetetive can be considered "important" to anyone except those who wish to subtly imply that aa'ishah was pre-pubescent by linking dolls with apparent age. that is OR. nothing from the second narration (8.73.151) indicates anything about even the time of her marriage, it just says Muhammad used to enter her house (i.e. abu bakr's house) and occasionally play with her and her playmates. there is no indication that she was married, or going to get married at this time. the narration before that is irrelevant and pretty much useless (no indication of age, she could have been thirteen when saying that, even to deduce that she was married when narrating this although to some it is obvious is still OR).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Second, we need to change the title of "Evidence that Aisha was nine" to "Evidence that Aisha was 5 or 6 at Marriage and 9 at Consummation"</i> - there would be no confusion for anyone who bothers to read the lead section. if they do not read the lead section (see <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>) , which is primarily to add context to and summarise the issue, then they cannot blame anyone if they become confused.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Or, we can just change the name of "Evidence that Aisha was nine" to "Evidence that Aisha was a Child"</i> - i disagree. one major view says that aa'ishah was nine, another extremely less notable view says she was significantly older than nine but they arrive at different conclusions regarding age. this is the dispute: was she nine? or significantly older than nine (and in these cases proposed ages are given)? "evidence that aisha was nine" is far more neutral than "evidence aisha was a child". using the term "child" to point out that she must have been nine or less is OR. if in the "older" section an argument points to her being twelve, or fourteen, that could still be regarded as a "child". so her being a "child" or not a "child", which again is a relative term and understood differently by different people and so less suitable than giving exact age, is not the focus of the article, and is not what is disputed by the two parties.</dd>

<dd>This hadith proves nothing because, as the article says that even Aisha was born before advent of Islam, she might be only two years old when Prophet Muhammad were prophecised, which would make her age much more than 9 at marriage.

<p>Arguments given in defence of Aisha's late marriage are definitely taken from Moiz Amjad's work, but I dont' think so that this is all his work. I had a quick look into <b>Habib ur Rahman Kandhalwi'</b>s work and he also mentioned these points plus many others. I didn't have a time to go through and see which one I can put on wikipedia. Well! I think it is already written very clearly on the article that what most and traditionally Muslims think and this opinion is hold by minority, so in that case, it definitely is a POV. But does this section deserve a POV tag? <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 02:48, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>i think i have mentioned this before, but here are the guidelines of what <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">undue weight</a> consists of. if a view is a minority then it should be given space in relative proportion, the current section dedicates a lot of text to eludicating all of the arguments precisely when they could just be summarized. giving one viewpoint a substantial elaboration gives the impression that the view is more adopted than even claimed by the article. you don't say "A is a minority view" and then dedicate a few sections to give present all or most of the arguments, when it can easily be summarized. similarly, in any article you don't give dozens of paragraphs to outrageous theories just because it will take that much for every argument within the theory to be sufficiently covered. ideally if it was a minority view then you would give it a paragraph or two (but it depends on article size), and this is what the undue weight clause is about: maintaining article balance by propotionalizing the views on that subject, irrespective of what is considered "true" or "false". furthermore, for the "was 9" section, there are almost no arguments provided and it seems to be more of a compilation of primary source narrations. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 16:16, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aisha being older than nine may be a minority view among the Muslim community in general but among many Islamic historians, this view is quite popular. The guidelines mainly refer to <i>tiny-minority</i> views and this view is not a <i>tiny-minority</i> view by any means. It may not deserve <i>equal</i> weight as the former argument but it does deserve the weight it has been given. I think a better idea would be to expand the former section on Aisha's age being nine (perhaps with some more quotes), rather than reducing the latter section on her age being older than nine. This would be equivalent to giving the former argument more weight than the latter. <a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagged_85_b01d.html" title="User:Jagged 85">Jagged</a> 18:20, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>could you substantiate your earlier statement "<i>...but among many Islamic historians, this view is quite popular</i>". from what i know, such a view had not been prevelant or even known until recent apologetic responses to orientalist scrutiny. the only actual sources for this argument that i know of are indeed those that have already been mentioned in the article. consideration should also be given to the fact that the "was nine" section is currently a collection of primary sources while "was older than nine" is an 'analysis' and evaluation of these and other sources which i think gives the impression of stronger weightage of this view as no actual arguments or analysis are provided for the opposing view. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 20:14, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was referring to <i>recent</i> Islamic historians, such as those mentioned in the article. Reducing the length of the <i>older than nine</i> argument won't help the article in any way, since this article is primarily based on the debate surrounding Aisha's age. What I was suggesting is that we add more weight to the <i>was nine</i> argument, rather than cutting down the size of the other section, which will only make the article less informative. On the other hand, adding more quotes, arguments or an analysis to the <i>was nine</i> argument would make the article more informative. <a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagged_85_b01d.html" title="User:Jagged 85">Jagged</a> 22:09, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The main problem with the hadith related to Aisha's (ra) marriage age is that Muslims have been accepting it, but as a <a href="../../../u/m/m/Ummah.html" title="Ummah">Ummah</a>, we never acted upon it. <a href="../../../u/m/m/Ummah.html" title="Ummah">Ummah</a> is void of such practices at large in which children are married with much older persons. And the reason behind is that Sunnah and Quran teaches us strong morality in sexual relations and human nature just cannot assimilate such events in general. I can also see the argument in Spellburgs writing that <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni.html" title="Sunni">Sunnis</a> might reduced the age of Aisha and Sabaites reduced the age of Fatima by ten years (her birth:instread of 5 years before prophecy, they count 5 years after prophecy) for their own benefits, this clearly shows a pattern of political benefits in later Islamic eras. Interestingly, all other women related to the prophet were married at very reasonable ages. Muslims have been ignoring these hadith for a long time, but when you have cynical commentators on Islam, this is a definite loop hole for them. My point is that consensus of the practice of <a href="../../../u/m/m/Ummah.html" title="Ummah">Ummah</a> does not see such practices at large scale, because of some problems with it. And this practice at large deserves this much space on wikipedia, or even more. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 22:20, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I concur. In my opinion, neither side of the argument is more factual than the other, and Muslim historians are clearly divided on this issue, with strong arguments coming from both sides of the debate. Just because the Sunni community in general regards her to have been nine at marriage, that doesn't necessarily mean that we should give this argument more weight. I believe Wikipedia should be as neutral and unbiased as possible, and give both sides of the debate equal weight. However, I don't mind giving the <i>was nine</i> section slightly more weight, as long as we don't cut down on the <i>older than nine</i> section. <a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagged_85_b01d.html" title="User:Jagged 85">Jagged</a> 23:21, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Fact is that normal adults doesn't have sexual feelings for 9 year olds.. Anyway, it doesn't really matter much.

<p>I think Judging this issue is very difficult, this happened a long time ago in a different culture and we dont have all the facts, I think also the arguement is very heated and recent, morals come and go in another 1500 years this could be perfectly acceptable I think the article should keep this in mind, The term pedophilia is also very vague, Legaly if a person who was 1 day over the age of concent had sex with a person 1 day under legaly they would be a pedophile.

<p>I think it was Striver who introduced special "hadith quote" markup that surrounded hadith quotes with a box and colored them green. I removed it all.

Why should quotes from a certain body of Islamic texts get special treatment, and who gets to decide whether or not a particular collection gets the special treatment?

<p>If hadith get special treatment, why not quotes from other books? Or people? Do all Torah quotes get to be red? New Testament quotes purple? What about the Apocrypha?

<p>One editor removed the note re early marriages in Europe with the comment that it didn't apply to Arabia. Having spent many years reading widely in history and anthropology, I know darn well that in many societies, girls were routinely married off as soon as they were pubescent. However, the problem is coming up with a citation.</p>
<p>WP has lists of contemporary average marriage ages in various countries, ditto lists of minimum marriage ages. But nothing about history. Googling on historical demography, age at marriage, child bride, etc. brings up many books and papers about early marriage at specific places and times, but no global surveys.</p>
<p>I have tenuous memories of reading demographic theories about medieval and Renaissance Europe being anomalous in that they favored late marriage rather than early. But I can't for the life of me remember the authors or titles -- and in any case, that's from twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Is there anyone here at a university with a good demographics department or concentration? Anyone else can find references?</p>
<p>We could, I suppose, start adding references to the various regional/historical studies, but they would soon swamp the article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:37, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, do most Muslims know about this issue? Do they tend to assume that Muhammad couldn't have done such a thing (have sex with a nine-year-old girl)? Or would they be more likely to concede that he did, but insist that there was nothing wrong with it? (Either because a prophet should not be held to ordinary standards, or because Ayesha was "mature for her age," or because that sort of thing was normal for their society, etc.) If it turned out to be true--say, if they discovered a letter by Ayesha saying this--would very many Muslims quit their religion? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_218.167.166.61_3273.html" title="Special:Contributions/218.167.166.61">218.167.166.61</a> (talk) 01:41, 5 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>I would say that most Muslims don't know about this. As Islam doesn't practice <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clergy.html" title="Clergy">clergy</a> legally but still because of the effect of <a href="../../../m/u/f/Mufti.html" title="Mufti">Muftis</a> and <a href="../../../u/l/e/Ulema.html" title="Ulema">Ulemas</a>, Muslims tend to follow the traditional arguments i.e. she was mature for her age. But I believe that some people have done excellent work on the age of Aisha i.e. she was older when she married, hence, this problem is no longer a problem.

<dd>"Comparison of hadith of Aisha's age with hadith of Laylat al-Qadr, in which 1 was used for 21, 3 for 23, 5 for 25 and so on, suggest that maybe Aisha's reports were transmitted literally and 16 became 6 and 19 became 9, as it is a way of talking in Arabic language when base is already known.[3]". Clicking on [3] in the text leads nowhere. The references in the reference secton are in a mess and need to be sorted out.</dd>
