<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/s/Talk%7EAish_HaTorah_ee76.html" title="Edit section: Spielberg">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spielberg</span></h2>
<p>Mentioning Spielberg's inconsistency with the ideals of Aish HaTorah is relevant. Aish HaTorah uses his endorsement, and as I recall he dedicated something which bears his name in the Jerusalam yeshiva. Spielberg is married to a non-Jew, and his new movie "Munich" has been subjected to a torrent of criticism for its inability to make a moral distinction between the terrorist murderers of Munich and the Israeli hit team that tried to enact justice and kill them. That's not the kind of man that Aish should be trotting out of evidence of their success.</p>
<dl>
<dd>For now, try to integrate that context (with wikilinking), because that specific passage is untenable in isolation; it is simply too confusing and unclear as per relevance, and otherwise. Please keep the average reader in mind. Thanks. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 08:24, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

He is a respected mathematician in his own right, and the Discovery program that uses these codes is one of Aish's biggest items. Perhaps the criticism belongs <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aish_HaTorah_4e76.html#Seminars" title="Aish HaTorah">here</a>, where the claim "Discovery Seminar ... uses scientific methods of research to explore the authenticity of Judaism" is made.

<p>However, it's not critcism in this blog. It's bleating and aimed at "exposing" this or that. It only criticises the UK branch, which is only a small part of a much larger organisation.</p>

<p>I don't have a reference to back this up, so I won't put it on the main page, but this passaage:</p>
<p>"However, the accusation is not only commonly dismissed by Aish HaTorah members and staff, but also the majority of religious Jews, who see the controversy surrounding Aish HaTorah as rooting from secular Judaism in an attempt to taint Aish HaTorah's name, and their outreach work"</p>
<p>is just false. Most orthodox Jews cringe when they hear the name "Aish Hatorah" because they know the place is wacko. I highly doubt anyone with smicha from Aish would be taken seriously in a serious religious setting. But I dodn't have documentation so I leave it on this rarely-viewed page.</p>
<p>This whole page read like Aish propaganda. It ought to be cleaned up from a NPOV<a href="../../../h/y/i/User%7EHyim_f46e.html" title="User:Hyim">Hyim</a> 05:56, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Please do not suggest <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad-Lubavitch_9846.html" title="Chabad-Lubavitch">Chabad-Lubavitch</a> propaganda as an "antidote" to Aish's propaganda because it will sound just as silly and foolish. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 07:04, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The whole page is propagada. I have sprinkled some citations and references to their wacky beliefs and tried to beef up the Controvery section. It's such a shame that this organization can't just try to produce committed Jews instead of zealots adi67 17:24, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Most of the Controversy section is an unsourced editorial and thus is forbidden by the rules against <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

<dd>I have added a 'Controversy' label at the start of this discussion; it seems clear to me that there those with both very positive and very negative views of the organisation making edits, based on a lot of hearsay, personal opinion, and making relatively emotive comments. The first paragraph is a good example of this - much of it is false (especially in the various branches of the organisation with which I have personal experience), and dubious at best; and the controversy section is an ongoing conversation between various editors. I don't see the point of editing as based on current trends it will be gone within a few days... Garry Wayland 17:16, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have edited the endorsements paragraph to reflect, I believe, the best of Wikipedia policy: a statement of the facts with sources. I corrected the text that compared Aish's endorsements with those of Scientology and Kabbalah Centre because there were no sources provided. In fact, I went to those websites and could not find ANY endorsements, celebrity or otherwise, nor did I find any with a google search. Therefore, I believe that the intellectual reputation of some of Aish's endorsements is one useful piece of information in this section. It alone doesn't prove anything, nor is it irrelevant. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User_talk%7ENarcissus14_9f48.html" title="User talk:Narcissus14">Narcissus14</a></p>

<dd>You were right to remove the Scientology and Kabbalah Centre claims, but your own edit was a clear violation of the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">no original research policy</a>. The problem is that as well as linking to Aish's page of endorsements, you added your own opinion about it ("seem to belie...").

<dd>You are making a strong argument for editing, but not for deleting the entire chunk. In fact, the statement "this is an accusation of which the organization is aware" which you left intact is very un-wikish - it has no source. Moreover, how can an organization be aware of something? I'm going to edit, taking into consideration your point (above) and challenge you to repair rather than delete if you see any problems. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Narcissus14 (<a href="../../../n/a/r/User_talk%7ENarcissus14_9f48.html" title="User talk:Narcissus14">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Narcissus14_3dd8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Narcissus14">contribs</a>) 16:07, 31 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>Your text is Original Research, simple as that. Everything you wrote is <i>your</i> analsysis.

<p>Someone deleted the following subsection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aish HaTorah's methodology and impact on some people has led to comparisons between Aish and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Religious_Movement_5f9f.html" title="New Religious Movement">New Religious Movements</a> (sometimes referred to as <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cults</a>)&lt;ref&gt;Tapper, A. The "cult" of Aish Hatorah: Ba'alei Teshuva and the New Religious Movement phenomenon". Jewish Journal of Sociology, vol 44, nos 1 and 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;. This is an accusation of which the organisation is aware, and counters by claiming it is intellectually honest &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aish.com/spirituality/foundations/How_Can_We_Be_Sure_of_Anything.asp Aish.com] - "How Can We Be Sure of Anything?"&lt;/ref&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That deletion was justified. First, the description of Tapper's paper is woefully inadequate. Second, the page of Aish linked in reply does not mention Tapper at all, so the charge "honest" (presumably supposed to be "dishonest") is unsourced. (Google cannot find Tapper mentioned at aish.com at all, which is what I would expect.) I don't want to write on this subject in the article, but if anyone wants to study Tapper's 25-page academic paper and use it to improve our article, send me email by the link on my <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKay_32b8.html" title="User:McKay">home page</a> and I'll send it to you.
