<p>The last three styles in the list - those of Rod Kobayashi, Seagal and Nocquet - are they not a part of Aikikai? If they are, they should not be listed separately. If they are not, now big are they? Should we list all independent aikido organisations there is? I fear the list could be long... <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 10:19, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed Aiki-Budo. As far as I could see it referred to a stage in Uesthibas development, an aikido of longer time ago still visible through some of the teachers within and outside of the Aikikai; if we list every technically different aikido as a style IMO we will have as meny styles as teachers. <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 19:55, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I changed Tendokan Aikido to Tendoryu Aikido, because Tendokan means the Dojo from Shimizu Sensei in Tokyo. -- <a href="../../../u/k/e/User%7EUkemi_fe3d.html" title="User:Ukemi">ukemi</a> 13:54, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I altered the Tomiki Aikido entry slightly since I felt it was redundant with the Shodokan Aikido entry below. There are some groups which consider themselves Tomiki but not Shodokan but Shodokan is what Tomiki called his style. It's a bit confusing but this way I think it is less so than two entries. Peter Rehse</p>
<p>I don't see it has a huge problem right now but perhaps the style section will need to be re-worked. For example not all of the styles listed (and I see the number growing) have a Honbu Dojo in Japan (as stated in the first line of the section). With the growing number (often for political reasons - as I guess was usually the case in the past also) of new independent dojos which ones are actually styles and more to the point how many affiliated dojos do you need to be considered major. Also - several of the styles are affiliated to one of the major styles. Major appears to mean one of your members thinks your style is major and had it tacked on to the original list which made more sense. I don't want to start messing around with anything right now but how about styles founded by pre-war students of Ueshiba, founded by post-war students of Ueshiba, Independent dojos. There should still be room for unique subsets of the major styles or dojos that broke away from these. For discussion purposes only - any opinions. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 08:10, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
OK I guess it bothered me more than I thought. I did some re-arranging. My biggest worry is about the Iwamma group and I hope I did them justice. The last entry ... well to be blunt one dojo does not make a style and I think it should be removed. It's dojo advertising and there are hundreds of larger independent associations. Tenshin is also Aikikai affiliated as far as I know but this bothers me less. I removed Tomiki as a separate entity - no need for that as it is correctly described under Shodokan.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 06:07, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the latest Style entry should be removed as they are part of the Aikikai. I placed an entry in <a href="../../../c/t/o/User_talk%7ECtozer_02ab.html" title="User talk:Ctozer">User talk:Ctozer</a> to leave it with the author for a few days after which I will remove it. Hopefully he will see the light. He also wrote an article about himself to which myself and one other commented. I suspect it is just a matter of understanding how Wikipedia works.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 05:55, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm thinking about removing the name and links to the USAF and ASU from the Aikikai entry and referring to the List of Famous Aikidoka where I will include the links with the appropriate name (Chiba with USAF and Satome with ASU). The reason is mainly to head off the inclusion of a number of other organization links which would tend to swamp the Aikikai entry.

<dd>Could someone whip up at least a stub for Noriaki Inoue and/or Shin'ei Taido. Trying to get rid of empty links but I think they are important enough to the overall history of Aikido that they should not be deleted. A stub for Nihon Goshin Aikido would also be great - I think there was one but it was deleted because of copyright violation.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 04:43, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Korindo Aikido and Minoro Hirai</span></h2>
<p>I didn't say any mention of this part of aikido in the article</p>
<p>Minoro Hirai lived around the same time as Uyeshiba (both of them are called O'Sensei bytheir followers), and they influenced each other's style Aikido, while considered an invention of Hirai, was actually expected to emerge out of the styles of Jiu-jutsu, and was then called aiki-jujutsu, both masters founded their schools for that, and apparently, both called them Aikido.</p>
<p>Hirahi's branch was called Korindo, and, probably "thanks" to the small number of students didn't split into factions, as tends to happen in the martial arts world. It's still practiced, but mainly in Japan, Israel, and Berlin. I believe it's fading away, seeing as the korindo type of aikido is less familiar (an understatement) than Uyeshiba's.</p>
<p>Korindo does emphasize practicaluty as opposed to the ideal of a perfect movement, seen in some branches of Uyeshiba's aikido (this doesn't mean one is better than the other, it means they're different, that's all).</p>
<p>one of the unique traits of it is use of specific forms of tai sabaki designed to practice fluency in some of the basic movements and techniques.</p>
<p>I realize this probably won't be a main theme in the article about Aikido, but it won't be complete without some mentioning.</p>
<p>a practicing teacher in Israel is Shlomo David, dan 6. he's a full time coach in martial arts, and has studied aikido in Japan under Hirai, when Minoro Hirai was still alive.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Capital letters</span></h2>
<p>The use of caps in originally Japanese words keep coming in. Aikido, Judo, Karate, Nage, Ki... why? What is the rationale for this?</p>
<p><br />
If it some kind of honorific, this might work fine in the works of each aikido organisation but not in an encyclopedia intended for wider audience. There are many rules of English language I am not acquainted with (and those I should know I accidently break every now and then) but if there is a rule that words that originates in Japanese language should be spelled with a capital letter, or words with budo origin, I will be happy to recieve a pointer. Until that happens, I will see these capital letters as mistakes and remove them. / <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 02:23, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are correct with regard to the capital letters. A while back someone started a capitilization craze which I noticed but couldn't be bothered to police. Thank you for taking care of it.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 13:09, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The standard, then, is to not capitalize words like aikido? This seems to be the most widely used throughout the article, but there is still some inconsistency. For example, throughout the introductory paragraph before the contents box, aikido is capitalized. There could be a reason behind this, similar to how the first use is boldfaced, but it could also cause confusion as to what the standard is. There are also other examples scattered throughout the article, such as in the first paragraph of the Training section. Here the phrase "aikido technique" is written first as I just demonstrated, and two sentenes later as "Aikido technique." I'm happy to do the final cleaning and standardizing, but I figured I would get some feedback first - especially regarding to the introductory paragraph. Estrand 00:32, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Idid a quick run through but please take another look for more. I actually thought it was all taken care of but they sneak in. Aikido should not be capitilized within sentences.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 06:29, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Would someone please neutralise the article?</span></h2>
<p>In some parts it seems no more than an enthusiastic advertisement. It is an encyclopedia, mind you. (e.g. "A new person - straightforward, brave yet humble, able to be both strong and yielding as circumstances require - can emerge from this training")</p>
<p>Please go ahead - I'm doing my best keeping the styles section under control. A couple of sections are too long, too involved and not too neutral. The best way is to take one section at a time - Mind is one, Ki is another that needs work.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ki Section and Kanji and Harmony</span></h2>
<p>Hi. I just tweaked a few things on this. I lived in Japan for 3 years and am a fluent reader/speaker of japanese and have studied Aikido for the same amount of time. I'm no expert on the art, but I know that AI KI DO is not directly translated as the "way of harmony" so much as English speakers keep saying, although I admit it does sound quite nice. the character "AI" is used for many banal purposes, such as HANASHIAI (meet and talk) or TAIKAI (sports meet/exhibition), to ascribe "harmony" to it is a bit of western romanticism I think. Ki is ki, and Do is "way", this much is true. Basically, this is my opinion, but I believe the important idea being expressed in the word AIKIDO, is that it is about the MEETING of KI, the ki of two different people. whether they clash, or harmonize, is up to the individuals. Harmony and harmonizing is a wonderful quality, but it is a bit new agey to use it all the time. I think of Aikido as an ongoing experiment, a "ki science" that deals with all the different and wonderful ways that two people's Ki (i.e. intention, etc.) can meet. I mean, you could meet someone, and kiss them, and that would be a way of two "ki's" interacting, so let's keep it a little more open ended people!</p>
<p>also, I added that the character of KI represents a bowl of rice with the lid on, thus the steam is the "KI". This was drawn out and explained to me by an 80 year old guy who knew onsensei, yadda yadda. The rice character is used in AIKIDO, while in regular casual japanese, the character has been changed with the rice replaced by a katakana "me" character.</p>
<p>also, I reworded some phrases and such, to get around the word "spiritual" which is used WAAAAAAY too much, and is not a very concrete word that tells us much, especially when it is used so often. I'm all for spirituality, but it really is an ambiguous and ill-defined word to use to define something else... for example if someones says, "what is the deal with religion X or philosophy B?" and I answer "it's really, um...SPIRITUAL", I'm not really telling them much am I?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whoops - I wish I had read your talk contribution before I started changing things. First of all thanks much for taking care of the Ki section. I still think it could be trimmed further - please feel free. I do think you are wrong about the kanji - please double check and lets discuss it here (I've lived in Japan for over 10 years and have studied Aikido just as long). Finally (my typo aside) Wikipedia asks that articles be written either in American or British English not a mixture of the two.

<dd>I like the changes that you've made to this section. It has bothered me for some time and I haven't known how to change it. As for the translation of Aikido, I have seen the use of "The way of harmony with ki" or "The way of harmony with the spirit of the universe" in various books in english by <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kisshomaru_Ueshiba_c95c.html" title="Kisshomaru Ueshiba">Kisshomaru Ueshiba</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moriteru_Ueshiba_06fb.html" title="Moriteru Ueshiba">Moriteru Ueshiba</a>. I have also heard your literal translation before, but it seems that the interpretation of it as "The way of harmony" seems to come directly from the <a href="../../../a/i/k/Aikikai.html" title="Aikikai">Aikikai</a>, not from the west. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwinstearns_4271.html" title="User:Edwinstearns">Edwin Stearns</a> | <a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwinstearns_df71.html" title="User talk:Edwinstearns">Talk</a> 14:28, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Steven Seagal</span></h2>
<p>Stranglely I first spent two weeks constantly putting him back in the list of famous Aikidoka apparently someone didn't think he did Aikido or was famous or something. Now I find myself removing references and information in both the List of Famous Aikidoka and here. Excuse the rant but he is not the worst or best thing that happened to Aikido. I suggest that references to Seagal and his Aikido should stay on his own page which is linked through the list of famous Aikidoka. There are members of that latter list who have a far greater influence on Aikido which basically is my problem.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Live blades?</span></h2>
<p>IP 80.45.15.210 has added that some people practice with live blades. For solo practice (what we call movement practice - where you are not directly engaged with another person), I could believe this. But for training in techniques against people (regardless if they are open-handed or equipped with a sword), I find this claim doubtful. Safety is paramount in training, and when working with a live blade, the stakes are too high to risk even a minor mistake by either tori/nage or uki. Either person could make minor mistakes in body movement or hand position, or someone could stumble, trip, or even stub their toe on the mat. The results could be life threating. That's not a safe way to train. So... at a minimum, I think the statement should be made clearer that some practice by themselves with live blades. But in reality, I think the statement could probably be removed without losing much, if any, real content. I'm inviting 80.45.15.210 to this discusion.<a href="../../../m/r/a/User%7EMrand_eed8.html" title="User:Mrand">Mrand</a> 11:26, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also know Aikidoka that practice iaido and/or kenjutsu and have incorporated parts of that into Aikido demonstrations. The rational is that the base of Aikido is the sword and therefore knowlege of real weapons is relevant but Aikido in itself is not knife or sword fighting. The pain from a good bokken strike is pretty real so the added edge (excuse the pun) of training with live weapons is not really an issue. The lack of safety and the suggestion in a wikipedia article that it is something to aspire to is however an issue. I know one guy with half a hand that decided his karate (could just as easily be an Aikido guy) could be enhanced with real samurai sword training - an accident waiting to happen - he didn't even bother to get introductory training since I guess he was a black belt and knew what he was doing.

<dd>I apologise for the addition, and upon reflection realise that I probably did not really improve the article. However, in my experience (ie. in the dojo where I trained) live blades were used, but, as I should have specified, only when advanced students were performing a demonstration or during advanced grading. They were not used for regular practice. In response to Mrand's comment, use of live blades in this manner was essentially movement practice, but with a partner. Neither the attack nor the technique are delivered with the same commitment as bokken or unarmed training. Instead the movement is performed in a controlled manner to minimise risk. In any case, as said above, the statement did not add much and PRehse has rightfully removed it. In future I shall consult talk pages prior to such additions. 80.45.15.210 09:47, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Well, I can only explain using logic. (and not outside references). All matter and energy are one and the same at their most basic level, and so any form of energy is really just energy, i.e., ki, at its most micro and macrocosmic level. This is the idea behind ki.(according to Koichi Tohei as well). To say that there are separate or multiple forms of all-pervasive universal energy seems counter-intuitive and just doesn't make sense if you really think about it. I know that Chinese martial arts tend to have very complicated energy systems and what not, but any major google search will point out that tai chi and ki from aikido, hapkido, chi from kung fu, and so on is all the same stuff according to numerous websites (I know that is still a weak outside reference).</p>
<p>However, I think the idea that ji is a different form of energy is the one that needs explanation. As a student of chinese and japanese languages, I can't agree that having a different character makes the 'ki/ji' in dispute an entirely different energy form rather than just a slightly different conceptualization.</p>
<p>how can there be more than one form of energy? energy is either light, heat, etc., but it is at its most basic level the same stuff... <a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 03:26, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree (with Nat Krause). In the name "taiji"/"tai chi", the "ji"/"chi" does not mean energy. If you were to talk about "energy" in tai chi, it would be "chi"/"qi", not "ji"/"chi" and would be the character 気 (The "Ki" in "Aikido"), not 极 (The "ji" in "taiji"). They have completely different meanings, and the "ji" in taiji has nothing to do with energy! -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave3141592_76f7.html" title="User:Dave3141592">David Scarlett</a><small><sup>(<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave3141592_ff4a.html" title="User talk:Dave3141592">Talk</a>)</sup></small> 00:18, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks guys. That straightens it out. So let's just throw out the semantic taiji argument. I guess ji means 'fist' or something? The point is that the energy in all the internal arts is the same (the Qi page even referes to Greek pneuma, etc.). If enough people really want to nit pick, let's just throw the reference out completely, since it no longer becomes helpful to the paragraph.

<p>That was my feeling when I removed it earlier. The article does not need to cover every single nuance especially when there is a clear link to further reading. That is after all what the links are for (hey even the rice cooking is borderline in that regard but it in that case it gives something to the readability of the article). For the record, in my opinion when a taichi guy talks about internal energy it is pretty much the same way as an Aikido guy - even though the Chi in the name is not the same as the Ki in Aikido. More to the point Ki is part of the Aiki compound rather than a stand alone and not that important overall but that's another battle.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 01:02, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>'Ji'/'Chi' in '<a href="../../../t/a/i/Taijiquan.html" title="Taijiquan">Taijiquan</a>/Tai Chi Chuan' is actually linked with 'Tai', and translates as 'Supreme Ultimate'.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Spirit of Aikido</span></h2>
<p>Peter, Hi. What's up with your removal of the Osensei quotes? I saw your subjective comment on AikiWeb about it. I think a few more people should weigh in on its removal besides only you. Osensei was a deeply religious and spiritual man who is said by most to have achieved enlightenment, and the art of Aikido stems from this experience. This is more than worthy of mention in the Wikipage about Aikido. As far as copyright, I'm no expert, but a quote from a famous deceased person is public domain as far as I know. The same quote appears in three different books, written by two different people, with no apparent copyright problems. Also:</p>
<p>Peter Rehse wrote: "It shouldn't be in there like that because it is a copyright infringement and at the head of the article it sets a tone which give the article a non-encyclopediac feel"</p>
<p>The source is Kisshomaru Doshu's original "Aikido," later published in translation or a new edition as "Spirit of Aikido" He is the primary reporter of his father's statements. It cannot be a copyright inforngement to repeat the quote, any more than it was infringement for Stevens to repeat or retranslate it. "</p>
<p>It was O-Sensei's impetus from his revelations that spread aikido internationally with a sense of mission behind it, whatever opinion you may have about the reported content. But for that vision, aikido would be a family heirloom art practiced solely at Iwama.</p>
<p>Merely because the same thing is not directly experienced by those learning the art does not mean it was not important as a component of its development and spread. Plainly, the charisma O-Sensei possessed as reflected in or received from his visions played a powerful part in drawing deshi to him, who then had the will and desire to spread the art far and wide. If you do not live in Japan, and probably even for most of those aikidoka who do -- those visions are responsible for you practicing aikido today -- wherever you are living.</p>
<p>And that information is quite "encyclopedic" in its nature. Cordially, Erick Mead</p>
<p>Wanted to include that in case you missed Erick's input on Aikiweb. I agree entirely with him. Encyclopedia does not mean, "boring technical and trivial detail that disregards the main focus and principles of the object of knowledge". Aikido without Osensei, enlightenment, and Ki isn't Aikido if you ask me. What do the rest you guys and ladies think?<a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 06:14, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No - the quotes are fine in themselves but the translation, order and presentation were lifted directly from the books (as pointed out by several aikiweb members). Wikipedia has pretty strict policy in that regard (look at the grief caused by internet page copies and pictures) - and that is why it was removed. It is not enough to say that it really isn't copyright infringment (Eric is wrong) because it is - both Steven's and Kisshomaru's books are copyrighted and you don't know what arrangement was made between Stevens and the Ueshiba family. If kept I would be happier if it was a bit deeper in the text but that is just a question of style. An encyclopedia entry should start off with the more factual and then give way to legend and stories - that was what I meant by tone.<a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_FAQ_fe96.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright FAQ">Wikipedia:Copyright_FAQ</a><a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 08:05, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I l'll see what I can do to respect everyone and everything involved. By the way, a direct quote from the founder of the martial art, explaining what aikido is, is not a 'legend' or ' story' it is what he says it is, and is to me, more interesting and more important than "it was developed from daito ryu" on the history page. I think it speaks much more about the essence of what aikido is. In fact, the history page is very weak right now, and doesn't really give a good briefing. It doesn't mention sokaku takeda, etc. either. <a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 11:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alright, I think the resulting 'spirit of aikido' section is nice, and won't make spirituality-phobes frightened. It also leads in quite nicely to the history section. I really think from here on, it's a matter of getting the essential info of aikido across, and eliminating a lot of the tangential arguments and qualifying sentences, whittling the attack, defense, etc. sections down to small, manageable blocks that make a reader get the general feeling, "oh, this is a nice and accessible, comprehensible page"<a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 13:31, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
That works much better and I also noticed your trimming which is a good thing. Somethings I would not have cut but you know it will build up again and eventually need pruning. The history section was more involved at one point with both Deguchi and Takeda mentioned (I actually wrote "that their contribution should not be understated")- not sure who trimmed them out. Its not a matter of being a spirituality-phobe but reflecting how Aikido tends to be practiced. It is still firstly a martial art. By the way Daito-ryu people might take offence about the injurious and competitive nature of his previous arts - that's not quite right (not NPOV) - can't think of better adjectives at the moment.</p>
<p>One point about the qualifications. Sometimes they are superfulous (the clothing was a good example) other times they are a genuine attempt to remove bias from the article and give a view how aikido is practiced across the spectrum of styles. Quite a bit of effort has been spent to remove bias (yeah maybe a few of my own snuck in but I tried) so please take care. Aikido is far from a monolithic entity.

<p>My bad I confused the Ueshiba entry with the Aikido entry (vis a vis what was in the history section). I think the great thing about wikipedia is the ease of linking articles and the consequential need to avoid repeating information. As such the spiritual awakening fits much better in the <a href="../../../u/e/s/Ueshiba.html" title="Ueshiba">Ueshiba</a> article and the paraphrasing does a good job of removing the copyright issue. As I said the quotes themselves are pretty fair game and I have no argument with the relevance to Ueshiba and through him Aikido.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 02:14, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm in total Aiki agreement with you Peter(drum roll, cymbal crash). I do think it works better in the Osensei section. As far as basic editing is concerned, I'm certainly no expert on Aikido, though I'm doing my best to learn as much as I can and read as much as I can. But in a way, that qualifies me even more. I see the Aikido Wiki as needing to contain a BRIEF amount of info about the most essential and interesting aspects of Aikido, presented in a clear, simple, and lucid manner, so that someone who is not familiar with it, can read the page and not feel completely lost, and have the option of clicking on various stubs for more info. For example, that's why I cleaned up clothing, since everything you could want to know about the history of keikogi and hakama are already under their respective stubs. I think the focus should stay lasered on Aikido, with as much brevity as possible. I think everyone naturally wants to put in props and caveats for their own style, (I even did this with Ki Aikido, but later erased it), but I think this kind of thing would be better served by expanding the individual style stubs, rather than, for example, constantly stressing that yoshinkan is this way and tomiki is that way within the umbrella aikido article. I understand there are unique differences, but the AIKIDO main wiki IMHO should keep info on what 90% of what aikido consists of (uke, nage, ukemi, etc.), and for those who read to the end and still want police force or competitive aikido, they can check out for example, a tomiki stub, or REALaikido, etc. In fact, I think BECAUSE there are all of these differences, it is too difficult to keep putting exceptions all over the article.</p>
<p>Ok my long-winded diatribe is finished. I've gotten a bit of osensei's spirituality into the wikis, so my job is done.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nage initiating techniques</span></h2>
<p>The first technique in Ueshiba M.'s Budo Renshu has nage initiating the technique. The first waza in Shodokan Aikido's Koryu Goshin no Kata has this technique - picture a pair facing each other in the kneeling position. Nage initiates with a back fist strike, uke attempts to block and nage uses ikkyo. I have seen the same technique and others where nage initiates a number of times in a number of different dojo. They usually are considered advanced techniques, right alongside of reversals and counters.

<p>hmm..Well, that's pretty nice support. However, was it called "Aikido" at the time of Ueshiba's 'budo renshu', or Aikijujitsu? There is a very significant meaning to the changing of the name to 'Aikido'. I think the strong point of Aikido is that Nage doesn't initiate, otherwise, what's the point of calling it Aikido and all the talk about harmony? Doesn't that just make it just another martial art like judo or karate? BTW I've never seen Nage initiate in Aikikai, Yoshinkan, or Ki Society. IMHO (and I know it doesn't count for much on Wikipedia), Nage initiation goes against the main philosophical principles of Aikido(aka, post WWII Aikido). Any post WWII styles wanna chime in? Also, one more question, doe the addition of the sentence "nage might 'sometimes' initiate in high-level stuff", add much value or important info to the Aikido wiki? Is it really a sentence that NEEDS to be in there?<a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 07:15, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Seizing the initiative is quite common across styles - you will find it in Yoshinkan, Iwamma and Aikikai - most often it is in a pretty direct irimi. The Aikido name change was suggested (some say imposed) to Ueshiba M. by an outside Budo organization and was not driven by any philosophical forces but even so there are many ways to restore harmony. You are not supposed to go out looking for fights and you are expected not to seriously harm the aggressor (Judo and Karate teach the same thing by the way)- that doesn't mean your techniques are limited to the purely reactive. I don't realy care one way or the other for the sentence. This topic was pretty heavily discussed on Aikiweb - I'ld check there.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 08:26, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In my dojo (Iwama-ryu), we perform some techniques as "arrest techniques", where nage initiates. Nage will thrust their hand towards uke's face, then when uke raises their arm to block the strike, the block is treated as a shomen-uchi by nage. I think this line should be left in. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave3141592_76f7.html" title="User:Dave3141592">David Scarlett</a><small><sup>(<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave3141592_ff4a.html" title="User talk:Dave3141592">Talk</a>)</sup></small> 03:20, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it is far better to define what aikido is rather than what it isn't - the latter is a slippery slope of contention. That said - I don't think the added sentence really contributes that much since it was already stated that uke "usually" initiates technique. Ergo there are situations where nage does. I say leave it as it is (ie removed). Cheers <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 05:16, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a name="Transliteration" id="Transliteration"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Transliteration</span></h2>
<p>Allow me to preface by expressing my appreciation for the article so far.</p>
<p>That said, I'd like to see someone edit all of the Japanese used for consistent transliteration. I guess you could call me a bit detail-oriented, but it would be an even better article if everything were consistent.</p>
<p>For example, <i>jo</i> should be <i>jō</i>; <i>tanto</i> should be <i>tantō</i>; <i>Iwama Ryu</i> should be <i>Iwama Ryū</i>; <i>shomenuchi</i> should be <i>shōmen'uchi</i>; <i>ikkyo</i> should be <i>ikkyō</i>; <i>do</i> should be <i>dō</i> (when it is written by itself); <i>yokomenuchi</i> should be <i>yokomen'uchi</i>; <i>munetsuki</i> should be <i>munezuki</i> or <i>mune-zuki</i> (depending on which is easier to read); in the subsection titled 'Randori,' 'randori' and 'jiyuwaza' should be italicized; <i>kyu</i> should be <i>kyū</i>;</p>
<p>While those are what I would consider definitely in need of change, there are numerous other words that invite discussion. According to the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28Japan-related_articles%29_4f6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Japan-related articles)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Japan-related articles)</a>, so-called 'loanwords' that have been adopted into English do not get macrons, but all other Japanese words should be written with the appropriate indication for a long vowel.</p>
<p>As such, I could agree that the words aikido, judo, kendo, dojo, etc... stay unchanged. However, is 'O-sensei' properly written? I would argue no (despite what I'm aware is the convention in martial arts/aikido circles), and that it should be written as the article on <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensei.html" title="Sensei">sensei</a> writes it; as <i>Ōsensei</i>. Further, I'm pretty sure that Omoto-kyo has a long vowel or two in there (and should recieve one).</p>
<p>If anyone likes, I would be happy to make the changes myself, but otherwise this kitchen probably has enough chefs already. Looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradford44_dda2.html" title="User:Bradford44">Bradford44</a> 18:11, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>munetsuki should be munezuki or mune-zuki (depending on which is easier to read);</i></dd>
<dd>Pardon me if I am being ignorant, but aren't <i>tsu</i> and <i>zu</i> distinct? There are two syllables pronounced <i>zu,</i> and both are seperate from <i>tsu.</i> This may not be an issue of consistency in transliteration, it may have to do with the fact that different aikido traditions have slightly different vocabularies.<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransentient_702c.html" title="User:Transentient">Transentient</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's a good question, and the answer is yes and no. I hope that my response does not sound patronizing, especially as many of the people posting here probably have a far better grasp of Japanese than I. I am writing in detail because it is a good and interesting question. If I were not typing this at work, I could insert the hiragana to explain more clearly, but I will do my best. First, there is no basic hiragana for <i>zu</i>. It is arrived at by adding diacritical marks to either of two different hiragana: <i>su</i> or less frequently, <i>tsu</i>. In Japanese, many words change pronunciation when used in the second or later position in compound words. Some martial arts examples include <i>kamae</i> changing to <i>gamae</i>, as in <i>jōdan-gamae</i>; <i>keri</i> changing to <i>geri</i>, as in <i>mae-geri</i>; <i>tachi</i> (for sword) changing to <i>dachi</i> as in <i>ōdachi</i>; <i>tachi</i> (for stance) changing to <i>dachi</i>, as in <i>zenkutsu-dachi</i>, etc... all of these are changed by adding diacritical marks to the hiragana for the first syllable. This is a case of <i>tsuki</i>, written in hiragana with the character for <i>tsu</i> changing to the character for <i>tsu</i> with diacriticals (thus pronounced <i>zu</i>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To further complicate things, nothing in the above paragraph represents hard and fast rules. In Japanese writing, this is a non-issue - obviously these words would almost always be written in kanji. Altering the spelling (either in hiragana or in romaji), is not a reflection of correct vs. incorrect, but only a reflection of the reality that occurs when one speaks. That is, if you use any of the above compound words in day-to-day speech, you are generally going to pronounce them with the compound pronunciation. Say <i>mae-keri</i> ten times fast. I promise that at least nine of them will sound like <i>mae-geri</i>. Thus all of the various punches that are expressed by tacking the word <i>tsuki</i> onto the end (or the aiki-jō suburi, which use the word <i>tsuki</i> for its literal meaning of thrust), such as <i>choku</i>, <i>gyaku</i>, <i>mune</i>, <i>kaeshi</i>, <i>oi</i>, or <i>kizami</i>. In reality, even if you are attempting to say <i>tsuki</i> on the end of those words, it will sound like <i>zuki</i>. The final complication (according to what I've been told, and therefore if anyone has contrary information, please correct me) is that whether or not this is expressed in writing, or the extent to which a given speaker attempts to hold on to the original pronunciation while speaking, is a function of regional dialect. For example, in the Tokyo area, it is more likely to be expressed with <i>zuki</i>, elsewhere, <i>tsuki</i> might be preferred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I prefer the change. It looks better, and reflects how it sounds. Further, it seems to me that most schools (aikido and non-aikido) with a significant striking curriculum use the changed version. To be fair though, a good number of them also probably pronounce the word 'soo-kee' (prounounced like 'new key'), instead of 'tskee' (sounds like 'ski').<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradford44_dda2.html" title="User:Bradford44">Bradford44</a> 15:17, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, when I hear Saotome Sensei or Ikeda Sensei, both of whome are from the Kanto area, pronounce <i>mentsuki</i> or <i>munetsuki,</i> my ears definately pick up a "ts" sound. I can't say whether the ears of a native Japanese speaker would hear that though. I can say that a brief survey of sources online shows that the Yoshinkai spells a face punch as "Gamen Tsuki," and the Aikikai spells as body punch a "Menu Tsuki."</dd>

<dd>Now, it sounds as though you feel that our standards for transliteration should be phonetic? I apologize if I am missing the point, but I think we should stick to translierating written Japanese into written English for our article. You are correct that the names of attacks and techniques are going to be written in kanji, and that kanji should have an official reading, and that's what we ought to transliterate.

<dd>which I pulled completely at random from a google search for "karate terminology," show the -zuki way of transliteration. That in no way makes -tsuki incorrect. In fact, given the prevalence of that way of writing it throughout the aikido community, I'm withdrawing my suggestion that it be changed in this article. It doesn't make sense to write it differently here than it's written throughout the rest of the aikido community.</dd>

<dd>As far as my other point (somewhat moot, now), I was not trying to suggest that our transliteration standards should be phonetic. Our translation standard should be the revised Hebon-shiki system (which as far as I know, provides no insight on this particular issue). Rather, I was stating that the development of the Japanese hiragana writing system was developed throughout history with a much greater focus on attempting to emulate the phonetics than say, English. Instead of the same letters having different sounds based on their context (as in English), in Japanese, the 'letter' (kana) changes when the kana's position in the compound word changes. Do you disagree with the other examples I listed? An example I should have listed is <i>tori</i>. For example, there is a huge difference just among aikido schools with whether <i>katate-dori</i> is listed as <i>katate-tori</i> or <i>katate-dori</i> (likewise with all of the other grabs). Obviously it is the same word with the same kanji. The only difference is the addition of diacritical marks to the hiragana <i>to</i>, changing it to <i>do</i>. My original point was only that the whole reason the hiragana changes is because at some point in the development of the Japanese language someone thought that it would be a good idea for a word's spelling in hiragana to reflect changes in the pronuciation of the kanji. If there is an "official" pronuciation for the kanji for <i>tsuki</i> when it is used second in a compound, I don't know what it is. I intend to look in my kanji dictionary when I get home, but right now I'm not optimistic.</dd>

<dd>Non-pluralization of the word <i>dojo</i> gives me some agony on occasion. I feel that the word <i>dojo</i> as it is typically used is actually a loaned word at this point, and my reasons for that are that I first encountered the word when training a Korean martial art under an American who had learned it from an American...and my experience is certainly not unique. Since the word is often applied (at least in America) to training halls for non-Japanese martial arts, and has led to the use of English terms such as "McDojo," I think it is good to note that there is a place for the pluralized term <i>dojos.</i> The context of this article, however, is probably not such a place.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The other place where I find it interesting to take a stand in favor of standardized transliteration is <i>Honbu.</i> I prefer writing it this way, myself, though it brings up some interesting issues. First of all, I wonder if there are any regional dialects of Japanese that would ever pronounce it this way. Certainly not on the Kanto plain. As far as the west, I was at a small Matsuri this past weekend and the Japanese M.C. was a lady from Kyoto; when reading off raffle ticket numbers she distinctly pronounced the number 2 as "mi." Second to the issue of native Japanese pronounciation is the fact that native Japanese speakers, in my experience, use romaji phonetically themselves. So it is almost as if strict transliteration of Japanese only exists amongst non-native users of the Japanese language!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And there is also the matter of the Okinawan martial art Kempo. Anyway, I'd personally support changing "Hombu" to "Honbu" in favor of keeping transliterations standard, but I am afraid it may be controversial in the long run. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransentient_702c.html" title="User:Transentient">Transentient</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Changes made</span></h2>
<p>Sorry if I seem like I'm jumping in, but I came along to qualify the article for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Martial_Arts_6277.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Martial Arts">WikiProject:Martial Arts</a>, and saw a few things I could change to make to 'improve' the article.</p>
<p>I've made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've shortened the opening paragraph, moving the sentence about Ueshiba also being known as 'Ōsensei' to practitioners.</li>
<li>However, I have also removed all instances of 'Ōsensei' but the explanatory note; Japanese honorifics are generally used within a group, and Wikipedia is aimed at practitioners and non-practitioners of Aikido alike. While an aikidoka may understand who is being referred to by 'Ōsensei', someone without knowledge of the art may not, and it is they who we should be aiming to teach.</li>
<li>I've changed the quotation from the blockquote tags to cquote. This is primarily personal stylistic preference, but it is done with the best intentions.</li>
<li>I've scattered a few 'citation needed' tags throughout the text; at present, they are in certain points that I think need referencing. Nonetheless, I believe that this article could go a lot further if it were referenced properly. The internet gives us the benefit of hyperlinks, let us use them to their utmost.</li>
<li>I've archived parts of the talk page (y'know, the one you're reading now); namely complete threads from before 2006.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few changes I propose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extension of the opening paragraph: This paragraph should be a few sentences long, and give the reader a good introduction to what aikido is.</li>
<li>Inclusion of example techniques: As noted within the source for the page, I think this page could benefit from some of the more common techniques, else a brief explanation about them. The sections on training is great, but going from the small introduction to the in-depth discussion of the subjects is quite a shift, and it needs to be a smooth and natural transition.</li>
<li>More references: I've included a sample reference in the text itself, and basically set it up so that one only needs tags. Now, the 'reference' should technically be an external link (or a direct link from the body of the text), but it is to display the reference system to those unfamiliar to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I think this is a great article, and there are some real gems in the text. All it needs is a bit of polishing and some expansion in key areas to bring it up to the standards of the best articles. I am seriously considering nominating this as at least a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_eaa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles">good article</a>, should these changes go through, as I believe that martial arts articles have, until recently, been woefully under-publicised. I would even like to see it on the front page.</p>

<p>It would be great if someone could either fill in the citation blanks or remove the statements. I have no idea where to find several of them if indeed they can be found in print - inclusion would increase the references. Example techniques are tough since there is such a breadth not to mention varience in terminology.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 01:34, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand what you mean. There would probably be a similar problem if one asked for example techniques for Karate. Nonetheless, I'm sure there must be some fundamental techniques common to at least the major schools of Aikido. Or perhaps there are some techniques exemplary of their respective schools of Aikido. Either way, I believe it would be beneficial to at least attempt to demonstrate the technical spirit of Aikido.</dd>

<p>All ranking certification I received from the Aikikai in Tokyo is still written with the 'old' kanji. It appears on most of their significant documents. It is also used particularly used in Iwama Aikido, Aikimanseido, and the 'ki' in Ki no Kenkyukai. This denotes a reverence to the older way of writing it, and evidences its continuing usage. Ueshiba always wrote it as 氣. The very fact that our computers can still generate the j-code for the character shows that it has not obsolete. The character for 'ki' is used in over 40,000 words and phrases in the Japanese language. The government simplified it for ease of writing, however, in any activity related to martial arts, historical figures or gods and mythology, the original 氣 is still used. It really is a matter of what situation and word combinations it is used in that is important. 元気, for example, appears as the new kanji, sure, but 腹の氣, in my computer at least, automatically comes up as the old kanji. Maybe we should ask a Japanese person who knows some history and practices Aikido?<a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 01:56, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Ueshiba always wrote it as 氣." It is interesting to note that <a href="http://http://www.page.sannet.ne.jp/shun-q/" class="external text" title="http://http://www.page.sannet.ne.jp/shun-q/" rel="nofollow">Ueshiba actually calligraphed it differently from both versions</a>, wrapping a spiral around the vertial part of the plus sign under the "bridge" and removing the horizontal stroke from the plus. Although it could probably just have been his personal "cursive" way of writing 氣. --<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterchan_2094.html" title="User:Waterchan">Waterchan</a> 03:16, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Or you could just go to the Japanese version of the article and see how its written there. You see archaic kanji used in formal documents - for example my dan grades are all written using the old numbers - I'm now wondering which kanji they used for Ki. The home page of the Aikikai Honbu uses the new one in text but the gif uses the old one. The older form I think expresses the idea of steaming rice much better and I think now that it should be kept - perhaps mentioning that it is an older form.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 03:30, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, I do not think it should be changed to the modern 気. In modern Japanese the later symbol is commonly used, but for this purpose I definitely think the older Kanji should be used. Koichi Tohei, direct student of founder Ueshiba uses the original 氣 in his books. In most martial arts contexts not only in Japan, this is still favored. From an abstract, martial point of view, it gives greater meaning and vibrance to the character itself. If you ask a Japanese person, I'm willing to bet that they will say that both characters can be used today depending on the context. I can ask a native Japanese person if anyone is curious. --<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterchan_2094.html" title="User:Waterchan">Waterchan</a> 03:10, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I had a half-hour discussion with Koichi Kashiwaya Sensei about this over the weekend. (he's 8th Dan Ki Society, yada yada if that means something to anyone, blah blah), but more importantly, he's a very serious aikidoka who is japanese and very versed in budo and japanese history. He stopped me in my tracks when I said the Japanese government changed the kanji. To summarize what he said: 1) the government did not change the kanji, the ministry of education changed the kanji that are taught in school to make it easier for kids to learn and to basically streamline the curriculum. 2) there is actually no such thing as an obsolete kanji. Some do go out of style over hundreds of years, but only to resurface. 3) Yes, depending on the situation, etc., it is perfectly fine to use 氣. Especially in Aikido and budo related stuff. Basically, both are perfectly fine. I'm thinking it's like how Brits spell color as colour. Neither is right or wrong, it's just a question of consistency in usage.<a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 04:27, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wilson nice addition to the techniques section. I guess you are still touching it up so I'll stay clear for awhile. Judo is a borrowed word like aikido so it should be spelled as judo - the rest of those transliteration devils are fine. Thanks for that.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 03:30, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with PRehse, the techniques section is a very nice addition. However, I think <i>nikkyō</i> should be <i>nikyō</i>. Only "<i>ichi</i>" doubles the consonant when added to "<i>kyō</i>" (and other words), in order to indicate that part of the word "<i>ichi</i>" has been lost. In <i>hiragana</i>, therefore, you should have いっきょう, and にきょう, but not にっきよう. If you decide to include "sixth technique" it would be <i>rokyō</i>, not <i>rokkyō</i>, even though in that case you actually do lose part of the word <i>roku</i>. Anyone please correct me if I am wrong. Aside from that, I too will leave you alone for awhile.&#160;:P <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradford44_dda2.html" title="User:Bradford44">Bradford44</a> 15:50, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks guys. Feel free to change the romanizations (and anything else) however you wish. I'm not sure I have anything more to expand on or add to it, I kind of just wanted to pop it in there, as someone mentioned it would be nice, and adds a nice contrast to the Ueshiba quote to give a sense of balance and info. I described the techniques in my own words to avoid copyright problems (it is HARD to describe Aikido moves using only words!), though I admit I did rely heavily on the descriptions and the names of the nerves and bones as mentioned in 'Aikido exercises for teaching and training' by C.M.

<p><a name="Intro" id="Intro"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Intro</span></h3>
<p>The statement "aikido contains a very spiritual component..." is imprecise at best. This is a somewhat non-scientific way to describe aikido, and frankly, I'm not sure what it means for something to "contain" a spiritual component, or for that component to be "very significant." Therefore, I suggest that sentence be changed to something more lik:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aikido is partly characterized by its emphasis on the spiritual and philosophical development of its students. This is a direct result of Ueshiba's involvement and belief in the <a href="../../../o/o/m/Oomoto.html" title="Oomoto">Ōmoto-kyō</a> religion, as well as <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinto.html" title="Shinto">Shinto</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>.</li>

<p><a name="Spirit_of_Aikido_2" id="Spirit_of_Aikido_2"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Spirit of Aikido</span></h3>
<p>It seems to me that this subject heading is a bit vague on its own, and then not entirely related to the material appearing under it. Is this supposed to be a section on the development of a person's spirit through the practice of aikido, or a section on the spirit of aikido as in the essence of it? The content of the section is partly about the etymology of the word 'aikido', followed by a very tiny note describing the legend of aikido's development. There are four problems I have with this section.</p>
<p>I disagree. I think the point of the section is to show that the essence of aikido, the love and protection of all creation, is contained within the etymology as well as the enlightenment of Osensei.<a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 18:24, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ol>
<li>The first is the title, which should be changed to "The Meaning of Aikido"</li>
<li>The second is the definition of "ai" (合:あい). No dictionary I'm aware of contains "harmony" as a definition or translation of "ai". I have found "meet", "unite", and "join," but not "harmony". As someone previously noted, there already is a word for "harmony of energy", and that's "waki" (和気:わき), not "aiki" (合気:あいき). Please don't get me wrong, I have no problem with the assertion that it meens harmony in this specific context because of what Ueshiba intended it to mean. It would be perfectly acceptable to note the contextual use of "harmony" in the following paragraph, but it is disingenuous to list "harmony" next to "ai", as if it were a proper translation of "ai" when it is not.</li>
</ol>
<pre>
I strongly urge you to ask a native japanese speaker who studies aikido about the meaning of aikido before you get into a pissing contest with other folks who probably know much more japanese than you do. Anytime a kanji is used in a larger word, the meaning can become incredibly flexible, and the western attitude  "this is it, the only PROPER definition" just doesn't fit most japanese words, if any<a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 18:24, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
</pre>
<ol>
<li>The first paragraph below the definitions should be rewritten to reflect the above.</li>
<li>The second paragraph should be moved to its own section that describes in detail Ueshiba's three enlightenment experiences, or they should be described on their own page, or Ueshiba's page. Either way, as scientifically impossible events analogous to miracles, it is unencylopedic to express their occurrance as facts. The sentence should read something along the lines of "legend has it that..." or even, "according to Ueshiba's writings/students, such and such was the basis of...". Even the article on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> doesn't express the events of Jesus' life presupposing that they actually occurred, or even that he actually existed. It says "according to the bible, or according to his followers, blah blah blah..." Surely we should be at least as objective about Ueshiba.</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, the enlightenment experiences ARE on Ueshiba's page. I don't see any conflict with the Ueshiba enlightenment sentences. If you'll kindly refer to a dictionary, any human being can have enlightenment about any number of things. For example, "I became enlightened about how dependent America is on oil when I saw the gas prices skyrocket after the war in Iraq began". Similarly, Osensei became enlightened about Budo being a way of achieving peace rather than destruction throughout his lifetime and his experiences. There is nothing miraculous suggested in those sentences. I would say you are adding your own subjective aversion to the word 'enlightenment'.</p>
<p>(begin tangent) Also, please check out the page on buddha if you want to start putting 'allegedly' next to everything. Personally, I don't think the world contains any 'facts', for all we know we are in the matrix, yadda yadda, so why not just put a big 'alleged' next to the entire universe and be done with it? I don't think readers are so stupid as to need coddling and guidance as to one person's definition of what is real and what is a 'claim'. The universe is bigger than one person's brain or ego, and eventually everyone alive today will be proven wrong about just about everything they believed was once true about the world around them. So let's keep all the cynical 'allegeds' out of it, so we can get on with having a helpful, informative article.<a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 18:24, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Technique - Attacks</span></h3>
<p>Although in most aikido schools "mune-tsuki" is used as the name of the technique for striking to the stomach, "mune" actually refers to the chest, at the sternum, and not the stomach. Should this be noted?</p>
<p>sure, in the japanese language ,but most readers of this article practice munetsuki as a stomach punch, and that makes 'munetsuki' in the western aikido world, a stomach punch. japan has no special authority. If I use a word, even 'galabadab' to the extent that the whole country uses it, even if my original personal definition was 'coat', if the world says it means 'gloves' that's what it means for all intents and purposes.<a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 18:24, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a sensible argument, that the most literal reading in the native language is not necessarily the most correct rendering. However, I am suspicious of the idea that aikidoka "generally" punch for the stomach. I'm used to being told to aim for the solar plexus (hence the alternate and more explicit, if poetic wording, suigetsu-tsuki). I'm not aware of the stomach being a particularly suitable target for a punch. I'm restoring it to the literal meaning for now; I'd appreciate it if others would weigh in on the question of where aikidoka tend to strike at when performing 'mune-tsuki'. If it's stomach, we'll make it that; if chest, we'll keep it that. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 16:26, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Technique - Randori</span></h3>
<ol>
<li>First of all, I think that transliterating to "randōri" (with a long 'o') is incorrect. If indeed randori is written in Japanese as 乱捕り (らんどり), or 乱取り (らんどり), which seem to both mean the same thing, either way it is correctly transliterated as "randori" (らんどり), and not "randōri" (らんどうり). Someone please correct me if I have the wrong kanji or are otherwise incorrect about this.</li>
<li>Second, I couldn't find it, but I'm pretty sure there is a guideline about not making links out of section titles.</li>
</ol>
<p>sounds like you're right, but again, we need a real live Japanese Aikidoka to verify it.<a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 18:24, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Styles</span></h3>
<p>I don't see any specific problems here, but what is the logical distinction between the "styles" listed here, and groups like USAF, ASU, and others, who are admittedly influentual players in the international aikido community? If it is a concept of a school vs. an organization, how can one include Aikikai, but not USAF? Or Tomiki's branch, but not Saotome's? If it is merely because of size, then isn't USAF much larger than Iwama, which wasn't even officially separate from Aikikai until very recently?</p>
<p><a name="Ukemi" id="Ukemi"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Ukemi</span></h3>
<p>This section should exist on its own. In many respects this is the most immediately practical part of aikido. I'd be willing to bet we all know far more aikido practitioners whose lives or limbs have been saved because they know how to fall than because they know how to throw...</p>
<p>No problem with most of it. With respect to styles USAF and ASU are part of the Aikikai whereas Shodokan (Tomiki), Yoshinkan, Ki-Society, etc have not been for quite some time. My suggestion would be to expand the <a href="../../../a/i/k/Aikikai.html" title="Aikikai">Aikikai</a> article itself to include all the sub-organizations.</p>

<p>At present, these read like an interesting but rambling essay on aikido. I'm sort of baffled by their choice as sections, to be honest: it doesn't seem like a helpful categorization. I recommend erasing both headings, and blending the material into a shorter, more direct version. I'll give it a try myself in a bit.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion: Photos</span></h2>
<p>I think we should try to find a cache of free-to-use aikido photos to spruce up this article. I believe this came up earlier in reference to the photo at the top. Take a look at <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judo.html" title="Judo">Judo</a>'s current image: that's an excellent, dynamic shot that (to me, anyway) conveys a good sense of what judo is like. I think aikido would benefit from something similar. At present, it looks to the casual observer as "Some guy holding his arms out, and another guy rolling". (Although it is a nice picture in other respects.) Not just there, but throughout the article, some good photos would be excellent to convey to the casual reader what aikido looks like. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 20:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wordiness</span></h2>
<p>I'm really dissapointed in what I've seen happening to the Aikido page lately. It's almost as if people are deliberately TRYING to make it as ambiguous and wordy as possible. Endless phrases like, "loosely described as" all over the place. If you are describing it loosely, why describe it at all? Describe it or don't. The apologetics and verbal backtracking in each paragraph are killing the momentum of the article. We have all the styles listed at the bottom, so there is no need to constantly backtrack with, "though not all styles do blah blah, many styles agree that...." that kind of phrase shouldn't even be in there in my opinion. Aikido is a massive subject that no single page of wikipedia could ever hope to show in its entirety. Am I crazy, or should this just be a SIMPLE, CLEAR, and CONCISE article that INTRODUCES the topic of aikido. Already the ikkyo nikkyo techniques have become massive paragraphs in their own right. I knew this would be a troublesome section so I hesitated to put it in there. The point is not the various nuances, the point is that shihonage is a throw using the wrist, not shihonage has a long and varied history within many schools of thought, to say it is a throw is a misnormer because......</p>
<p>who wants to read all that shit? I think this page should be written with the idea that a total novice can read it and understand what the hell is going on. We wouldn't teach a beginning aikido class by giving 8 different explanations of Aikido. (an expert class, maybe, but not a beginning)</p>

<dd>Wwilson, I hear you about the wordiness and ambiguity of the language, but your recent changes don't solve the problem. While they make the article more clear, they also make it less correct. The statements:</dd>

<dd>Aiki is considered and elevated form of, <i>ai uchi</i> ("mutual strike/kill")...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>are simply not true in any way that can be considered universal. We have to find a way to balance clarity against the wide array of interpretations of the massive subject that is aikido.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rather than the current solution of massaging the language to the point that it applies universally but looses its meaning, or your solution of clarifying the language to the point it is looses its universality, my suggestion is to drop non universal statements entirely.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"If you are describing it loosely, why describe it at all?" I wholeheartedly agree. Any statement about aikido that can't be said to be true across some large percentage of participants should be dropped. It will make for a much shorter article, but a better one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For example, I recommend cutting the descriptions of the techniques down their bare minimums, deleting commentary such as (for Sankyō): "It creates a distinctive "tiptoes" response in the recipient, as he or she tries to move upwards to relieve the pressure." But before I jump in and start cutting I want to get a sense of how other editors feel about it.</dd>

<p>As one of the above mentioned "total novices", I would like to agree about the problem of wordiness. I came to this page with the goal of connecting the techinques themselves (with which I am rudimentally familiar) with their mysterious Japanese names, and was not able to recognize any from the descriptions given. AikiWiki (which is linked to in the article) was better, but I still don't know what Ikkyo refers to.

<dd>Hey everyone! Good to see that people are, uhhh...<i>spirited</i>...about improving this article. &#160;:) I'd like to publicly take the blame for some recent edits to the ever-controversial "Spirit of Aikido" section, and the Techniques section as well. I'd like to comment briefly on both of those debates. First, with no offense at all intended, I don't think that "aikido is an elevated form of ai uchi" is the best phrasing. It seems a bit of a stretch. To clarify, my intent in mentioning ai uchi was to provide another martial arts "ai" example that might explain to the reader what "fitting" means. I do definitely agree with cutting out the note about 'ai' being a homophone with love, and the other trims that were done. Those help a lot. Here's my proposed new version for the first paragraph of "Spirit of aikido":</dd>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Aiki</i>, or "spirit-matching", is a principle of the martial arts, describing blending or even total oneness in the midst of combat. For example, a related term, <i>ai uchi</i> ("mutual strike/kill") refers to a situation wherein two combatants simultaneously deliver lethal blows. From this martial tactic, a philosophical concept of "aiki" as the negation of violence through harmony has arisen.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Is that getting closer to a consensus? As for the techniques section, after reviewing them, I'm not sure what's too verbose. I suppose that one could describe shihonage as "a technique involving the wrist", but that's so vague as to be entirely non-unique. I think it's a better idea to identify the basic anatomical action for the locking techniques (to integrate them with pre-existing wikipedia articles like Wristlock), without particulars like footwork that are too style-specific. As for sentences like the "tiptoes" description of sankyo, my intent was to help an unfamiliar reader imagine the kind of pressure it produces, although that my be a hopeless errand. I'm going to go through and trim out whatever I can.</dd>
<dd>Let's continue this discussion; I think it's productive. Thanks for your time and energy. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 16:12, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>No GenkiNeko, thank you for all YOUR time. Two things I have to say are:</p>
<p>1) "spirit-matching" sounds really dumb. Possibly the most awkward sounding translation on the page.</p>
<p>2) that wristlock page looks fantastic, they have pictures and everything.</p>
<p>I think that unless we can add individual pictures to the technique section, it's pretty useless to try to actually describe the waza to the degree that a noninitiated person would have a clue what you are talking about. It's hard enough to understand when a teacher physically demonstrates it!!! So if we can't add pics, I think we're better off adding links to the wristlock page and keeping the descriptions very bare. Also, challenge yourself to see how efficiently you can write. You would think your Aikido technique was poor if it took you five steps to execute a technique, so see if you can express an idea in less than 5 sentences, in that same spirit of one strike, one kill. (haha) Lengthy treatises are what the talk page is for.&#160;:)<a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 16:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Ha ha. I'll give it a try.&#160;:) I'm increasingly won over to your position; we shouldn't be too ambitious in what we expect to convey to an audience primarily consisting of people who do not practice aikido. I will focus on 1) explaining the basic anatomical summary in standard terminology and 2) relating techniques, where possible, to the more general grappling database that Wikipedia has built up. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 18:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re: Peter's suggestion...I still feel the two things I mentioned above remain obstacles to this article being worthy of "good article" status. I still think that the photos are suboptimal (rather vague, especially to non-initiates), and perhaps more critically, I find the "defense" and "attack" sections to be poor organizational choices.

<p><a name="Ikky.C5.8D" id="Ikky.C5.8D"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Ikkyō</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>I question the idea of ikkyo as a technique applied primarily to the wrist. It can be done by gripping the non-flexible end of the forearm just before the wrist, for instance. I'm not saying both hands (the one on the elbow and the one on the wrist) aren't important, just that I consider it odd to summarize it as a wrist rather than elbow/shoulder technique.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>How about, " - gripping the wrist with one hand, and immobilizing the elbow as a fulcrum with the other, this technique is used to <a href="../../../l/e/v/Leverage.html" title="Leverage">leverage</a> <i>uke</i> to the ground. This grip also applies pressure into the <a href="../../../u/l/n/Ulnar_nerve.html" title="Ulnar nerve">ulnar nerve</a> on the medial side of the arm." <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradford44_dda2.html" title="User:Bradford44">Bradford44</a> 18:53, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Howdy Branford - I have to admit I find myself disagreeing pretty strongly with your wording... the words "immobiling" or "leverage" are not part of any description of any technique that I practice, and the word "fulcrum" would only be used in describing a point around which uke ends up rotating (not used as something that tori forces like a lever). In doing google searches, I don't find lots of hits elsewhere either, which leads me to believe that it isn't the most popular method of applying aikido prinicples. I'm obviously not saying that it is ineffective - I'm simply saying that it perhaps is not the most common.

<dd>It may be that I'm using fulcrum a little loosely, so let me be more specific with what I was trying to get across. I conceptualize the control of the arm in <i>ikkyō</i> as an immobilization of the elbow with one hand, while the other hand pulls the wrist of <i>uke</i> toward oneself, except all in constant motion. This is a lever (it it helps, picture only the end part of <i>ikkyō</i>-<i>omote</i>, before you take <i>uke</i> all the way to the ground. How do you prevent <i>uke</i> from standing up? By maintaining a strong posture, and extending the arm gripping uke's elbow, which creates the fulcrum from which you can pull uke's wrist toward you. The other end of the lever is uke's body, where the more you pull his wrist toward you, the more his body is leveraged down to the floor.) Now all of that represents only a moment in time, but isn't this same physical structure that you are using throughout the entire range of motion; from the initial pickup of uke's arm until uke hits the floor? Can you do ikkyō without controlling the wrist? Was that at all coherent? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradford44_dda2.html" title="User:Bradford44">Bradford44</a> 16:46, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm a bit hesitant about the term 'pulling'. The way I've been taught ikkyo, both arms are meant to be fully extended from takedown to pin. But in a way the hand does come towards the body. Hmmmm. I'm not sure if the term is accurate or not - I think it depends how you conceptualize it - but either way, I don't think it's currently necessary. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 17:32, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Howdy Bradford44... I agree with GenkiNeko - I would use the term fulcrum long, long before I ever used the term 'pulling'. While my arms or hands may be moving towards me because uke is moving that direction, I never use muscles to pull uke - that just pulls uke into a position that he can counter (often with Gedan-ate). I realize this isn't an place to discuss how techniques work, but the answer to all your questions is that you prevent uke from standing up by keeping him off-balance. And since it is an elbow technique, my answer would be yes, it could be done without controlling the wrist, although it would probalby take someone pretty skilled to do so. My one line definition of ikkyō would be something like "get off-line while taking uke's balance by pushing through his elbow. As uke moves, nage moves as well, keeping uke off-balance as he is guided to the floor". Opppps... two lines! <a href="../../../m/r/a/User%7EMrand_eed8.html" title="User:Mrand">Mrand</a> 02:21, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm content with whatever wording you settle on, and perfectly happy to agree to disagree. I did want to make clear however, that I never meant to imply that that both arms were other than extended throughout the entire movement.<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradford44_dda2.html" title="User:Bradford44">Bradford44</a> 15:56, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Based upon your latest statement, I'm not sure we disagree all that much - but I think our discussion is a very good example of why accurate wording for describing even just the basic concept of each technique may be VERY difficult to compose, EVEN if there is a general agreement on how the technique is done. Many words can be interpreted too many ways. This is why I'm hesitant to even have a "list of techniques", at least in the main article (so I definitely agree with moving it to a seperate article).

<dd>Ikkyo is close to being the exception, especially if you exclude a hand grip. However, the pin is quite painful, especially if the arm is not allowed to rest fully flat against the ground. And the shoulder pressure from a rapid "otoshi" takedown can be pretty intense. Sankyo is also another obviously painful lock. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 15:33, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Iriminage</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm unsure about iriminage. I think I can agree with the recent edit (down to just "though often very little force is required"), but I could see an argument for a rewrite. Really, the signature visual aspect of iriminage is the outstretched arm hooking past uke's head. As for the mechanism of action, well, it's kind of complicated, isn't it? What do people think?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Iriminage encompasses the entire category of entering techniques, so perhaps the entry should be similar to how kokyūnage is written. One possibility is something like, "- the term for any of various throws where <i>nage</i> executes the throw by crossing through the space occupied by <i>uke</i>. This technique most often has the appearance of "clotheslining" <i>uke</i>." <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradford44_dda2.html" title="User:Bradford44">Bradford44</a> 18:53, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Jūjinage</span></h3>
<p>Hi Genki - I wholeheartedly agree with your desire for literal accuracy in the parenthetical translations of the throws, but "shaped-like-'ten'" is pretty literally accurate. "Ji" means sign or character by itself, but when placed after a number, the new compound becomes an adjective that literally means shaped like whatever number precededes "ji". I even found an online dictionary that listed the adjective definitions of "jūji" as: "crossed" or "cruciform". Would you be happy with "ten-shaped throw", instead? Calling it the "cruciform throw" might be a bit weird, I think&#160;;) <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradford44_dda2.html" title="User:Bradford44">Bradford44</a> 19:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True. After all, we don't list kotegaeshi as "small-hand-return". I think I'll switch it to "shaped-like-'ten'" for now, unless someone has a better idea. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 20:47, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What do people think about the inclusion of this technique? I can say that in Yoshokai (and I assume Yoshinkan) it's definitely "its own technique."

<ul>
<li>Retain as is?</li>
<li>Rename to shomen'ate?</li>
<li>Delete? (since it's arguably a variant of kokyunage or tenchinage)</li>

<li>While I'm writing, I figure I should point out a discrepancy the Techniques section: the section starts with the following text <b>by matching another's movements or balance with a dominant complement</b>, yet the most of the descriptions that follow make almost no mention of any such things. Instead, the focus appears to be on nerves, pressure points, and locks - all of which, in my experience, are almost completely unnecessary to demonstrate the essence of each technique. Boy, I hope I don't sound like a crabby old man! I wish I had time to try to find the magical arrangement of words to form golden descriptions of these. <a href="../../../m/r/a/User%7EMrand_eed8.html" title="User:Mrand">Mrand</a> 02:37, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well I hope my minor change reflected that concern. Leverage works for me, so does fulcrum - I kind of like the fact that the descriptions are based on anatomy and physics rather than the less tangible.

<dd>I actually thought about that myself, Mrand. I was thinking, "Hmm, we talk all about blending and stuff above, but then we just list a bunch of jointlocks and other anatomy stuff." However, I'm not sure there's an easy way to incorporate any of that, largely because, it seems to me, the real "aiki" comes in during the implementation. I can't say how the energy exchange works "in ikkyo", because it totally depends on which iteration of ikkyo it is. Furthermore, while the timing aspect is somewhat elusive when one tries to put it into words, the "Grab here, twist there, step through to there..." is very clear. Maybe this is just my Yoshokai bias, but I think it's perhaps best to have minimalist descriptions that just show the basic anatomy of what's going on, at least for this section. After all, to use the above example, -every- ikkyo has the basic elbow/shoulder control in common. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 15:33, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

But it seems like it would only contrast with double-double techniques which are the unique provenance of space aliens with four arms. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 17:30, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't think this article is the place for all variations and permutations of attacks and techniques. Can you imagine if we included all the nomenclature of all the styles. When things get very style specific (and I am thinking about Aikikia at the moment) please remember that Aikikai has its own entery.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 00:29, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

So guys - this is developing from gee lets get a few techniques listed to .... the Judo guys have a page called Judo techniques. What about starting one ourselves? Frankly speaking the list of techniques that we have is about twice what I think it should be, the grabs and strikes bordering on the too detailed. Opinions? <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 02:37, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Absolutely. I think then the super detailed people could get their rocks off without alienating people who want to be introduced to the concept of aikido<a href="../../../w/w/i/User%7EWwilson_1_906b.html" title="User:Wwilson 1">Wwilson 1</a> 03:52, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think an "aikido techniques" page, to parallel the judo one, does make sense. I think that we should try to list every -class- of technique here, and every common grab/strike - those are both short lists, around 10 entries apiece. It's the implementations that get wacky. Actually, I don't think even a separate page would be a solution to the matter of implementations...what, are we supposed to try to describe every technique of every style? That would not only be impossible, but arguably improper as well (we'd be spilling our schools' syllabi all over without permission.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My suggestion: I think the main page is doing pretty well on this front as-is: one-liner descriptions for techniques and attacks. Let's put together an "Aikido techniques" subpage that describes each of the techniques (and perhaps attacks) in more detail, while still remaining true to the style-neutrality principle. As for specific implementations, I think that might be fair game. If you're doing a whole paragraph or two on ikkyo, rather than just a line, it might make sense to, say, discuss shomenuchi ikkyo and its application. But still, we want to be careful not to provide some sort of wiki-manual; more like a more thorough discussion of the uses of the different techniques. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 15:28, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems to be the consensus, as of this time, that this idea (a separate article entitled "Aikido technique") would not be a beneficial complement. Although I initially thought it had some promise, I like many others quickly became convinced that it would only be a headache. If you disagree, feel free to comment, but I'm having a hard time seeing how getting into more detail about specific waza would be useful here.

<p>I propose that, in keeping with Peter's suggestion, we create a new article entitled, "Aikido technique". This would repeat the same techniques listed on the main page, and add the following sorts of <b>content</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include less-common techniques, or notable sub-types.</li>
<li>Discuss not just the basic mechanics but the significance of each technique</li>
<li>Discuss variants of techniques (<i>henka-waza</i>, yes?)
<ul>
<li>This could include -limited- discussion of style differences...recognizing divergences, but not getting into "at my one school in the middle of nowhere we add this one quirk"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discuss counters to techniques (<i>kaeshi-waza</i>)</li>
<li>Discuss <i>ukemi</i> for techniques</li>
<li>Describe some common attack-technique pairs (implementations) that are common to many styles. (Not</li>
</ul>
<p>"this foot here at X angle, the other one at Y, atemi of this sort here..." - that would breach the principle of universality.) This might just be the most useful outcome of the additional length: we can, in addition to talking generally about the techniques, list a few common combinations, like munetsuki kotegaeshi, or katatedori shihonage.</p>
<p>Some <b>caveats</b> I suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should -not- turn into an aikido techniques manual:
<ul>
<li>Should not be style-specific.</li>
<li>Should not be detailed to the point that instruction in class would be</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should not be prescriptive, or a repository of "tips" (although important components can be mentioned as part of the discussion, something like "Common mistakes" would be excessive.)</li>
<li><b>Concision still matters.</b> It's not "spill every random thought on ikkyo", but more like, "If you had eight lines instead of one to talk about ikkyo, what would you mention?</li>
</ul>
<p>Please comment.</p>

<p>I disagree with the concept of making an encyclopedic entry for aikido techniques because there is so much disagreement between teachers on the naming. Any accurate list would have to have many exceptions and caveats for all of the variation. I don't have a citation, but my understanding is that most of the names were coined by Ueshiba's students and that he resisted having formal names. Aikikai hombu may have formal standards, but not even all of the teachers affiliated with Aikikai are in agreement. For example, the current article lists "irimizumi". In twenty years of training, I have never seen or heard this name before, although I recognize it from its description. I don't mean that the name is in any way invalid, I have simply not trained with the same teachers as the author. Another example is "jujinage", most teachers use this to indicate the technique described in the article, others use it to indicate the technique I would call udekime nage.</p>
<p>Some teachers and some students like to have all techniques formally named. There is no problem with this, but I don't think that it is possible to come up with a list that everyone would agree on. A formal list of techniques will always be personal, not authoritative. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwinstearns_4271.html" title="User:Edwinstearns">Edwin Stearns</a> | <a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwinstearns_df71.html" title="User talk:Edwinstearns">Talk</a> 20:36, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You know, I'm starting to agree. I think that Judo had a sub-article largely because they have so very -many- techniques. As I start to think more about what a thorough discussion of aikido techniques would look like, it really seems more like a book than an article. I believe the short versions we have here are ideal as is: they are brief, to the point, and provide the flavor of the various major techniques without getting into messy details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for irimi-zuki/shomen'ate, I know it is often given a separate name in Yoshinkan and Shodokan. However, we could remove it, if people feel that it is too specific. (I might be applying my Yoshinkan bias here; I'm used to it being considered a separate and important type of technique.) The ambiguity about jujinage seems too minor to remove a throw that, to my knowledge, every major style of aikido practices.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While I agree that there will always be subjectivity involved, I strongly disagree with the idea that styles do not all pretty much draw on the same inventory of waza.</dd>

<p>At the head of the section it says Aikikai terminology so perhaps the irimi-zuki/shomen'ate should be dropped. Upon reflection if we keep the list as is or even slightly smaller (its not meant to be comprehensive) then we don't need an extra article. I am thinking of an expanded version of the Shodokan article to explain the Junanahon. A more complete list for Aikikai and Yoshinkan should perhaps go in their respective entries also.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 00:34, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I won't fight this. As a student under the Aikikai umbrella, I recognize all the techniques listed as fundamental.

<dd>Actually, I think the consensus (which I wholeheartedly agree with) is <b>not</b> to make a separate article for aikido techniques. I think it would be a headache. If you mean the list inside the article, though, I think it really contributes to the overall effect, by providing some interesting tidbits of detail to augment the more vague and abstract language about "throws" and "joint locks." It's not wordy, but rather gives concise and informative descriptions of the techniques of aikido.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Aiki Translation</span></h2>
<p>An anonymous IP address added a line to the effect that <i>aiki</i> means "love or harmony". Personally, I find this a stretch. Harmony is understandable, but "love" is just a bit too far. I'm not saying that <i>aiki</i> isn't ultimately about love, in the cosmic sense, but I wouldn't say that <i>aiki</i> "means" love. What do other people think? Personally, I favor not including a direct translation of aiki: they see "match or fit" and "spirit" for the individual kanji above, and are free to piece together whatever meaning they think it has from that, and the descriptions that follow. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 23:37, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aikido was born out of three Enlightenment experiences of Ueshiba.

<p>Sure that's fine, but the controversy is political between Japan and Korea, but this article about Aikido is not interested in that. The only real argument that can be made is that since Hapkido is allegedly descended from Daito Ryu, this gives it the same root, but not being directly related to Aikido, it isn't neccessary to mention it on this page.

<p>Congratulations everyone! When i scroll through it now, i see nice, manageable chunks of concise, clear information communicating what Aikido is to those who might wish to know. Of course it will continue to evolve over time, but compared to say, a year ago, it's come along quite nicely. I think as far as tweaking, people should instead consider adding to the various aikido subgroupings, like iwama, ki society, and so on. It is there that the 'exceptions to technique rules' would best fit, and room for subtle differences in style can be expounded upon. Also, many of those articles are a bit skimpy.
