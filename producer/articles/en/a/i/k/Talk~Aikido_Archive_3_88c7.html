<h2><span class="mw-headline">GA status!</span></h2>
<p>I've upgraded this article to GA status, a few gripes, one is the need for more inline citations especially what with the length of the article, perhaps turning some sections into separate articles in themselves. The opening paragraph is not very informative and needs a bit of improvement. Otherwise, these are minor quibbles and can be sorted out as soon as someone has time. All in all quite a comprehensive effort that fulfills the GA criteria. P.s&gt; Someone should archive most of the discussions! --<a href="../../../z/a/k/User%7EZakksez_1fb7.html" title="User:Zakksez">Zak</a> 22:57, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I don't think we should split articles off but Zak has a point about the first paragraph - it needs a bit more punch. Perhaps elements from the first two sections should be added. Also a few more citations is correct. Someone mentioned that there should be at least one per paragraph but that might be more than necessary. Still - I think these issues need to be taken care of before we can try for featured article status. Another possibility is to ask for peer review with an eye to promotion to A-class but again I am sure the comments would reflect the ones Zak has already made.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 01:19, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Introduction_paragraph" id="Introduction_paragraph"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Introduction paragraph</span></h2>
<p>I looked at the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judo.html" title="Judo">judo</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karate.html" title="Karate">karate</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumo.html" title="Sumo">sumo</a> pages for inspiration and they are also pretty short and to the point. I did change the aikido paragraph to emphasize what aikido is as opposed to where it comes from. The latter is covered later. I still think it needs a bit more.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 03:09, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="History_of_Aikido_-_expansion" id="History_of_Aikido_-_expansion"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">History of Aikido - expansion</span></h2>
<p>I've expanded the history section, but it still needs some more work. I thought I would share my concept for the history section here, and we can discuss whether it is the right way to go or not.</p>
<p>Conceptually, I see two main historical elements. 1. things that led to aikido's creation, and 2. things that resulted from aikido's creation.</p>
<p>Part one can be broken down further.</p>
<ul>
<li>1.a. technical contributions, i.e. the martial arts that Ueshiba studied and how they were synthesized into aikido.</li>
<li>1.b. philosophical contributions, i.e. the effect of Omoto-kyo upon Ueshiba's and aikido's basic philosophy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those things are reasonably well covered so far. Part two should be a bit more chronological:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.a. First Aikido was taught by Ueshiba in Japan.</li>
<li>2.b. Then Ueshiba sent emissaries throughout the world.</li>
<li>2.c. Then Ueshiba passed away, and factionalism among Ueshiba's direct students ensued. (this is indirectly covered in the styles section)</li>
<li>2.d. Today, current doshu is Ueshiba's grandson, and etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, it would be great to cite to some print sources for all of this, rather than the internet. If there is one section of any article that should be heavily sourced, it's probably the history section. As a caution, I'm very concerned about getting too detailed on Ueshiba's life except for the parts that directly implicate his martial arts. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradford44_dda2.html" title="User:Bradford44">Bradford44</a> 20:06, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ueshiba has his own page where we can expand on his life to our hearts content.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 01:22, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The organization of the <a href="../../../a/i/k/Aikikai.html" title="Aikikai">Aikikai</a> today (ie *2.d. Today, current doshu is Ueshiba's grandson, and etc...) belongs in the article on the Aikikai not here. I also think discussing the fractionalism beyond the indirect serves no purpose - people can go to individual articles to find out more. Otherwise we open the article up too much to "point of view".<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 05:03, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also nice expansion on the history section - again just a caution about absolute statements and also "points of view". By way of example it is enough to say that Ueshiba studies x, y and z martial arts it is quite another to say he excelled in the koryu arts. It may seem trivial but not all Aikido people refer to Ueshiba as Osensei but he is recognized as such. We generally need to be careful layering our own beliefs over all aikido.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 04:58, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Preparing for Peer Review</span></h2>
<p>I agree for the need for some more hard citations. So there are three places with citation flags (good place to start) - I don't have the books to hand but for the Saito and weapons it may be one of Saito's books, and I would also suggest fitting in Best Aikido (Ueshiba K and M, and Aikido by Ueshiba K). Would the Aikido-faq dojo search engine be a good citation for dojo through out the world? I added a new one for the randori section.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 04:45, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'ld like to send this article for peer review by the end of the year no matter what the progress. If we can get those citations taken care of perhaps in a weeks time would be ok. I would like some opinions on that. Frankly I believe the article is a Featured Article candidate especially with the recent effort that we all made and I would love Aikido to be the first Featured Article in the martial arts. Think of the glory &lt;----humor.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 05:11, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ha ha. Sounds good! I also share this dream. ^_- Anyway...I'll see what I can do for the history section and its citation-ness, and improve what I can. Perhaps I'll add some kanji for the techniques? --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 20:56, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've been weighing the idea of adding kanji to the techniques for a while, because there is a conflict between accessability to non-familiar readers, and the level of inclusion that I feel is warranted by encylopedia-ness. I like to err on the side of comprehensiveness, so I say add the kanji. But maybe we should get a couple more opinions first?<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradford44_dda2.html" title="User:Bradford44">Bradford44</a> 02:31, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, if I read the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JP_8906.html" title="WP:MOS-JP">WP:MOS-JP</a> correctly, its guidelines suggest that kanji should be used in the article body only when doing so is relevant to the context, or otherwise helpful to the reader for a specific reason, but, kanji for proper names should always be given. Thus, one of the next tasks will be to include the kanji for all of the aikido practitioners discussed in the article (I already did this for the history section, and the MOS-JP provides detailed format guidelines that depend on the person's year of birth, etc...).<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradford44_dda2.html" title="User:Bradford44">Bradford44</a> 02:31, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would not add the kanji - I don't think it would add to the article or the section. Please remember that the names are only the <a href="../../../a/i/k/Aikikai.html" title="Aikikai">Aikikai</a> variation.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 02:35, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I will submit Aikido for peer review in five days - ie January 1st. Last chance to add some more citations - you know we'll be called on it.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 08:16, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No idea - I'm thinking of deleting the entry entirely. Either we list stylistic variations within the Aikikai or not.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of added information without adequate explanation</span></h2>
<p>I had had several pieces of information that I have added removed from the page (a page that is theoretically editable by everyone). I fully appreciate the need for some regularity, consistency and avoidance of style specific terms etc. - and for these corrections I thank the person who has corrected me - but some of my additions have been removed where I do not believe this applies (e.g every style practices techniques from ushiro-ryote-dori, in some styles it is ONLY graded females who may choose to wear the hakama). In each case, I have been referred to 'common consensus' or to the talk page, but can find no reference to the issues in question. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Simonb420 (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimonb420_9e50.html" title="User talk:Simonb420">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simonb420_101b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simonb420">contribs</a>) 12:40, 28 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>I did the revert and appologize if it seemed draconian. Call it lazyiness - it just seemed easier to do a revert. There are two archives of discussions - some where in there was a discussion of which grabs to include. At the very least another entry for ushiro ryote dori grip was removed quite recently using that reasoning (please see History of edits December 22). Please propose changes in talk first. There has been a lot of effort pairing down the information in the Aikido article - we recently got it upgraded to GA status and are going for peer review in the New Year for featured article status. One of the comments was that some sections should be peeled off into their own articles. Frankly speaking if something needs to be expanded - perhaps a new article is in order.</p>
<p>With respect to the grips. Your additions added variations to what was already there and are quite style specific. Not that we don't all do them but the names are different or we don't differentiate. It has been suggested that if we want to get more specific we should expand the articles on the various styles.</p>
<p>The same argument goes for the hakama.</p>
<p>I for one recognize the good faith changes that were made but once again please realize the effort that has been made by a number of people to get Aikido from a confused and unbalanced entity to one of two martial arts articles that have made GA status (<a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumo.html" title="Sumo">Sumo</a> is the other).</p>
<p>Oh yeah - we always welcome contributions. Cheers.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 03:51, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Ok Peter. Thanks for your feedback and also your hard work. Your reasoning is indeed understandable. It seems to be a fine balance as, for example, the article on hakamas is not specific to aikido so the comment would not be relevant there either! Best of luck with the peer review.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pre-war kanji 氣</span></h2>
<p>The article uses the pre-war kanji 氣 instead of 気. This has been discussed previously, but the reasons given for the current state of the article were not very convincing. If you look at the <a href="../../../../ja/%E5%90%88/%E6%B0%97/%E9%81%93/%E5%90%88%E6%B0%97%E9%81%93.html" class="extiw" title="ja:合気道">Japanese article</a>, they use the modern form of the character, except in names of associations etc. that contain the old character and non-literal quoting would be simply erroneous. If you google 合気道 and 合氣道, the former is 10 times more common on Japanese-language sites. It is what you will find in the dictionaries, too. Completely ignoring the most popular form (there is not a single mention of it in the article) is rather strange. If the old form must be used, then it should at least be said to be by far the less common way to write the word in Japanese, and the reasoning for using it regardless should be explained.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions</a> says this: <i>Generally, article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature.</i> I have not looked at whether the Japanese Wikipedia has a similar guideline, but it probably has, and thus 合気道 (the title used) is the appropriate choice for the article title in Japanese Wikipedia. Now, in English Wikipedia neither one of 合気道 and 合氣道 is the article name for obvious reasons, but if you're going to mention the Japanese word at all, it would make sense to use the one that, using such a guideline, is appropriate in Japanese (i.e. the Japanese article title).</p>
<p>In the archived discussion, it was said that Aikikai and others use the old form in their official documents and that it is used in some association names but not in others, and that Aikikai's website uses 気 in the text but 氣 in a gif (which is true). It is alleged that this denotes a reverence for the older way of writing it. I think this is not far from the truth, as it is common to stick to more traditional ways in formal matters related to a tradition (see <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_Latin_dd04.html" title="Ecclesiastical Latin">Ecclesiastical Latin</a> for an extreme example). The Wikipedia article is not such a formal document, so use of 気 would be normal (by 10 to 1, if the Google result is representative). Mentioning that 氣 is used in formal documents such as rank certificates, on the other hand, would be useful to a Western audience, even if the Japanese article does not need to mention it (as the Japanese understand both forms and that one is the common one and the another an old form). If significant amount of important people prefer to always use 氣, that fact would also be notable and could be used as a basis for preferring it here, but the reader should still be informed that it is not the usual choice. Currently no such explanation is given in the article, and for that reason it is also impossible to give references that justify the decision to the reader, as there's no place to put them. -- 82.103.215.236 04:03, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>uggh. You HAD to push the issue! 1) This anonymous poster doesn't have a real account, which doesn't add much weight to his opinions. 2) I'm wondering if someone can find a pic of 気 for the KI section further down. otherwise it is going to be confusing to the reader to have two different ones in there. In fact, I'd say this is a very good reason to argue for leaving it the way it is. I'd say this is the same as the 'british english vs. american english' question. As long as it is totally consistent, leave it one or the other. Both kanji are equally recognized in Japan. The 'ki' the anonymous poster is referring to is the simplified for learning in school texts kanji, but that gives it no authority or even modernity. It's equivalent to people who write '4' closed or with an open top. 3) most dojo scrolls have the 'older' kanji, and since that's what everyone is used to seeing, why not let it prevail? Japanese don't go around telling everyone that they pronounce 'sake' wrong, as that's what's become adopted and accepted over here. Why should we care what is done in japan? We're talking about Aikido in the English speaking world.</p>

<p>1) they don't have to be a wikigeek, but registration is not too much to ask. 2)Yes we need that graphic, as the first paragraph next to it directly describes the visual etymology of the kanji. 3) please reread the talk page. Again, i spoke with the Head instructor of US KiAikido, 8thDan Kashiwaya sensei about this. The man knows more about aikido than any contributor, and is of course a native japanese speaker as well as a bit of a samurai/japanese history buff. He told me directly, regarding this very issue, that it makes NO difference. The government did NOT approve certain kanji. No kanji were ever made obsolete or archaic. The EDUCATION ministry (read: not the big daddy division of gov't.) decided on simplifying some kanji for children to learn so it would be easier for them. That is ALL. Mr. Gwalla or others who think this is incorrect need to provide evidence to the contrary, sorry to heave the burden of proof over to you, but that's where it lies. heresay an educated opinion is still not proof or fact.

<dd>Wayne, I have the utmost respect for the cultural and spriritual traditions of budo, but I believe that this and other articles are the place to write about those traditions, not reflect them. I may persist in arguing my point of view, but I assure you that I also respect yours. However, an encylopedia is ultimately a scientific tool, and should operate accurately and effectively. I believe a compromise can be reached that both celebrates the martial traditions which mean so much to all of us, as well as accurately reflects things as they exist in the present.

I realize it's minor, but...best to be correct. I disagree with the <i>jumbi undo</i> romanization of じゅんびうんどう. We could debate about prevalence, in which I case I could point to, for example, Yoshokai aikido, which uses <i>junbi</i>. But I think the matter is best resolved by simply adhering to standard romaji. If I'm not mistaken (I might be), ん is transcribed as 'n', not 'm', even when preceding a p/b (where English speakers hear something that reminds them more of 'm'). I have not changed it, since I think people should get a chance to voice their opinion here, but it seems like a clear matter to me. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 19:49, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no "standard romaji" - there are <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_romanization.html" title="Japanese romanization">different styles</a>. Personally (in this case) I prefer "jumbi" (phonetic) over "junbi" (pseudo-phonemic), but it comes down to personal preference. As for what English speakers hear, that consonant is actually pronounced as [m] by native speakers. It might be ever so slightly different from the [m] which comes at the beginning of words, but it is still a bilabial nasal stop. If you want to change the spelling, go ahead, but don't imagine that you're "correcting" it. <a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjiann_32cf.html" title="User:Djiann">Djiann</a> 00:16, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If everyone will refer to <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JP_8906.html#Romanization" title="WP:MOS-JP">WP:MOS-JP#Romanization</a>, you can see that Wikipedia specifically prefers the Revised Hepburn romanization system of transliteration. As such, ん should never be transliterated as 'm' under any circumstances, but always as 'n'. Although wikipedia makes an exception for the use of 'm' in proper names of places when designated by the government (Shimbun, Namba, etc...), or for proper names of people or characters where an unconventional romanization is in general use (e.g., <i>Devil Hunter Yokho</i>). <i>Junbi taiso</i> obviously fits neither of those exceptions. I think the point here is not personal preference, but a conscious decision to pick just one method of romanization and stick to it. Hopefully this clears up any further debate. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradford44_dda2.html" title="User:Bradford44">Bradford44</a> 15:00, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wayne, although your request was as polite and humble as always, I must respectfully decline. Or at least, object pending further discussion and consensus. Please note at the outset that the names you are referring to already correctly adhere to the wiki guideline. If you will kindly refer to <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JP_8906.html#Names" title="WP:MOS-JP">WP:MOS-JP#Names</a>, you will see that there are several variables that apply to the use of proper names of Japanese people. The manual requires that where a person's commonly used English name differs from its correct romanization, that this be noted parenthetically. Further, in an English article, a modern (born after the first year of Meiji in 1868) Japanese person's name should be written generally with the family name last, followed by the family name first in parentheses. Please note also that the above rules only apply the first time a name appears in the article, and that this article is fully consistent with the rule. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradford44_dda2.html" title="User:Bradford44">Bradford44</a> 21:27, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Did the founder require wearing of hakama</span></h2>
<p>I removed the following line:</p>
<p>&gt; The founder required all levels to wear hakama.</p>
<p>I removed it because it is unlikely to be true, at least as far as I know. The tradition that male students below shodan don't wear hakama in most (not all) Aikikai dojos probably predates Morihei Ueshiba's death. If he required all levels to wear hakama then this tradition wouldn't have existed. I hold out the possibility that he did require it at some time, but later dropped the requirement, in which case the line that I took out is only partially inaccurate and misleading. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwinstearns_4271.html" title="User:Edwinstearns">Edwin Stearns</a> | <a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwinstearns_df71.html" title="User talk:Edwinstearns">Talk</a> 19:53, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I remember correctly this was before the war (stories circulate about people practicing in their fathers best hakama) but the requirement changed possibly during but definately post-war and was a direct reflection of relative poverty. I would leave it out as is or qualify it some how with a citation (which by the way we need more of).

<dd>Hakama were practical attire for riding horses, and extended from there into general use as a kind of business dress, and proper attire for training in a dojo. So it is highly likely that the founder required all levels to wear hakama, but that isn't a very interesting statement; it is the equivalent of saying, "highschool football players of the late 20th century were required to wear their team's uniform and the proper protective equipment." I don't know how we feel about citing Ellis Amdur blogs for reference but there is a good piece by him on <a href="http://www.aikidojournal.com/?id=44" class="external text" title="http://www.aikidojournal.com/?id=44" rel="nofollow">Aikidojournal</a>. I do think that there are a number of misconceptions about the origins and meaning for the hakama in Aikido (e.g, they are supposed to hide your feet, they are a traditional mark of mastery) that would be appropriate to address in our article. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransentient_702c.html" title="User:Transentient">Transentient</a> 21:03, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If there are links to expanded articles (which there is for <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakama.html" title="Hakama">hakama</a>) then unless something is of great importance specifically to aikido we should be careful of repetition. Since aikido isn't defined by the pants we wear - I think it should be refered to in a minimal way. Perhaps the <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakama.html" title="Hakama">hakama</a> article itself could have a section on symbolism in the martial arts. It already mentions the origin.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 04:40, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The story goes that Ueshiba did indeed require all levels to wear a hakama(as it has been told by Saotome Sensei). In the post-era due to shortage and poverty it wasn't possible for all students to buy a hakama. Ueshiba allowed this however after reaching a certain level(possibly Shodan)you were obliged to wear one. This was translated over time into a rule that it's wasn't allowed to wear a hakama till you reached shodan. The general rule is that indeed isn't allowed to were a hakama untill Shodan. There are certain scholes however that have different rules, or simple no rules('if you want a hakama buy one').145.116.18.2 12:12, 27 February 2007 (UTC)jbm</p>

<dd>I think we had this debate a while ago, and as I recall it was pretty conclusively settled. While harmony might be a reasonable figurative extrapolation from 'aiki', I believe it's more appropriate in this section to simply give a basic, literal meaning of each character, and let the reader figure it out. Else, one gets into a very large and perhaps controversial (oh, the irony) discussion about the real "meaning" of aikido.

The List was a throwback to an earlier version when that section was horrible and yes I think we could and should change it to a prose style.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 03:51, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Done - but it needs work.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 04:48, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good job, Peter. I rearranged a few things and did a little copy-editing. There is probably still more to do. <a href="../../../m/r/a/User%7EMrand_eed8.html" title="User:Mrand">Mrand</a> 13:19, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the changes - I am pressed for time these days so it was a bit haphazard - looking to add some citations.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 00:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
