<h2><span class="mw-headline">Attacks</span></h2>
<p>I will change the first few lines on the attack section. All that was really required to join Ueshiba M.'s dojo in the early days were letters of introduction and not all had previous martial art experience. Those that did tended to come from Judo rather than striking arts. Interestingly when he first started teaching it was at the Omotokyo headquarters in Ayabe - the bulk of his students had no Budo experience. When Ueshiba began teaching it wasn't called Aikido but Daito-ryu and was not a new art. I also removed the "more agressive" designation for striking arts. Irimi can be very agressive and is designated by some Aikidoists as atemi (striking) waza. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 01:12, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">External Links</span></h2>
<p>What is the policy on external links? Generally I can see broad based sites such as Aikiweb, some organizational sites, even things like the Primer, but some look like quite ordinary personal pages. It really is not that long to worry about but hey I'm curious.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 07:07, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I really don't think this is the place for individual homepages. If they add something to the article then perhaps the article itself should be changed.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 00:47, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>My major problem with individual homepage external links, besides the potential length of the list, is the feeling that they act more as advertisment than information. Quite a bit of effort has been put into the Aikido article to avoid style bias and affect a <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. To get your dojo name out there, a laudable exercise, the Dojo listings at Aikiweb and Aikido Journal, are far more effective. If the person who added the last link insists then in fairness I will re-add the other deleted links. If you look at the general trend in other articles the number of external links tend to be limited to two or three. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter</a> <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Rehse</a> 04:12, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bias?</span></h2>
<p>Under "Techniques," there is the line, "Aikido is considered one of the most difficult of the Japanese martial arts in which to gain proficiency since it has such great demands physically and mentally." While I personally train Aikido and agree it's difficult, I don't think this statement can be meaningfully confirmed. What does "proficiency" mean? I agree it's difficult to become adept enough in Aikido to use it for self-defense, but I still think this is too vague and perhaps self-congratulatory a statement.</p>
<p>No offense is intended. If anyone disagrees, please contact me. But I can't imagine that jujitsu, karate, or any other Japanese martial art is significantly easier to gain proficiency in. Otherwise I'll delete the line in the near future. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanspalding_ced1.html" title="User:Danspalding">Danspalding</a> 02:10, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that on the face of it it seems like a weird line, and doesn't seem to have adequite support. What I have seen mentioned a couple times in Aikido books is that the mean time to get a dan-level qualification in Aikido is, on the average, longer than the time to get an equivalent qualification in TKD or most of the popular forms of karate taught in the west. Of course, the authors of Aikido books tend to interpret that as being a side-effect of the difficulty of Aikido, but it could just be a matter of differing ideas of what constitutes a black-belt level student. I doubt that there is much in the way of quantitative data on this subject; somehow, I don't see anyone getting a grant to study training pace in martial arts schools any time soon. What might be worth mentioning is that there is a perception in the Aikido community (as reflected by popular authors, etc.) that Aikido training and certification occurs at a different pace than in many other martial arts. I can certainly say that I've seen reflected on message boards and in conversation with aikidoka that such a perception exists; in particular, I think that there is a perception that because of the philosophical aspects of Aikido, there is a higher standard set for qualification at upper levels- that one must not only know the techniques, but also be a conscientous partner, a reasonabley skilled instructor when dealing with newbies, and an excellent uke for class demonstrations. Whether this is true or not is debatable, but the existence of the perception should be possible to document. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 02:44, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I was also bothered by the line. Here in Japan yudansha rank in Aikido, Kendo and Judo take about the same amount of time. There are also forms of koryu that use techniques as or more "sophisticated" than Aikido. Same can be said for the philosophical underpinnings. As the original comment suggested the statement tastes of self congratualatory back slapping - what do other arts think of Aikido - and should be removed. It is opinion rather than fact.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 00:49, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I removed the line "Aikido is considered one of the most difficult of the Japanese martial arts in which to gain proficiency since it has such great demands physically and mentally." For the above reasons, and because it wasn't a great fit in the "Technique" section. I couldn't find a great place for it under "Training," either. Looking at the Training section, I think the average reader will be impressed that Aikido is a demanding art. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanspalding_ced1.html" title="User:Danspalding">Danspalding</a> 23:21, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is far easier to avoid a punch by using a standard block with your arm and then grabbing the other person's head and pulling it down into a rising knee than it would be to say, blend expertly with the attack, move at the very last second to avoid/deflect the punch, move to just the right postion up next to the attacker, pivote while under complete control and throw them with an irimi-nage. I could teach you to do the karate block/knee smash in about an hour. You'd be very good at it. The Irimi-nage? Uh, not in an hour. I think that's the point the author was making.</p>
<p><a name="Ki" id="Ki"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ki</span></h2>
<p>Hi. Someone (who must not speak Chinese) suggested that the ki in aikido was the same as both the Qi in Qi Gong and the Chi in T'ai Chi Ch'uan. This is not true (although I can understand the mistake; the Chi in T'ai Chi is actually pronounced ji -- thank you Wade Giles -- and doesn't mean the same thing at all). I corrected this mistake. I also edited much of what was written before for clarity and grammar. And added a bunch of discussion on how various schools see Ki -- the old article essentially emphasized the spiritual Aikikai interpretation of Ki which is by no means the only one.</p>
<p>Hopefully you guys can look it over and improve it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The statement that Chinese chi and Japanese ki not necessarily is the same thing, has nothing to do with the etymology of the word but the meaning of it. I have it from martial artists who has trained in both Chinese and Japanese arts, and found that the teachers from the two countries did not mean quite the same thing with the word. Of course, we could argue if a reiki healers and an aikido persons concept might not be the same. Maybe there is not even two aikido persons who means the same thing, when they say the word...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Btw, I think the ki-part of the article is greatly improved by your changes. <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 13:59, 21 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it's not really an issue of "Chinese chi vs. Japanese ki" as it is an issue of "Chinese ji (= chi = 極) vs. Chinese qi (= ch'i = 氣). It is a question of etymology. I agree that the recent edits were an improvement.

<hr />
<p>added some details for ki - as i dont know anything about the chinese version i thought - this the better place&#160;:) (slartibartfasz)</p>
<hr />
<p>Perhaps I'm being needlessly contentious, but you say "No article about Aikido can be complete without a discussion of the concept of Ki"--a statement which contains a link to <a href="../../../q/i/_/Qi.html" title="Qi">Qi</a> but not a discussion of it. Is this irony unintended? Why not add at least a brief discussion of Qi on the aikido page (maybe leaving the more lengthy discussion in place)? --KQ</p>
<hr />
<p>I just recently linked the reference to Ki to Qi because I knew the entry existed. Someone more educated on such a subject than I needs to tie this in, I'm afraid. Better linked than nothing! -<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_D_259d.html" title="User:Alan D">Alan D</a></p>
<hr />
<p>True. Well I suppose someone will pick it up. My last reading on it was in high school, though I suppose I could copy and paste. I'd rather someone genuinely knowledgeable about it do it, though. --KQ</p>
<hr />
<p>In my mind, this extended text on ki does not have much to do in this article. It might feel natural to some aikido people, but I do think it would be better to make this one really short and transfer parts of it to <a href="../../../k/i/_/Ki.html" title="Ki">ki</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 20:08, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hara</span></h2>
<p>Is the link to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hara.html" title="Hara">Hara</a> correct? The page seems unrelated. Can someone write a different page about Hara?</p>
<dl>
<dd>it is another meaning of the word. What do to do with the redirect? /<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Looks like the existing Hara page is the Indian Hara which redirected to another page. What we need here is a page for the Japanese Hara.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have created a Hara page for the Japanese Hara called <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hara_%28Fu%29_110c.html" title="Hara (Fu)">Hara (Fu)</a>, following the pattern of a previously existing page called <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanden_%28Dantian%29_13f3.html" title="Tanden (Dantian)">Tanden (Dantian)</a>. The problem has arisen, due to the use of these two words interchangably and as synonyms, even though they have different meanings. Hara seems more to refer to a body part, the belly, while Tanden is more etheral a concept, being the centre of power and centre of gravity (assuming the stance is correct, of course). A Chinese friend who speaks both Mandarin and Japanese showed me that the characters are one and the same in both languages. I have resolved all links, ie Aikido - this page, to the new page. The old <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hara.html" title="Hara">Hara</a> page still exists, as it is a disambiguation page. I have made a link in it to the 2 new pages, as the terms are often used interchangably. As well, the old and incorrect Hara (Dantian) page should be deleted. I have removed all text from it and unlinked it, so I presume that it is gone.</p>
<p>While I was at it, I also corrected the links to Qigong and Tai Chi Chuan at the top of the section. [[User:Whiskers|<a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiskers_5ae4.html" title="User:Whiskers">whiskers</a> <a href="../../../w/h/i/User_talk%7EWhiskers_39c7.html" title="User talk:Whiskers">(talk)</a>]] 07:14, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I corrected the links to a more widely used way in Wikipedia. The page Hara (Fu) would suggest that there is a category of Fu, which Hara is a part of. For example, see <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assimilation_%28Star_Trek%29_1270.html" title="Assimilation (Star Trek)">Assimilation (Star Trek)</a> -- assimilation is under Star Trek. I corrected all the links, except for in this page (that would perhaps be a little intrusive, to edit others' comments). The page is now <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hara_%28Martial_Arts%29_afdc.html" title="Hara (Martial Arts)">Hara (Martial Arts)</a> --<a href="../../../k/o/o/User%7EKooo_250c.html" title="User:Kooo">kooo</a> 17:51, 2004 Sep 17 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Genealogy chart</span></h2>
<p>Hi, newbie here. I made a chart of the "genealogy" of Aikido some time ago, using the info found at aikidofaq.com, aikiweb.com and some other pages (urls of which i don't remember, sorry) related to some particular Styles. I thought it could be useful in Wikipedia, and converted it to ASCII art (sort of).</p>
<p>I need your help for corrections (I'm not 100% sure wether the info I used was completely accurated), and for NPOV (some may think that the inclusion of Daito-Ryu, Hapkido, Judo, or the Sportive Styles is biased in some way?).</p>
<p>The chart is <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArinArin_SandBox_03a8.html" title="User:ArinArin/SandBox">here</a>, I don't wanted to post it until you had revised it. Do you think it's worth including it?</p>
<p>Thanks! --<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArinArin_66db.html" title="User:ArinArin">ArinArin</a> 11:38, 11 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>As long as the arrangement is your own, and not taken from something else, then I definitely think it's worth including. It's a very handy, comprehensive summary.</p>
<p>A few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schools, arts, people, and other topics should probably be linked to their appropriate pages.</li>
<li>If you're using Japanese naming order (and you seem to be; Ueshiba Morihei for example), then Kano Jigoro is correct. I don't know what the accepted Wikipedia style is (Japanese or anglicized naming order), or even if there is one.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Addendum: According to the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_for_Japan-related_articles_dcca.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style for Japan-related articles">Manual of Style for Japan-related articles</a>, Japanese names should be given name first, family name last <i>if they're more commonly known that way by English speakers</i>, and in Japanese order otherwise. So, it's pretty flexible. Depends on how obscure the individual is to the general public, I suppose. - <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> 20:38, May 7, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>A couple of things to think about though:</i></dd>
<dd><i>The layout makes it _very_ hard to understand what you want to explain.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Jigoro Kano didn't study daito-ryu - he studied kito-ryu</i></dd>
<dd><i>Morihei Ueshiba didn't study Kendo. He did study spear and bayonet though.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Look at John Stevens books for more info about what Ueshiba did.</i></dd>
<dd><i>And "Kano Jigoro" is the correct form in your genealogy tree, since everybody else that's Japanese has their name in last-first order.</i></dd>

I think it's clearer than ASCIIart but maybe too big. Ideas?</dd>
<dd>To do list for the chart:
<ol>
<li>Delete Kano from disciples of Takeda, or move to Kito-ryu.</li>
<li>Translate from catalan into english (excel version).</li>
<li>Check John Stevens' <i>Abundant Peace</i>.</li>
<li>Ancestors for Aikijutsu maybe are too much info for an Aikido article. Delete?</li>
<li>(More)?</li>

<p>I'd move Kano to Kito-ryu. If you make this its own article (which you probably should), then including ancestors for aikijutsu is fine. You'll want to convert it to a form that can be displayed on Wikipedia though--I don't think posting it in Excel form would be a good idea.</p>

<p>I have recently updated the Aikido page by posting sections pertaining to the Body and Mind. I felt that if there was a section on Spirituality and Ki, a section on the Body and Mind would give a well rounded sense of the diversity of Aikido. I noticed today that in both of the new sections, someone has taken out links where I have learned some of my information from. I sited the sections of the text that were paraphrased and don't understand why they were taken out. I would like the person that edited the text to provide an explanation if possible. Cviggian</p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone has any pictures of videos showing the so called "unbendable arm"? It has been described as an impressive display of the power of ki, all the way down to a simple parlor trick. The unbendable arm is a demonstration where the demonstrator extends his arm and challenges others to bend it. Sounds simple right? By "extending ki" through his arm, the demonstrator can make it impossible for anyone to bend it. This sounds really cool and I really would like to see it with my own eyes. Any link to video or pictures would be awesome. Cviggian</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Technical Summaries?</span></h2>
<p>I am myself quite ambivalent about this idea. What would you think about adding a list of aikido techniques/attacks here? Perhaps on a single page, with short definitions of, say, irimi-nage, ikkyo/ikkajo, kaiten-nage, etc. I think this would provide useful information, but at the same time it might be overly ambitious, especially when stylistic differences come into play. (Are we really qualified to describe the fundamental, trans-stylistic essence of, say, yonkyo?) I'd like some feedback before I make such a move.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that this is a bad idea. Not only are there technical differences, but there are terminology differences. The ikkyo-ikkajo issues is only the beginning; what many teachers call irimi-nage is called kokyu-nage in Ki Society. Even within the Aikikai, there are divergent naming conventions. Furthermore, I don't think that an encyclopedia article should try to be a technical manual. It would be fine to have pictures of some techniques as examples with the naming convention used by the person doing the demonstration, but any attempt to give a NPOV technical description would be doomed to failure.</dd>

<p>I think that we should be carefull that this page doesn't become a series of promotions for induvidual styles.

I thought it would be best if people just filled in information about the styles they knew about. The page isn't meant to remain static. According to your logic, if one person can't equally extend the descriptions of all the styles, they must remain the same length forever. I don't think this is the best approach. <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorokun_049e.html" title="User:Torokun">Torokun</a> 01:27, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's reasonable. I am just concerned about people making characterizations like "style A is stronger than other styles" or "style B has more sophisticated weapons training". Very few people have enough exposure to various styles to make objective judgements about the differences between styles. Often there are greater differences within organizations than between organizations. As a compromise, we could start a new list of orginizations under the <a href="../../../a/i/k/Aikikai.html" title="Aikikai">Aikikai</a> umbrella with descriptions focused on objective facts, like leadership, date of founding and organizing principles. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwinstearns_4271.html" title="User:Edwinstearns">Edwinstearns</a> 13:52, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding this article here: can it safely be said that ki aikido focusses more on spiritual aspects and less on technique? I can imagine that depends on how you define spirituality, and how you define technique. I suggest we take that sentence out. <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 19:18, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Which sentence? But as for spiritual and Ki-aikido, I suppose that depends on how Koichi Tohei interpreted it when he first created the style to begin with. What little I have read seems to suggest that Tohei isn't exactly a scientist and supreme rationalist, although he wasnt as religious a man as Ueshiba was, but rather a spiritual man who believes the concept of Ki can heal both mind and body.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, when one think of spirituality one usually think of religious rituals. Ueshiba had quite a lot of those before, (during?) and after practice. I cant remember seeing or hearing Tohei doing any of that stuff in his dojos or in his official "doctrine" for lack of better word. The cultivation of Ki is mostly done with meditation and aikido practice as I have understood it. My own Ki-aikido club for instance has (only) meditation techniques besides the aikido practice itself to cultivate Ki.</dd>

<dd>Actually, to me it is odd to write about "Ki" under "Spirituality". I guess that depends on how you define that, but I would like to de-mystizise the article quite a bit. <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 18:48, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I did change it to <a href="../../../k/i/_/Ki.html" title="Ki">ki</a> instead of spiritual, but I'm not a scientist, I cannot say how or if the concept of Ki truly works or not according to Tohei, but I cannot ignore to write that Tohei himself thinks it works, and how he got to that conclusion, since the article is about him and his life.</dd>

<dd>In Japanese, when the body malfunctions in some way we call it yamai, or byo, which means simply "illness"; but when the failure extends to one’s ki as well we call it byoki.

<p>Fred26, I am talking about the article that this talk page belongs to - aikido! Maybe I was unclear when I said "regarding this page here", but most of the time you assume that what is on a talk page concerns the article that the talk page belongs to.</p>
<p>I am discussing whether we safely can say that ki-aikido is more spiritual than other aikido. I argue that we can not safely say so. <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 17:08, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whoops! My bad..sorry. I thought you meant something else. As for yer question, ki exists in both "regular" aikido and ki-aikido, but the latter and its founder has made it a goal to "bring forth" the Ki in aikido with education and practice. The aikikai, whom Tohei belonged to, did not want to include Toheis ki-excercises, or rather not just prescisly HIS teachings, so Tohei said he would teach outside the main Dojo, which he was allowed to and did.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But there is another style of aikido who was founded by a Omoto-kyu follower. The impression I got from him and his words suggests that he worships Ueshiba as a prophet who was "filled with the spirit of God and talked through him" or something similar like that. So in terms of spirituality, I dont think Ki-aikido is the greatest of spiritual Aikido, but nevertheless a bit more spiritual than "regular" aikido.</dd>

I liked the way the editors divided the people into 3 groups following the evolution of Aikido in the U.S. I am also interested in other parts of the world as well. Please list other Aikidoka if they have made contributions to Aikido as well as similiar books which would be good references. I also moved the List to new page. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetersam_7af3.html" title="User:Petersam">Petersam</a> 20:25, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A section "Literature" is fine with me, although I can think of some books more obvious to mention (Aikido and the harmonic sphere, Saito's books, osenseis books). A section about the history of aikido in the US would be fine; sections about the history in Europe, Australia etc. also. In this context I guess mentioning the book as a source would be the way to go. <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 01:12, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Styles: Nishio and Tissier Aikido</span></h2>
<p>I removed Nishio aikido from the styles section, since Nishio was a part of the Aikikai. Technically he had a very unique style, but we have to distunguish between organisastions and technical styles; a list like this has to be of organisations, or it is impossible what teachers have a style unique enough to be mentioned.</p>
<p>I do not know if Tissier has his own organisation or not, but until I have facts that this is the case I would like to remove Tissier Aikido from the list also. I'll wait a bit, though. /<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 08:49, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that the picture is probably nikyo and is now correctly captioned, but I would point out that there is very little consistancy in the naming of techniques and it is possible that the instructor demonstarting called it ikkyo. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwinstearns_4271.html" title="User:Edwinstearns"></a> — Edwin Stearns | <a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwinstearns_df71.html" title="User talk:Edwinstearns">Talk</a> 18:52, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>I don't see how this can be true. O-Sensei was alive at the time of founding and was the head of the orginization until he died. While it may be true that his son was instrumental in Aikikai's formation and that O-Sensei had little interest in orginizational issues, it seems to me to be misleading to say that he didn't found the orginization. I will change this unless someone can cite a source one way or the other. --<a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwinstearns_4271.html" title="User:Edwinstearns"></a> — Edwin Stearns | <a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwinstearns_df71.html" title="User talk:Edwinstearns">Talk</a> 19:03, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Chinese connection</span></h2>
<p>I recommend deleting the paragraph detailing the argument that Aikido was developed from Chinese arts. As far as I know, this argument has no traction among historians of Aikido and I personnally see no evidence of it. When I see film of Ueshiba demonstrating his art before WWII, I see the art fully formed, much as it is now practiced. The differences are most likely from the developments of his students, not any change in his own thinking. The concepts of ki in Aikido that the author is refering to probably originated with Tohei Sensei and is studies of "Japanese Yoga" taught by Nakamura Tempu. I don't think that the article would be enhanced by a debate on this topic. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwinstearns_4271.html" title="User:Edwinstearns"></a> — <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwinstearns_4271.html" title="User:Edwinstearns">Edwin Stearns</a> | <a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwinstearns_df71.html" title="User talk:Edwinstearns">Talk</a> 13:11, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>While Ueshiba and Aikido schools have never formally acknowledged this, one must consider the chauvinistic military and nationalistic climate in Japan shortly before and after the end of World War II. It simply would have been extremely politically incorrect and counterproductive for Ueshiba's organisation to give credit to the Chinese for his "new" martial art.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I find this here as well questionable. It doesn't seem to fit with Ueshiba's character to hide his training. Additionally, he was rather opposed to most political climates concerning Japan. --<a href="../../../h/i/d/User%7EHidoshi_954c.html" title="User:Hidoshi">Hidoshi</a> 02:45, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. I was very curious when that edit showed up, but I don't have my aikido references handy at the moment. I don't believe that Ueshiba really spent that long in China- wasn't he arrested a fairly short time after arriving, along with the rest of the Omoto-kyo expedition that he was part of? It's also a lot of space in a very sparse history section to give to a theory that shows up in a single autobiographical book by a New Yorker- if controversies over the formation of aikido are going to be discussed, the claims of the Daito-ryu aikijutsu folks are much better documented and more well known. I'll go ahead and remove the section under discussion, and if the poster wants to chat about it we can maybe take a look at the sources, or think about a way to reformulate things so that this single theory doesn't dominate the history section. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 03:35, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Partner Terminology</span></h2>
<p>I noticed that someone changed 'nage' to 'tori' at one point in the article. I've heard a number of different terms for the two partners involved in practicing together; 'uke' seems to be pretty standard, but for the other partner I've heard 'nage', 'tori', and something that sounds like 'shay'. Are these varient readings of the same kanji, or terms that are used in different aikido schools? Nage is standard in Aikikai schools, as far as I can tell. Should there be some effort to pick a standard set of terms and give the others as alternates? --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 01:10, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I changed the edit back to 'nage' because that is the term that is being used elsewhere in the article. 'Nage', 'tori' and 'shi'te' are all used in various branches of Aikido. I agree that nage is the most common term in <a href="../../../a/i/k/Aikikai.html" title="Aikikai">Aikikai</a> circles but in the recent english translation of one of the books written by <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moriteru_Ueshiba_06fb.html" title="Moriteru Ueshiba">Moriteru Ueshiba</a>, current <a href="../../../d/o/s/Doshu.html" title="Doshu">Doshu</a> of Aikikai, the term tori is used. The current defacto policy of this article is to use nage everywhere and to mention that other terms are sometimes used. I would be in favor of removing all technical terms as there is no terminology that all Aikido practitioners agree with (with the possible exeption of shihonage) and because people who have come to the article with no Aikido experience won't understand the terminology anyway. My understanding is that <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morihei_Ueshiba_a300.html" title="Morihei Ueshiba">Morihei Ueshiba</a> didn't specify any of the terminology, but rather his students invented them, which has led to the current state of confusion. If this is true, there is not 'correct' term to use. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwinstearns_4271.html" title="User:Edwinstearns"></a> — <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwinstearns_4271.html" title="User:Edwinstearns">Edwin Stearns</a> | <a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwinstearns_df71.html" title="User talk:Edwinstearns">Talk</a> 20:11, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is tough since the three terms actually have a different meaning. With respect to terminology even Shihonage does not cut across all bounds. Avoiding terminology where possible seems like a good policy and if it really has to be used I think its better to choose the Aikikai version by weight of numbers alone.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 02:35, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
