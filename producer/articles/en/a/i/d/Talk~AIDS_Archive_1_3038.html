<p>re: the comment that SIV (Simian immunodeficiency virus) is "virtually the same" as HIV. SIV is not lethal in its host. That's a substantial difference between the strains. One of the scientific questions about HIV is the relative increase in lethality of the virus vis a vis related strains in primates. <a href="../../../d/w/m/User%7EDwmyers_463f.html" title="User:Dwmyers">David M</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Partially correct. SIV has a high degree of variability in lethality to its host, depending on the host. I added some information in a section called "Immunity" at the bottom. Regardless, though, the virii are quite similar, and are very close relatives. Now, beyond this, we'd need to get into a discussion about the different strains (there have been several branching-off points).... <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7ERei_ee10.html" title="User:Rei">Rei</a></dd>

<p>I believe it is best to separate out the conspiracy theories and the scientists that have a generally unlike, but alternative view of a cause. AIDS is the only place I have seen where an alternative view can be considered denial and other possibly hateful words. I moved the alternative theory sentense out of the denialism section. Lets keep it that way.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jus t a couple of questions - in the text it states that people have got HIV (and thus AIDS) from oral sex - is there any evidence for this; I was under the impression this was something of an urban myth, but I may be talking nonsence. Secondly, AIDS is ofter defined as standing for <i>Auto Immune Deficiency Syndrome</i> - Is this wrong, or an alternative meaning or something else all together. If it is relevant, it should be in the article. - <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETompagenet_9d27.html" title="User:Tompagenet">User:tompagenet</a></p>

<p>The discription states that AIDS is a disease. Its not. It's a "syndrome". There is a virus called HIV. This virus weakens the human immune system. Then you get diseases like pneumonia and others. There is a well defined set of deseases which define AIDS. But you cannot get AIDS itself. You can only be HIV positive. jms 22:55 May 09, 2003</p>
<hr />
<p>It should be noted that the deaths counts for AIDS are not actually measured, but instead a sample of about 5000 women with newborn children is extrapolated to the whole continent. The calculation programs runs at WHO, and no outsider has yet seen this program or the changes that happened to it since the beginning of the epidemic. So don't see death counts for Africa as "absolutely real". Anonymouy, 03:09 May 18, 2003</p>
<hr />
<p><br />
One of the big problems is that AIDS is legacy term. The "S" in "AIDS" stands for "syndrome" and now that the condition is know to be a disease caused by a virus it is no longer a true syndrome. The correct replacement term would be <i>HIV disease</i> but the term AIDS is written into so many laws and regulations concerning disability, benefits, etc. that we are stuck with it. <a href="../../../k/s/t/User%7EKstailey_5463.html" title="User:Kstailey">kstailey</a> Fri Oct 17 15:53:07 UTC 2003</p>

A note on my removal of the "denialism" paragraph. First of all, I noticed in earlier versions that "denialsm" and "alternative theories" were separated into two sections. This somewhat ameliorates the misconception of equating the conspiracy theories with dissidents, but still doesn't go far enough. For one thing, the TERM "denialist" or "denialism" is used in the medical (if HIV research can be called "medical") literature to refer to the dissidents and the dissident movement, i.e. those who don't find that HIV causes AIDS. Whereas in the "denialist" paragraph, the term "denialism" is equated with conspiracy theories. Moreover, the mention of South Africa is especially wrong, because South Africa is more associated with the dissident movement than "conspiracy theories", they don't "believe AIDS doesn't exist", they have questioned HIV. This mixing of the two is confusing and misleading, this is why I removed it.</p>
<p>If you want to put in a section on conspiracy theories, fine. But</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Make it a separate section from "alternative theories", i.e. dissidents.</dd>
<dd>2. Don't use the word "denialist" or "denialism" in either section. The reason not to use it in dissident section is its POV and prejudicial; the reason not to use it in conspiracy theory section is that you're using a word almost universally used to refer to dissidents among the AIDS community.</dd>
<dd>3. Don't equate South Africa, in particular, Thabo Mbeki, with entertaining "conspiracy theories". He is more associated with dissidents, not conspiracy theorists.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you can't do these things, i.e. if you can't be factually accurate and correct, if you can't use POV and prejudicial language, and if you can't separate conspiracy theories from dissident theories, then don't write about these things; if you do, I'll come back and remove and/or edit it. Thanks. User:128.111.88.233</p>
<dl>
<dd>The threat to sit on the article rather than rewrite it in a way all sides can agree is neutral is not-very-wiki. The fact that you do not like the word opponents have applied does not mean we will not report that the word is used. Certainly conspiracy and dissident theories don't have much in common, and if you equate all African theory with the former I can see why you didn't much like the section. We probably don't need the African reference if you think it confuses. Cheesemonkey</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, you can mention that some people use the word "denialist", but if you are going to report that, at least report THAT correctly. The term "denialist" is used by some people to refer to dissidents, and this was not accurately reported; the implication was made that "denialist" referred to any conspiracy theorist, and this is what bothered me most. Also, even if you wish to report that the word "denialist" is used, I still think it should be avoided as a term used by the encyclopedia itself, for reasons given at <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">AIDS reappraisal</a>. As for not rewriting anything...what I removed was so confused and misleading, I wasn't sure what was intended to be said, so how can I replace it? What was it actually supposed to be reporting on? I don't know. If things that are written are confused and misleading enough so that it's not even clear what they are trying to say, then I don't see what's wrong with removing it without replacing it. Besides, as a dissident, I don't really feel it's my place to offer text, since almost anything and everything in this article I find untrue or misleading. I don't want to try to get this article to NPOV, because to me the HIV viewpoint is so POV that it's not worth it -- fine, your guys' viewpoint is so prevalent now that you can write your own article on it, I just don't want to intrude. UNLESS I find something very untrue or misleading about dissidents in general. And that's what I found. I'm not going to try to write a replacement text about dissidents in an orthodox article, because the AIDS (orthodox) article is ALREADY POV TO ME, i.e. my NPOV is not considered so here. So I won't try.</dd>

<li>I'm no expert on AIDS, but the anonymous contributer seems pretty much correct IIRC. HIV is not SIV, the FIV stuff I hadn't heard about. But the contributor <i>didn't</i> say immmunity was a myth, he said that studies showing babies being spontaneously uninfected were flawed. As far as I know, only a small number of Northern European-descended persons are immune, thanks to having been selected in the Black Death (which virus entered the cells in the same way AIDS does). <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">orthogonal</a> 06:37, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hmm. It does seem distasteful. However, perhaps there may be a place in this or another article for comparisons with other pandemics such as the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Death_ffa3.html" title="Black Death">Black Death</a>, which the African AIDS disaster seems to be approaching in scale? I seem to recall reading that resistance to the Black Death developed by evolutionary selection amongst Europeans.

<p>Without stating what common trait is being selected against in those who die or what common trait is being selected for in those who survive, we cannot state that natural selection is at play here. There simply is not enough data to make that leap (see the "immunity" section). Also note that the mere fact that selection is occurring should not be considered 'distasteful' -- death by <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a> already selects <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sickle-cell_disease.html" title="Sickle-cell disease">sickle-cell disease</a> carriers (one copy of the gene) in parts of Africa since some of the <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemoglobin.html" title="Hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a> in a carrier's red blood cells collapse when malaria parasites inflect those cells (and when enough hemoglobin in a red blood cell collapses, the cell itself collapses and kills the parasites). IIRC the Great Plague in Europe also selected for something. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 18:05, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Folks</p>
<p>If this web site is going to be meaningful - then it needs to be careful what it posts as fact. There is not one scientific paper published in a scholarly scientific journal with peer review that shows that HIV is the probable cause of AIDS. Notice - not even the probable cause.

         Alternative theories 
</pre>
<pre>
         A few scientists continue to question the connection between HIV and 
         AIDS, the very existence of HIV, or of an independent AIDS disease. 
         The validity of current testing methods is also questioned. 
         Dissident scientists report that they are usually not invited to 
         attend AIDS conferences and are not granted research funding. 
         Prominent members of this group are virus researcher Peter Duesberg 
         and Nobel Prize laureate Kary Mullis. Their opponents often 
         characterize their position as "AIDS denialism" and believe their 
         public proselytization for their various theories is destructive to 
         the adoption of appropriate preventive and therapeutic measures.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Changes to Article</span></h2>
<p>Please add in more definition. The article is turning out good. Did correctional grammar. I clarified up some areas. The beginning has boxes I don't know why its stretching horizontally like that..I'm still new to wikipedia, can someone fix those boxes for me?</p>
