<p>I changed "AIDS conspiracy theories" to "Alternative theories about the origin of AIDS". This is a more satisfactory title and should be a good compromise. It is NPOV, while "conspiracy theory" is often used in a negative connotation. I ask why was it moved back and why do you have a problem with neutrality? <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> 04:06, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The title is disputed. The phrase "conspiracy theory" is at best ambiguous and at worse extremely POV (presumption inducing).

<p>Basically Revolución, it comes down to whether a user wants to build a language neutral encyclopedia or whether a user wants to encourage sheepish behavior in the masses by using presumption inducing language for POV advancement. It is notable that such a misuse of language was/is a nazi-esque propganda technique though I will also note fighting fire with fire is just as depraved. The thought police are more accurately described as the thought middle men. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 22:53, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, that's why I'm here, to encourage sheepish behavior by the masses by using nazi-esque propaganda techniques.

<p>May I ask why the title was changed by <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">User:Revolución</a> in the first place? We've already explained why we think that "AIDS conspiracy theories" is a better title. We've already had a lengthy discussion with many editors with a clear consensus opposing this change.

<dd>It looked to me as though there had been no comments for <i>nine</i> days, and that there <i>was</i> consensus. I'd like an agreed time when this can be settled, but I'm pretty easy. In the end this should either be settled or moved to request for comment. I notice that you have not placed a quasi-vote in the section you unboxed. Was that on purpose? Are you abstaining?<br />

<dd>No one noticed the vote apparently and given the discussion and infered votes in this section and previous votes above it may be redundant, but if you insist. Disputed headers come into play when there is a legitimate neutrality dispute, they would never be used if the majority could simply outvote the minority to remove them. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 07:32, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the dispute remains legitimate then yes it should stay, it would encourage discussion to reach true consensus. If the pro disputed header folks stop making logical arguments (and/or seem interested in just keeping an ugly header at the top of the article) that can be used as evidence the dispute is no longer legitimate. Separately, I was thinking of creating a template called {SpecificDispute} which would take a text argument for each situation to signify *exactly* what is disputed rather than being forced to fit each dispute within pre-existing templates, or I suppose each article could just have custom warning/notice text at the top and simply not use a template. Also, perhaps instead of a big red warning that doesn't convey much context, the warning should look more like a disambig notice and it should describe exactly what the concern over the alleged neutrality violation is so readers have the full context, i.e. in this case the brief warning at the top would say something along the lines of the rough "Notice: there is a dispute over whether the phrase 'conspiracy theory' biases the presentation of this subject, see the talk page". Readers should be made conscious of the exact details of the dispute and what to watch out for (as succinctly as possible), rather than just having a random nearly contextless warning that in many cases I agree does damage article quality. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 08:33, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was requested by Zen-master to have a look at this whole situation. As an objective outsider (I haven't voted anything nor expressed an opinion anywhere on this), I've come to the following conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were many votes at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EConspiracy_theory_archive2_d4c8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Conspiracy theory/archive2">Wikipedia talk:Conspiracy theory/archive2</a> stipulating a case-by-case discussion should be had for each one</li>
<li>With the previous point in mind:
<ul>
<li>I find no consensus on the words "conspiracy" or "consensus"</li>
<li>I find no consensus on this page</li>
<li>I can't reasonable understand how anyone can claim a consensus has been made when the very word consensus is being debated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The revert war on this page shows to me that not only has the dispute about the title not been settled, the definition of "consensus" is still not settled</li>
<li>I think a vote needs to proceed immediately to determine a more numerical support as having read this talk page....I find nothing, only an attempt on a vote that seems overly complicated (version numbers??)</li>
<li>I think Zen's violation of the 3RR should be upheld primarily because of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#What_Vandalism_Is_Not" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism#What Vandalism Is Not</a></li>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>I will be blocking Jayg for violation as well in a moment, which will be explained on his talk page.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last concluding note: I want to stress that the dispute as to whether or not there is a dispute clearly shows to be that no consensus has ever been formed. I would encourage this talk page to be archived, the discussion started afresh, some points and definitions be clarified, and a vote held (maybe even list on WP:RM for more advertisement). <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 01:05, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Where is it written in policy that the counter argument of a proposed policy that fails becomes policy itself? The counter argument did not explicity note it was itself a policy proposal, in fact, the counter argument option was "keep conspiracy theory titles as is" and we have not changed them as a group, the counter vote option was not "change policy", how are you construing that? "As is" means neutrality concerns are still decided on a case by case basis, how was WP policy possibly changed through an anti-proposal argument when nothing was explicitly noted? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 20:23, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although I don't generally hold with Zen-master's crusade over "conspiracy theories", this is a rather special case. Not all of the theories about AIDS concern "conspiracies". One specifically notes that it is thought to have originated in an accident. I don't generally feel Zen has grounds for his dissent over this issue -- although I agree with him that there is no "consensus" while some editors try to silence him by browbeating him with a majority vote, which may well be the vogue in Wikipedia but is not something to be lauded in my view and is definitely not something that has a place in the ideal wiki -- but I think Alternative theories on the origin of AIDS or something similar would be a much better title. It could consider any and all theories -- making the kind of synthetic article that Wikipedia can sometimes do much better than any other medium, since Wikipedia is not restricted for space or by overarching editorial control. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 04:54, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>My apologies. I see this suggestion was already shouted down by one of the editors who, because he is part of the majority, does not feel that there's any point actually building a consensus. Still, Dante's suggestion is a good one. Not only would it resolve Zen-master's problem but it would make a much better article. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 04:58, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just happened to stumble across this.</p>
<p>There's every reason to believe that, at least in this case, "conspiracy theory" is POV. While you can get technical about it all you want, a significant number of people (perhaps even the majority of English speakers) associate "conspiracy theory" with "something espoused by crazy people". And at least one of these theories is not a conspiracy in the technical sense, others are on par with theories about space potatoes, lending credence to the meaning "things suggested by nutters".</p>
<p>Most of the theories presented here are either non-science or easily refuted, especially the theories insisting AIDS began in the late 70s and/or it involving genetic engineering. There's pretty definite evidence it existed before we had the capability to do this.</p>
<p>As I see it there are four choices. The three obvious ones are to call a spade a spade and title the page "Pseudo-scientific AIDS theories", create a single page called "AIDS alternative theories" and include the more scientific-sounding non-mainstream alternatives, or simply name this page something truly neutral like "AIDS alternative theories". There's simply no need to keep the current name, and good reason to change it.</p>
<p>Or, better still, create a page called something like "Theories of the causes of AIDS" and list all of them, with a brief explanation of HIV at the start plus a separate link to the page containing complete information on the HIV theory. The briefer theories won't need separate pages. If you truly want to be NPOV, that's the right alternative; it makes it clear that the mainstream theory is HIV, but that there are others worth considering.</p>
<p>(Personally, I think it's HIV and that the other theories listed here are nutso. I'm just suggesting a better way to be NPOV.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm just checking this out now too, and here's my view. Part of the problem is a lack of consensus as to what a "conspiracy theory" is. I personally use it in a very precise way (as in, a theory, usually resistant to verifiability, that alleges a hidden conspiracy), not in the more general "loony theory" sense. I would argue that we should stick to the more precise definition, in part because encyclopaedias are supposed to be precise and demonstrate (by example) critical thinking, and using terminology in a "loose" way defeats all of these. In addition, it reduces the utility of the term to have it be synonmous with a broader class of bogus theories.</dd>
<dd>There's also the problem of whether a theory that posits that AIDS was <i>originally</i> natural, but is <i>now</i> the subject on some conspiracy - e.g. to say, hide a cure - is an "AIDS conspiracy theory". To me, it's an important distinction to make, in part because it's more heinous to have deliberately created such a thing and set it loose, and in part because <i>the evidence needed to show it's untrue</i> is different.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Moving on to the theories listed in the article, some of them aren't conspiracy theories at all, e.g. the Edward Hooper and William C. Douglas theories. (I can't tell about Matilde Krim because the entry doesn't say where she thinks the virus originally did come from).</dd>
<dd>Others fall into that grey area where there is a conspiracy, but it's not related to the origin and spread of the disease - Hulda Clark seems to fall into this class.</dd>
<dd>Then there are people like Thabo Mbeki and Peter Duesberg, whose theories aren't fundamentally conspiracy theories, in that they seem to concede that AIDS has natural and/or accidental causes (but argue that it is not caused by HIV). There may be minor aspects of their models which count as conspiracy theories (e.g. why keep giving AZT when it's poisonous and doesn't work), but I don't really think you can call them conspiracy theories.</dd>
<dd>Cold War Propaganda is in a class by itself, because it claims that there was a <i>real</i> conspiracy - to promulgate a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_propaganda.html" title="Black propaganda">black propaganda</a> conspiracy theory about the cause of AIDS! (I looked up the Mitrokhin citation, but alas that book, otherwise well noted as to sources, gives no notes for its source for its main section about this claim, although a later references notes <a href="../../../o/l/e/Oleg_Gordievsky_6e1b.html" title="Oleg Gordievsky">Oleg Gordievsky</a>, who would have been in a position to know. A subject for later investigation, but if it can be sourced, e.g. to Gordievsky, I think I'd be inclined to drop Cold War Propaganda entry entirely, except to note that it was the motivation <i>behind</i> Jakob Segal's work.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All of which leads me to agree that "AIDS conspiracy theories" is an inappropriate name for this article. Ideally, I'd like to see it titled something like "Non-mainstream theories about AIDS", and divided up into sections:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Alternative theories about the causes of AIDS" (which would hold Duesbery, Mbeki et al, those who propose it's not HIV)</li>
<li>"Alternative theories about the spread of AIDS" (which would hold Hooper, Douglas et al who agree it's HIV, but say the spread was caused by human activity, but not deliberately)</li>
<li>"Conspiracy theories about the causes and spread of AIDS" (which would hold everyone who feels there was deliberate creation/spread - I don't feel it's useful to divide this into the two constituent groups)</li>
<li>"Other AIDS conspiracy theories" (which would hold people like Clark, who allege post-spread conspiracies)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This has the nice attribute that some theories are clearly labelled "conspiracy theories" (which should mollify one camp) while pointing out that they aren't all conspiracy theories (which should mollify the other camp)! I'm only worried that then there would be arguments about which category to list various theories in!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 20:19, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Noel's proposal is an organizational improvement but what about the point that "conspiracy theory" is non neutral language and violates NPOV? Is <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">Flat Earth</a> titled "Dubious Flat Earth theory"? Answer: no. Evidence has to be <i>presented</i> and <i>described</i> neutrally first, before conclusions of dubiousness or "conspiracy theory" can be determined, to do otherwise taints any article. I ok with section sub titles along the lines of "non-mainstream theories about the spread of aids". Let's not forget scientists are the ones alleging these supposed "conspiracy theories" so there is absolutely zero logical rationale for using dubious and discrediting presentation method and language here. Even labeling the theories "dubious" would be a drastic improvement over "conspiracy theory" as far as NPOV is concerned. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 20:19, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Theories which allege a conspiracy are, facially, "conspiracy theories". How can the use of "conspiracy theory" to describe a theory which alleges a conspiracy be NPOV? It's a flat, factual description of the theory. If you claim that the term "conspriacy theory" is inherently dismissive, would you be OK if we labelled the sections, e.g., "theories which allege a conspiracy related to the cause and spread of AIDS"? Would that really make any difference? <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 21:12, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I am ok if we describe the theories as "Many people consider these theories to be dubious" but I do not support subtly duplicitious language such as "conspiracy theory" which subtly concludes things about a subject inappropriately, titles especially should not do that. And where is the requirement that we have to focus on describing these theories as only involving people conspiring, there are many other valid ways of describing them...? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 21:34, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's only permanent if you choose not to debate and not work towards true 100% conensus. The NPOV policy means dispute headers are added if an in good faith dispute exists. I am not saying time can't be considered a factor, I am saying in this case there clearly still is a dispute. Time is only a factor if it becomes obvious someone is just trying to damage the look of an article, in this case many people agree there is an arguably valid neutrality complaint here. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 17:56, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Of course I assert that, because it is fact. The vote was taken, consensus was decided, and no new arguments have been raised in months. Either the title has "conspiracy theory" in it or it does not; there is no middle ground. The minority is insisting on a "compromise", but that "compromise" means that the title cannot contain the term "conspiracy theory", so it's no compromise at all, nor in good faith. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:09, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

The problem is, Jayig, that vote didn't decide what you're claiming it did. That vote defeated a proposal that was to remove all "conspiracy theory" titles, Wikipedia-wide. That proposal failed. The argument here is that this particular article needs to have that aspect of the title changed. Your "consensus" to "keep conspiracy theory" was not what you're saying it was. It was simply saying, "No, don't get rid of them all"... which is not the same as saying, "KEEP ALL OF THEM FOREVER OMGLOLLBBQ!!!!1" --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 18:48, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Jayjg, can you point me to a vote where it was decided, specifically, that all "conspiracy theory" titled articles are ok? As I've explained to you before a vote for "keep 'conspiracy theory' articles as is" means we should not change them all as a group, which is exactly what has happened, but neutrality concerns are still decided on a case by case basis individually and the vote was not "there is no dispute". Also note NPOV disputes, separate from other wikipedia policies, work off of true consensus not majority. Also note a highly related dispute over the appropriateness of "conspiracy theory" in another article's title <a href="../../../s/a/d/Talk%7ESaddam_Hussein_and_Al-Qaeda_6b8e.html" title="Talk:Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda">Talk:Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda</a> so this proves "conspiracy theory" is still actively disputed. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 18:15, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to propose several edits to be made during this time while the article is protected. I think they are neutral and factual. They are related to the second bullet point, on Edward Hooper. I was surprised to see a suggested origin in the era of Salk, Sabin, and the polio vaccine, since I thought AIDS had a later origin than that, and I searched the web for some additional information. I found several sources (noted below) that show that Dr. Koprowski's polio vaccine was administered in the late 1950s. I propose that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The spelling of Dr. Koprowski's name be corrected (it is spelled "Kaprowski" in the article).</li>
<li>The dates 1956-1960, or more conservatively, the period "late 1950s", be added to fix this theory in time.</li>
<li>The links to [[Salk]] and [[Sabin]] be changed to [[Jonas Salk|Salk]] and [[Albert Sabin|Sabin]].</li>
<li>The name of Koprowski's vaccine, CHAT, or other information from the sources I found, or links to the sources themselves, might be useful additions. I leave that to the discretion of others.</li>
</ol>
<p>The sources are the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/witness/originsofaids/polio.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/witness/originsofaids/polio.html" rel="nofollow">CBC</a>, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/431167.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/431167.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC</a>, <a href="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/AIDS/Koprowski92.html" class="external text" title="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/AIDS/Koprowski92.html" rel="nofollow">a letter from Dr. Koprowski to <i>Science</i></a> (on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wollongong_0999.html" title="University of Wollongong">University of Wollongong</a>'s web site), and <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/01/14/MN140641.DTL&amp;type=printable" class="external text" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/01/14/MN140641.DTL&amp;type=printable" rel="nofollow">an article in the San Francisco Gate</a>.</p>
<p>I am hesitant to wade into the "conspiracy theory" debate, but I would say that although it does have a negative connotation, it can be used to describe a theory about conspiracies. However, no conspiracy is even alleged in the Koprowski case, so the title may not be an accurate summary of the theories in the article regardless of any negative connotations of the term.</p>

"Conspiracy theories" is a fine description of theories that allege conspiracies, such as those that claim it was created covertly as a biowarfare agent, but many of the theories described on this page, such as Thabo Mbeki's viewpoints, don't allege any conspiracy at all. I think we should either make this page only be about actual conspiracy theories such as the biowarfare one, or rename it to some broader term, such as Non-mainstream views on HIV/AIDS that covers basically any viewpoint other than the mainstream one accepted by the scientific community. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 18:14, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can we please just move the article to Alternative theories about AIDS (a suitably neutral title), and divide them up into sections, with the minor change that we label the sections which allege conspiracies "theories which allege a conspiracy related to the cause and spread of AIDS" and "other theories which allege a conspiracy related to AIDS"? That avoids use of the dreaded "conspiracy theory" phrase, but keeps prominent the fact that these theories allege conspiracies. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 21:22, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Conspiracy theory" is fine. Your suggestion above was good. I'm all for compromise, including on the title, but Zen-master insists that there cannot be "100% Compromise" until the phrase "Conspiracy theory" is excised from the page. That's not compromise at all, especially considering the fact that consensus was that the phrase was just fine. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:30, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My understanding is that ZM would vastly prefer that conspiracy theory be excised from the article completely, but that he recognizes that fixing the article title is an important move nonetheless. Aside from that, there are the rest of us who would support such an article title change. I don't really see that anyone is saying (still) that the article title ought to steadfastly remain "AIDS conspiracy theories" --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 21:50, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was a vote on this, strong consensus that "Conspiracy theory" was just fine. ZM has been picking away at this ever since; I'm sure if we involved all the people who took part in the original vote, the view of the "rest of us" would change dramatically. I'm certainly not going to accept any unilateral change of the name, when there was a recent vote taken to <b>not</b> do that. The only valid reason I can see for a name change is that not all the items listed here are conspiracy theories. If we could get agreement that the content would be divided into sections, including the Conspiracy theory sections, then it might make sense to rename the article. However, if the point is just to get Conspiracy theory out of the article a little bit at a time, against previous consensus, then no, that won't fly. Get agreement on all the items, <b>now</b>; I'm not interested in having this article held hostage by ZM for another 3 months until he gets his way in everything (what he calls "100% consensus"). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:00, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As Dante, others and I have explained to you Jayjg, the vote you refer to does not mean what you think it means. Please point out where in the counter arguement it proposed that "conspiracy theory" was "just fine"? A vote against one proposal does not an opposite precedent make, especially when not explicitly noted.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Jayjg, would you support something like "Many people consider these theories to be 'conspiracy theories'" inside the article (in the sub section) so it's clear to the reader there is a <i>chance</i> the theories are not "conspiracy theories" (i.e. we shouldn't conclude dubiousness completely)? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 22:10, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, they ARE conspiracy theories, so including a tiny-minority view that they aren't conspiracy theories is not necessary, per NPOV. ZM, point out the argument where "conspiracy theory" is "not fine"? Also, the dream scenario of 100% consensus does not exist, else articles would be held hostage by tiny bands of POV-warriors...Also, Jayjg is right to say that the NPOV tag is for noting disputes between encyclopedic sources, not editors. Failing to ram through your name change does not mean you put an NPOV tag on the article. --<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrfixter_3580.html" title="User:Mrfixter">Mrfixter</a> 23:36, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My issue with them is that many of them are clearly <i>not</i> conspiracy theories. They may well be wacky unscientific theory, but a conspiracy theory is specifically a theory that alleges a conspiracy. Some of these do do that: The theory that AIDS was developed as a biowarfare agent is indeed a conspiracy theory. Others, however, such as the dubious claim that HIV doesn't cause AIDS, may be bad science and wrong, but don't involve conspiracies. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 23:57, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Responding to Mrfixter, they may literally be theories of people conspiring under the first definition of the phrase but the point is we shouldn't additionally hint at a predetermined conclusion of dubiousness under the secondary definition automatically too. I am ok if we state in the article, using NPOV language, something like "Many people allege these theories are dubious" or even "Many people have concluded that these theories are dubious". But using the phrase "conspiracy theory" is an extreme POV violation as it is needlessly ambiguous on a subconscious level which is completely unnecessary because we can just state what we mean directly with pristine conscious clarity. Given the secondary definition of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> that describes it as "connoting that the subject is unworthy of being taken seriously" how are all theories of people literally conspiring not potentially illegitimately tainted with a hint of "dubiousness" if the phrase "conspiracy theory" is used to describe them? If something has no basis in fact we should simple state "it has no basis in fact" which is exactly what we do inside the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">Flat Earth</a> article, rather than resort to subconscious language confusion ("conspiracy theory"'s having two defintions, one of which means dubious, is the language confusion). Why take a chance of confusion and/or illegitimate biased presentation if we can just state facts directly using alternative simple and clear language? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 00:13, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>needlessly ambiguous on a subconscious level</i> - I think we should stick to writing WP articles on a conscious level, else we get into all sort of problems, IMO. Anyway, its the primary meaning of "conspiracy theory" that we are dealing with and its not being used in a prejorative context (consciously). Its obvious that we are all taking this article very seriously (even a little too seriously) so there is no way the secondary definition applies here. That you think using the term is an extreme POV violation is a tiny minority view and should be ignored, per NPOV. --<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrfixter_3580.html" title="User:Mrfixter">Mrfixter</a> 07:48, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That doesn't make sense. If there is a chance of misinterpretation with "conspiracy theory" why not use language where there is no chance of misinterpretation? Do a google search for site:en.wikipedia.org and "conspiracy theory" and you will see, even on just talk pages, it's used pejoratively all the time. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 11:03, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know you and others claim "conspiracy theory" means only a theory of people conspiring, yet I also know it is used all over the place to discredit things (see the list of discrediting uses below) so I know there is a profound inconsistency somewhere. Here is how the language confusion might work: because the phrase "conspiracy theory" has a strong hint of implied dubiousness and also because its <i>literal</i> definition means simply a theory of people conspiring, people errantly assume (at whatever conscious or subconscious level) that the theory being described must <i>literally</i> be dubious too. It's the combination of having a <i>literal</i> easily true first definition and a discrediting dubiousness connotation under the secondary definition. The most plausible explanation is that this complex language confusion is/was by design, especially when one factors in the illogical repetition used to defend and perpetuate it. 13:21, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The proof is in the section below, there are numerous examples of "conspiracy theory" used to discredit things just within Wikipedia. Whether the ambiguity is subconscious or not doesn't eliminate the point that there <i>is</i> ambiguity (unnecessarily imprecise language). The "subconscious ambiguity" instead is more accurately described as "an errant initial gut reaction interpretation of language", the problem really centers around the fact that the phrase "conspiracy theory" is described as being "literally true" under the first definition (a theory of people conspiring), so the discrediting dubiousness secondary definition baggage is also assumed by the mind to be literally true too, to a certain extent it comes along for the "literally true" ride illegitimately. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 16:24, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like "AIDS origin theories" but as far as sub section titles go I think we can come up with a more neutral way of describing even arguably dubious theories than using the ambiguous and improperly discrediting phrase "conspiracy theory". Separately, the NPOV policy requires us to state who and how someone has concluded that some of the theories are allegedly dubious, which is impossible when the phrase "conspiracy theory" is used in a descriptive, conclusive sense. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 19:20, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Here is a surprising usage case, the phrase "conspiracy theory" appears to be used to discredit an alleged connection between Timothy Mcveigh and Al-Qaeda/the middle east, apparently in response to a WSJ opinion article (very interesting...) <a href="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:ExQTKUnUoxQJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Timothy_McVeigh+site:en.wikipedia.org+talk+%22%5B%5Bconspiracy+theory%5D%5D%22&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:ExQTKUnUoxQJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Timothy_McVeigh+site:en.wikipedia.org+talk+%22%5B%5Bconspiracy+theory%5D%5D%22&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>Here is a case where someone describes a "conspiracy theory" as "(presumed) wildly speculative hogwash", hmmm Mrfixter and Jayjg and others certainly won't like the fact that a phrase that they claim <i>only</i> means a theory of people literally conspiring is being used like this (I am being sarcastic): <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:0B9y0L4BuuwJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stanley_Kubrick+site:en.wikipedia.org+talk+%22%5B%5Bconspiracy+theory%5D%5D%22&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:0B9y0L4BuuwJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stanley_Kubrick+site:en.wikipedia.org+talk+%22%5B%5Bconspiracy+theory%5D%5D%22&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
<li>Here is a use that stretches even the definition of "conspiring", trying to be used in a historical context to discredit possibilities, note it doesn't simply say "Japan likely did not have nuclear weapons" it merely says, to discredit it, "There is a conspiracy theory that Japan tested nuclear weapons during WWII" <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:4XBg3XoWEkMJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_countries_with_nuclear_weapons+site:en.wikipedia.org+talk+%22%5B%5Bconspiracy+theory%5D%5D%22&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:4XBg3XoWEkMJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_countries_with_nuclear_weapons+site:en.wikipedia.org+talk+%22%5B%5Bconspiracy+theory%5D%5D%22&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>

<p>Responding to Mrfixter, nice try at mischaracterization, this list exists to disprove your and jayjg's claim that "conspiracy theory" does not have any discrediting secondary definitions or is never used as such.

<dd>The "subconscious ambiguity" argument isn't mine, its ZMs. And this whole list thing above has been created to prop up ZMs strawman. What strawman argument you ask? That I have ever said that "conspiracy theory" has "only" one meaning. I have never said that, so I am confused about ZMs point here, apart from clogging up this talkpage. Here is an interesting diff <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:AIDS_conspiracy_theories&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=20175163" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:AIDS_conspiracy_theories&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=20175163" rel="nofollow">Anyway, its the primary meaning of "conspiracy theory" that we are dealing with and its not being used in a prejorative context (consciously).

<dd>Your labeling my argument a "strawman" is a slightly better attempt at mischaracterizing what I am saying. Mrfixter states above "Anyway, its the primary meaning of 'conspiracy theory' that we are dealing with and its not being used in a prejorative context" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:AIDS_conspiracy_theories&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=20175163" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:AIDS_conspiracy_theories&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=20175163" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> so my list is proof the phrase "conspiracy theory" is used in a discrediting sense on wikipedia generally and frequently. The question then becomes how and why is this article somehow magically exempt from the secondary discrediting definition? If "conspiracy theory" is provably discrediting in and of itself generally on Wikipedia talk pages why use the phrase in an <i>encyclopedia</i> at all (especially considing the phrase is ambiguous and confusing additionally)? You will have to justify your uncited, seemingly random allegation designed to attack my argument without any logical basis: "there is no way the secondary definition applies here". That sounds nice, and was likely designed to sound very conclusive, but it actually does not make any sort of logical argument in support of anything (no evidence, no basis). <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 18:38, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I believe your evaluation of what a straw man argument is needs to be reevaluated.

<p>Since other articles whose only connection to this one is the phrase "conspiracy theory" keep being referenced, I suggest that this matter be handled n a comprehensive basis. Maybe a page like <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConspiracy_theory_5aa7.html" title="Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory">Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory</a>. Hey, wait a minute! That's already been done!

<dd>Maybe it's time for a revote. Though, you once again perpetuate the mistaken belief that a denied policy proposal somehow creates an opposite proposal. Where in the counter argument was it explicitly noted that "conspiracy theory" is ok for all time, the vote result was to leave "conspiracy theory" titled articles as a group unchanged, we have done exactly that. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 19:26, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was asked to give an opinion here. Conspiracy theory is a distinct narrative genre recognized by people who work in political research, journalism, and the like, and so I see nothing wrong with the use of the term, so long as it's used descriptively, and not in a purely prescriptive way. To use it descriptively, any examples must fit an agreed definition. I wrote up the definition below for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConspiracy_theory_5aa7.html" title="Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory">Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory</a>, which Chip Berlet (who's very knowledgeable in this area) agreed with, so it might be helpful here — not in the article, but as a rule-of-thumb on how to distinguish a conspiracy theory from an alternative theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term "conspiracy theory" is used as a description of a particular type of <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narrative.html" title="Narrative">narrative</a>. A conspiracy theory explains a set of circumstances with reference to a secret <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plot.html" title="Plot">plot</a>, usually by powerful conspirators. One of the distinguishing features of a conspiracy theory is that it tends not to be <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falsifiable.html" title="Falsifiable">falsifiable</a> in the minds of believers. For example, if the claim is made that 4,000 <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli.html" title="Israeli">Israelis</a> were warned not to go to work in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Center_57c9.html" title="World Trade Center">World Trade Center</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">9/11</a>, and if it's later established that only 10 Israelis were, in fact, ever employed there, the conspiracy theory evolves to include the claim that the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossad.html" title="Mossad">Mossad</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_government_6d14.html" title="United States government">United States government</a> have conspired to alter the records, and that the names of 3,990 Israeli employees have been made to disappear. That is, the conspiracy theory represents a <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closed_system.html" title="Closed system">closed system</a> and is not amenable to the standard rules of <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence.html" title="Evidence">evidence</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This evolutionary growth in the face of evidence disproving the theory is one of the characteristics that distinguishes a conspiracy theory from a matter of simple controversy, an unresolved issue, or an alternative theory. A conspiracy theory is a matter of <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideology</a>. The difference between an alternative theory and a conspiracy theory is <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemological</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Conspiracy_theory&amp;action=edit" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Conspiracy_theory&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">[22]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key features are that a conspiracy theory "represents a <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closed_system.html" title="Closed system">closed system</a> and is not amenable to the standard rules of <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence.html" title="Evidence">evidence</a>"; that it's a "matter of <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideology</a>" and that "the difference between an alternative theory and a conspiracy theory is <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemological</a>."</p>
<p>Looking at the examples on the page, I'd say the view that HIV does not cause AIDS is not a conspiracy theory; don't know about Hooper; William C. Douglas doesn't sound like one; and Hulda Clark is borderline, depending on how much she claims powerful people are trying to stop her. I'd say all the others are examples of conspiracy theories. You might want to ask Chip for his opinion.</p>
<p>Some editors have suggested having sections for different types of theory, including those that are definitely conspiracy theories. That sounds like a good idea to me. I hope this helps a little. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:18, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Slim, you are just repeating the same misdirecting argument in favor of "conspiracy theory" as you did before in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConspiracy_theory_5aa7.html" title="Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory">Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory</a>. In email to me you claimed your position had changed somewhat, but that doesn't seem to be the case. If an allegation or theory truly is not "amenable to the standard rules of evidence" then it should be deleted from wikipedia or neutrally caveatted as being uncited/dubious rather than left in an article to errantly be presented with the improperly discrediting phrase "conspiracy theory". To put it simply, if a theory or allegation is that dubious and/or uncited we should label it with "dubious" or "uncited" <b>and</b> note exactly who is counter-claiming the theory is dubious. For example, I would support historically accurate references to the phrase as in: "The science organization X publically stated that theory Y is a 'conspiracy theory'" but we should never use the phrase to describe something directly ourselves (though the insightful question then becomes would a true science organization ever resort to language such as "conspiracy theory"?). Wikipedia already has rules for dealing with uncited and/or dubious allegations, let's follow those rules rather than use "conspiracy theory". Wikipedia also requires neutral language, especially when describing or presenting information, allegations, and theories. Conclusions are inferred from neutrally presented facts, not assumed from improper language. It is irrelevant whether "conspiracy theory" is a type of "narrative" or a "genre" or an "ideology", the point is the phrase is additionally non neutral. You say "so long as it's used descriptively" but that misses the point as the phrase has more than one use, it is not just generically descriptive, it also discredits and is prematurely and improperly conclusive. If "conspiracy theory" meant only what you claim it does above then the phrase would be ok to use, but the lack of neutrality problem exists precisely because of all the other negative connotation secondary definitions that you don't mention. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 14:14, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ZM, you are just repeating the same misdirecting argument in opposition to "conspiracy theory" as you have done ad nauseum, at great length and on a great many pages. Using the term conspiracy theory to describe a conspiracy theory is fine because that is what they are. That the term has more than one use is maddening, but that is the english language for you. Once someone reads the article which has the term "conspiracy theory" in it, there can be no serious confusion. A tiny minority view should not hold this article hostage forever. --<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrfixter_3580.html" title="User:Mrfixter">Mrfixter</a> 19:01, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm Mrfixter, your statement "using the term conspiracy theory to describe a conspiracy theory is fine" is circular logic. You also have to actually explain how my argument is "misdirecting" rather than just regurgitate my interpretation/summary of Slim's argument. The point is there are better ways of describing "conspiracy theories" since I've proved the phrase has more than one literal meaning and because not all theories of people literally conspiring are necessarily dubious. The phrase being literally true under its first definition is not enough to avoid a lack of presentation neutrality otherwise. I make no claims that any specific "conspiracy theories" aren't dubious, I just know we (an encyclopedia especially) are required to use straightforward neutral language <b>and</b> precisely note who is claiming or concluding what. We need to disassociate description of a subject from implied conclusivity at a language level. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 21:16, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The using the term "conspiracy theory" to describe a conspiracy theory is neutral, straightforward and widely used and understood because that is what it is. Do you think conspiracy theories don't exist or that conspiracy theories should be referred to as not conspiracy theories? I think they do exist and should be honestly referred to as such, this being an encyclopedia an all. --<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrfixter_3580.html" title="User:Mrfixter">Mrfixter</a> 23:53, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whether they exist or not as some sort of "narrative" is irrelvant to the fact that "conspiracy theory" is not the most fair or accurate way of describing them. If something is conclusively dubious to the point of being worthy of the discrediting phrase "conspiracy theory" we still have to describe the issue neutrally and present things fairly, then conclusions are inferred (its a multi-step process that "conspiracy theory" violates). We also have to state explicitly who is concluding or counter-claiming what, that is why I am ok with usages of the form: "The scientific organization X claims Y is a 'conspiracy theory'". But an encyclopedia is generally required to use neutral language when it describes things directly, rather than perpetuate language confusion. You (and others) seem like some sort of bot designed to debate illogically to perpetuate an entrenched POV. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 01:18, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Using the term "conspiracy theory" to describe a conspiracy theory does not violate NPOV because it is describing a conspiracy theory.

"Conspiracy theory" is obviously wrong given it's secondary definition and considering better and neutral straightforward ways of describing the same thing also exist.

<dd>Let's keep the personal attacks out of this. The primary definition is the definition that I am talking about. Its maddening that "conspiracy theory" has a complex meaning, but thats the english language for you. "Conspiracy theory" is easily the best term to describe a conspiracy theory. "Conspiracy theory" is obviously right given its primary definition. Why do you insist on trying to deny WP the use of a term that is widely understood, is neutral and straightforward? Do you think that there is no such thing as a "conspiracy theory"?</dd>

You seem to believe that because "conspiracy theory" can be used in a disparaging way, that negates its use and its primary meaning. There are many words and phrases like that on the WP, but that is the fault of the english language not of NPOV or WP. --<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrfixter_3580.html" title="User:Mrfixter">Mrfixter</a> 15:47, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That wasn't a personal attack, it was a test of my theory. The term "conspiracy theory" is actually widely misunderstood. "obviously right" under a first definition is not enough, an encyclopedia should use non duplicitious language and fortunately in almost every case better descriptive and neutral language has already been suggested by someone. Wikipedia is under no obligation to accept and use directly any presumption inducing language merely because it exists in the english language. What do you have against neutral/better alternatives to the phrase "conspiracy theory"? As a side note to your operator(s)/designers: it's completely unclear what your motivation and your logical basis for disagreeing is, it should be apparent and arguably consistent. It seems like you are debating just for the sake of it without any motivation other than to use/try every misdirecting trick in the debate book. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 16:33, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The issues are still unresolved, neutrality violations exist, provably non neutral language is being used. Feel free to disagree (as always) but don't mischaracterize or try to portray the issue inaccurately. What happened to the plan to retitle this article but put some of the theories in a "conspiracy theory" titled sub section? If one of you bots had gone ahead and made the changes I might not have considered this entire debate to be worthless except for the purposes of bot testing practice and to make sure third parties aren't tricked by your arguments. Though, given the existence of <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">AIDS reappraisal</a> this article should be merged to it and deleted. It's also very interesting to note that not one of the editors defending "conspiracy theory" here on this page or was involved in the dispute notice edit war a few days ago has ever edited the <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">AIDS reappraisal</a> article, if your POV was consistent you'd have a problem with that article. You do not seem to care about making sure certain AIDS allegations are discredited you only seem to care about defending the propaganda usefulness of the phrase "conspiracy theory" on a language level. Why try so hard to defend "conspiracy theory" here when mostly the same content is neutrally presented elsewhere? Separately, how would the POV gang vote if I nominated this article for VfD (merge to <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">AIDS reappraisal</a>)? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 21:51, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As if you don't know, I will play along though, it means: the way the phrase "conspiracy theory" can be used to discredit and taint anything that happens to be a theory of people literally conspiring. Theories and allegations can be presented and thought of in a myriad of different ways, it's intriguing that "conspiracy theory" is used so often and so exclusively considering it is an exponentially discrediting method of presentation. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 15:39, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know, I only consider it highly probable and plausible that only those who would want to hide something about a subject would resort to using the insidiously duplicitous and discrediting phrase "conspiracy theory", the phrase seems engineered for exactly that purpose. A real scientist or someone genuinely interested in scientifically or logically disproving a theory or allegation would never use it (I'd like to think so at least). As I've said many times before any debunking or conclusiveness should be based on facts not on tricky language used in a subject's presentation. With politics in mind look at the list of articles that use it over on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConspiracy_theory_5aa7.html" title="Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory">Wikipedia:Conspiracy theory</a> and look at how it is used unevenly to discourage an untainted analysis of some subjects but not others just within wikipedia talk pages alone (see list above). The phrase is perhaps a master key that unlocks many things. though that isn't to say all or even 50% of "conspiracy theories" are necessarily true. The first step is to realize the exponential degree to which the phrase is non neutral, various plausible political motivation theories for its existence and use come from that as a starting point. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 01:51, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's pretty clear that as long as the article contains the word "conspiracy" anywhere in it, (even if the actual phrase "conspiracy theory" is banished in favour of perfectly factual descriptions such as "theories which allege a conspiracy"), ZM's not going to be happy. (See his response to my question above: <i>would you be OK if we labelled the sections, e.g., "theories which allege a conspiracy related to the cause and spread of AIDS"?</i>)</p>
<p>Since i) a number of the theories described here <i>are</i> allegations of conspiracies, and therefore ii) any number of editors will (rightly) protest if they are not described as "theories which allege a conspiracy", we can therefore conclude that making ZM happy is impossible (at least without ignoring a whole flock of other editors). We should therefore try to reach agreement among the rest of us, and give up on trying to please ZM.</p>
<p>Moving on, therefore, I will repeat my previous position that the article includes descriptions of a number of theories which either i) do not involve conspiracies (and hence the title "AIDS conspiracy theories" is inappropriate), or ii) are not about the origin of AIDS (and therefore the proposed titles "AIDS origin theories" and "AIDS creation theories" also aren't applicable).</p>
<p>The article, as it stands, seems to be a dumping ground for various unaccepted theories about different aspects of the whole AIDS situation (of varying degrees of unliklihood and breadth of following). Given this, it seems to me that we can either i) change the title to accurately reflect what <i>is</i> in the article (and perhaps apply some sorting and subheaders, as I have previously suggested), or ii) remove all material that does not match the description implied by the title, and move it to new articles.</p>
<p>I really don't care which, but I do think we ought to do one or the other. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 21:44, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

We just need to be careful and ascribe any POV claims to the appropriate source so that it doesn't appear that the Wikipedia is making said claims. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 22:20, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually I support this plan. As long as it's clear that "conspiracy theory" is not a conclusive determination and not used to describe a subject but is presented as a counter allegation against a non mainstream theory then I don't see a problem. Though I think the phrase "person X accuses theory Y of being dubious" or "theory Y is considered non mainstream" is exponentially more clear and informative on multiple levels than if we stated "person X accuses theory Y of being a conspiracy theory". If a fair person is truly trying to disprove something they would use facts and a logical argument rather than discrediting and objective analysis discouraging language. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 02:14, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're severely confused.

<dd>Uhhh the book is not proclaiming itself to be a conspiracy theory in the discrediting sense (unless it is disinformation), whether you realize it or not you are focusing on just the phrase meaning a theory of people literally conspiring which brings the discrediting secondary definition baggage along for the ride (subconsciously perhaps). Why label an allegation only generically (and discreditingly) with "conspiracy theory" when it should be described specifically as to exactly what it is: "The Secret AIDS Genocidal Plot"? If something is arguably dubious it would require a caveat, not improper language and presentation. And it is completely reasonable to allege that AIDS was a genocidal plot of some sort given the available information and the hype surrounding the disease and the mysterious deaths of AIDS researchers. Please note that Nobel prize winning scientists are the ones alleging AIDS equals biowarfare theories, you can't get more anti-discredit worthy than that. A corollary to what I wrote above: no scientist or honest person would chose to use "conspiracy theory" to describe their pet subject if they were genuinely interested in proving it. The propaganda phrase "conspiracy theory" was not engineered in a day, it's very convenient (and no coincidence) that any covert operation is a theory of people literally conspiring, makes it even easier to discredit potentially true allegations with nothing more than tricky misdirecting language. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 05:22, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I missed this one on the first pass through: <i>it is completely reasonable to allege that AIDS was a genocidal plot of some sort given the available information</i>. Just out of curiosity, I don't suppose you think that it's "reasonable" to conclude that the great influenza epidemic of 1918, which killed more people than the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Death_ffa3.html" title="Black Death">Black Death</a>, was a "genocidal plot of some sort"?</dd>
<dd>I mean, the notion that it's "reasonable" to conclude that "AIDS was a genocidal plot" needs to overcome such small obstacles as the fact that i) the immune system was so poorly understood when AIDS started (circa 1960) that there is no way such a subtle virus could have been created back then, given the state of the knowledge of the immune system then, ii) before using bio-warfare weapons it's wise to have a vaccine at hand, so your own people don't get taken out by them, but again, even with the knowledge we now have, it's proving almost impossible to create a vaccine, iii) I could go on but what's the point?</dd>
<dd>Alas, in this particular case, I'm afraid that <i>both</i> meanings of "conspiracy theory" are 100% dead on target. And I'm pretty stunned to hear someone label this theory "reasonable". <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 22:28, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Caveats are suppose to add specific clarity, not be generally conclusive and discrediting. What do you have against other better ways of describing a non mainstream or dubious theory?

Also, I'm not certain why in your rebuttal to my suggestion, you repeat that they are conspiracy theories... the two are not mutually exclusive. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 21:11, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dante, I think "non mainstream" sounds better than "fringe" but it's not that big of a deal and yes all descriptive adjectives should be sourced, even "fringe". Though our proposals are likely all moot since the POV gang seems to disagree with us. Jayjg, the fact that the theories literally involve people conspiring is just one aspect of the allegations, why do you and your POV gang repeatedly want to focus on only this fact? Answer: because that method of presentation using "conspiracy theory" is discrediting. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 18:13, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your logic is flawed and I am not giving credence to conspiracy theories, I am saying the phrase is non neutral language and it is improperly biasing (it does not convey who exactly is counter claiming the theory is dubious), and there are better ways of describing the theories, being literally a theory about people conspiring is just one fact among many about the theories. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 00:15, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd support Noel's idea. Change the name of the article to xxx AIDS theories with xxx to be decided: nonmainstream? alternative? and have sections that are neutrally headed: "theories that allege a conspiracy" is a lot less loaded than "conspiracy theories". Jay, in the world outside Wikipedia, consensus basically means everyone walks away happy, not that the majority steamrollers the minority and uses its empowerment on account of being the majority to stifle dissent. That's what makes consensus such a noble aim. It's come to mean "get a big enough majority and you no longer have to listen to minority voices" on Wikipedia but that's not something to be celebrated. A true consensus would bring Zenmaster on board, not seek to coerce him into accepting that his views should necessarily be subordinated to those of the majority. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:22, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tiny minority views should not be allowed to hold articles hostage forever. Not using the term "conspiracy theory" is POV, especially when writing an article that includes conspiracy theories.

<dd>In my experience, real-world consensus almost never means that everyone walks away happy. There's always going to be a certain percentage of people that don't agree with the majority. In the real-world, if 85% of people support X, then the 15% of people who oppose X probably will get steamrolled. On Wikipedia, consensus does not mean "everyone agree". The community is far too large to even attempt to get everyone to agree on anything. From what I'm seen in this particular discussion, Zenmaster hasn't really tried to compromise. He wants the term "conspiracy theory" out of the title (of this and many other articles) even though the majority feel differently. I'm not sure that anything short of removing the term will "bring Zenmaster on board". <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 15:19, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. In fact, Zenmaster not only insists that "conspiracy theory" be removed from the title of the article, but from any sub-section within the article as well. He simply will not allow the phrase anywhere, without slapping a "NPOV" tag on things and insisting that it remain until there is complete "consensus", i.e., the phrase is removed.

<dd>That is an inaccurate interpretation of my position, I support Grace Note's suggestion of using neutral language in sub section titles as in words like "alternative" or "non-mainstream" and perhaps indirect usage such as "person X alleges that theory Y is a 'conspiracy theory'". A core requirement or essense of an encyclopedia is to describe the specific details of each theory or allegation directly and upfront rather than focus on the not even worth mentioning minor point that the theory or allegation involves people conspiring. How does it make sense in the language center of your brain that the minor and unnecessarily generic point that a theory simply involves people conspiring is somehow more notable than the specific details of the allegation itself?? Deeply focus on whether the language used itself is neutral, not on politics. Since wikipedia articles have to cite sources these non-mainstream theories are indeed more accurately called allegations anyway (until true consensus is reached). Also, presenting a <b>cited</b> allegation discreditingly by directly using "conspiracy theory" in a descriptive sense violates wikipedia's assume good faith policy. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 15:48, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jayjg, what do you mean when you say "death by a thousand cuts", that does not make sense in this context. For direct use of "conspiracy theory" to be acceptable you have to prove it is neutral, which will be hard given all the evidence it is not.

<p>ZM seems to argue that there is little point in focusing on the fact that a theory purports a literal conspiring amongst a group when describing said theory. Nevertheless, there does seem (to me at least) to be some descriptive value in noting that a certain theory alleges a conspiracy. If the concern is over the perceived pejorative taint that comes along with the phrase "conspiracy", I would suggest alternative language in an attempt to allay those fears. What about subject headings titled thusly, "Allegations of Clandestine Creation of HIV/AIDS" and "Allegations of Clandestine Dispersion of HIV/AIDS"? This both recognizes that certain theories have common threads (that there is a conspiracy involved in one or more aspects of the AIDS epidemic), avoids the highly charged term in question, <b>and</b> makes it clear that there are at least two different "flavors" of conspiracy theories about AIDS... with regards to creation and dispersion.

<dd>Your recollection is interesting but inaccurate. What 32 people voted for was maintaining the status quo in the sense of defeating an initiative to remove all occurences of the phrase from article titles. This is not the same as saying that it should, perforce, remain in EVERY article title, but rather that it shouldn't be removed from them all <i>en masse</i>. This has been explained to you a number of times and you have yet to address it. I simply do not understand why you CONTINUE to maintain that there is a vote that decided that "conspiracy theory" is "perfectly reasonable, specific, and accurate". Such a vote does not exist, Jayig, your own recollections not withstanding.</dd>

<dd>Also, FYI, 12/32 is 3/8 or 37.5%. Most people familiar with numbers and math do not consider this a "small minority". In fact, it's rather closer to a simple majority than anything like a small minority. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 22:26, August 24, 2005 (UTC)

<p>Note to third parties: this thread completely mischaracterizes the issue of "conspiracy theory". I now consider "Dante Alighieri" to be secretly pro "conspiracy theory" or desgined to mischaracterize the issue. The core issue is whether the phrase, analyzed on a language level, is neutral. Anyone that deflects from a neutrality or language analysis should be banned from Wikipedia as a propgandist (I have an increasingly large list). <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 22:31, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok then, by what rationale do you think the title should be changed?

<dd>From the first paragraph in this thread I quote you, "Nevertheless, there does seem (to me at least) to be some descriptive value in noting that a certain theory alleges a conspiracy". If the phrase is not neutral by what rational would there be descriptive value in noting that a certain theory alleges a conspiracy? Aren't the details of the theory itself exponentially more worthy of being noted? Why is "conspiracy theory" the first noted fact (when used in titles)? "Conspiracy theory" is an overly generic way of describing a theory, an encyclopedia should describe things more specifically and state clearly who is counter alleging that the theory is dubious. The apparent propaganda goal in noting that a theory involves people conspiracing is to taint that theory through guilt or dubiousness by association. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 23:02, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you re-read what I wrote, I did not advocate using the phrase "conspiracy theory". I do think there is some value in noting that a theory advocates a conspiracy though, because there are more than one that do. This is a form of categorization that seems perfectly appropriate to me. I don't think that the taint of the phrase "conspiracy theory" is so far-reaching that it would attach to a subject heading like "Allegations of clandestine creation of HIV/AIDS". The fact that SOME people will still dismiss such a theory out of hand is lamentable but there is also nothing we can do about it. There are some people who are not equipped for critical analysis and therefore seek to think as little as possible. The fact that there are some theories that DO involve an alleged conspiracy is going to make some people consider them rubbish, regardless of how careful we are in our language. Even so, I think that my proposed language is about as neutral as we're going to get. Besides, I even suggested partioning the "conspiracy theory" subject heading (as proposed by others) into TWO different subject headings, because the different theories belong to (in my opinion) two basic families. Those that argue a non-standard origin for AIDS and those that argue a non-standard method of transmission. I suppose there could be theories that fall into both camps... so there's a third family as well. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 23:10, August 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I mean, really, what's the alternative? Not mention anything about conspiracies at ALL? Then what happens when someone comes along and says, "Hey, don't these theories involve some sort of conspiracy"? What do we say? "Yes, but don't mention it because even the mere mention of it could bias certain people who aren't good critical thinkers"? I understand this is an exaggerated example, but my point is that regardless of how we present the information, people who want to find reasons to dismiss a given theory will do so... no matter what. I think we can help by avoiding specific language (such as the phrase "conspiracy theory") that are highly likely to evoke an emotional rather than rational response... but I don't think that denying that there is a common thread to some theories (that there is a conspiracy amongst a certain group of people as to the origin of HIV/AIDS) is going to be helpful, ulitimately. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 23:15, August 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is this descriptive value of "conspiracy theory"? <b>The minor point that a theory alleges a conspiracy is a conclusion and does not belong in the description of that theory.</b> The word "conspiracy" itself is not neutral either as it groups a specific theory with the entire dubious "conspiracy theory" genre (dubiousness induced through association). We should require descriptive words and phrases to have a pristine level of presentation neutrality, especially considering Wikipedia claims to be an encyclopedia. The minor point that a conspiracy is alleged is a conclusion about a theory and does not belong it the theory's description. Why should every article seemingly have to have a check box for whether a conspiracy is alleged? You seem to be arguing in favor of every conspiracy article including the sentence "This theory alleges a conspiracy"? I actually would be ok with that if it is presented as a conclusion outside of titles or section titles and is definitely not used to describe something. Though merely noting that a theory involves a conspiracy is a less subtle method but still implies dubiousness through association with the larger "genre" of "conspiracy theory". Why encourage a generic grouping with conspiracy for a specific theory when that can only subconsciously imply dubiousness (and how would that be neutral)? The entire concept of, and word "conspiracy" may be so tainted, language neutrality wise, to the point where it shouldn't be used anywhere in an encyclopedia (encyclopedias should have higher neutrality of language standards, especially as far as presentation is concerned). There would be more people that would be equipped for critical analysis if they were encouraged to be consciously aware of language. There is/has been a de facto prohibition on the internet against calling someone a nazi in a debate, though it's been my experience that that word is an accurate description for the pervasiveness of language propaganda these days. However, the word nazi is still completely not acceptable for descriptive use in a random article, just like "conspriacy theory". <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 23:40, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have attempted to follow the debate. My opinion is that the term "conspiracy" in the title and the introductory paragrahp for this article is inaccurate, as at least some of the most prominent alternative theories do not (or not necessarily) claim that the virus spreading was intentional. Perhaps it would be better to resort to a more inclusive title like "alternative AIDS origin theories" or "AIDS origin theories". <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichele_Bini_3e69.html" title="User:Michele Bini">Michele Bini</a> 08:27, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Feel free to retitle the article but the pro propaganda POV gang will likely revert. What about the allegations that do allege that someone conspired (a minor point that is hardly noteworthy in the real real world), how can those allegations be presented fairly?

<dd>Alternative AIDS origin theories is fine, so is the already existing AIDS reappraisal, and AIDS biowarfare theories perhaps.

What you call repeating old arguments is really the continued existence of my challenge for someone to explain the lack of neutrality over "conspiracy theory". You can't even make an argument it's neutral. There are 100s of talk page examples of the phrase "conspiracy theory" being used non neutrally, and some of the most non dubious worthy allegations are very suspiciously presented in discrediting fashion on wikipedia with "conspiracy theory", why is that?

<dd>It's very disappointing that a Lord of the Wiki thinks that there is a consensus when 12 editors disagree with a majority view. To my view -- and I recognise it's in itself a minority view, incredible as that seems to me, given what a "consensus" actually is (a general agreement) -- the vote should be taken to indicate that we <i>do not have a consensus</i> on this issue. It's very difficult to achieve a true consensus on some issues, and yes, that means that there will be those who think a vote should be taken and the minority disregarded if they lose it sufficiently. What would be interesting would be for Jay to give a good reason for opposing "Alternative AIDS origin theories"? Jay, by "good reason", I don't mean simply repeat that the other title has a consensus. If you like, we'll take that as read. Just explain why you wouldn't support the alternative title without reference to there having been a vote. Given that not all of these theories even are "conspiracy theories", why do you think your preferred title is better? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 01:14, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You rarely respond to me because you prefer assertion to discussion, Jay, as demonstrated on most of the pages that we meet on. I have read the talkpage, of course, although I admit to my eyes glazing over halfway through some of Zen's longer comments, and I genuinely do not see a coherent description of why you think it is better. I see your argument that "conspiracy theory" is not pejorative and merely describes a theory about people conspiring, which is a bit odd, and certainly contestable ("Colloquially, a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> is any non-mainstream theory about current or historical events, with the connotation that that theory is unfounded, outlandish, or irrational or in some way unworthy of serious consideration." seems reasonable to me.) I see lots of assertions that it is the consensus title, Jay, but I'm asking you to give a good reason not to use the title suggested. I'm not disputing that you have a majority on your side. I'm asking you to discuss why you do not feel that the alternative title suggested is a good idea. "We won the vote" is not an answer to that question.</dd>
<dd>You rarely respond to me, Jay, but whenever you do, this is more often than not your response. You do not actually bother with discussing what you want. You simply argue that you must have your way because you form a majority. Well, Jay, of course you will have it, and if Zenmaster doesn't desist, you'll probably have him banned from this page. But do you truly think that that is the right way to resolve a dispute? Do you not think it would be more satisfactory to give a coherent defence of your position?

<p>Yes Grace, and just because there was a vote against removing the phrase "conspiracy theory" from titles doesn't prove it's neutral, on the contrary the pro side didn't even make that argument (because that would have been obviously wrong). There is overwhelming evidence that the phrase is not neutral but various (already suspicious) users downplay or misframe the issue by simply misinterpreting the old vote or (mis?) framing the issue solely in terms of majority vs minority (ignoring any mention of the lack of neutrality concerns). A random true wikipedia user/admin would care if someone was making an in good faith neutrality complaint and directly agree or disagree with that, rather than invented a silly argument in favor of something that is obviously discrediting. Also, members of the POV gang always seem to show up, usually in pairs, around the same time for maximum bullying effect (the effect being to decrease the chances third parties are made aware of the core issues). Though, I wonder why the pov gang goes to such lengths, I assume it would be much easier to selectively sensor information that it deemed unacceptable, how would anyone know? Perhaps this is a test for a time when communication and integrity is secure and can be assured? I don't see how there can ever be any gaurantee that anyone is anyone on wikipedia or that other people are ever allowed to read what you write. There are likely very few people that are testing/verifying wikipedia for integrity of edits/posts censorship wise. Centralization only makes the data warehouse/propganda masters's job easier.</p>
<p>To return to the issue, there is undisputed evidence that the phrase "conspiracy theory" is not neutral, the best the pro "conspiracy theory" side can argue is that we should note (and for some reason be the most important point that is noted) that an allegation or theory is a part of the "conspiracy" genre, but that argument is designed to ignore the fact that the implied dubiousness through mere association with that "conspiracy" genre is exactly how the phrase's non neutral discrediting works. If something is truly dubious/incorrect it should be discredited with facts that are specific to it, not discredited by association with a generic genre. Only those that want to hide something would use "conspiracy theory", but I digress, hopefully everything turns out ok. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 02:50, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>Duesburg theory - Requires the "AIDS establishment to be conspiring to conceal the "truth" "<i>The non-funding of non-conformists has not changed in the US. I assume it would be fatal for the current AIDS establishment if they were proven wrong, and that is why it will not change soon.</i>" <a href="http://www.duesberg.com/faq.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.duesberg.com/faq.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a></li>
<li>The only one that is possibly <i>not</i> a conspiracy theory. However, it has been almost completely discredited.</li>
<li>Proposes that HIV was engineered at a U.S. military laboratory.</li>
<li>HIV virus was created by Western scientists for biological warfare.</li>
<li>Soviet Union planted disinformation suggesting the CIA or other agencies created AIDS.</li>
<li>HIV is a genetically modified organism developed by U.S. Government scientists; that it was introduced into the population through Hepatitis B experiments performed on gay and bisexual men.</li>
<li>Hepatitis B vaccination experiments of the late 70's caused the AIDS epidemic.</li>
<li>World Health Organization created the AIDS epidemic by administering contaminated smallpox vaccines to people in third world countries.</li>
<li>AIDS was the culmination of biowarfare research conducted by the U.S. Government (and later, by the Soviet government) throughout the 20th century.</li>
<li>AIDS was made in the laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor, New York. The virus was spread by putting the AIDS viruses into the smallpox eradication program by the World Health Organization, and that AIDS did not exist before 1978.</li>
<li>AIDS virus was engineered by such U.S. Government defense contractors as Litton Bionetics for the purposes of bio-warfare and "population control".</li>
<li>Dr. Hulda Clark claims that the medical establishment seeks to suppress her theories and cures.</li>
<li>The U.S. Government has an established history of performing experiments on its own citizens without their knowledge or consent.</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems rather obvious that it's entirely appropriate for this article to be titled "AIDS conspiracy theories". If any change should be made, perhaps #2 should be removed, but there's no evidence that the title should be altered. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 00:07, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Even if something is false or at best dubious why use dismissive language to present it? Shouldn't any debunking or conclusions come from facts presented rather than discrediting and ridiculing language used to present it. In the best case "Conspiracy theory" violates the scientific method. Why risk tainting the presentation of a subject by using abiguous language if you can disprove it with plain simple facts presented neutrally? There is also the possibility people will assume those that use duplicitious language aren't telling the truth, on at least some level. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 00:28, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a minor point that a conspiracy is alleged, you point that out because you want to discredit the allegation through association with the dubious "conspiracy theory" narrative genre. The fact that a theory literally alleges a conspiracy is insufficient evidence that the dubious narrative genre is applicable to it, it is inappropriate to discredit something that way by using confusion over the literal definition of a phrase. You are using the psychologically tricky language of a disinformation artist. Why use what is at best ambiguous language if the allegation can be debunked with facts, do you fear what would happen if the facts were presented fairly on this subject? Why taint any conclusions formed from an unscientific method of presentation?

<dd>Just because a theory literally alleges a conspiracy is insufficient evidence that it is a part of the dubious conspiracy theory narrative genre. But more importantly, it is inappropriate for an encyclopedia to attempt to discredit a cited allegation with nothing but implied dubiousness through association. Instead, we should describe the issue neutrally, present all facts, fairly describe what points are disputed, and cite who is claiming or counter-claiming what. Labeling an argument a "conspiracy theory" is someone's counter POV against an allegation, which can't be cited in an article's title. Carbonite, why do you seemingly intentionally perpetuate literal definition vs abstract issue confusion? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 16:57, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The majority is certainly imposing its will, but that doesn't mean the phrase is neutral. Someone that truly cared about Wikipedia's neutrality policies would not respond to an in good faith criticism of "conspiracy theory" the way you and your buddies have. Why don't you support utilizing the scientific method to present a scientific subject? Why use what is at best ambiguous language if clear and direct alternatives exist? Why try to confuse people by saying a "conspiracy theory" is a theory that literally alleges a conspiracy (conveniently ignoring the secondary completely discrediting and hence non neutral definition)? Only duplicitous people would use and defend duplicitous language. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 17:23, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I like titles to accurately indicate content. But maybe there are good reasons why an accident theory is included in this article. Would anyone care to share these good reasons? (I have spent 5 minutes wading through arguements about consensus looking for this info but so far no luck). <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithBlue_06f3.html" title="User:SmithBlue">SmithBlue</a> 02:42, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I recall, the thinking was that with the Koprowski theory that there was a conspiracy to cover up the accident. That's implicit, but but it seems to fit in the scope of the article. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 03:52, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thanks for your time in replying to my initial question - looks like things get a bit tense around here at times, and I wasnt sure what sort of response I was going to get. So this article is about "Conspiracy theories involving AIDS" - not just "Conspiracy theories about the introduction of AIDS into humans"? <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithBlue_06f3.html" title="User:SmithBlue">SmithBlue</a> 04:39, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually it was one big dust-up a year ago. Otherwise this article has been pretty uncontroversial. The stated criteria for the article is:
<ul>
<li><i>There are a number of theories about AIDS which make claims about the origin and/or nature of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS that differ radically from mainstream beliefs. These theories range from claims that HIV is not the principal cause, to suggestions that AIDS was the inadvertent result of medical experiments, to claims that HIV was deliberately created.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So yes, you could say that his article covers purported conspiracies related to AIDS and is not strictly limited to allegations that the virus was intentionally spread. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 05:37, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can see that there is "conspiracy" claimed by each theory; conspiracy to mislead the public and turn them against their governments, active conspiracy to kill with deliberately produced virus, conspiracy to cover up accidental release of deliberately produced virus, conspiracy to cover up deliberate release to humans of a natural virus, conspiracy to cover up accidental introduction to humans of a natural virus and conspiracy to cover up the "true" nature of AIDS. Sometimes these "conspiracies", however, do not appear to be direct "claims about the origin and/or nature of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS..." but rather claims of conspiracies to coverup hypothesised accidents related to "the origin and/or nature of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS". I guess this point has been raised before but I would appreciate someone sharing the reasoning that includes these coverup conspiracies under the stated criteria; "claims about the origin and/or nature of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS..." <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithBlue_06f3.html" title="User:SmithBlue">SmithBlue</a> 08:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK I think I've answered my own question; Hoopers CHAT OPV theory can be restated as a conspiracy by establishment scientists to cover up the origins of AIDS. If no one objects or does it first I will rewrite Hoopers OPV theory section as such. <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithBlue_06f3.html" title="User:SmithBlue">SmithBlue</a> 15:58, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>With a little more experience on Wikipedia I now see that restating Hoopers theory would amount to [WP:Original research]. I also note that the title of this article is inconsistent with its lead and some content. And given the possible pejorative nature of the title I will now support either a name change or a limiting of content to AIDS theories that explicitly and centrally claim a conspiracy about AIDS. <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithBlue_06f3.html" title="User:SmithBlue">SmithBlue</a> 02:53, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just added material on Mbeki's views. Can you imagine my surprise when on an article, whose discusion page takes about 1 hour to read through, I find <b>no</b> References section? This lack of a References section, and the space devoted on the discusion page to disputes over the title of this article, reinforce my concerns about this article. <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithBlue_06f3.html" title="User:SmithBlue">SmithBlue</a> 01:51, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The name of this article and the lead appear not to be consistent. I propose to rewrite the lead to refer explicitly and solely to conspiracy theories around AIDS.

<dd>No, they should probably all go. Actually, hardly anything in the article meets <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. I think the whole article is probably <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">deletion</a> material; the most notable stuff is already in <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">AIDS reappraisal</a>, and the rest is basically poorly sourced baloney. Occasionally people feel strongly enough about a particular conspiracy theory to add it, but no one's felt strongly enough to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">source things</a>.
