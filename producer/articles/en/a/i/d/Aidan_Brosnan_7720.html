<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/d/Aidan_Brosnan_7720.html" title="Edit section: Aidan's story">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aidan's story</span></h2>
<p>Aidan was first seen in January <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> as a young, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a>, apprentice <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">footballer</a> for '<a href="../../../w/a/l/Walford.html" title="Walford">Walford</a> Town' football team. When <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Fowler_261a.html" title="Arthur Fowler">Arthur Fowler</a> caught sight of his talents he offered to assist him as his coach and keeper and so Aidan went to live with Arthur and his wife <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_Fowler_f5e2.html" title="Pauline Fowler">Pauline</a> at no. 45 <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Square_f1ed.html" title="Albert Square">Albert Square</a>.</p>
<p>Aidan soon caught the eye of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandy_Salter_ab5c.html" title="Mandy Salter">Mandy Salter</a> and it wasn't long before they'd sparked up a relationship, much to the concern of Arthur who was all too aware of Mandy's past misdemeanours. Mandy was an extremely bad influence on Aidan and after persuading him to skip football practice she took him back to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Fowler_7e15.html" title="Mark Fowler">Mark Fowler's</a> (where she was staying) and got him drunk on <a href="../../../t/e/q/Tequila.html" title="Tequila">tequila</a>. Mark interrupted them before Mandy could have her wicked way with Aidan, but whilst on his way home Aidan (still extremely drunk) foolishly decided to climb on top of a parked car only to fall off and severely injure his <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg.html" title="Leg">leg</a>. Aidan was out of action for a while, but his leg did recover. However not long after he was involved in yet another accident during football training. As a result Aidan could never play football again and his promising career was over.</p>
<p>Mandy and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Butcher_eb03.html" title="Ricky Butcher">Ricky Butcher</a> tried to cheer Aidan up by luring him into club-culture, and it wasn't long before they talked him into trying <a href="../../../e/c/s/Ecstasy.html" title="Ecstasy">ecstasy</a>. However, disaster struck one night after Aidan passed out in an ecstasy-induced <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coma.html" title="Coma">coma</a> and was rushed to hospital. He recovered from the incident, but after his parents heard of his escapades they forced him to return to Ireland. Mandy was not willing to give her boyfriend up so easily however, and she followed him home and dragged him back to the square in the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer.html" title="Summer">summer</a> where they quickly became Walford's most hated residents.</p>
<p>Upon returning Mandy and Aidan found themselves with nowhere to live, so they broke into <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Beale_33ff.html" title="Pete Beale">Pete Beale's</a> vacant flat and attempted to claim <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatters_rights.html" title="Squatters rights">squatters rights</a>, which lasted a couple of days before <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grant_Mitchell_%28EastEnders%29_3fef.html" title="Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)">Grant</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Mitchell_2084.html" title="Phil Mitchell">Phil Mitchell</a> physically removed them. Aidan and Mandy were now <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeless.html" title="Homeless">homeless</a> and with nowhere to go they started sleeping on the streets. During the following months they tried every despicable trick in the book to earn themselves some cash including: begging around the square; stealing prescription pads from <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Harold_Legg_bc12.html" title="Dr. Harold Legg">Dr. Legg</a> and selling them on to drug-dealers and stealing food whenever they could. Mandy even turned to clipping (where a girl pretends to be on the game, takes the punters money and does a runner), which ended after she was arrested and Aidan made her promise to stop. They eventually took up residence in a rundown flat at number 5 Albert Square, and even managed to wire it up with electricity by pilfering it from the neighbouring houses. This later caused a massive power cut on the square and the electricity board soon put a stop to their scam. Meanwhile Aidan and Mandy would spend what little money they did manage to earn on <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> and drugs.</p>

Homeless Aidan, taken over by depression, contemplates suicide (Christmas day 1993).</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Towards the end of the year they both found employment at the First til Last grocery store in Bridge Street, but when the job fell through they began to go into decline. Aidan received news from his parents telling him that his grandmother had died, but because they were unable to reach him he only discovered the news on the day of her funeral. Aidan visited Ireland briefly with money his parents had sent him, but upon his return he discovered that <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Cole_%28EastEnders%29_fb13.html" title="Richard Cole (EastEnders)">Richard Cole</a> had started a smear campaign in his absence — wrongly accusing him and Mandy of being behind a series of robberies around the Square. Everyone began to turn against them and Aidan became increasingly ill and <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression.html" title="Depression">depressed</a>. Things worsened when Richard purchased the flat they were squatting in. When they refused to leave Richard broke into their squat and evicted them days before <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>. Aidan received a letter from his parents telling him that he was a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parasite.html" title="Parasite">parasite</a> on humanity and that they were disowning him. After reading this Aidan's depression became so bad that he attempted to commit <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_day.html" title="Christmas day">Christmas day</a>, by nearly jumping off the top of a <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_block.html" title="Tower block">tower block</a>. Mandy managed to stop him just in time, but Aidan had had enough of her and before the end of the year he'd decided to desert Mandy and go back to Ireland to reconcile with his parents. Mandy was devastated to lose Aidan and left Walford early in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Aidan was initially meant to commit suicide on Christmas day 1993, however the powers-that-be at the BBC felt that a suicide on Christmas day would be too depressing, so the scripts were revised and Aidan returned to Ireland instead.</li>
