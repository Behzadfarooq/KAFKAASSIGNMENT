<dd>This was not one of my references, but the source quoted is: "Hutin told the lawmakers that WHO estimates that approximately 2.5% of all HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa are transmitted through unsafe healthcare injections but warned that his research of several "relatively reliable" HIV studies has revealed that medical transmission could actually be three to fifteen times higher than the conservative WHO figure." This gives a range of 7.5% to 37.5%. For comparison the WHO figure is around 12.5% consisting of 10% transmitted through the transfusion of infected blood and blood products plus 2.5% transmitted through unsafe healthcare injections. To demonstate <i>good faith</i>, I will edit the 30% to 20% <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 04:36, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nice try, but that view doesn't sit with the medical mainstream. Try <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14962531&amp;query_hl=1" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14962531&amp;query_hl=1" rel="nofollow">this 2004 Lancet paper</a> (I have the full PDF if anybody's interested and can't get it) by a large group of authors from the WHO and other notable places of expertise on AIDS. They give a thorough bollocking to the methodology of people claiming higher rates of medical transmision in sub-Saharan Africa. They agree that unsafe injection practices should be eliminated, but they still regard it as a relatively minor factor in the spread of AIDS in those countries, and believe that heterosexual transmission is responsible for the vast majority of infections there. Finally, they see no reason to discard the 2.5% estimate based on these new studies.</dd>
<dd>Again, I'm not claiming that the medical mainstream is always right. But to claim that the medical mainstream reckons dirty needles are a big factor in the sub-Saharan epidemic is wrong. As far as your show of good faith, how is altering the fudge factors on your back-of-the-envelope calculations anything other than a tapdance around the fact that your evidence to support your figures is shaky in the extreme?--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 06:17, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Genetic susceptibility</span></h2>
<p>I am quoting this unreferenced section in full, because it is becoming increasingly speculative and lacks any sources for an editor to verify. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 04:24, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>CDC has released findings that genes influence susceptibility to HIV infection and progression to AIDS. HIV enters cells through an interaction with both CD4 and a chemokine receptor of the 7 Tm family. They first reviewed the role of genes in encoding chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CCR2) and chemokines (SDF-1). While CCR5 has multiple variants in its coding region, the deletion of a 32-bp segment results in a nonfunctional receptor, thus preventing HIV entry; two copies of this gene provide strong protection against HIV infection, although the protection is not absolute. This gene is found in up to 20% of Europeans but is rare in Africans and Asians; researchers and scientists believe that the HIV virus had a similar viral shell as the virus which caused the black plague (1347-1350), leading to the decimation of one-third of the European population, possibly explaining why the CCR5-32 receptor gene is more prevalent in Europeans than Africans and Asians. Multiple studies of HIV-infected persons have shown that presence of one copy of this gene delays progression to the condition of AIDS by about 2 years. And it is possible that a person with the CCR5-32 receptor gene will not develop AIDS, although they will still carry the HIV virus.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here is a quick ref pulled from a quick google'd article: <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v382/n6593/abs/382722a0.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v382/n6593/abs/382722a0.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It is also known as the 'delta-32' gene, or 32 base deletion. this gene, if carried in one or both parents, can have a very favorable effect for a person exposed to HIV. This gene produces a unique condition with the CCR5 on macrophages which is used by HIV to enter the cell and infect its DNA. Most people have normal CCR5 growing in the appropriate cells, and HIV takes advantage of that fact. What delta-32 does is cause the body to make abnormal CCR5 in cells that travels more slowly to the outside cell membrane where they normally are. This causes HIV to have trouble infecting particular cells as it would have no CCR5 to attach to, thus arresting the whole process.</dd>
<dd>It is important to note that this genetic resistance (32 base deletion) happens to prohibit the process best in a strain called HIV-1 B, which prefers the sexual route. Thus someone who goes around all willy-nilly without worrying about HIV could run up against another strain, say, one that is more prolific with needle-sharing, and the genes wouldn't mean didly squat. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">(talk)</a> 16:16, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, here's one big problem with the quoted paragraph: "the virus which caused the black plague". Although some scientists have proposed that the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Death_ffa3.html" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> was a viral disease rather than bubonic plague, that's very far from a consensus view. I suspect that whoever wrote that paragraph was summarizing something incompletely understood. <a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob"></a>←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 03:39, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Defining_AIDS" id="Defining_AIDS"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Defining AIDS</span></h2>
<p>We seem to be drifitng back to the idea that AIDS is defined in different ways in different countries. This may be more factually correct, but is opens a <i>can of worms</i> If a group of AIDS patients in Uganda would not be diagnosed with AIDS in Europe or the USA, then are we talking about the same disease? If we put then on a ship to the USA would they be cured? What does it mean to say that millions of Africans have a disease that would not be considered a disease in the USA?</p>
<p>My recollection is that if we count actual reported cases of AIDS then the number of reported cases in Africa is about the same as the USA (around a million people). But while all the USA reported cases were supported by HIV antibody tests, HIV testing of small groups of the reported AIDS cases in Africa revealed that about half were NOT infected with HIV. All this has been extensively discuused and referenced in the develpoment of the Wikipedia AIDS article.</p>
<p>The current position of the AIDS article is to follow the UNAIDS position that about 40 million people are "infected with HIV". This is NOT based on reported or diagnosed cases. UNAIDS clearly set out the basis for their estimates, HIV antibody testing of pregnant women in <i>sentinal hospitals</i>. This firmly places AIDS in the context of HIV infection rather than the older style <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangui_definition.html" title="Bangui definition">Bangui definition</a> I also note that the British Medical establishment has consistently challenged the assumption that pregnant women aquired HIV from sex. Specifically this group of women have a high exposure to both unsafe blood transfusions and unsafe medical injections.</p>
<p>I have no problem adopting the more scientifically rigorous approach advocated by <a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Grcampbell</a>. By stating what is known and the limitiaons of our current knowledge we would move toward a more NPOV approach. But my previous attempts to move in this direction were vigorously opposed by other Wikipedia editors - hence my adoption of the <i>consesus</i> pseudo science <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 02:51, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is no reason explanations of the above-stated limitations of current knowledge can't be explained in the article, and that divergent definitions and diagnostic approaches can't be explained. If a number is an estimate, it is dishonest to report the estimated number as a fact. In so far as immune difficiencies are identified in Africa absent the presence of HIV, however they are classified under various disease taxonomies, the details need to be accurately explained for any article on the topic to be accurate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is no concensus among editors to the contrary, at least not as long as I contribute even the slightest punctuation and thereby qualify as an editor of the article. AIbaco 02:45, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Surrogate markers</span></h2>
<p>I think this article honestly presents the facts in an unbiased way:</p>
<p>"An ideal surrogate marker still does not exist for HIV/AIDS. In fact, after two decades of looking, only two assays, CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and HIV RNA viral load, have been widely adopted as imperfect surrogates for monitoring and predicting the course of disease in people with HIV. These markers have been fairly well correlated with the natural history of HIV infection and progression to AIDS, but each has limitations." <a href="http://www.thebody.com/gmhc/issues/may02/illuminations.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thebody.com/gmhc/issues/may02/illuminations.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>A more recent article, July 2005, is suprisingly frank about the fact that "we honestly don't know when and how to best treat HIV infection." <a href="http://www.thebody.com/Forums/AIDS/Meds/Current/Q166770.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thebody.com/Forums/AIDS/Meds/Current/Q166770.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

If the article cites those groups as the authors of the findings explained in the article, there is little room for controversy. There is little debate about whether WHO and NIH concluded certian things, and whatever debate has arisen about the content of their findings can also be reported encylopedically, without relying on loaded POV language such as "denialist" and "propaganda". I'm attempting to merge the better lead of July 28 with the meaningul edits that were contributed since then, as well as improving attribution at the top so as to avoid controversy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What is AIDS?</span></h2>
<p>The fact is that in the USA, since 1993, most AIDS diagnosis have been based on low T cell counts, below 200. These people did NOT have an opportunistic infection and did NOT have an AIDS defining condition. They were <i>healty people</i> with a low T cell count. This was before the era of HAART, so some of these people may be alive and well today without HAART. They may even have T cell counts above 200.</p>

<dd>I reviewed some data, and though many gay men (and others) have exhibited immunodifficiencies absent a positive HIV test, it seems the relevant "half" (42% at the end of 1982?) related to renaming GRIDS was that roughly half of the so-called GRIDS patients were not gay, were not IV drug users and were not transufsion recipients.

The failure of writers in the links above to specify whom they identified as "officials" complicates efforts now to use their work as sources. Many Wikipedia writers seem eager to continue this generalized, non-specific, authoritarian style, but an accurate encyclopedia will discover and report who so named the "new disease".

<dd>For surveillance purposes, the CDC does not define AIDS as HIV disease, but instead characterizes it by symptomology, as is expressed in the current lead, which essentially the July 28 lead Raul643 reverted to. "For the limited purposes of epidemiologic surveillance, CDC defines a case of AIDS as a reliable diagnosed disease that is at least moderately indicative of an underlying cellular immunodeficiency in a person who has had no known cause of underlying cellular immunodeficiency or any other underlying reduced resistance reported to be associated with that disease."[JAMA 1983; 250:1016]
<dl>
<dd>Since tihs 1983 reference, the CDC has progressively developed the AIDS definition. For example it now requires evidence of HIV infection! But thank you for this blast from the past.

<dd>I don't know why Sci guy didn't just answer your question, but that link does contain the answer: "ABC" (Abstinence, Be faithful, and Condoms) is a slogan invented in Botswana, and subsequently adopted by public health authorities in Uganda and elsewhere in Africa. It's gotten more public attention in the U.S. than in Britain because the Bush administration has expressed a desire to only support AIDS-prevention programs that place abstinence first, and has mentioned "ABC" several times when pointing to Uganda as an example. <a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob"></a>←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 04:35, August 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry to be harsh, but: if you hear something on TV, but you don't understand it well enough to <i>explain</i> it beyond "I believe it's true", then don't add it to the article. After nearly three decades of AIDS research, increasingly focused on molecular biology, why would anyone think that epidemiological history is anywhere near the most important thing to look at? There's probably more agreement on the modes of transmission, and the ways AIDS has spread through different populations, than on anything else; long before anyone knew anything about HIV, it was clear that it was a blood-borne disease that would spread more or less the same as hepatitis B, which is why the delay in screening blood transfusions was so inexcusable. And the prevailing theory of the disease's travels has it coming out of Africa not once, but many times - so any reference to "patient zero" is meaningless unless you choose to focus on the U.S., Europe, Asia, or wherever. Not to mention that when you say "patient zero" in the context of AIDS with no further explanation, absolutely everyone will think of Gaetan Dugas. <a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob"></a>←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 16:20, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blood transfusions as a treatment for AIDS?</span></h2>
<p>I have a question - In conjuction with typical treatments that knock down the viral load, why have researchers not experimented with some kind of T-cell transplantation? (e.g., through blood or blood serum transfusions). Hemophiliacs in dire situations can go through mass-transfusions where their blood volume is relaced 2 or 3 times in the span of a few hours. Would it not be possible to do something similiar with an AIDS patient? Could this not considerably restore a low T-cell count and lower the viral load? <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 06:37, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It also has it's grips on the lymphatic system and the brain (as it crosses the blood/brain barrier). Once lots of the latent infected cells have been activated, it can act/spread quite fast.

<dd><b>Most</b> of the HIV load in the body exists as DNA inserted into the chromosomes of resting CD4+ lymphocytes. Viral load is measured in the blood because blood is easily accessible, but it's a bit like measuring the capacity of a bathtub by measuring the spillage when you step into it. The average virion "lives" less than one day, and the average replication cycle is about three days. You're not going to do any good by an exchange transfusion, and if your goal is reducing viral load, medication already does this more effectively, throughout the body rather than simply in the blood, and with considerably less mess. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 00:56, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
