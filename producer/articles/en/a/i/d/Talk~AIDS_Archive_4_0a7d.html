The new image is clearer and provides a better description of the anatomy of the HIV viron.

<p>I have removed. "During situations where treatments are available many people are able to delay death between ten to twenty years after the development of AIDS." becuase there is no factual basis for this claim. Show me the reference to a ten year survival for antiretrovirals . if you want to make this claim.</p>
<p>Also I have added. "In a process still imperfectly understood, HIV infects the CD4 cells (also called T4 or T-helper cells) of the immune system" This is the current 2005 "scientific consesus". Fauci of NIH from memory.</p>
<p>I have a problem with "AIDS typically develops about ten years following HIV infection." I think ten years is probably the 50% survival - so half develop AIDS within 10 tears and after 10 years half have not developed AIDS. Calling a mid point of a range "typical" seems misleading as in fact very few people wil actually develop AIDS in years 10</p>
<p>Also "proper administration" of antiretroviral medicatiom, seems unnecesarily contentious. Is there evidence of improper adminstration - is it itended to suggest that all or some doctors are imcompetent?</p>

When a person's CD4+ <a href="../../../t/_/c/T_cell.html" title="T cell">T cell</a> count decreases sufficiently he or she is prone to a range of diseases that a healthy person's body is normally able to fight. These diseases include cancers and <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opportunistic_infections.html" title="Opportunistic infections">opportunistic infections</a>, which are usually the cause of death in persons with AIDS.

</dl>
<p>How is this relevant to <b>Symptoms of AIDS</b>?</p>
<p>The whole issue is that the first symptom of AIDS is usually an <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_defining_illness_090e.html" title="AIDS defining illness">AIDS defining illness</a>. Two thirds of reported AIDS in the United States is on the basis of low CD4 cell count - these cases are all <b>asymptomatic</b></p>

<dl>
<dd>I'm uncertain on how well-supported the evidence is on this point, but in general I think you're seeing a contradiction where none needs to exist. Even if the risk of transmission is reduced by treatment, it doesn't mean that you still wouldn't advise the use of condoms to reduce the risk further. So unless the evidence for this reduced transmission is marginal <i>in and of itself</i>, I think the appropriate action would be to reinstate the sentence and note that this doesn't make it wise for HIV-positive people to have unprotected sex. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 07:43, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC) (no relation)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you that we cannot determine from the linked newspaper article how well-supported the evidence is on this point. But the treatment guidelines have changed so much since 1997 that this research is largly irrelevant. The <i>hit hard, hit early</i> glory days are gone, because the <i>scientific consenus</i> has accepted the many studies showing unnacceptably high drug toxicity.

<dd>Hmmm. For one thing, the study <i>began</i> in 1997; given that it was published in 2004 I would suggest that the data would go to at least 2002. Seconldy, the latest source Sci Guy <a href="http://hab.hrsa.gov/tools/HIVpocketguide05/PktGARTtables.htm" class="external text" title="http://hab.hrsa.gov/tools/HIVpocketguide05/PktGARTtables.htm" rel="nofollow">has dragged up</a> suggests that treatment with low viral loads and high CD4+ counts is recommended against, but it says that for people with high viral loads that whether to offer treatment is controversial, particularly when the CD4+ counts are above 350/mm3. So , on the basis of that link (and it appears to be current and from a relevant, reputable source) the science isn't settled on exactly when to start treatment, and there seems to be some consideration for treatment purely to reduce viral loads. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 07:13, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is correct, Robert. Treatment purely to reduce viral loads in people who have not been diagnosed with AIDS is now considered <b>controversial</b> in the United States. This is a big change in direction since the 1997 treatment guidelines. I am happy to read your Taiwanese research if you have a reference.

<dd>I think you're reading more into the description of "controversial" than you should. I suspect "controversial" in this context means that the evidence that treatment is beneficial is unclear, and therefore some substantial group of clinicians think it's worthwhile and others don't. The jury is still out. Have a look at some of the criteria on which the decision to treat might be based, though; it includes likelihood of compliance with treatment. I suspect there might be more to it than drug toxicity; treatment, particularly imperfectly-applied treatment, might promote drug resistance and reduce treatment options later. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 23:53, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Controversial" is a highly charged word. We should simply report facts. The optimum time to begin therapy remains an unresolved issue. It is recognized that therapy should begin before there is an irreversible deterioration of the immune system, and recommendations have varied: in 1987, treatment was delayed until patients had developed clinical AIDS; in 1996, the "hit-early-hit-hard" premise prevailed, and patients were treated when their CD4 count was &lt;500/cmL. The current recommendations call for an intermediate approach: patients with CD4 counts &lt; 200 should be treated, patients with CD4 counts &gt; 350 who are asymptomatic should not be, and the decision on when to initiate treatment for patients with CD4 counts between 200 and 350 is based on rate of CD4+ cell count decline, HIV load (&gt;100,000 copies is the number for concern), pregnancy, and patient interest in, concern about, and individual risk of drug toxicity. The decision about when to start therapy is a balancing act between factors favoring deferring therapy, such as a better quality of life and less risk of developing resistance, and the main factor favoring initiation of therapy, which is avoidance of deterioration of the immune system to the point that it cannot be rescued with antiretroviral therapy. There are data that support earlier initiation of therapy than the recommendations above advise, such as the Wang study, which showed a higher mortality for people who were started on HAART later, and other evidence that will be factored into future recommendations. There will no doubt be modifications from time to time in the recommendations based on studies of measures of viral replication and immunological function, the availability of clinically useful resistence studies, and with increased convenience and lower toxicity of available therapies. Similarly, the recommendations for initial therapy for HIV have evolved over time, with the current regimens being a choice of a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor plus two NRTIs, or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor plus two NRTIs. Previously recommended regimens, such as 4-drug regimens, 3-NRTI regimens, and single-drug regimens, are no longer considered optimal. -<a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:01, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Panel reaffirms the desirability of initiating therapy before the CD4 cell count falls below 200 cells/mm3. In addition, there are inconsistent data documenting added value in treating before the count falls below 350 cell/mm3, but some clinicians opt to consider treatment in patients with CD4 count &gt;350 cell/mm3 and HIV-RNA &gt;100,000 copies/mL.

<dd>Going back to the original point, there's not much directly on this in the guidelines but they do say the following, in regards to reasons for commencing therapy: "Potential Risks of Deferred Therapy include:...the increased risk for HIV transmission to others during a longer untreated period.". So these guys seem to think that antivirals can reduce the risk of HIV transmission, and that's a relevant factor for considering when to commence treatment. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 04:04, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Alternative theories</span></h2>

<p><i>Main article: <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">AIDS reappraisal</a></i></p>
<p>A few scientists and AIDS activists continue to question the connection between HIV and AIDS, the very existence of HIV, or of an independent AIDS disease. The validity of current testing methods is also questioned. Dissident scientists report that they are usually not invited to attend AIDS conferences and are not granted research funding from most mainstream sources. Prominent members of this group are virus researcher <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Duesberg_a1b6.html" title="Peter Duesberg">Peter Duesberg</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Prize_c061.html" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> laureate <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kary_Mullis_c230.html" title="Kary Mullis">Kary Mullis</a>. These theories have been in the field for at least 15 years, and have found little support beyond the original circle of advocates.

As this is the habitat of the common chimpanzee genetic comparisons of HIV and SIV were done by the team at University of Alabama. 1999 is the date of publication not when the research was done. The researchers have wisely avoid speculation about how the transfer from chimpanzee to human occured. Weiss, a leading expert in AIDS, suggests the butchering of chimpazees for meat is a possiblity. Beliefs about prostitutes are unsupported by evidence. The polio vaccine theory has also been investigated and discarded. An encyclopedia is not a repository of every discredited belief, blind alley or red herring. Stick to the facts than can be referenced.</p>

There is ongoing research into developing a <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_vaccine_d25e.html" title="HIV vaccine">vaccine for HIV</a> and in developing new anti-retroviral drugs. Human trials are currently underway. Research to improve current treatments includes simplifying current drug regimens to improve adherence and in decreasing side effects.</p>

<p>Ever since AIDS entered the public consciousness, various forms of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative medicine</a> have been used to treat its symptoms. In the first decade of the epidemic when no useful conventional treatment was available, a large number of PWAs experimented with <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_medicine.html" title="Alternative medicine">alternative therapies</a> of various kinds, including massage, herbal and flower remedies and <a href="../../../a/c/u/Acupuncture.html" title="Acupuncture">acupuncture</a>, to either combat the virus or to relieve related symptoms. None of these were shown to have any genuine or long-term effect on the virus in controlled trials, but they may have had other quality of life-enhancing effects on individual users. Interest in these therapies has declined over the past decade as conventional treatments have improved. They are still used by some people with AIDS who do not believe that HIV causes AIDS. Alternative therapies such as massage, acupuncture and herbal medicine are still used by many sufferers in conjunction with other treatments, mainly to treat symptoms such as pain and loss of appetite.

<p>Alternate version: Newer treatments, however, have played a part in delaying the onset of AIDS, on reducing the symptoms, and extending patients' life spans. Over the past decade the success of these anti-retroviral treatments in prolonging, and improving, the quality of life for people with AIDS has improved dramatically.</p>
<p>Current optimal treatment options consist of combinations ("cocktails") of two or more types of anti-retroviral agents such as two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and a protease inhibitor or a non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Patients on such treatments have been known to repeatedly test "undetectable" (that is, negative) for HIV, but discontinuing therapy has thus far caused all such patients' viral loads to promptly increase. There is also concern with such regimens that drug resistance will eventually develop. In recent years the term HAART (highly-active anti-retroviral therapy) has been commonly used to describe this form of treatment. The majority of the world's infected individuals, unfortunately, do not have access to medications and treatments for HIV and AIDS.</p>

<dd>I don't think anything is to be gained by discussing with radical AIDS denialists like Sci Guy and Fred2005. Time and again we have patiently explained things to them and provided sources, yet they still delete any information about benefits of AIDS treatment while adding their bullshit claims such as "AIDS is completely confined to gays and drug users in the US". I'm curious why you cut and pasted the AIDS denialist version of the section here, as opposed to the scientific consensus version. You don't get it, this isn't a legitimate dispute. It's the overwhelming scientific consensus versus a few fringe activists. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 16:36, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This link was in the references. Is it one of the <i>AIDS denialist</i> websites? They seem to be pushing the same line about defering treatment. <a href="http://www.thebody.com/hivmed/hivmed02.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thebody.com/hivmed/hivmed02.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<dd>Doctors still disagree about when is the best time to begin HIV treatment, also called anti-retroviral therapy. You and your doctor will need to determine this together, but there are some respected guidelines. Be aware that these guidelines are regularly updated and are just suggestions based on the most recent research, and are not hard and fast rules.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For example, the U.S. government's Department of Health and Human Services recommends that you begin HIV treatment if you have any serious symptoms, or if your T-cell count falls below 200. When your T-cell count drops below 200, you risk possibly irreversible health problems both before and after you begin treatment</dd>
</dl>
<p>Current Guidelines Recommend</p>
<ul>
<li>If your T-cell count is 350 or above, do not start medications unless your viral load is 55,000 or higher.</li>
<li>If your T-cell count is between 200-349, treatment should be considered.</li>
<li>If your T-cell count is below 200, treatment is indicated.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the U.S. government's Department of Health and Human Services says do not do not start medications, if your T-cell count is 350 or above unless your viral load is 55,000 or higher - then who is advocating early treatment?</p>

<dd>Considering treatment when CD4 count is between 200-350 is the current consensus in the various guidelines. Unfortunately, denialists like you look at any change in medical consensus as conclusive proof that doctors don't know what they're talking about. I have one more bone to pick with your edits: You added the text "Many people believe that newer treatments have played a part in delaying the onset of AIDS, on reducing the symptoms, and extending patients' life spans, although experts describe the data as inconclusive". I see that the word "inconclusive" came from the treatment pocket guidelines. The guidelines merely say that the data is inconclusive about whether to start treatment when CD4+ is above 350. You, however, made a misrepresentation (hopefully not deliberate) and claimed that the pocket reference guide was stating that the overall efficacy of HAART was "inconclusive". Hopefully this misrepresentation will stop, as I've linked to two large studies which show that HAART is effective, and which carry much more weight than a pocket treatment card. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 16:20, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the United States, 75% or reported AIDS cases were attributed to male-to-male sexual contact or injection drug use. These are the two original risk groups identified in 1983, before HIV blood screening was available. This is very different from Africa.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">undetectable</span></h2>
<p>I have a problem with:</p>
<p>"Patients on such treatments have been known to repeatedly test "undetectable" (that is, negative) for HIV, but discontinuing therapy has thus far caused all such patients' viral loads to promptly increase"</p>
<p>Does "have been known" mean that this is an unusual or rare outcome?</p>
<p>I assume the intention is to claim that <i>viral load</i> blood test is undetectable rather suggesting that such treatments mean a person is negative for HIV on the antibody test.</p>
<p>I suggest we need a source reference so we can edit this to avoid misunderstanding Joe Merkel 15:33, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, antibodies persist. Viral load has a lower limit of detection, and the virus may be reactivated if HAART is stopped. There is nothing counterintuitive about this, and may not even need sourcing. Antiretrovirals suppress viral replication, sometimes to the point that the viral load is under the detection limit, but when discontinued the virus comes back. Sure. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 15:40, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Joe, I am sick of people coming in to the treatment section and "nerfing" it with vague phrases like "Many people believe that newer treatments have played a part in delaying the onset of AIDS". Peer-reviewed research and clinical trials should not be described as "many people". Many times over, studies have showed that patients who properly adhere to therapy have much lower viral loads, higher CD4 counts, and longer survival times. I am linking to two of these studies so please cut out the vague rewrites. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12646794" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12646794" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12126821" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12126821" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>Also, please stop mentioning the dangers of antiretroviral therapy before it is even described. HAART is not perfect.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Liver Failure</span></h2>
<p>Under paragraph two of "AIDS epidemic," the article currently states, "In the United States, the most common cause of death for people with AIDS is liver failure caused by antiretroviral drugs." I'm very skeptical of this statement--especially considering many people with AIDS in the US are also co-infected with Hepatitis B or C.</p>
<p>The only source I can find for the liver failure mortality claim is a University of Pittsburgh Medical Center press release <a href="http://www.discover.pitt.edu/media/pcc020822/sciEnzymes.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.discover.pitt.edu/media/pcc020822/sciEnzymes.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> highlighting a study by Dr. Amy Justice, presented at 14th International AIDS Conference in Barcelona (2002). She is quoted, saying, "[f]urthermore, the fact that the most common current cause of death among people with HIV is liver failure suggests that liver injury may be a major limiting factor in the effectiveness of current HIV treatment." That quote was then picked up in several news articles and ended up on lots of the "HIV doesn't cause AIDS" websites.</p>
<p>Can anyone verify that liver failure caused by antiretroviral drugs is the most common cause of death for people with AIDS in the US? I tried, and I can't.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_Henderson_841b.html" title="User:Carl Henderson">Carl Henderson</a> 00:14, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's <i>certainly</i> not true that <b>"liver failure caused by antiretroviral drugs"</b> is the leading cause of death in HIV infected people in the U.S. And we have no citation for that assertion. I suspect what's happened is someone has taken a study in which the most common cause of <b>non-AIDS-related</b> death in AIDS patients is liver failure, added their erroneous assumption that this was due to drugs rather than co-infection with hepatitis B or C, and asserted it here as fact. One study showing results capable of such misinterpretation (but in France rather than the U.S.) is <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15561752&amp;query_hl=5" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15561752&amp;query_hl=5" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and another one among women <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12133746&amp;query_hl=5" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12133746&amp;query_hl=5" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In all such studies, liver failure remains one of the more common types of <b>non-AIDS-related</b> deaths, but non-AIDS-related deaths are dwarfed by AIDS-related causes. A possible explanation of the high incidence of renal and hepatic failure is suggested <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11874639&amp;query_hl=1" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11874639&amp;query_hl=1" rel="nofollow">here</a> to be a rising proportion of drug addict in the population.

<dd>ABSTRACT: We conducted a retrospective chart review of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected patients who died in 1995 and in 1999–2000. We found an increase in the proportion of patients who died from an illness that was not related to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although there was a decrease in the prevalence of AIDS-defining illnesses, &gt;85% of patients died with CD4 counts of &lt;200 cells/μL. The leading cause of death was Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Nonadherence to therapy and new diagnosis of HIV infection were the leading reasons why patients were not receiving antiretroviral therapy. The leading causes of non–AIDS-related deaths in 1999–2000 were non–AIDS-defining infections and end-stage liver disease. At our hospital, PCP remains an important cause of death in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, possibly because &gt;50% of HIV-infected patients who died were not receiving HAART. AIDS-defining illnesses continue to be a major cause of mortality in the HAART era in populations where access to care and adherence to HAART is limited.</dd>

<dd>ABSTRACT: Background-In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) mortality has decreased substantially among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people with access to HAART, but there are concerns regarding co-morbidities and adverse effects of HAART, which may impair vital prognosis. The Mortality 2000 study examined the causes of death in HIV-infected adults at a national level in France in the year 2000. Methods-All French hospital wards known to be involved in the management of HIV infection were asked to notify prospectively the deaths that occurred in 2000 among HIV-infected adults. The causes of death were documented using a standardized questionnaire. Results-The 185 participating wards notified 964 deaths. The main underlying causes of death were AIDS-related (47%, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: 23%), viral hepatitis (11%, hepatitis C: 9%, hepatitis B: 2%), cancer not related to AIDS or hepatitis (11%), cardiovascular disease (7%), bacterial infections (6%), suicide (4%), and adverse effect of antiretroviral treatments (1%). Among AIDS-related deaths, HIV infection had been diagnosed recently in 20%. Smoking was recorded in 72% of cancer-related deaths and alcohol consumption in 54% of hepatitis-related deaths. Among non-HIV related deaths between 25 and 64 years, the proportion of infectious diseases (including HCV and HBV-related deaths) was higher in HIV-infected adults than in the general population. Conclusions-Improved strategies for detecting HIV infection before AIDS-defining complications occur are needed in the era of HAART. The prevention of non-AIDS related cancers, especially lung cancer, the management of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and of viral hepatitis are also important priorities.</dd>

<dd>ABSTRACT: To analyse the causes of death among HIV-infected adults in France in the year 2000. METHODS: Based on data from a national survey, our study describes and analyses the causes and characteristics of patients with immunological and virological response (CD4&gt;200/mm3, ARN-HIV&lt;500 copies/mL), who died during antiretroviral treatment. RESULTS: Among a total of 964 deaths registered, data on 864 cases were available for analysis. One hundred forty-nine patients (17%)were immunovirological responders. The underlying causes of death were non AIDS-defining malignancies for 36 (24%), mainly due to lung cancer (16 cases), hepatocarcinoma (7) and ano-rectal carcinoma (3), AIDS for 22 (15%), mainly due to Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (10 cases) and uterine cancer (3), cardiovascular diseases for 22 (15%), post hepatitis C hepatic failure for 16 (11%), suicide for 16 (11%), and bacterial infections for 14(9%). When comparing characteristics of death in the 149 responders versus the 715 other patients, the responders were significantly more frequently: co-infected by HCV+ (45 vs. 33%), injected drug addicts (40 vs. 27%),alcoholics (38 vs. 28 %), and dyslipidemics (19 vs. 11%). In 2000,around 20% of registered deaths of HIV patients in France had occurred among good immunovirological responders. CONCLUSION: To further reduce mortality among such efficiently treated patients, attention must be focused on treatable conditions such as hepatitis C, dyslipidemia and on the prevention of malignancies such as lung cancer and cervical or ano-rectal carcinoma.</dd>

<dd>ABSTRACT: Highly active antiretroviral therapy has decreased human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–associated mortality; other comorbidities, such as chronic liver disease, are assuming greater importance. We retrospectively examined the causes of death of HIV-seropositive patients at our institution in 1991, 1996, and 1998–1999. In 1998–1999, 11 (50%) of 22 deaths were due to end-stage liver disease, compared with 3 (11.5%) of 26 in 1991 and 5 (13.9%) of 36 in 1996 (P = .003). In 1998–1999, 55% of patients had nondetectable plasma HIV RNA levels and/or CD4 cell counts of &gt;200 cells/mm3 within the year before death. Most of the patients that were tested had detectable antibodies to hepatitis C virus (75% of patients who died in 1991, 57.7% who died in 1996, and 93.8% who died in 1998–1999; P = NS). In 1998–1999, 7 patients (31.8%) discontinued antiretroviral therapy because of hepatotoxicity, compared with 0 in 1991 and 2 (5.6%) in 1996. End-stage liver disease is now the leading cause of death in our hospitalized HIV-seropositive population.</dd>

"AIDS results from an infection of <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a>, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus,

</pre>
<p>is really poor? I mean, the first part says - "HIV results in AIDS" and the second - "It's debatable that HIV results in AIDS". Can't we say something like "AIDS results from an infection of <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a>, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Though the later has been widely credited, some still debate the origin of AIDS." Or maybe even take out "although some debate this." all together from the beginning and add it as a counter-point later in the article. Having it in the intro just makes a weak impression for the everything else. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">(talk)</a> 15:32, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have never had a problem with "HIV causes AIDS". It is the same as "smoking causes lung cancer" or "speeding causes road accidents". The October 2004 version from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A positive HIV test result means that you are infected with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). Being infected with HIV does not mean that you have AIDS right now. However, if left untreated, HIV infection damages a person’s immune system and can progress to AIDS. <a href="http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/other/cbrochure/english/CBrochure_en.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/other/cbrochure/english/CBrochure_en.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I was surprised by the "can" in "HIV infection damages a person’s immune system and can progress to AIDS". But the issue is not what you or believe, we are editors searching for facts that can be verified. So I agree with you that "although some debate this." is really poor. Who debates this? On what basis? When?

<p>Alright guys, don't be scared, but I printed this thing out and started using a red pen.

I am doing it in sections so that people can see the changes more easily.</p>
<p>I've gotten about halfway through the article with the red pen, and will finish and add the last half after i change the first half on here.

<dd>Of course I agree with you, it is devastating. But it's POV for the article to use such words, even if most people would agree with them. The word doesn't enhance the sentence at all, it's just an appeal to emotion.

<dd>About removing uncited parts. I agree that many parts of this article need citations. I don't know if the proper response is to simply remove them. Assuming that most of the contributions were made in good faith, I think it might be better to leave them in the article for the time being, and make a list of these claims which need to be cited. Then we can simply check things off the list once they are verified. Whether we leave them in the article or remove them, I think we need a list of uncited claims. People tend to forget about text once it's removed from an article, so we should keep track of these claims with the intention of replacing them. Would you be interested in helping to make this list? <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 18:34, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>if you leave uncited parts until they are verified it can only cause problems. for instance, "AIDS has been correlated in men between 21 and 31 to higher speeding practices in cars." -- I made that up, it's bullshit. People who spread misinformation about AIDS do dumb stuff like this all the time, and to leave it there would be a disservice to people trying to educate themselves on AIDS everywhere. We shouldn't selectively decide 'which are probably true' and which aren't, so I think the best solution right now is to delete them.</dd>

<dd>Here's another factoid sourced to add to the list. A previous version of the article stated that "Blood tranfusions remain a major source of new HIV infections worldwide. WHO estimated in 2000, between 15% and 20% of new HIV infections worldwide were the result of blood transfusions, where the donors were not screened or inadequately screened for HIV."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not quite accurate. According to a 2000 WHO press release <a href="http://www.who.int/inf-pr-2000/en/pr2000-25.html" class="external text" title="http://www.who.int/inf-pr-2000/en/pr2000-25.html" rel="nofollow">Blood Safety... For Too Few</a>, "between 5% and 10% of HIV infections worldwide are transmitted through the transfusion of infected blood and blood products. WHO/UNAIDS estimate that 5.6 million new HIV infections occur annually." This number is consistant with the WHO <a href="http://www.who.int/bloodsafety/global_database/en/" class="external text" title="http://www.who.int/bloodsafety/global_database/en/" rel="nofollow">Global Database on Blood Safety's Summary Report for 1999-1998</a> which estimates that 43% of the blood supply in developing nations is not screened for HIV or other blood transmissible infections.</dd>

<dd>"Chances of HIV transmission from infected male to female in a single act of genital sex are quite low: it is estimated that under normal conditions, only about 1 in 1000 acts results in infection." and "Transmission of virus from females to males is even less likely, but still possible."</dd>

<dd>Acording to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/figures/r402a1t1.gif" class="external text" title="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/figures/r402a1t1.gif" rel="nofollow">CDC table</a> SciGuy added Friday, these numbers are correct. I'd suggest a rewrite to say something like, "According to the CDC estimates (reference the table here), chances of HIV transmission from infected male to female in a single act of unprotected genital sex are quite low; it is estimated that under normal conditions, only about 10 in 10,000 acts results in infection. Transmission of virus from females to males is only about half as likely--though still possible. Note that these CDC estimates are averages, and actual odds of transmission of HIV via a single sexual act can be affected by other factors, such as the viral load of the infected partner or the presence of abrasions or sores on the genitals of either of the sexual partners." And if this section is rewritten, it should also be made clear that the CDC figures are based on AIDS in America, and that the methods of transmission elsewhere may not show the same pattern.</dd>

The current definition based on HIV antibodies, T cells and AIDS defining illnesses would be better. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 14:12, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For those new to this article, Sci guy was the major proponent of the "Bangui definition" stuff in the first place. Please stop playing games. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 01:43, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, he has changed tactics. Now he simply cuts and pastes selected bits of CDC literature into the article, in an effort to decrease readability I guess. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 02:01, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have heard that Africans are more likely to contract AIDS due to genetic factors and that a minority of those with Scandinavian genes are immune to it. Perhaps we should include something about this? <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.224.198.170.html" title="User:207.224.198.170">207.224.198.170</a> 16:50, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're thinking of the CCR5-Delta32 mutation, which provides some protection against HIV infection and is more common in those of European descent. see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=601373" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=601373" rel="nofollow">the CCR5 page in OMIM</a> or do a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi" rel="nofollow">Medline search</a> on "CCR5-Delta32". - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 05:14, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Drowning in statistics and terminology</span></h2>
<p>I'm assuming that Sci guy's new tactic is simply to drown readers in overwhelming statistics and impenetrable language, such as the new CDC graphic and the large lists of people infected per region and deaths per region. I'm not saying this data shouldn't be in there, but there seems to be an intentional campaign to (a) make it take up as much space as possible and (b) copy complex language directly from medical studies.</p>
<p>For example, we just rewrote the lead section by hand over the past few days. I think the new lead is pretty good. Sci guy replaced the lead section with this text, copied directly from the CDC's MMWR, a publication which is intended for medical professionals:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The etiologic agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome <b>AIDS</b> is a <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retrovirus.html" title="Retrovirus">retrovirus</a> designated human immunodeficiency virus <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a>. The CD4+ T-lymphocyte is the primary target for HIV infection because of the affinity of the virus for the CD4 surface marker. The CD4+ T-lymphocyte coordinates a number of important immunologic functions, and a loss of these functions results in progressive impairment of the immune response."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This text is basically unreadable to a layperson. I'm concerned that now that the legitimate contributors are making an effort to cite sources, Sci guy has shifted tactics towards trying to make the article as unreadable as possible. Sci guy please use your own words. Other people have taken the time to do research and write in language that is comfortable to read. If you are not willing or capable of doing the same, I'd ask that you please stop editing this article. All of your recent edits have been simple cut and paste jobs. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 16:57, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you check the archive, you will find that Sci guy was previously criticized for NOT including the statement "The etiologic agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome <b>AIDS</b> is a <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retrovirus.html" title="Retrovirus">retrovirus</a> designated human immunodeficiency virus <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a>." Now he is being criticized for including it! Is this article intended to contain, current referenced facts - or readable misinformation? For example the lead section now contains the popular misconception that "AIDS is a disease characterized by the destruction of the human immune system." In fact it is only part of the immune system the CD4 T cells that are affected, and this is thought to result in a loss of cell mediated immunity, and therefore vulnerablity to certain specifc diseases and some cancers. The current focus of AIDS is the heterosexaul epidemic in sub Saharan Africa. Fred2005 11:27, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fred, you are quoting out of context. At the time, Rhobite was making the point that Sci Guy was selectively quoting the CDC (and back then, we were making the point that the article was unreadable through his and your efforts). Now, as Rhobite said, Sci Guy has switched gear to swamping the article in medical jargon. As to "destruction of the immune system", that's a good enough approximation for an article introduction. Now, stop wasting our time, please. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 12:34, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
