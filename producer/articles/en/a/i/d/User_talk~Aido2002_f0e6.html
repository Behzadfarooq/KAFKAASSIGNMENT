<p>The WNBC gallery does violate fair use criteria. It says this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The material must contribute significantly to the article (e.g. identify the subject of an article, or specifically illustrate relevant points or sections within the text) and must not serve a purely decorative purpose.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The station logo at the top of the article and the few images of newscaters already illustrates the relevent points of the text. A gallery of images does not illustrate much of a relevent purpose and is purely decorative. If they were intergrated into a history section, about different eras of WNBC, the case for fair use would be stronger, but even then we would only need 2-3 images, not the 11 present in that gallery. Hbdragon88 22:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There isn't a history section. The logos are just put there.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../t/w/i/Image%7ETWiT.jpg_954e.html" title="Image:TWiT.jpg">Image:TWiT.jpg</a></b>. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be a justification explaining why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media meets the criteria at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

1. Your continual, discussion-free defiance of clear Wikipedia consensus and the MoS cannot be interpreted as anything other than a bad-faith act.</p>
<p>2. Regardless of their use in the article, the WNBC logo images were properly deleted, as the accompanying descriptions contained no source information and no fair use rationale. Re-uploading them was entirely inappropriate.</p>

<dd>Re-uploading them was not "entirely inappropriate." AManinBlack deleted them, and said in the deletion log that he did so because they were orphaned.

We have no prose regarding their history or significance, and you even removed the slightly specific descriptions that we did have (not that these were sufficient).

In response to your request that I discuss the WNBC matter on your talk page, I direct your attention to the above.

<p>I saw you had tried re-introducing numerals written as words into this article. When I re-wrote this and others, I substituted most single-digits with their word forms, and it wasn't a problem until David Levy decided to change them a month or so ago. While he has a leg to stand on as per Wikipedia's <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">Manual of Style</a>, this is not correct from a writing standpoint, as other writer's style guides (such as the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Manual_of_Style_77c7.html" title="Chicago Manual of Style">Chicago Manual of Style</a>) suggest the same thing we agree on. However, David Levy has drank the Wikipedia Kool-Aid much too much to listen to any suggestions. In short, I agree that single-digit numbers should be written as words in most cases. But we'll have a better time appealing to someone higher than David Levy, with whom I've had problems in the past and dislike immensely. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERollosmokes_a776.html" title="User:Rollosmokes">Rollosmokes</a> 07:01, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Over and over again, you ignore the ample evidence of the fact that this is a clear-cut exception to the rule. I explained the distinction between a formal FCC designation and a mere word used in prose. You stated that "we should practice the same stylistic protocol as printed encyclopedias," so I quoted several excerpts from the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> (arguably the world's most prestigious printed encyclopedia) in which single-digit channel numbers are referenced in numerical form. <b>You</b> quoted an excerpt from the <i>Penguin Handbook</i> containing an explanation that "most styles do not write out words in ... an address" and prescribing that we "use numerals instead," but you refused to explain why we should spell out postal addresses (such as "Nine Broadcast Plaza") and channel addresses (such as "channel nine").</dd>
<dd>Rather than addressing any of this, you focused on <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">uncivil</a> <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attacks</a> (which you've resumed above).</dd>
<dd>Consensus on Wikipedia is clear, as evidenced by the format used throughout the site (which, to borrow your logic, "wasn't a problem" until you decided to change it). No Kool-Aid is involved, however, as this is the common style used in formal writing. Please stop attempting to impose your idea of correctness on the community.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, given the fact that you made such a fuss regarding my age (mistakenly assuming that I was much younger than I am), I'll point out that Aido2002 (the individual with whom you agree) is 14 years old. Of course, some of our best editors have been that age and even younger. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 21:21, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would assume the rule was written as the result of a discussion. Well, in that discussion, what reasoning did they cite as why we should use "4" and not "four", "2" and not "two", etc.? <a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAido2002_97b8.html" title="User:Aido2002">aido2002</a> 22:20, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, there was no such discussion. That isn't always how things work. Our Manual of Style documents Wikipedia style conventions, one of which is to write channel numbers numerically. (As you can see, this is done throughout the site.) This is the format normally used in formal writing (not merely in Wikipedia), so there was never a disagreement of this nature until Rollosmokes decided to unilaterally overrule the community. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 22:31, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but you're mistaken. Most numbers below ten are conventionally written out as words, but this is an exception.</dd>
<dd>I've repeatedly asked you to read my discussion with Rollosmokes. In it, I quote several passages from the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> in which single-digit channel numbers are referenced in numerical form. If that isn't a reputable authority, I don't know what is. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 22:38, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, that's different. It is proper to write out <i>channel numbers</i> in number form, however, I think the first line should be an exception. The first line is supposed to look good and open the article, and using word form looks nicer. (Notice how I only change the first line to "4", after I realized you have a case for the rest of the text.) Forget the rules for a moment, and look at this from a purely presentation point of view. It makes the article, and Wikipedia look better to open with (I'm paraphrasing) "<b>WNBC</b> is a television channel that broadcasts on channel four" than to say "<b>WNBC</b> is a television channel that broadcasts on channel 4." I know this seems like a strange argument, but think about it for a moment, and compare the two revisions in the edit history. <a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAido2002_97b8.html" title="User:Aido2002">aido2002</a> 20:47, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that the station <i>doesn't</i> broadcast on "channel four." Frequencies aren't written that way. As I explained to Rollosmokes, "4" is merely a technical symbol, <i>not</i> a means of counting through three other television stations to reach number "four." You're transliterating something that isn't literal.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, the existence of a talk page discussion is <i>not</i> a valid reason to omit an edit summary. The summary is for the benefit of everyone who views the revision history (not merely the person whose edit was reverted) and it will be there long after this discussion is archived and forgotten. In general, failing to use an edit summary when engaged in a dispute is perceived as <i>worse</i> than if no such dispute existed. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 21:32, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is kind of pushing it. Everyone sees "4" and "four" as interchangeable.

<dd>1. I did <i><b>not</b></i> say that this rule was not consensus-derived. It certainly was. It wasn't <i>discussion</i>-derived. Our policies and guidelines are descriptive, <i>not</i> prescriptive; they document the way that things are done. In this case, consensus is evidenced by this format's use throughout Wikipedia (and formal writing in general, for that matter).</dd>
<dd>2. With the exception of Jimbo, it is no one's place to unilaterally "set an example" of how he/she believes things should be done. When clear consensus exists to do something a certain way, your choices are to agree or propose change. Simply overriding consensus is highly disruptive and counterproductive.</dd>
<dd>3. Before you revert again, please see <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">Wikipedia:Three-revert rule</a>. I won't block you (because of our disagreement), but I will report you. I don't want to (as I know that you mean well), but this has to stop.</dd>
<dd>Please take my advice. I possess no more authority than you do, but my role as an administrator should tell you that my knowledge of Wikipedia procedures is sound. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 04:41, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Look, I'm not trying to start an argument here, and I understand that you mean well. I am not attempting to override consensus, but rather to demonstrate how I believe this should work, to have an article to cite when I propose a discussion for it.<br />
I agree that this has to stop, edit wars like this will not get us anywhere. For now, I will leave the article with "4", but I'll start a discussion over it, to give us a chance to debate it (I don't think following the rule shows we agree, but rather that we don't feel like doing something, or getting blocked).<br />

<p>As you know, I agree with you 100 percent. However, it's not worth getting banned for going tit-fot-tat with David Levy or any admin over any issue with a revert war.

<p>We have enough trouble trying to keep articles for schools on Wikipedia.

But there is no way that an article like Marlboro Memorial Middle School Faculty and Staff will survive long on Wikipedia before being deleted. I encourage you to focus on finding more details about articles about the school, awards that have been won, sports championships, etc. that might better qualify the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlboro_Memorial_Middle_School_2d06.html" title="Marlboro Memorial Middle School">Marlboro Memorial Middle School</a> article to meet the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> standard.

So if you want four columns, I don't really think I'd be able to help, but I can do similar to my userbox page if you want (or you can just copy the format). — <a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnemoneProjectors_565e.html" title="User:AnemoneProjectors">AnemoneProjectors</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnemoneProjectors_b870.html" title="User talk:AnemoneProjectors">talk</a>)</small> 15:07, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>By the way, if you add the {{<a href="../../../h/e/l/Template%7EHelpme_09e4.html" title="Template:Helpme">helpme</a>}} tag here on your talk page, you'll be placed in a category for people looking for help, which is checked regularly by several users.

<p>I realize that the average reader of the article might be confused; however, I have yet to find one page on Wikipedia with a corporate infobox that uses "Formerly" underneath the true legal name of the company. I this practice should be utilized, why not go to the <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprint_Nextel_7c19.html" title="Sprint Nextel">Sprint Nextel</a> article and put "Formerly Sprint Corporation" underneath? Or DaimlerChrysler "Formerly Daimler-Benz"? I do not see the importance in putting "formerly" in the infobox, especially considering the article itself frequently repeats that it continues to do business as Cingular. KansasCity 22:50, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If this is to be true with all articles, why was this not done with AT&amp;T Inc. and "Formerly SBC Communications"? Why not put "Formerly Verizon Information Services" in the <a href="../../../i/d/e/Idearc.html" title="Idearc">Idearc</a> article? I cannot find any valid reason why "formerly" belongs in the corporate infobox. I have yet to discover an incident when this happened. KansasCity 07:33, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I feel it is a precedent that should not have been started. If you feel this is necessary, the "formerly" should at least not be present on the Cingular article when Cingular is dropped altogether. KansasCity 03:10, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I agree that both terms are used, the district refers to itself most often as the "Marlboro Public Schools" rather than as the "Marlboro Township School District". "Marlboro Public Schools" is what appears on top of all pages at the district's website. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:59, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
