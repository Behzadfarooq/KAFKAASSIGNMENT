<p>Hi. Just wanted to let you know that I have shrunk Image:11 19 2006 11 59 22.jpg down to a much smaller size and reuploaded it as <a href="../../../b/b/c/Image%7EBBC_Parliament_ident.jpg_a1ea.html" title="Image:BBC Parliament ident.jpg">Image:BBC Parliament ident.jpg</a> for use with the respective articles. The original image is unfortunately too big to constitute fair use on Wikipedia plus the other image has a bette filename for finding the article etc. Hope you don't mind. Thanks for your other ident related work, <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_Idents_and_Presentation_fe34.html" title="ITV Idents and Presentation">ITV Idents and Presentationâ€Ž</a> is really good and I have done my best to save it from deletion so that it can be improved. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 19:59, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I try to keep to around 400px, no more really than 500px if I can help it. I have resized several of the images in the ITV idents article to 400px. That's my general standard, other's follow their own. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 22:51, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. As part of the big cleanup of all the articles nominated for deletion late last year, I have been working this evening on the ITV Idents and Presentation article. I have nominated a large number of the images for deletion as part of this, but also renamed the article as <b>ITV television presentation</b> since it sounds a little bit better. Would you like to upload new images of the idents used both now and in the past for each channel discussed within the article? By this I mean the ITV 3 and 4 sections as well as possibly the ITV News Channel and ITV Play. My idea was to have at least one ident image per look that each channel had. What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Also, the images I have now tagged for deletion are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image:ITVNC Ceased broadcasting.jpg</li>
<li>Image:Itv-slide.jpg</li>
<li>Image:Itv-ecp-other.jpg</li>
