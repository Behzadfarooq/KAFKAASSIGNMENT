<p>In some instances the article mentions the "<a href="../../../t/_/c/T_cell.html" title="T cell">T cell</a>" count instead of the CD4+ count. The distinction is quite essential; not all T cells carry CD4, yet for AIDS it is the most important marker. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 15:27, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question and request for clarification</span></h2>
<p>The article states, "HIV is a retrovirus that destroys the T cells of the immune system, weakening it and rendering it unable to fight off infections and cancer." Is it shown that HIV directly does so, or might it be that HIV causes an autoimmune destruction of the T cells? I ask whether there are studies that show HIV destroying T cells <i>in vitro</i> or <i>in vivo</i> without some complementary mechanism, and references if possible. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 16:14, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well not only does it destroy T cells, but it also tricks the body into destroying health t-cells as well.

<dl>
<dd><i>"In summary, the gp120-mediated autoimmune model asserts that it is the combination of gp120 and antibodies against gp120 which acts to disable T4 cells, not the direct infection of T4 cells by HIV. After initial infection, the concentrations of gp120 and antibody in a person's body slowly rise. HIV continues to infect more cells and spread, shedding more and more gp120, and B cells continue to multiply and produce anti-gp120 antibodies. Finally, the number of T4 cells that are disabled by the gp120 and antibody reaches critical levels, and the immune system starts its collapse."</i></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is exactly what happens. HIV infected cells attack a healthy T cell first with their gp120, which are those beads surrounding the infected cell. It binds to the CD4 of the healthy cell, then bends over to and binds to the CXCR4 (for a Fusion T helper cell, CCR-5 for a macrophage) which sends commands inside the healthy cell to shut down a load of its functions, allowing the gp41 to pierce the cell and infect it easily.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What is a son of a bitch is those gp120s shed off an infected cell and float around in the blood stream or just break off the infected cell brushing against healthy ones. No infection has to take place; that gp120 just has to hit a healthy cell and it not only disables the cells' functioning (immunity suppression), but it also marks it for death for T killer cells as well(our own bodies killing our immune system)! <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">(talk)</a> 15:31, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fascinating. So this would support the idea that AIDS is largely (if not entirely) an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autoimmune.html" title="Autoimmune">autoimmune</a> disorder (presumably initiated by HIV infection) and not strictly a disabled immune system (though hyperactive autoimmunity can cause such disablement). This hypothesis explains as well the long latencies that are observed with the HIV model. I think there may be significant reason to think new treatment modalities addressing this mechanism might work better than the present antiretroviral approach, though I pass no judgment on the particular vaccine proposed by the group cited above. The fact that they seem to be focused on raising funding for their approach puts them in some question, but it may be that other groups are proceeding with similar studies. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 17:00, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As HIV brings the CD4+ count down more and more, the latent HIV infected cells activate more and more. In the beginning it is largely autoimmune, but towards the end you get tons of cells lycing - litterally exploding from all the HIV virons it is producing, leaving a gutted cell behind. And, towards the very end, and what makes AIDS so debilitating, is the opportunistic infections that ravage the body due to no immune system to stave them off.</dd>

<dd>Further consideration of this hypothesis with respect to the effectiveness of antiretrovirals would suggest that their principal benefit is in fact due to their <b>suppression</b> of the immune system (reducing autoimmunity) rather than destruction of HIV itself. A person might have a prior infection with HIV which, even if successfully "cured", leaves the autoimmune progression to continue its destructive course. This would also explain why we would find it hard to isolate active HIV from AIDS patients. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 17:09, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-retrovirals.html" title="Anti-retrovirals">anti-retrovirals</a> work by stopping HIV in one of its steps for replication. Right now we have reverse transcriptase inhibitors (stops RNA--&gt;DNA replication) and protease inhibitors (stops HIV from producing proteins to asemble more copies of HIV virons). It doesn't <i>suppress</i> the immune system per se, but it does allow less HIV in the body to replicate thus letter the immune system build back up for a time.</dd>

<dd>If magically we could cure someone with HIV, there would still be gp120 floating around for a time making their immune system attack itself - but it would subside after a time. gp120 does suck, don't ge me wrong, but HIV is the thing that keeps its production up. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">(talk)</a> 17:35, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Suppose that HAART were used for a brief high dose (i.e., chemotherapeutic) course followed by anti-gp120 (antioxidant) therapy — we know that long term use of HAART has its own problems, and this might be an effective approach to be explored, if it isn't already being explored. I'd like to see if studies exist for this. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 17:50, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Fuzeon is another new and upcoming treatment you might be interested in. Here <a href="http://thebody.com/fuzeon_guide/contents.html?m103h" class="external autonumber" title="http://thebody.com/fuzeon_guide/contents.html?m103h" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> is a little guide about it, although this particular link comes off more like an ad than a study&#160;:/ . Fusion inhibitors work by keeping the gp120 from interaction with CXCR4 on T helper cells, thus keeping the HIV viron from shutting down the cell's functions. If it can't disable the cell it can't pierce the cell membrane with gp41 and enter/infect it. Cool stuff, shows promise. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">(talk)</a> 22:11, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Looks really nasty, actually, or at least doesn't look like any sort of improvement over the existing regimens. As monotherapy, it fails completely, and apparently it's used for end-stage cases where all other therapies have failed (i.e., <i>drug resistant</i> AIDS). <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 01:02, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think most of the wish-wash in there is related to AIDSVAX, a vaccine trial that took place in Thailand that flopped terribly. It showed nothing after the trials. The trials were allowed to happen even though their data wasn't so supportive before hand, and some say a little doctored. Most of the weight thrown around sounds like an attempt not to dump $119 million on another AIDSVAX. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">(talk)</a> 18:35, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)

<p>I kinda don't like how the prevention section is winding up. Although odds for infection are worst for blood transfusions and injection drugs, the odds for all the sex is quite low. I know that this is accurate as it came from the CDC, but if as a guy my chances of catching HIV is 1 in 2,000 if i am hetero, then i'm not gonna care if i wear a condom or not, ya know? (i mean, i'd feel lucky if i got laid 1,000 times in my <i>lifetime</i>) I want to be NPOV, but it can be a lot more dangerous than that, especially with other STDS present/co-infections.<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">(talk)</a> 18:13, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It should come as no surprise that 450 ml of HIV tainted fluid (one unit of blood) injected directly into the bloodstream carries a higher risk than 10 ml of HIV tainted semen deposited elsewhere! If you wanted to "even" out the statistics, you'd calculate risk per ml rather than risk per exposure—but that would not be a particularly useful statistic. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 02:15, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as I understand it much of the early disease spread among homosexuals followed a culture of really promiscuous sexual activity, far exceeding the mainstream, perhaps many hundreds of times per year with dozens or more partners each. This is quite an environment for disease spread, and indeed a great deal of other sexually transmitted disease shows up in these subpopulations. Frankly, I think that condom use is far less of a safety measure than having stable monogamous relationships. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 21:09, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a good example of why not to use news reports as references! Dr. David Ho, of now discredited HAART and viral load fame has once again grabbed the media spotlight.

<dd>No, it's not "a good example of why not to use news reports as references". News reports are appropriate when they are clearly labeled as new developments with unresolved issues. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge about AIDS, and the "super AIDS" story is widespread enough that it would be irresponsible for us <i>not</i> to acknowledge it and, now, acknowledge the evidence against it. Also, trying to turn this into a grudge match between David Ho and Robert Gallo is just odd, and I have no idea what you mean by "now discredited HAART and viral load fame". Ho's public comment on this case was "it is prudent to closely watch for any additional possible cases while continuing to emphasize the importance of reducing HIV risk behavior" - a sensible statement and hardly "grabbing the spotlight". <a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob"></a>←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 18:46, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thirteen human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in young women who reported sexual contact with the same HIV-infected man were detected in a rural county in upstate New York. <a href="http://www.thebody.com/cdc/cluster/cluster.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thebody.com/cdc/cluster/cluster.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>These 13 women were identified from 47 women who reportedly had had vaginal sex with the same HIV-infected man. The median number of vaginal sexual exposures to the same HIV-infected man was higher, although not significantly, for the HIV-infected women (six exposures; range: two-190 exposures) than for the uninfected women (three exposures; range: one-90 exposures) (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p=0.07). Median ages at first exposure to the putative index case-patient were similar for HIV-infected women (17.8 years; range: 13-22 years) (data were missing for one) and uninfected women (17.7 years; range: 14-24 years).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unravelling the AIDS paradox</span></h2>
<p>In 1985 AIDS was an unusual disease of several thousand sexually promiscuous, drug using, white, gay men in California and New York. Twenty years later AIDS has been redefined as a disease of millions of monogamous, married women in Africa. The emphasis has shifted from explaining unexpected cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma in apparently healthy young men in the United States to interpreting the meaning of HIV antibodies in pregnant women in Africa. Along the way, about half the original AIDS patients have been reclassified as not having AIDS because they did not have HIV antibodies. Blood donors, who have HIV antibodies detected, are retested a year later and usually no longer have HIV antibodies.</p>
<p>HIV has proved impossible to purify. There are no electron micrographs of purified HIV particles. In the place of facts we are offered <i>artists impressions</i> and pictures of bumps on cell surfaces.</p>

<p>I think it has been well established for over a decade, that at least some recently HIV infected people are highly infectious. This group of HIV negative people may infect 10% to 30% of people they have sex with and account for half the new HIV infections. Compared to the lower rates of transmision for HIV positive people with established infection of between 1 and 50 per 10,0000 exposures - the relative risks of anal and oral become insignificant <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 17:07, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe you are right, people are more infectious if recently infected. Quantifying that into the exposure/infection numbers of general populations is a much more difficult task however. Do you know of a study that gives a solid, tested percentage of how much more infectious someone is soon after they are infected themselves? If so, we can added at the end of the HIV infection rates for vaginal/anal/oral something like "it however has been shown that after XX weeks initial infection, a person is XX% more likely to infect their partner." <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">(talk)</a> 18:00, July 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought this CDC cluster was about 42 women, of whom 31% were infected with the same HIV. If you apply your "one man" rule, then most of HIV science goes down the drain. All HIV tests are based on samples from one man in France, which Gallo and Weiss were given by the Pasteur Institute. The origin from Chimpanzee case is based on samples from one laboratory animal in the USA. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 05:17, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>In empirical science we try to not base things off just one example. The HIV tests may have been, but they've been widely proved/developed with more samples since. The chimpanzee case isn't the best, which is why we are still for the most part formulating just base theories on the origins of HIV. Here we have the option not to have to rely on 'one man data', and we even have other studies that take populations into account from the CDC (look at the table we have for infection rates). So please, something better than that. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">(talk)</a> 18:48, July 23, 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>OPPORTUNITY TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION</i></dd>
<dd><i>A third reason that PHI may represent real opportunity is that it is a time of heightened infectiousness, during which identification of infected patients can open up the possibility of preventing secondary infections. The Duke UNC Emory group in collaboration with Swiss colleagues (Abstract 366-M) presented data on paired semen and blood HIV viral load concentrations measured at baseline (prior to initiating HAART) in a group of 30 men with PHI. By displaying these levels as a function of estimated time from infection, investigators showed that viral loads appear to be highest in semen at the precise time that they are highest in blood, and that changes over time in viral loads appear to occur in parallel in the two compartments. They then used a series of calculations to estimate that the likelihood of sexual transmission from a given man to a given woman would be increased about 20-fold during PHI as compared with the same couple having the same sex act 4 months later. These observations suggest that changes in semen viral load are significant during PHI and may put sexual partners at truly high risk-emphasizing the public health opportunity PHI represents.</i></dd>

<dd>I do not think it is correct to say that all HIV infects all T helper cells. My recollection is that only a very small percentage of T helper cells are infected with HIV. As I recall the number of T helper cells killed by HIV each day is about the same number you would loose when shaving. Either way the decline in T helper cell numbers takes several years, which is much longer than the average life of a T cell. An then there are all the people who develop AIDS defining illnesses while their T cell number are within normal range. Are we presenting popular prejudice or the current state of knowledge? Most of the quoted sources are more skeptical than the current article. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 16:00, 25 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He never said that <i>all</i> t helper cells are infected, he just said that t helper cells are infected. And the initial onset of HIV doesn't kill many T helper cells, especially directly (i.e. cell lysing). But later in the progression of the disease, latent HIV cells activate and produce mass amounts of the virus and lyse the cell, destroying them and infecting others and doing the same. More than shaving. Lots more. Plus, your own immune system rolls around killing your own t helper cells because they are infected, even disabled ones hit with rouge gp120 viron particles. This isn't some 'popular belief', it has been studied and proven. As for HIV longterm non-progressors, that is a very very small percentage of the population who's t-cells don't drop yet have AIDS defining illnesses. That is a whole other can of worms. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">(talk)</a> 17:41, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Listen. Your revert changes far more than what you have issue with, which I assume you do on purpose. Not only this, but the VERY next line in the Biology Project source to "Many models have been proposed." is "The most recent ideas center around the fact that CD4 and CCR5 are co-receptors for HIV." This cite comes from 2000, and five years later you look around and tell me which is the most popular still.</dd>
<dd>Also your direct quote of "Many models have been proposed to explain why the body's <a href="../../../t/_/h/T_helper_cell.html" title="T helper cell">T helper cells</a> are depleted by HIV. The progression of HIV infection to AIDS probably depends on how well our body can replace cells destroyed by virus." is weakly phrased and copied. Find your own voice.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>All reverts are not equal, and "working together" only works if both all parties have the same goal. That's not the case here. JoeSmack is trying to put together a well-referenced accurate AIDS article; SciGuy is involved in a form of passive-aggressive article vandalism. SciGuy does a decent job of obfuscating what he's doing, but to anyone who's watched the edits here for long, it's obvious. His <i>modus operandi</i> consists of:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Making tiny changes so as to weaken unequivocally true statements,</li>
<li>Replace clear language with obtuse--but scientifically correct--technobabble so as to hide important points from the casual reader,</li>
<li>Citing sections from sources out-of-context, then claiming the source supports his point of view,</li>
<li>Slipping critical changes in the middle of a host of small changes (usually with no annotation of what the change is on the revisions page), and</li>
<li>Demanding standards of proof that are not possible in any field of science, or demanding specific evidence, and then moving the goalposts when such evidence is presented.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think (but can't be sure) that viewpoint he's pushing is "HIV doesn't cause AIDS." That's fine--there is a page on Wikipedia for that (and other AIDS dissident views). He needs to go there, and stop making life harder for people who are only trying to create a good, well-referenced, and complete article on AIDS.</dd>

<p>(Speaking as the person who wrote the 3 revert rule enforcement guideline which Jimbo then proposed) The three revert rule is not intended as a invitation for people to start pushing agendas, which as Carl accurately describes, is exactly what Sciguy has been doing. Nor is it indended to be applied mechanically, without good judgement from administrators. Sci Guy is good at quashing factual inaccuracies when they crop up (such as my erronious statement saying that HIV directly kills T-cells), but 95% of the work he does here consists of obfuscating or otherwise whitewashing certain aspects of HIV/AIDS. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 19:37, July 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The policy also states, "In the cases where multiple parties violate the rule, sysops should treat all sides equally.".

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Factual errors</span></h3>
<p>Recent changes have introduced several factual errors. No references are cited to support these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>AIDS was not formerly known as <a href="../../../g/r/i/GRIDS_2b79.html" title="GRIDS">GRIDS</a>. GRID was was initially proposed as the name for clusters of Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocycstis pneumonia among gay, male, drug users in California and New York City. But later testing showed that half this group were not infected with HIV. see Shilts R, And the Band Played On. 1987.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Might you have a journal reference for the testing that showed half of this group were not infected? I like those better. I believe And the Band Played On is a book (and a rather poor movie too&#160;:-/ ...). Also, when talked about in the article here the cite <a href="http://www.aegis.org/news/nyt/1982/NYT820610.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aegis.org/news/nyt/1982/NYT820610.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> refers to it as "gay-related immunodeficiency disease", notice the "immunodeficiency". Anyone know for sure?
<dl>
<dd>I agree that journal references are better, but the CDC rarely publishes in peer reviewed journals. The CDC revised the original number of reported AIDS cases based on HIV antibody testing. As to the New York Times story, this is exactly why newspaper stories are not good sources. They do not have a good track record in correctly reporting AIDS stories <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 16:35, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>The claim that "HIV can be transmitted in numeraous ways" seems misleading. HIV is actually very difficult to transmit, requiring direct exposue to infected blood or semen (both of which may occur during oral sex).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>How is it misleading? It may be difficult to <i>contract</i> statistically, especially compared to diseases like <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hepatitis.html" title="Hepatitis">Hepatitis</a>, but it can still be 'transmitted in numerous ways'. There isn't anything ambiguous about that.
<dl>
<dd>Frankly, there are very few ways to be exposed to HIV infected blood or semen. This may explain why HIV is so difficult to transmit - and so easy to prevent by using a coindom. The more important point is that half the new sexually acquired HIV infections are thought to be acquired from people who were recently infected with HIV and would test HIV negative. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 16:45, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Definitions of what constitutes RP, LTNP and LTS vary between studies and cohorts. In Uganda we have defined an LTS (long term survivor) as a person who has a CD4 count greater than 500 cells/mm3 six or more years post-infection, whilst a RP is a person who died or progressed to a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 within 5 years of sero-conversion. LTNP is someone who has a CD4 count greater than 500 cells/mm3 12 or more years post-infection. This, we have published in medical journals such as JBC and AIDS. However, one must be careful as to the definitions of this as the date of seroconversion is always an estimate, and thus it is very difficult to know when one has become infected, also, the mode of infection can play a role in this, as the initial viral dose can play a large role. Personally, I feel that the term LTNP is a misnomer, and I know I'm not alone in this POV, as these poor individuals will eventually progress to AIDS, albeit over a longer time period. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Grcampbell</a> 19:45, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
