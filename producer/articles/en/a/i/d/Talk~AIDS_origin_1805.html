<p>I changed all the refrences to use the &lt;ref&gt; syntax, for purly URL links this is not a significant improvment. The superscripts look nicer but it takes two clicks to follow the link, so its a wash. It does however provide for some better naming of the refrences and I did a few of them at the bottom. We shoudl follwo the links and at least include the title of the page linked to if nothign else. I also added some headings though I am not 100% happy with my choices here it was just a sort of off the cuff "this is what is contained here" sort of naming so someone should probbly rethink them and change to somethign mroe encyclopedic. In doing the headings I moves some paragraphs around and added a little bit of wording. I am slightly (but not significantly) concerned about the POVness of assuming the <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoonosis.html" title="Zoonosis">Zoonosis</a> origen is correct. It is my understanding that this is overwhelmingly the prevaliant view, and I head on NPR last week talk of a study (in nature?) where they actually tracked down likley populations in the wild that had the right forms of the viruses and the right location near population centers to have been the sources. They devloped a way to test for the simian vairant of the virus in feces. Either way we should be carful about wording and also someon shoudl track down that study. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 05:12, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

The researchers say that transference from chimp to human most likely occurred when a human was bitten by a chimp or was cut while butchering one, and the human became infected.<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-05-25-hiv-cameroon_x.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-05-25-hiv-cameroon_x.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Calculating based on a fixed mutation rate, the jump from chimpanzee to human likely occurred during the French colonial period. Comparative primatologist Jim Moore suggests that this may have been the result of colonial practices of forced labour, which could have suppressed the immune system of the initial hunter enough to allow the virus to infect and take hold. Likewise, forced immunisations (using one needle on many patients) may have sped the virus's spread through Cameroon and beyond.<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5450391" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5450391" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<p>This article is a mess. The 1959 sailor and the boy in St Louis was disproved in the early 90s. WHY is it still in this article. The HIV was from lab contamination. — 4.142.93.88</p>
<dl>
<dd>Incorrect. Your source for this information is Alan Cantwell's book "Queer Blood." However, it never states that the St. Louis samples were ever questioned or that the original findings were disproven. In that case, I believe three samples were all found to contain HIV, therefore, the 1969 case is a definite instance of HIV infection, and the earliest known case in the United States. This is an important piece of information for the appropriate Wikipedia articles to contain, and as such, it is best that you read your sources more carefully before editing articles and compromising the veracity of what is published.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Reread the Cantwell source. You'll find that it never says anything about the 1969 St. Louis case being disputed, only the 1959 Manchester case. Cantwell states, as do other sources, that the samples of David Carr, the sailor from Manchester who died in 1959, were initially found to contain HIV, but it was subsequently determined that the samples were contaminated and the findings were therefore refuted. You somehow lumped the St. Louis case into that one. Finally, Cantwell is a fringe source—hardly an authority on anything—whose work should probably be taken with a grain of salt, and should not serve as a basis for any Wikipedia additions.

<p>Can someone with more expirience in the topic than me help with this?</p>
<p>From what I can dicern, between 1956 and 1960 there was a camp at Lindi in the Belgian Congo that was reached by a ferry where between 400 and 600 chimpazees were captured by african native hunters, male chimpazees were killed while the females and children were kept. Around 400 chimpanzees were killed, their blood was collected and kept in glass jars, while their bodies were autopsied to remove several organs like the liver and kidneys in particular, this was performed by african nurses under the direction of medical officials from a large medical research centre (the name of which I cannot remember, something like Stanleyville?) where cultures of chimpanzee organs (particularly kidneys) were used in the research and production of the polio vacine. Lapse in scientific procedure led to this vacine being given to around 1million people without it first being tested for infections, etc, that could potentially have been transferred from animal to human. The resulting polio vacine was sent to philedelphia, places in Belgium, France, among others, where it was produced on mass.</p>
<p>The vacine gaurded against polio but also enabled the means to which HIV/AIDS could transfer between animal and human. Debates between Edward Hooper and the Royal Society in 2000 led to this theory being "disproven", however, evidence was not considered and several medical officials and members of the scientific community gave contradicting evidence. Evidence of the existance of the camp at Lindi exists and proof of the use of chimpanzee organ cultures in production of the polio virus has been proven. There are many people, (particularly africans who worked at the camp and the research facility) who have given evidence and are willing to testify. The research of Edward Hooper has been well documented and many documentaries have been created. A well known british scientist died of malaria upon returning to the africa to collect data to seek the truth of the theories. A book of Hoopers research was released by himself.</p>
<p>It has been said that as long as the medical officials involved (including Hilary Koprowski) remain silent as to the full extent of their knowledge of the issue, there will always be doubt. It is noted that the only holes in Hoopers 17 year research are those of these people who continue to keep silent. Now I don't know much about science or medical research or polio or AIDS or any of the people involved, but it would appear to me that this must be mentioned because it is as valid as any other theory until one in particular is properly proven or disproven, nothing has been <i>properly</i> proven or disproven to date. The debate in 2000 involving the royal society was a farse from my perspective, and the people who know and are keeping silent must supply the world with the truth. If you were Hilary Koprowski would you want to admit that you had a hand in transfering AIDS from animals to humans when he's already praised for producing the polio vacine?</p>
<p>I'm posting this here on the talk page to force discussion especially from people who know what they're talking about, and to suggest that it warrants the same ammount of validity as the current beliefs as to the origins of AIDS, therefore warrants the same ammount of attention within the article itself. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_carson_2b91.html" title="User:Nick carson">Nick carson</a> 04:33, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What you outline above (except for 1 very important error) is called the <a href="../../../o/p/v/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis_8959.html" title="OPV AIDS hypothesis">OPV AIDS hypothesis</a>. Its most visible champion is <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Hooper_896e.html" title="Edward Hooper">Edward Hooper</a>. "Hooper rejects the 1930's date on the basis that phylogenetic dating of "the most recombinogenic organisms known to medical science", immunodeficiency viruses, is "inherently incapable of making any allowance for recombination". <sup id="_ref-1930s_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1930s" title="">[1]</a></sup> (The "Wikipedia: AIDS origin" article uses a range of dates "1915 and 1941" in place of "1930s".) The OPV AIDS hypothesis is seen as "a very ugly theory" in immunology circles. Your error is that the vaccine allegedly produced in Stanleyville is not claimed to have been used outside Africa. At present the article gives minimal space to any theory of the initial crossover, focussing more on other areas. If it mentioned Hoopers discounting of DNA sequence analysis (above) I'd see it as wholey neutral. As it is, it seems pretty close. <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithBlue_06f3.html" title="User:SmithBlue">SmithBlue</a> 04:24, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. So the theory has a name and is recognised, is anyone investigating further? I for one would like to know if we humans transferred AIDS from chimpanzee to human, and I imagine the implications would be massive. I did however hear that samples of that particular polio vacine were sent to philedelphia, that is a reoccuring place in my research. I'll check out OPV AIDS hypothesis.

<p>I most certainly do not advocate this hypothesis, but I think it should at least be mentioned somewhere on Wikipedia as people really believe in this hypothesis for AIDS. Of course, there is no evidence for this hypothesis, and it should not deserve any serious consideration. I think it is worth mention that some people believe HIV as created by God to punish homosexuals for their "sinful lifestyles". <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinkinPark_6d45.html" title="User:LinkinPark">LinkinPark</a> 23:44, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article is a curious when comparing title and content. The title suggests that all theories on AIDS' origin would be mentioned. However the content briefly mentions the 2 most mainstream scientific theories and then moves on to a description of how AIDS spread, etc. There are separate pages for <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_conspiracy_theories_4054.html" title="AIDS conspiracy theories">AIDS conspiracy theories</a> (which some editors find a very problematic name) and <a href="../../../o/p/v/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis_8959.html" title="OPV AIDS hypothesis">Oral Polio Vaccine AIDS Hypothesis</a>. Strangely I think this article works fairly well. But yes "Gods punishment" is a common POV on the creation of AIDS and needs space somewhere.<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithBlue_06f3.html" title="User:SmithBlue">SmithBlue</a> 00:05, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is the source stating forced labour was a cause in AIDS? What is the source stating there WAS forced labour in the colonies during that period? Truth is there was no forced labour (it may have been used during war or as a punishment but not as in slavey which had been abolished for more than 100 years in France by then). There were really bad working conditions but it is absurd to blaim the French for the spread of AIDS. Please remove that sentence or provide a source and a well researched one. Thank you. 86.104.216.79 20:07, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, you are wrong. The French did use forced labor in colonial Cameroon. I can find several sources to back this up, if you still dispute it. However, the immediate source for the statement you question is a piece from NPR, which can be found <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5450391" class="external text" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5450391" rel="nofollow">here</a>. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">Brian</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrianSmithson_2424.html" title="User talk:BrianSmithson"><small>talk</small></a>) 10:02, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the following paragraph, from the "History of known cases and spread" section, needs to be reviewed. Its tone and lack of copy-editing caught my attention. Could someone with more experience take a look at it and decided if it belongs here?</p>
<p><br />
According to research of old bloodsamples HIV did not exist before year 1978 in United States of America. A very rapid spread of HIV-infections is still officially unexplained phenomenon but HIV-infections appeared exactly the same time in different areas of world and they also matched exactly the smallbox vaccine program of World Health Organisation (WHO) in Haiti, Brazil and Africa, within Zaire (nowadays Democratic Republic of the Congo) the most vaccinated state had also most HIV-infections. WHO it-self started to suspect was there really somekind of connection with its vaccine program and AIDS-epidemic. To find it out WHO hired a outsider investigator who did spotted a very clear connection with HIV-infections and vaccine program. WHO did not ever published the report it ordered and has kept it contents secret.
