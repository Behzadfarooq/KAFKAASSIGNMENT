<h2><span class="mw-headline">Poor quality</span></h2>
<p>Ok, I found the RFC, and have looked at this page with the eyes of a scientist with a strong biological background. I am open to alternatives and comments to any theory (like to do that myself, it is often needed). I have read two different versions with a pure logical mind and my remarks are the folowing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The text in general is poorly written</li>
<li>The text contains a lot of activism</li>
<li>Most is written as opinions, this is an encyclopedia, not a forum. Every claim, especially when people disagree with the main point-of-view, needs to be appropriatly cited.</li>
<li>I have seen claims that are at least 10 years old. In the meanwhile, a lot of research has been done, and it should be replaced by more recent claims. For example: About 350 people in 1993-1995 who singed a letter from <i>The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis</i>. First of all, many are not scientists, second of all, it was 1993-1995, how many do still have the same opinion.</li>
<li>Finally, much what is said can be condensed significantly, whch would enhance the change of getting the message about, and that is that there is some criticism to the main stream idea of the cause of AIDS.</li>
</ul>

<dd>My suggestion is to move pretty much all text to a talk subpage, and let people edited that. When sections are of sufficient quality, they can be moved back to the main page. I am not going t edit anything, but I am available in a letter stage to read again and see if the piece meets the standards that need to be set for a place like wikipedia. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> 02:58, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>additional cleaning - I removed the quote about "the package insert of Revtrovir" ... the language quoted was from a package insert used in the early 1990s, and no longer accurate.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clean-up Process</span></h2>
<p>Nrets claims there is a "clean-up process" on 2/6/06. I have seen nothing but removal of dissident evidence, quotes and references. And there have been NO changes in the last several days. So I will pause 24 hours to watch for "clean-up." If there is none, I will continue my campaign to have a page that represents dissident positions accurately. I FAVOR a clean-up...And I'm waiting for a legitimate one. Sgactorny 15:04, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Must a consensus version have NPOV? If so, I suggest the following sentence change:
<dl>
<dd>These claims are met with resistance, and often evoke frustration, censorship and hostility from those invested in the HIV-causes-AIDS paradigm.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>yes, it has to be NPOV, this is an ecyclopedia, not an activist page for either pro or contra. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> 20:36, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>OK, then. I am changing the sentence to the following:
<dl>
<dd>These claims are met with resistance from members of the mainstream, who believe that an untreated HIV infection causes AIDS, which leads to death.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Please let me know if that seems POV or wrong in any way. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a> 03:48, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The following sentence is hard to believe:
<dl>
<dd>Though the orthodoxy claims HIV antibody tests exceed the performance of most other infectious disease tests in both sensitivity [...] and specificity [...], the reality is very different.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Does some reliable reference really show the mainstream claim that about HIV antibody tests despite undisputed evidence to the contrary? <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a> 04:22, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another neutrality recommendation is to change the word "editorial" to "report" to avoid mischaracterizing the 1994 <i>Science</i> report. Since the description of the <i>Science</i> report has experienced an edit war, I will wait until we seem to have some consensus before making that change. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a> 04:34, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I repeat the recommendation to change the following:
<dl>
<dd>The <i>Science</i> editorial failed to mention the reality that the AIDS reappraisal movement is diverse, including hundreds of scientists from all over the world.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The point of that sentence appears to be to clarify that the Science article only addresses Duesberg and should therefore not be taken as a rebuttal of positions of any other segments of the AIDS reappraisal movement. So, instead of that sentence, the rebuttal section should open with something like the following:
<dl>
<dd>The AIDS reappraisal movement includes a diverse range of views. In 1994, the journal <i>Science</i> conducted a 3-month investigation of one such set of claims, Peter Duesberg's....</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Does that sound better? <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a> 04:40, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Rod, many things sound already much better. I have been writing yesterday evening off-line on several pieces to clean it up, and such, and I will later add tags to highlight unsoured information. But first I have to run and do some work. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> 14:09, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>

<dd>As far as the report in the journal <i>Science</i> goes, I'm not quite sure "news report" is quite accurate either. But it is better than "editorial". Also, there is a claim there that it was not peer-reviewed, implying that it is full of inaccuracies. <i>Science</i> is one of the top rated journals for publishing original research as well as literature reviews. I would find it har to believe that they would publish such a report without heavy editorial oversight. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 17:47, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is what Science themselves have used, and I used that, which is the most acurate way of representing it. The article will have had editorial oversight, but news reports are generally written by science journalists without peer review as they voice opinion, not original research. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> 18:02, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The previous version stated that the Science articles (remember, there were five articles, nit just one) failed to address all dissident positions. However, the articles/news reports/editorial (all semantics) was not about all dissident positions, but about the position held by Peter Duesberg. I have corrected this. Also, the previous version stated that <i>Science</i> refused to allow Duesberg or any of his colleagues the right to reply to many of the articles claims<i>, but he did reply, in the January 20, 1995 edition of Science, it was called</i> "The Duesberg phenomenon": Duesberg and other voices. <i>It can be found at the Pubmed Id of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=7824919" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=7824919">PMID 7824919</a> . Also, it stated that it was not peer-reviewed. It would have been reviewed by the editorial board, which is the peer-review process for scientific journals. Also, the then editor of Science actually supported Duesberg in finding funding so he could test his hypothesis. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 18:48, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Thanks for the corrections. I am merely cleaning up and editing stuff, without looking at the sources as this is already enough work.

<dd>In the latest cleanup of the Science article rebuttal, the quote attributed to Serge Lang states <i>the article completely omitted mention of dissenters such as Bialy and Haverkos, as well as many points raised by dissenters. For example, the <a href="../../../n/i/d/NIDA_5b61.html" title="NIDA">NIDA</a> meeting of May [1994], the position of Harry Haverkos on nitrite inhalants, the situation in Africa, the fact that malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, and influenza, test false positive on the HIV antibodies test, were still not mentioned in the</i> Science <i>article.</i> This is a bit obscure since nowhere else in this WP article is there mention of any NIDA meeting, there is no clear reference to malaria, leprosy, etc. and it is not clear what situation in Africa this refers to. Perhaps this quote should be put into context or removed altogether. Maybe we can say that Serge Lang opposed the Science article and link to his WP entry. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 21:56, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you at one hand on the arguments you provide, at the otherhand, this is about the arguments of the reappraisal movement.

I am not yet done with all the cleaning, the major hurdle will be the specific claims.</dd>
<dd>Along the line of the cleaning, I think it would be a good idea to make a header for the major players, such as Duesberg, spend a few lines on them and point to the pages on these people, rather than discussing everything here as well.

<dd>Actually the version on the Duesberg article was originally copied from this article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Alleged suppression of debate"</span></h2>
<p>I've made some changes to this section. The allegation that debate has not taken place is misleading. For example a search of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?DB=pubmed" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?DB=pubmed" rel="nofollow">PubMed</a> for "Duesberg HIV" turns up 72 results. Given the number of dissident websites around I think you'd have great difficulty finding an AIDS specialist who's unaware of the dissident point of view. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 19:58, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, you may be surprised how many "AIDS specialists" *aren't* aware of it. Not to mention just "HIV positive" patients. And the issue is really over the larger scientific community, as well. "AIDS specialists" are more than likely completely disinclined to consider alternatives, anyway. Most everyone else I run into seems (to me) to have a vague memory or passing acquaintance, in my experience, e.g. "Oh, doesn't this have something to do with the president of South Africa??", etc. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 10:30, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AIDS in Africa</span></h2>
<p>"Another relationship that is sometimes cited is that AIDS is highly correlated with drug use in Western countries, while it is associated with malnutrition and poor living conditions in Africa." This is a very silly sentence. AIDS is correlated with drug use all over the world, including in many non-Western countries such as Vietnam and Russia. If heroin suddenly became popular in Gabarone then I predict the correlation would apply there as well. Also it is simply not true that AIDS is associated with malnutrition and poor living conditions in Africa; members of the middle class are often among the worst affected.

<dd>I don't think that rephrasing would be helpful. The dissident case is put across very well in the preceding sentences of the paragraph, which make valid points about genuine epidemiological differences between sub-Saharan Africa and the West (except the bit about "exclusive AIDS-defining diseases", which could do with amending). The sentence in question is superfluous. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 21:25, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your change may be a slight improvement but I still think the sentence should be removed. You can't claim that "AIDS in Africa is a result of malnutrition and poor living conditions" implies "a non-infectious cause of AIDS".

<dd>How is it circular??? If AIDS diseases are associated with malnutrition and poor living conditions in Africa, and with drug abuse in North America, this is strongly incompatible with an infectious cause. You may doubt the premises, but the reasoning is not circular. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 10:23, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I only meant that the particular phrasing used in the article resulted in circular logic, not that the argument in general was circular. Perhaps "circular logic" was the wrong phrase to use; what I meant was "tautologous logic". It claimed that "AIDS in Africa <i>is a result of</i> malnutrition and poor living conditions" implies "a non-infectious cause of AIDS" If it had said that "AIDS in Africa is <i>associated with</i> malnutrition and poor living conditions" implies "a non-infectious cause of AIDS" then I'd have no objections on grounds of flawed reasoning. However, I would object that the association with malnutrition and poor living conditions is a matter of contention, which is why I rephrased this sentence - see revision history. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 17:48, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>"Furthermore, the high incidence of AIDS and HIV in developing nations is not inconsistent with infectious disease status at all; rather, poverty could explain a lack of education about HIV transmission and the subsequent increased rates of infection."</i> I've three problems with this sentence. Firstly, the "at all" seems a bit POV. Secondly, mainstream scientists believe there are many other reasons why poor people may be more vulnerable to HIV infection, such as greater likelihood of engaging in prostitution, less access to condoms, greater prevalence of untreated STDs, etc. Thirdly, as I've already said, the poorest people are not always the worst affected (e.g. rates of HIV and AIDS in Botswana far exceed those in Niger, though the latter is much poorer), so the link is not straightforward, according to the mainstream POV. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 19:02, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this claim is irrelevant to the issue of causation. Mainstream scientists also believe that AIDS does not always lead to death.

<dd>Where ARE these people, and WHY are they not being aggressively studied&#160;? Do you have a reference for this assertion&#160;? You'd think that after 20+ years and billions of dollars and tens of thousands of researchers working on HIV/AIDS the supposedly "immune" people would be a great rescource for development of a vaccine. Yet, Vaccine trial after vaccine trial has failed spectacularly.</dd>
<dd>This is what I mean by my complain that this article is hopelessly biased in favor of the orthodoxy, people are just repeating orthodox lines and removing Dissident arguments without understanding what Dissident positions are.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, the claim is NOT irrelevant, because the orthodoxy insists that people with HIV must be treated, with no regard for weather or not they posses immunity. The Dissident position is that antiretroviral treatment is itself IATROGENIC, yet I do not see mention of this crucial point. I'm not looking to this as a forum to argue, I am looking at this as an encyclopedic entry on the subject it purports to be ABOUT. The form this article is taking is one of consistent mis-statement of Dissident argument followed by fallacious orthodox rebuttals. This form is not encyclopedic, it is dismissive and political.DissidenceIsConscience 19:28, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Those people have a mutant CCR5 gene, delta 32. It is a genetic immunity, and has literally NOTHING to do with induced immunity as a result of vacination.

<dd><i>Chemokines and chemokine receptors play a crucial role in the trafficking of leukocyte populations across the body, and are involved in the development of a large variety of human diseases. CCR5 is the main coreceptor used by macrophage (M)-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2, which are responsible for viral transmission. CCR5 therefore plays an essential role in HIV pathogenesis. A number of inflammatory CC-chemokines, including MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, RANTES, MCP-2, and HCC-1[9-74] act as CCR5 agonists, while MCP-3 is a natural antagonist of the receptor. CCR5 is mainly expressed in memory T-cells, macrophages, and immature dendritic cells, and is upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines. It is coupled to the Gi class of heterotrimeric G-proteins, and inhibits cAMP production, stimulates Ca2+ release, and activates PI3-kinase and MAP kinases, as well as other tyrosine kinase cascades. A mutant allele of CCR5, CCR5 delta 32 is frequent in populations of European origin, and encodes a nonfunctional truncated protein that is not transported to the cell surface. <b>Homozygotes for the delta 32 allele exhibit a strong, although incomplete, resistance to HIV infection</b>, whereas heterozygotes display delayed progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Many other alleles, affecting the primary structure of CCR5 or its promoter have been described, some of which lead to nonfunctional receptors or otherwise influence AIDS progression. CCR5 is considered as a drug target in the field of HIV, but also in a growing number of inflammatory diseases. Modified chemokines, monoclonal antibodies and small chemical antagonists, as well as a number of gene therapy approaches have been developed in this frame.</i></dd>

<dd>There was a very interesting program on Nova a few years ago about people who survived the plague in villages in Europe passed down genes to their ancestors that give immunity to both the plague and AIDS. Mainly because both diseases basically operate the same way at the cellular level. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamb_4927.html" title="User:Williamb">Williamb</a> 10:43, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A couple of comments:</p>
<p>1. The Science "special news report" is given excessive prominence. There have been several other notable rebuttals of dissident claims that are not mentioned in this article at all (except as external links). It is misleading to concentrate only on one series of articles written 12 years ago (before the advent of HAART). How about replacing this section with one about mainstream rebuttals in general?</p>
<p>2. Something should be said about the influence of dissident ideas on President Mbeki and others in South Africa.</p>

<dd>This is an interesting article. It's the first response to Duesberg in a peer-reviewed journal. <i>"'Why won't they respond to me?' Duesberg constantly asks reporters, who then ask AIDS researchers the same question. 'I cannot respond without shrieking', says Gallo."</i> Anthony Fauci explains that, <i>"A number of scientists are reluctant to get into a public debate because it pits you against someone who is so far off from reality."</i> The article contains good rebuttals of Duesberg's arguments, which still stand today. I think this is worth mentioning. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 18:59, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History section</span></h2>
<p>One of the changes I've made is to remove the description of <i>Medical Hypotheses</i> as a peer-reviewed journal, which was a bit misleading. Papadopulos-Eleopulos has had some articles on AIDS (fewer than a dozen) published in peer-reviewed journals, the first of which appears to be <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=2777657" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=2777657" rel="nofollow">this one</a> from 1989. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 20:14, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">References</span></h2>
<p>The References section contains a lot of useful, relevant articles. However, this list seems almost entirely disconnected from the rest of the article (for example, there are several references concerning animal models, which aren't mentioned once in the main text). A number of these references also appear in the NIAID "Evidence" and "Relationship" documents, so there doesn't seem much point in having them all listed here as well. What's more, the references cited within the text are inconsistent - some correspond to items in the References list, while others are direct external links. I think we need a consistent system and probably a much shorter list of references, containing only articles directly related to the main text. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 20:46, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>DissidenceIsConscience 19:30, 14 May 2006 (UTC) A reference section in an article allegedly about AIDS Reappraisal which totally omits any references to the work of Lauritsen is absolutely rediculous and indicative of people editing the article who have a decidedly pro-orthodox POV and a lack of comprehension OF the subject matter at hand.</p>

<p>The list of dissident websites contains eleven entries. I suggest dropping the bottom three. It seems a bit excessive to include three pages from the "AIDS Wiki", and I don't think the Bauer and Culshaw sites are significant or useful enough to merit inclusion.

<dd>Yes, I have read them, and the Culshaw articles. My argument is that they are less useful than other dissident websites such as VirusMyth.net, Duesberg.com and your own AIDSWiki. The sites in question have relatively little content, and their arguments are largely derivative. I just thought it would be helpful to provide only the most useful links, but I don't really have a strong opinion on this. If dissidents think these are <s>among the nine most important dissident websites on the net</s> at least as significant as the other websites listed then the links should stay. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 18:11, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AZT package insert</span></h2>
<p>The statement "It was often difficult to distinguish adverse events possibly associated with administration of Retrovir from underlying signs of HIV disease or intercurrent illnesses" appears to come from a package insert featured <a href="http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/data/pdr-azt.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/data/pdr-azt.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>The statement wasn't presented in a historical context; it was presented as evidence that AZT causes AIDS. There are two problems with this. Firstly, the statement is very old - it comes from one of the earliest studies of AZT as an AIDS treatment, and as such doesn't necessarily represent current scientific knowledge. Secondly, the statement doesn't imply that AZT causes AIDS. As an analogy, someone who has a cold and is taking cough medicine may experience drowsiness and slowed reactions. It may be difficult to determine whether these effects are caused by the cold virus or by the medication. This doesn't prove that cough medicines cause colds. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 10:03, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Intention or not, this just underscores the fact that the iatrogenic properties of AZT are denied/ignored, which lends credence to Dissident complaints of revisionism and suppression of the facts.

<dd>I entirely agree that age is not sufficient reason for dismissing a piece of research. However, the point is that this particular study referred to "adverse events <i>possibly associated with</i> administration of Retrovir" (my emphasis). Because this was one of the first studies ever conducted on AZT as an AIDS treatment, the researchers didn't have a very good idea of what the side effects might be. Since 1987 the body of knowledge has grown immensely, and I'd hazard a guess that scientists are better equipped to distinguish between symptoms of HIV disease and AZT side effects. Still, if you want to put the comment back in then I won't object, provided it is presented in its proper context. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 19:13, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm now having second thoughts about this, having read the <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> article more thoroughly and also some of the external links featured on that page. A common requirement for pseudoscience appears to be the "assertion of claims that cannot be verified or falsified". This doesn't really apply to AIDS reappraisal. The usual argument is that the claims made by AIDS dissidents can be tested, have been tested, and have been shown to be wrong.</dd>

<dd>On the other hand, <a href="http://www.cssr.uct.ac.za/papers/wp149.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.cssr.uct.ac.za/papers/wp149.pdf" rel="nofollow">this article</a> defines pseudoscientists as "those who purport to work within the scientific paradigm, but who ignore or misrepresent accumulated scientific knowledge, fail to adhere to established scientific methods of research and who use scientific rhetoric when promoting their alternative remedies". The same article says that, "What distinguishes pseudo-scientists from scientists who are simply proposing new theories or arguing in favour of minority positions is that the pseudo-scientists do not respect the rules that govern scientific research and intellectual engagement – but instead appeal to popular fears and misperceptions." I reckon that AIDS dissidents fit these criteria. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 10:19, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>DissidenceIsConscience 19:36, 14 May 2006 (UTC) Dissidents argue that the orthodoxy has consistently fulfilled the definiton of Psudoscience, as stated above, by pointing out the economic and political influence on research and treatment as well as the aborgation of scientific method, i.e., the lack of proper blinding and controls in orthodox research. Again, not to sound like a broken record, but if one is going to contribute TO an article ON AIDS Reappraisal, it behooves one to at least attempt to properly represent the Dissident POV, after all, this is what the article alleges it is ABOUT.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The majority view is that AIDS reappraisal is pseudoscience, or at least wrong science. Wikipedia has <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Pseudoscience" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">clear guidelines</a> on how to write about what most people believe to be pseudoscience, and we should stick to them.

<p>According to the Wikipedia guidelines, AIDS-reaprassial should be listed as a pseudoscience because there is currently a strong scientific consensus that it is a pseudoscience. Wether that consensus is correct is irrelevant, as wikipedia is not original research. Obviously the dissidents themselves do not agree with the pseudoscience label, but it is still the majority view and consensus, and as such meets wikipedias guidelines for pseudoscience. If you disagree with wikipedia's guidelines, then wikipedia is not the place to argue that debate. There are wikipedia talk pages for discussing wether the wiki guidelines should be the way they are, but this page is not one of them. 137.205.192.27 21:34, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed "Impact" section</span></h2>
<p>I think I've done enough editing here so I'm going to withdraw into the background and let others have a go. But I hope they'll act on some of my suggestions. This has the potential to be quite an informative article.</p>
<p>Before I go, I'd like to repeat my proposal for a section about the impact of AIDS dissident ideas. It is important to record that these ideas have cost many people their lives. In particular, if the South African government had started providing antiretrovirals sooner then thousands of deaths would have been averted. The new section should have a global scope but I think it should concentrate mainly on South Africa. The following documents will be useful:</p>

<p>AIDS Dissidents would counter by saying that the orthodoxy has basically commited genocide, and that your "impact statement" is just another orthodox method of suppression of debate of the FACTS, as opposed to furthering a political agenda. After all, the orthodoxy has managed to get almost all of it's funding via. various government entities. Indeed, for all the "scientific" "proof" the orhodoxy claims to have, it simply can not deny that "the probably cause of AIDS" was announce via government press conference prior to ANY peer-review or debate whatsoever. Not a very respectable or scientific way to further the cause of science, but great for acheiving political goals and agendas. DissidenceIsConscience 06:26, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to reply as a scientist who knows how the inner working of peer review work. The time between the finish of the actuall peer review and the publication can be several months. The paper has to be prepared, proof read etc. I guess they have speed this up as much as possible, but it does take time. Therefore, the announcement before publication does not imply it was not yet peer reviewed. I can see that it was not a smart thing to do, although at the otherhand, people really wanted to know what the cause of that misterious disease was. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 06:40, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Dissident POV is that the announcement was a political one which influenced the allocation of rescources and corrupted the peer-review process by lending credence to Gallo's claims prior to proper peer-review. Gallo was a federal employee at the time, so this declairation, Dissidents argue, was tantamount to science by press conference. Also, one can hardly seperate Gallo, the criminal and fraud, from the orthodox assertions regarding causation, Dissidents argue that Gallo has such a profound record of being caught fabricating research and stealing other people's work that it calls into question the causation issue from the very beginning. Once can hardly represent the Dissident POV adequetly and omit all references to the fact that Gallo has been censored by the scientific community for theft and fraud, anyone else but a federal employee working in the scientific comminuty with this kind of record would have little credibility IN the scientific community, yet Gallo's "discovery" is deemed acceptible to people working in the field of HIV/AIDS, and this is an important part of Dissident criticisms OF the orthodoxy.

<dd>It seems like DissidenceIsConscience stopped reading the scientific AIDS literature in the 1980's. Gallo is by no means the sole person claiming that HIV causes AIDS. There are thousands of peer-reviewed articles that have since confirmed and reconfirmed the original hypothesis. I can highly doubt that the vast majority of current AIDS researchers, virologists, clinicians, epidemiologists, molecular biologists, geneticists, etc. are not in it for political gains, but to further our understanding of the causation of this disease and to save lives. Are you saying every AIDS-related paper has been a result of a corrupt peer-review process and scientific fraud? This sounds like a vast conspiracy theory! <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 00:48, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>DissidenceIsConscience 03:12, 15 May 2006 (UTC)When scientists build upon work based on fraud and lies their integrity deserves to be called into question, especially when they make excuses and create obfuscation and lame justifications for it. Again, this article purports to be about AIDS Reappraisal, I have yet to see any honest representation of AIDS Reappraisalist Therory here; just a series of straw-man misrepresentations of what AIDS Reappraisalism is, followed by orthodox POV dissmissals. Compleatly omitting mention of Gallo's fraud and criminal activity while he was head of the NIH, and ignoring the fact that most of the researchers you mention get their funds to conduct their research from the government prety much speaks for itself.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Much to your dismay, but scientists are not "idiots" who blindly build upon fraud. Much of what we now know about HIV and AIDS has been confirmed independently, from many different angles many times over by many laboratories. As I said, if you started reading and understanding some of the scientific literature it will become evident that the majority of the dissident arguments are far out of date and have been proven wrong many times over. However, any time anyone provides a logical argument agains all these reappraisal positions out come the accusations of censorship and dismissal. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 17:23, 15 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>DissidenceIsConscience 04:23, 16 May 2006 (UTC)I am not going to get into a pissing contest over how much orthodox material I deal with on a daily basis concerning HIV/AIDS, I will, however, point out again that misrepresenting AIDS Reappraisalists as not being thoroughly familiar with orthodox research, and that dissident arguments are all "dated" is in fact misreprentative and dismissive, not to mention rather over-generalized and vague. The issue was Gallo's fraud and unethical activity, obfuscate much&#160;?
<dl>
<dd>Gallo's unethical activity is discussed at length in the article <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Gallo_4cb3.html" title="Robert Gallo">about him</a>. And I'm not here to defend him. What you are implying by your remarks is that because Gallo was believed to be engaged in unethical behavior, then we must dismiss the whole HIV causes AIDS hypothesis. For that matter, if you read James Watson's "The Double Helix" it is not entirely clear that <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Watson_4863.html" title="James Watson">Watson</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Crick_68e2.html" title="Francis Crick">Crick's</a> discovery about the structure of DNA was reached by the most ethical of means, yet I don't see anybody ready to toss out the whole idea. If you have some more current views supporing the dissident arguments then add them to the article, but the vast majority of them are over 10 years old, and have all been addressed by mainstream science. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 13:34, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was announced singlehandedly, prior to any review, in a flashy news conference, complete with an unveiling of a large scale DNA model. They did take a lot of credit for work that several others had heavily contributed to. Of course this took place in England and funding was different then. But allegations about Gallo are not that he made up the data, rather than he presented other people's work as his own and took the credit for it. Anyway, as I said before, all this is mentioned in the Gallo article. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 00:41, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The key point of Crewdson's argument is that the French researchers, rather than Gallo, deserve credit for discovering HIV. All of the experiments that Gallo conducted have been repeated numerous times and have reinforced the case for HIV as the cause of AIDS. As <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> says, this kind of discussion belongs in the Gallo article, not here. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 19:20, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Concorde Study</span></h2>
<p>OK I'm back, and I've removed the new section about the "Concord" Study. For one thing, I don't entirely trust the opinion of someone who doesn't know how to spell the name correctly. In addition, this article cannot contain every detailed argument by either side of the debate; nor should it attempt to. Rather the article should stick to very concise summaries of the main arguments, with references and external links pointing to more information. Hundreds of articles have been written about Concorde, and it is far from the only study of AZT monotherapy (for example see <a href="http://www.aidsmap.com/en/docs/52923980-211B-48E9-80A1-A58985FF44ED.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.aidsmap.com/en/docs/52923980-211B-48E9-80A1-A58985FF44ED.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a>). If we start trying to include every relevant bit of information then this article will rapidly become massive and unwieldy. DissidenceIsConscience claims this article misrepresents dissident viewpoints. If that is the case then he/she should put things right. But in doing so he/she should stay within the word limit of the current article and not add lengthy new paragraphs. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 18:59, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Please note this is only a first draft. I'm aware that this is a very sensitive topic, but I hope people will contribute constructively. What I've written already is quite long and I don't think it should be made much longer, unless I've omitted something really important (which is quite possible). One of the sentences contains some blanks that I plan to fill in as soon I locate the relevant reference (which I know exists). I can supply references for the rest of the content as well. If people think this section is a good idea then I'll have a go at writing the rest of it at some point, unless others get there first.

<p>In light of the discussion above, I wouldn't object to the addition of a subsection called "Alleged scientific misconduct" or something similar, as part of the "Challenges" section, provided it is kept very brief and summarises both points of view.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Subtle but important bias in article, and the likely susceptibility of more</span></h2>
<p>I'm writing this because I think it is important and I don't see it anywhere else on the talk page. I believe that there is an inherent danger for this page to become a weapon for either side of the argument, in terms of public opinion. This is because a) people have grown to trust wikipedia, and although it might not affect a significant portion of the public, we shouldn't take for granted that many people will read it, b) emotions run high on both sides of the argument c) the debate is often very technical, and very dependent on not simply the existence of many sources, but also the quality and veracity of those sources, and the questions of quality and veracity are themselves complicated. In this situation, because it will take a huge effort to elaborate on point-counterpoint arguments, the article will be, for quite some time, if not indefinitely, a very short summary of these arguments, and even the smallest editing details will lead people to draw conclusions one way instead of another. For example, there is a danger that the article will appear to be in favor of whichever side is given the last word on any given subject, in lieu of the fact that the reply to that last word may exist and is simply not yet written down here. Solving these problems are difficult, and I'm not at all sure how to do it, which is why I think it should be discussed.</p>
<p>The "last word" bias already exists heavily - almost every section is arranged in such a way that the "dissadents" give a point of contention with mainstream theory, and then mainstream theory answers that point, followed by the next section. This makes it look simpler than it is, as though the answer to the dissadent's contention has been debunked. This is especially suspicious when a person like me, who knows little on this subject, knows of a further argument. For example, the article sites "numerous studies - conducted in Africa", besides the fact of this being a vast summary (almost necessary in an article this short), and having no citation, I know of articles that discuss the possibility of widespread corruption within organizations and companies that oversee such research, which include in some cases the elimination of control groups. While this is obviously open to debate, that debate should itself be alluded to somehow, and in all the relavent places, not necessarily just once.</p>
<p>The other bias that seems obvious to me at this point, is that the citations are very lacking in these rebuttals to dissadent arguments. This is understandable, as obviously someone has to do the work, and you are more likely to do the work for whatever side you agree with than the other side, but still, someone needs to do the work, otherwise the rebuttals appear as though they are simply thrown on the page by someone who just didn't want to stand by and let the dissadent's point of view go unanswered.</p>
<p>The point counter-point problem is difficult to solve, and seems inherent in many wikipedia articles, and, let's face it, any article on a debated subject. The most obvious long-term solution is to exhaustively include all notable points, counter-points, counter-counter-points, etc., but this is obviously very difficult, and is not a strategy for making the article unbiased in the short term. My best suggestion for a short-term solution would be to followup each section by a very neutral analysis of what the arguments rest on, so that the ball more clearly rests in the court of the readers and editors. For example, in the "AIDS treatment toxicity" section, we could write, "The weight of the argument regarding antiretroviral treatments lies in the strength of research performed on these treatments. The evaluation of this research bodes obvious consequences for pharmaceutical companies, governments investing time and effort in the research, the careers of those scientists who argue for or against those treatments, and the emotions of patients who have been positively or negatively affected by them. These consequences will just as obviously impact any given review of the research, and even the veracity of the information that such reviews are based upon."</p>
<p>I believe it is true that many "dissadent" or "out of the mainstream" views are merely conspiracy theories, but those cases usually involve dissadents who have very simple arguments that can be easily defeated, I don't believe that is the case here, and I don't believe this should be treated as such. It is quite obvious that pharmaceutical companies have deep pockets, deep motivations, and that there are governments and activists who, once swayed in a direction will exert massive powers over public opinion. I'm not trying to argue that the dissadents are correct, as I don't think I have the answer to that question, I'm trying to argue that there is some substantial reasoning behind their logic, even when they are arguing against many years of research. Essentially, that research needs to become the topic of this article.</p>
<p>Another note: The original AIDS article states HIV causing AIDS as fact, which I can understand is difficult to avoid...but perhaps more importantly, the reappraisal section is very small, and includes very little of the information found here, which this topic look like an aside, or, in other words, a conspiracy theory of little note.</p>
<p>Sorry, this is wordy and I'm adding even more here: It is also important, I think, to expand the history so that we can see why people are suspicious of mainstream thought in the first place. For example, Professor Duesberg was thoroughly castigated and virtually exiled from discussion of the subject when he first brought up these contentions, in some cases even refused the right to reply to arguments against him, which illustrates the emotional inertia that may make many people wary of arguments that involve "consensus of the majority". <a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesoid_ffa2.html" title="User:Cesoid">Cesoid</a> 04:01, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hate to be on the "this isn't a conspiracy theory" side of a debate, because there are so many contentions worthy of the label "conspiracy theory", but given nothing more than the notability and relavence of the people listed in the <i>The AIDS dissadent community</i> (if it is in fact true), it would be extremely hard for me to dismiss this as such. Please offer more useful comments as to why this is a conspiracy theory if you think it is. To summarize my motivations here: I don't want wikipedia to marginalize the voice of a minority when that minority has arguments that are not easily written off. To me, the definition of consipiracy theory is just that, an argument against majority opinion that can be easily refuted. For example, while UFO sightings cannot easily be proven to <i>not</i> be aliens, it is usually quite easy to refute that there is significant evidence for such claims. Or, for another example, you can easily refute many anti-evolution claims by simply better explaining what evolution is. The arguments in this case aren't like that, they are not explained easily as misunderstandings, or as overstepping assertions, they are substantial, regardless of whether it proves true that HIV causes AIDS, among other statements contested. <a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesoid_ffa2.html" title="User:Cesoid">Cesoid</a> 04:01, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Those advocating this particular conspiracy theory aren't generally clinicians, and are neither as numerous or notable as you seem to think they are. In fact, the minority has no arguments that merit serious consideration. I'm not sure on what basis you are characterizing them as substantial: they're not. If you think they are, you don't understand them. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:13, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I did not say they were "numerous". They at least seem to be notable, because those listed are quoted as contributing substantially to AIDS treatments. Perhaps this is wrong, if so, maybe it would actually be useful to put that in the article. Also, how is a clinician in a particularly good position to debate this? Their work is based upon AIDS research. While I'm sure they know substantially more than, for example, me, they can only base their diagnosis on available testing procedures, and base their treatment on available treatment research.</dd>

<dd>What should be more obvious than any of these points, is how it is not helpful to discuss this with single-sentence token arguments, or worse, assertions that your opinion is correct merely because it is correct, or merely because I must not understand.

<dd>Also, there are many assertions here, not just whether or not HIV causes AIDS flat out. You can also ask whether it causes AIDS alone, or whether, for example, AZT is a good treatment for it. These debates are all separable, and efforts to combine them hardly argue in favor of a coherent standpoint. Some of these points are argued by more than a <i>small</i> minority. For example, <i>Mothering</i> magazine, a very widely read publication, talks about pregnant women who refuse to use AZT because they believe it does more harm than good. There are studies suggesting that Vitamin A supplements work better than AZT. Again, maybe they're wrong, <i>why not document their wrongness instead of just stating it as fact</i>?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>One problem is that you think "debate" is a useful tool to settle these questions. It is <i>not</i>. Data, experience, history, <i>are</i>. It is particularly unavailing to have debates with those who are unfamiliar with the data, experience, and history that demonstrate the falsehood of the denialists positions. The only solution for those who have fallen for their fallacious arguments is to familiarize themselves with the data, which demonstrate the efficacy of treatment and the soundness of the knowledge of causality on which that treatment is based. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 14:47, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cesoid, since it seems like you are making comments in good faith here, I'll try and address some of your concerns. I think that you hit the nail right on the head when you say that many of these debates are in fact separable. Whether AZT alone is the best treatment for AIDS is in fact debated within the mainstream medical and scientific community, and that is why more research is needed to find more efficacious and less harmful treatments, but this can be said of any kind of medical treatment. Whether there has been some scientific misconduct by some AIDS researchers, fine, scientists a can be as prone to corruption as much as anybody else, but this doesn't meen ALL AIDS research is corrupt. The problem with the AIDS rappraisal movement is that they tend to take these arguments to basically mean that all AIDS research is wrong, that the whole hypothesis is invalid, that all scientists are frauds only seeking fame and fortune and power. Therefore, this article tries to take all of these arguments one by one and show evidence for and against in turn. If anything, this article disproportionatley represents the dissident argument, since the amount of evidence against each of the dissident positions is much larger than the evidence in favor, yet these are equally represented in the article. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 14:58, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While agreeing with the thrust of your reply, we ought to clarify: There is, in fact, <i>no one</i> who contends today that AZT alone is an appropriate treatment for HIV infection or AIDS! It's not debated at all! AZT was, however, more than twenty years ago, the only treatment available. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 15:09, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Many studies have found that AZT monotherapy is better than nothing for people in late stage disease. It would still be prescribed if no other drugs were available. However, combination therapy (which often includes AZT as one of three or more components) is much, much better still. AZT monotherapy is now almost never used except to help prevent pregnant women infecting their babies, though in most cases combination therapy is a better option. No one denies that, like many pharmaceutical drugs, antiretrovirals can cause nasty side effects. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 20:37, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>A number of other articles on controversial theories that are widely regarded as pseudoscience, such as <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">intelligent design</a>, take the same argument-counter-argument approach as this one, with last say always given to the mainstream side. I think that the Challenges section currently works OK. A while ago the article did try to cover arguments from both sides in more detail, but most of that material was removed for being too lengthy. I don't think there's much point going back. The external links listed at the end of the article provide a very thorough account of all the detailed arguments. It would be better for this article to concentrate on history, context, personalities and so on, which after all is more in the nature of an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 21:11, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is ludicrous. Almost any drug will have a toxic label when supplied for research use. Even ibuprofen. This just shows that it is possible to overdose with these substances. In the US, substance is defined as toxic if its LD50 is less than 50 mg/kg <a href="http://safety.science.tamu.edu/toxics.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://safety.science.tamu.edu/toxics.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The LD50 of AZT is 3084 mg/kg <a href="http://rx.onconews.org/profiles/UZ/Zidovudine.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://rx.onconews.org/profiles/UZ/Zidovudine.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, which means that it is not even near the threshold for toxicity. The typical adult dose of AZT is 600 mg/day. Which would mean that this dose would be acutely toxic to an adult weighing about 0.5 lb. Or that an adult weighing 160 lbs would need to take 372 times the normal daily dose to suffer from acute toxicity. When talking about toxicity of AZT, the relevant measure is the long-term toxicity which causes the side effects, which is why AZT is rarely used anymore. But to go ahead and make a statemnt that the AZT drug label says it is toxic and has a skull and crossbones is misleading. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 19:48, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
