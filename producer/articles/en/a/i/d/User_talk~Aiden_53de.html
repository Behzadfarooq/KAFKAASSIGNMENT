<p>The <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restorationism.html" title="Restorationism">Restorationism</a> article is in terrible shape. Amongst its many problems is a complete lack of citations. Do you have any online resources that you feel might help in a cleanup of that article? Everything from style and form to grammar needs attention; I'm willing to do a chunk of the work in cleanup, but I don't have the source background to do it right. Anything you can direct me towards would be appreciated. Thanks, -<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast1in_bacb.html" title="User:Last1in">Kevin/Last1in</a> 21:56, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You gave me quite the chuckle with a simple, one-letter typo. I laugh because it's the kind of thing I do, not in any way to belittle you. You wrote, "...the Gospels are Christian <b>cannon</b> anyway." A canon is an ecumenical doctrine, rule or foundation; cannons are things you shoot people with.

<p>Dear Aiden, In the last couple of days you have twice reverted my attempt to make the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Israel_9e85.html" title="Greater Israel">Greater Israel</a> article a bit more NPOV. The existing text says that claim that <i>Eretz Yisrael HaShlemah</i> stretches from the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_of_Egypt_46e9.html" title="River of Egypt">River of Egypt</a> to the <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphrates.html" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> is nothing but an anti-Zionist and Islamist conspiracy theory, while at the same time adding that "no prominent Zionist or Israeli intellectual or political figure advocates pursuing such borders". That text is really bad, as it one the one hand says that it's a false claim invented by critics or enemies of Israel, but at the same time recognises that some Israelis have that view, as the addition that no "prominent" Zionists, intellectuals or politicians have this view indicates that some less prominent people do.</p>
<p>So, I think that my attempt, <i>"According to a few <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionist_Zionism_b013.html" title="Revisionist Zionism">Revisionist Zionists</a>, who try to keep the views of people like <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avraham_Stern_cdd4.html" title="Avraham Stern">Avraham Stern</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Eldad_0f11.html" title="Israel Eldad">Israel Eldad</a> alive, the proper borders of the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a> stretch from the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_of_Egypt_46e9.html" title="River of Egypt">River of Egypt</a> to the <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphrates.html" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>. This extremist view has frequently been used in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionist_d028.html" title="Anti-Zionist">anti-Zionist</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamist.html" title="Islamist">Islamist</a> rhetoric as a proof of Israel's true intentions, although it is rejected by most Israelis"</i> is more accurate and more NPOV, as it clearly states that this is an extremist view, held by only a few, which is being used as "proof" by critics and enemies of Israel, although most Israelis don't share that view.</p>
<p>As you have reverted my change twice, without any other motivation then "POV", I would very much like to hear your reasoning behind it. Unfortunately there <u>are</u> small extremist Jewish/Israeli groups who claim that Israel should encompass all the area mentioned in the Bible. I see no reason to suppress this fact. However, I do think that the article should be moved to "Complete Land of Israel" with a rewrite and redirect from <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Israel_9e85.html" title="Greater Israel">Greater Israel</a>, as the term "Greater Israel" is an extremely poor translation of <i>Eretz Yisrael HaShlemah</i>, and is a major reason for some of the worries among Israel's neighbours for Israeli expansionist plans. It's bad enough that several groups today interpret <i>Eretz Yisrael HaShlemah</i> to include all the occupied territories as well as, in some cases, most of Jordan.

<dd>Thanks for the reply. Okay, so you want sources to the claim that Stern and Eldad advocated a <i>Eretz Yisrael HaShlemah</i> in accordance with the Bible:</dd>
<dd>Lehi, founded by Avraham Stern, advocated the establishment of a "Hebrew kingdom from the Euphrates to the Nile", according to <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/lehi.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/lehi.html" rel="nofollow">Jewish Library</a>.</dd>
<dd>According to an article in The Jewish Press, April 7, 1972, Eldad launched a monthly publication after the establishment of Israel, "named "Sulam" (Ladder), in which he sharply criticized Israeli government policies and advocated the establishment of a new "Malkhut Yisrael" (Kingdom of Israel) through the liberation of the entire Land of Israel <u>as defined in the Bible</u>". <a href="http://www.saveisrael.com/eldad/eldadbio.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.saveisrael.com/eldad/eldadbio.htm" rel="nofollow">Save Israel Eldad biography</a>. "Israel Eldad is famous for his advocacy, throughout the l950s and 1960s, of a Jewish state stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates", says <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Lustick_2187.html" title="Ian Lustick">Ian Lustick</a> in chapter 5 of his book <a href="http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/polisci/faculty/data/lustick/for_the_land/lustick15.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/polisci/faculty/data/lustick/for_the_land/lustick15.html" rel="nofollow">For the Land and the Lord: Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel</a>.</dd>
<dd>Both Stern and Eldad still have admirers and followers. The US-based website <a href="http://www.saveisrael.com" class="external text" title="http://www.saveisrael.com" rel="nofollow">Save Israel</a> is only one of many devoted to the writings of both men, so obviously there are people who think like they did. According to Ian Lustick, Yaacov Feitelson, former mayor of Ariel, has stated: "I say that Israel should establish new cities throughout the entire area. I mean really the whole area of the Middle East, without limiting ourselves", and Yehuda Elitzur, one of the most respected scholars in Gush Emunim, according to Lustick, considers the "promised" boundaries - extending to the Euphrates, southern Turkey, Jordan, and the Nile - to be "the ideal borders" for the lands Israel is required eventually to conquer and settle.</dd>
<dd>So, Stern and Eldad clearly held this view, and there are obviously a few, both inside Israel and outside, who still feel the same way. Best regards, <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Blomberg_de37.html" title="User:Thomas Blomberg">Thomas Blomberg</a> 04:41, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The following discussion (in a sub section) was originally started on the talk page of the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> article. I judged it to be very unlikely to result in any improvement of the article (or even of a change). My reasons for this were many but mainly I noted that the same concern has been raised many times on the talk page and has very rarely (or possibly not at all) resulted in an improvement of the article. As talk pages are for the purpose of improvement to an article your user page seemed a better place to carry out this sort of discussion:</p>

<dd>FYI the talk page on evolution is regularly trolled and issues surrounding the creationist perspective are often raised. Long and pointless discussions are regularly carried out on the talk page of the evolution article. Many editors have agreed to remove irrelevent and pointless discussion to user talk pages (To get an idea of the scale of the problem with such postings take a look at the archives of the evolution talk page.). This is not against wikipedia policy and hardly amounts to "censorship". <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnaby_dawson_0c30.html" title="User:Barnaby dawson">Barnaby dawson</a> 17:03, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have been petitioning to have IC included in the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> topic and have repeadetly ignored my arguement why it should not be included. Just for the record, I will write it once more. IC, by the admission of it's leading proponent, Bahe, has no scientific evidence to support it. Not a single study has been done to confirm this theory. Now, this fact makes this theory no different than an infinity of other theories proposed over the ages. To include IC into the article would require us to give space to all those other theories (it's gonna make life hard that there are an infinity of them) as there is no way to differentiate the validity of one thoery over the other. I agree that IC has a much higher support from the general public (due to ID's great PR campaign), but science is not decided by majority rule. So please, unless you can provide a reason why IC is better than another theory, cease requesting that it be included in the article.--<a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERoland_Deschain_25ed.html" title="User:Roland Deschain">Roland Deschain</a> 01:11, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"<i>You don't seem to have a problem including arguments against evolution based solely on faith, so why not one of the most popular 'logic based' arguments? —Aiden 07:30, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</i>"</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would have a huge problem if arguments based on faith (for or against) were included into the evolution topic. Can you point them out to me in the article so I can state my opposition to them and try to remove them (the misunderstanding section does not include arguements against evolution, it contains widespread misconceptions about the theory of evolution). I've read through the article twice and haven't found them. As to logic arguments: every single logical argument in biology (and science in general) must have some scientfic evidence behind it. And as Bahe has said, IC does not have any evidence going for it at all, so his logic is based on premises that have no validity to them (more than that, his premises have been proven false--see <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irreducible_Complexity_663b.html" title="Irreducible Complexity">Irreducible Complexity</a>. Bahe has based his entire logic on premises that cannot be differentiated from an infinity of other premises. --<a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERoland_Deschain_25ed.html" title="User:Roland Deschain">Roland Deschain</a> 23:37, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I may presume to add my two penneth, I would put in that 'irreducible complexity' is manifestly not a 'logic-based' argument. In fact, it is quite the opposite: a logical fallacy. It is an argument from personal incredulity. Instead of actually proposing scientific evidence that an organism or part thereof could not possibly have evolved through natural means, it simply argues that some things appear to be so complex that they must therefore have been designed. It's not much different from the discredited Watchmaker/teleological argument. It does not take into account that there are several natural paths proposed for every one of its examples - from the celebrated flagellum to the old hackneyed 'evolution of the eye' - and even if there weren't, that in itself would not be enough to prove that such a natural explanation could not exist and must necessarily therefore imply a designer. While it may be acceptable as a philosophical argument, it is certainly not a scientific argument and does not belong as a scientific criticism of evolutionary science. <a href="../../../j/f/_/User%7EJF_Mephisto_5456.html" title="User:JF Mephisto">JF Mephisto</a> 20:45, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello! I notice that you are a contributor to both Christianity-related and Islam-related articles, so I suspect we shall editing the same articles from time to time!</p>
<p>Regarding your reversion of my edits to the "salvation" section of "Christianity", please don't forget that your deletions on wikipedia should, ideally, be carefully justified.</p>
<p>Your deletion of clear, relevant and verifiable information does not appear to really be in line with wikipedia policy and guidelines. The salvation issue has several points of view, so I suggest all of which should be properly explained (in line with the NPOV policy).</p>
<p>Anyway I look forward to working with you in the future!</p>

<p>Someone reverted your NPOV edit on the opening of the <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liancourt_Rocks_ca1b.html" title="Liancourt Rocks">Liancourt Rocks</a>/<a href="../../../d/o/k/Dokdo.html" title="Dokdo">Dokdo</a>/<a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeshima.html" title="Takeshima">Takeshima</a> page. I didn't revert it back since I thought you might like to be the one to provide the rationale, or perhaps you will accept his reasoning (and because I've been editing the article quite a bit lately). Personally, I think it's good wording regardless of where the article winds up.</p>
<p>I have no idea the best way to start out the article, but it seems that both sides are at odds with one another. I appreciate you taking the time to try to help with a solution that worked elsewhere. If you add it back, I might suggest you note the parallel between the Palestinian territories article you mentioned on the talk page--it seems the reverting user didn't read it. <font face="Verdana" color="#003399"><b><a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELactoseTI_f014.html" title="User:LactoseTI">LactoseTI</a></b></font><sup><small><a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELactoseTI_0ced.html" title="User talk:LactoseTI"><font color="#009933">T</font></a></small></sup> 03:28, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aiden, you've added some information to this article for which no sources are cited. Please remember that all information added to Wikipedia must cite verifiable, reliable sources. In fact Transjordan did not invade Jerusalem: the Arab Legion was determined to stay out of Jerusalem for political reasons, assuming that Israel would do the same, but in fact the Jewish Agency had decided early in 1948 to establish west Jerusalem as capital of Israel by force. Israel also attacked east Jerusalem on 17 May; Transjordanian forces entered the Old City on 19 May, i.e., Israel attacked the "Corpus seperatum" with a view to annexing west Jerusalem and Transjordan responded to that action - see Klein, <i>Jerusalem: The Contested City</i>, pp. 44-45. Iraq occupied defensive positions in the hills of the West Bank, and didn't invade Israel except for brief incursions, none of which lasted for more than a few hours - see <i>The War for Palestine: Rewriting the History of 1948</i>, pp. 93 and 125. Lebanon didn't invade Israel either. There are perfectly good reasons why history books refer to Arab armies "entering Palestine" rather than "invading Israel". --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Pitchford_f7f8.html" title="User:Ian Pitchford">Ian Pitchford</a> 18:41, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And it's worth noting that even his supporters believed he was committing an act of terror designed to disrupt the peace process - Goldstein is not known to have given any reasons for his actions.

Hence my comment that I wish there was a comprehensive article on the Tanakh/Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and not simply individual article discussing only the terms. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><font color="#077CD0"><b>Aiden</b></font></a> 06:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aiden, that was intentional. IMHO the section is already much too detailed. In any case, it doesn't belong at the end of this paragraph but in the proper context. Maybe you can work something out so that this works, if you insist on having it in the article text.

<p>Thanks, Aiden. I think a footnote is a good middle ground between simply removing details and turning the persecution section into a "persecution of Christians with a focus on Islam" section.

<p>In the intro you changed one of my edits to this:</p>
<p>Christians typically believe in Jesus as the Son of God sent to provide salvation and reconciliation with God by atoning for the sins of humanity with his death on the cross.</p>
<p>in modern English I believe something along thes lines would be more succinct and appropriate, and would also describe Christian beliefs using common English as opposed to English only known locally in church circles. things such as believe in Jesus are ambiguous. What do you think about changing the above to something like this:&#160;?</p>
<p>Christians typically believe Jesus is the Son of God, and that he was sent by God to provide salvation from death and reconciliation with God by atoning for the sins of humanity by his death on the cross.</p>

<p>next time when you want to change the opening paragraph, would you discuss first in the talk page in order not to get into edit war again? As far as I remember there once was that suggestion to change the opening paragraph to put additional 'one of several names for' but there wasn't any consensus came out of that discussion. In my opinion, that suggestion cannot be justifed by NPOV argument. Otherwise every article regarding any object with more than one name should begin as you suggest when the other party is not happy with the name. What I meant by misleading is that when you begin the article with your opening sentence, the article is expected to be about the name of 'Dokdo' itself, not about the islets. It's confusing and the article becomes not well-written. Therefore the article should begin 'xxx is a group of islands...'. Considering articles like <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senkaku_islands.html" title="Senkaku islands">Senkaku islands</a> or <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kuril_islands.html" title="Kuril islands">Kuril islands</a> are putting the name of the status of quo in their opening paragraph and referring to the object with the name, I think the opening paragraph should be just like before you modified. <a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinnre_6885.html" title="User:Ginnre">Ginnre</a> 04:57, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually if you read the archives you'll see that this solution was proposed long ago with no objections. It had since stood for sometime before users with agendas changed it. This is a perfectly acceptable compromise and works flawlessly for other controversial articles such as <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a> and <a href="../../../e/r/e/Eretz_Yisrael_0fdc.html" title="Eretz Yisrael">Eretz Yisrael</a>.

<dd>Thanks for your reply. Yes I remember that suggestion, maybe it was from you. However, I was one of the guys who opposed the suggestion and as far as I remember there was no clear consensus for that suggestion. And as far as I know <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a> is the only article that has that kind of opening paragraph. Articles about disputed islands in WP don't begin that way. Again, putting 'one of several names' makes an article confusing, hence not well-written. The articles are about the islands, not about the names. <a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinnre_6885.html" title="User:Ginnre">Ginnre</a> 06:12, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why did you remove my edit of Christ's arrest, trial, and death? There is no evidence in scripture to say that Roman soldiers arrested Christ, whereas there is plentiful historical evidence to back the Jewish quasi-military explanation. Also, although Pilate says "I find no fault with this man' this not indicate that this was why he washed his hands.</p>

<dd>I never said they weren't involved. I merely said the source provided next to their listing under 'combatants' makes no such claim. It states merely that the US gives 'tacit approval' to Ethiopia's military support for the TFG and is this misrepresented in the article.
