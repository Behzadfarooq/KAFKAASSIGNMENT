<p>Aiden, as a point of fact, the paragraph has been revised several times since our compromise. My <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_56ae.html#Proposed_Revision" title="Talk:Jesus">proposed revision</a> is meant to clarify the paragraph while still imparting the same information. It still mentions the Nicene Creed, John 3:16 and Bible prophecy. Beyond that, JimWae raised (several times) the question of whether the paragraph accuractely represents Catholic Doctrine. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O.

<p>True, if one is predestined to receive salvation, one is also predestined to accept salvation. The point is that acceptance comes after salvation, not before. For some who hold to predestination, salvation comes before birth! The different kinds of Augustinian predestination get kind of complicated between different brands of Protestants, and from what I've heard Catholics invented limbo and purgatory to cover the spread. The Eastern (Orthodox) church has a separate doctrine of predestination, but I'm not familiar with the details. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O.

<p>You said, "No, predestination comes before acceptance. Acceptance comes before salvation." Yes, predestination comes first; but no, Lutherans and many other Protestants would argue that salvation comes before acceptance. We are only able to accept after God has granted salvation. It's a gift.&#160;;0) How do you accept a gift before it is given? It just doesn't make sense. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O.

<ol>
<li>While I personally believe that most Christians accept the Virgin Birth, JimWae contests this. If we're going to have this in the intro, we need some documentation beyond personal beliefs and church doctrine. CTSWyneken has said that he has some sources that may help.</li>
<li>I like your Alternative Salvation Sentences except for one thing: it's redundant to use both "Savior" and "salvation." A savior is by definition one who provides salvation.</li>
<li>We can document salvation on John 3:16, but it's an incomplete citation. We need more verses/passages. Again, I prefer John 3:1-21 to verse 16 alone. There are plenty of other verses in the gospels and epistles that help to define the Christian concept of salvation.</li>
</ol>

<p>1) "Because Jim contests something doesn't make it not a majority view." Yup, but if we are to counter-contest we need to <i>show</i> that it's a significant majority. Again it goes back to sources. CTSWyneken mentioned survey data that show that belief in the Virgin Birth is a significant majority of Christians. Now, we just need to find that survey data. 2) Glad you agree. 3) Hey, I'm lay and I still find relying on one verse to be incomplete! Just mentioning salvation is itself easy-to-understand information. Readers who want to know more details or appropriate Bible verses can simply click on the link. Please don't bring up the argument that not everyone clicks on links. If we go into Biblical support for doctrines of salvation, then we're talking about Christianity rather than the life of Christ, as KMH03 and others have already pointed out. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O.

<p>On John 3:16: There is some debate as to whether this is a quote by Jesus or commentary by John. What complicates things is that the original Greek does not have quotation marks, so translators have to decide for themselves whether it is quote or commentary. That said, I don't object to mentioning the verse per se, I'm just not sure that the intro is the appropriate place to mention the verse. There are other verses, and there are always footnotes.... <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O. La</a><sup><small><a href="../../../a/r/c/User_talk%7EArchola_c035.html" title="User talk:Archola"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></small></sup><a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_The_Centrist_Faction_48eb.html" title="User:Archola/The Centrist Faction"><font color="#404040">TCF</font></a> 06:03, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why is the verse being objected to? For some of us, it is because it is only one verse. I care not to speculate on what reasons other people may have&#160;;) Homestarmy and I have another solution: to quote him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If John 3:16 seems so limited to people, what about linking to the subheading under Salvation instead about the Christian view...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll also quote Storm Rider:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My contention all along has been that deleting John 3:16 as a reference in the intro paragraphs does not lessen the impact of statments and its inclusion creates problems for many groups. It is a wonderful verse, but it is an incomplete summary for many Christians.</p>

<p>For the introduction, I feel it's enough to say that Christian views are based on the New Testament, and interpretations of the NT such as the Nicene Creed. We can get into particular Bible verses (such as John 3:16, such also as the verses you were throwing at Storm Rider two months ago&#160;;) in the body of the article. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O.

<p>Nontrinitarian? I think JimWae has identified himself as a nonchristian. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O.

<p>I don't think anyone doubts the correctness of John 3:16. There are those who doubt whether the introduction is the appropriate place to bring it up, and there are others who prefer a whole-Bible approach to any one particular verse (including John 3:16). <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O.

<p>I'll do it later. Right now I think the contention is between you and JimWae. Most of the rest of us could live with either version.</p>
<p>JimWae's comments about the Trinty remind me of his earlier question as to whether God has a face and two hands. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Arch O.

<p>Oh yes, I could definitely use some help. I started the outline a month ago and SOPHIA was going to help, but all of a sudden she was chased away by sockpuppet allegations. Since she's been back, she's been working on other points; last I heard, she and Jim62sch were working on cleaning up the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Jesus_f6e4.html" title="Historical Jesus">Historical Jesus</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a> articles, based in part on Jim's translation of the German featured article.</p>
<p>I posted this as a subpage to <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> two weeks or so ago, but it's just now being noticed. I'm also not sure if it's complete. I just recently found and added Jehovah's Witness's views to the list. They believe Jesus is Michael?</p>
<p>BTW, whatever happened to the original <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Jesus_3975.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Jesus">Wikipedia:WikiProject Jesus</a>?

<p>Cool! AFAIK the wikiproject hasn't done much more than create the {{Jesus}} template. My outline started with that template and the structure of the Jesus article, and I built it up from there.</p>
<p>I don't remember Michael being mentioned in my conversations with Jehovah's witnesses, but that was a long time ago and only two brief conversations.</p>
<p>I couldn't find an article about what some call the skeptical view of Jesus, and what I call the philosophical view: that Jesus, while merely a man, was an ethicist ahead of his time.

<p>In general, I think that you really wanted to do an <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant-runoff_voting.html" title="Instant-runoff voting">instant runoff</a> (not that that's traditional for Wikipedia, but it would have certainly been closest to what I think you were trying to achieve). Beyond that, Wikipedia has generally done things by having a "by default do nothing" system. That is, you set up a single vote and if no majority is established, nothing is changed. This, for example, is the way AFD works.</p>
<p>I should really just give up and write a voting module for MediaWiki. It would be so easy to provide a selection of types of votes and a simple tool for injecting votes with something like &lt;poll title="Main page format" style="IRV" anon="true" start="2006-03-15" period="1 week"&gt; &lt;poll_option&gt; [[Main_Page|current format]] &lt;/poll_option&gt; &lt;poll_option&gt; [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Usability/Main Page|new format]]&lt;/poll_option&gt; &lt;/poll&gt;</p>

<dd>Aiden, you are seeing the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_unfulfilled_Christian_Prophecy_8c9f.html" title="Timeline of unfulfilled Christian Prophecy">Timeline of unfulfilled Christian Prophecy</a> rename vote as a vote between changing the page name and "either not changing it or changing it a little". Through that lens, you're not seeing the plethora of outcomes of the vote (for example, in a traditional runoff, some people may have opted to switch to the simpler change when their choice of larger change was removed). You are also ignoring the fact that people will tend to stick with the option that they choose, even when that means abandoning their original choice. Your assertion that voting in a runoff between B and C doesn't mean that I won't go back to A in a final runoff is not supported by any psycological model of voting that I'm aware of. Overall, you did rush the construction of the voting, and I think you made some mis-steps. I was trying to suggest that we all take a month or two off and come back in order to let you start over and have no question as to the consensus when you're done. I really think it's in your best interest, and the page name isn't going to kill anyone in the meanwhile. On the other hand, it does give all of us the chance to start contributing to the PAGE rather than the TITLE for a while, and that can only be good for Wikipedia! -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 13:08, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do you know what huddud is? Do you realise that every Muslim lives by the shariat, as much as is possible. It is the shariat that says you should not lie, steal, kill, hurt, etc. Imagine telling Christians that if they chose to live by their Morals they'd be chucked out. he could have said, if you want the <a href="../../../h/u/d/Hudud.html" title="Hudud">Hudud</a>, or some other clarification, but he didn't.. he attacked the "moral code" of all Muslims.

<dd>You brought up the poll, not me, but you are right, its content is not relevent. A man in his position should not tell Muslims who want to live within their religious boundries to leave their homeland. it was am intolerant disgrace. Also, you should not invent scaremongoring false statements. Also, hatred is a cycle, a vicious one, Hate leads to hate. when the hatred that manifested itself in the form of those Cartoons was returned by most Muslims, it came in the form of peaceful prtest, or no action at all. The embassies were attacked by a minority, but yes, all the hate is wrong. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 00:07, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>In comparative religion, universalism is the belief that true and valuable insights are available in many of the religious traditions which have grown up in various human cultures. It posits that a spiritually aware person will respect religious traditions other than his own and will be open to learning from them. It does not deny that immersion in one tradition is a useful anchor for an individual's spiritual development. While it celebrates the richness and value to be found among humankind's religious traditions, it does not necessarily deny that some things done in the name of religion, and some religious practices, are not constructive. But it distinguishes itself from the view that there is only one true faith, one uniquely chosen people, or one final prophet superseding all others.</i></dd>

<p>As we seem to be the ones ones who care about this phrase, and as it covers several pages, I post here:</p>
<p>v1) Like Y and Z, X is an Abrahamic religion. v2) X is considered an Abrahamic religion, along with Y and Z.</p>
<p>I prefer v1 because it's plainer language. X is an Abrahamic religion not just along with, as it happens, Y and Z, but for the same reason it is like them, historical descent. It avoids the ubiquitous "is considered", which isn't really necessary here, because the term "Abrahamic religion" is more or less defined by these three members. Whether the <i>genetic</i> descent from Abraham is real (as it isn't with most Christians) or whether Abraham would have preferred one to another isn't known and shouldn't matter.</p>

<p>Christianity is monotheism, of course, but I don't know if I want to jump into another firestorm, especially since that article is the center of the "cabal" allegations. I think what is happening is that people are confusing angels and demons with gods—but that is a very, very old problem. Don't even get me started with the veneration of saints: that's one of the areas in which Protestants diverge from the Catholic and Orthodoc views.</p>

<p>Saying that I censor talk pages is a very unpleasant accusation that does not improve the pleasure of contributing to this community project. I did explain in the edit summary why I removed the text. Also, you referred to Wikipedia policies, can you show me just one policy that states that anything that is dumped by anons at talk pages, even if unrelated to the edit proces, should remain there? <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 16:45, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Aiden: Thank you for your comments regarding Gidonb totally removing my contribution to the talkpage on Baruch Goldstein. I really appreciate your comments. Here is the message I just sent to Gidonb:</p>
<p>Dear Gidonb: I was rather dismayed to read your "reasons" for deleting my contribution to the talkpage on Baruch Goldstein. These you stated to be that they were my "personal opinion" and that they were irrelevant to the article on Baruch Goldstein.</p>
<p>However reading through one of your contributions to this very same talkpage you wrote "Goldstein was a terrorist". Since no Court of Law has found him guilty of being a terrorist, this is YOUR PERSONAL OPINION! In addition, if it is RELEVANT for you to make such a comment on the talkpage, it is NO LESS relevant for me to bring the counter view.</p>
<p>You also mention "Wikipedia policies". If you would study the "Key Policies of Wikipedia" you would see that one of them is "Respect other Contributors". However despite this you totally removed my contribution and when "Aiden" accused you of "censoring talk pages" you classed this as an "unpleasant accusation".</p>
<p>I consider my contribution to this talkpage no less relevant than your contributions and I am therefore restoring it. Simonschaim 08:30, 30 May 2006 (UTC) Simonschaim 08:47, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My belief is that Talk pages exist so user's can offer their views on a subject. Talk pages are not subject to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> or other article policies and there is no reason to remove another user's comments, save for vandalisim. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><font color="#077CD0"><b>Aiden</b></font></a> 14:04, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding the tags you added to this article. There is a very long list of references at the bottom of the page. In-line citations are not required on Wikipedia, though they can certainly be helpful. Speaking of helpful, you might like to consider making a request for in-line citations on the article's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:My_Lai_Massacre" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:My_Lai_Massacre" rel="nofollow">talk page</a> rather than tagging a subject that is so well-known as this, and for which the principle controversies concern the intentions of the parties involved and the apportioning of blame, not so much the incident itself. I suggest this because I can imagine these tags provoking an edit war - and that would be very unfortunate and counterproductive. I think it's better (particularly with subjects of a politically divisive nature) to discuss first, raise problems and try to resolve them, and if that fails, to tag and take it to the next step. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 15:43, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of the references listed in the <i>References</i> section, only three are actually cited in the article. The intro includes no citations, nor does the entire <i>Background</i> section. The <i>Massacre</i> section, comprising nine paragraphs, has only two references cited. Of the <i>Cover-up</i> section's five paragraphs, only one sentence, a quote, is cited. The remaining two sections, <i>Courts martial</i> and <i>Aftermath</i> have no citations. Throughout the article, there are many things claimed as fact, such as the "body count" mission evaluations, with absolutely no references to back up these claims. This systematic bias, unsourced as well, is flagrant in this article. In-line citations would be required at the end of nearly every sentence in the article. For these and other reasons I have disputed the neutrality and factual accuracy of the article, as well as cited lack of sources for the individual sections. Please see the Talk page of the article for further discussion. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><font color="#077CD0"><b>Aiden</b></font></a> 15:56, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
