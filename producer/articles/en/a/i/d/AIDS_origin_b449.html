<p><a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a> originated in non-human <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primates.html" title="Primates">primates</a> as far as is known.</p>
<p>Researchers announced in May 2006 that the HIV virus most likely originated in wild <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chimpanzee.html" title="Chimpanzee">chimpanzees</a> in the southeastern rain forests of <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cameroon.html" title="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> (modern <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Province_%28Cameroon%29_c256.html" title="East Province (Cameroon)">East Province</a>) rather than in <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinshasa.html" title="Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Republic_of_Congo_8cfe.html" title="Democratic Republic of Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (formerly Zaire), as had previously been believed. Seven years of research and 1,300 chimpanzee genetic samples led Dr. Beatrice Hahn of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Alabama%2C_Birmingham_2b5b.html" title="University of Alabama, Birmingham">University of Alabama, Birmingham</a>, to identify chimpanzee communities near Cameroon's <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanaga_River_a434.html" title="Sanaga River">Sanaga River</a> as the most likely originators. The researchers say that transference from chimp to human most likely occurred when a human was bitten by a chimp or was cut while butchering one, and the human became infected.<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-05-25-hiv-cameroon_x.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-05-25-hiv-cameroon_x.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Calculating based on a fixed mutation rate, the jump from chimpanzee to human likely occurred during the French colonial period (1919–1960). Comparative primatologist Jim Moore suggests that this may have been the result of colonial practices of forced labour, which could have suppressed the immune system of the initial hunter enough to allow the virus to infect and take hold. Likewise, forced immunisations (using one needle on many patients) may have sped the virus's spread through Cameroon and beyond.<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5450391" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5450391" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>A more controversial theory known as the <a href="../../../o/p/v/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis_8959.html" title="OPV AIDS hypothesis">OPV AIDS hypothesis</a> suggests that the AIDS epidemic was inadvertently started in the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgian_Congo_5c79.html" title="Belgian Congo">Belgian Congo</a> by <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilary_Koprowski_3cc7.html" title="Hilary Koprowski">Hilary Koprowski</a>'s 1950s research into a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polio.html" title="Polio">polio</a> <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine.html" title="Vaccine">vaccine</a> prepared from tissue cultures using locally captured non-human primates.<sup id="_ref-Curtis_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Curtis" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Hooper_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hooper" title="">[2]</a></sup> <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Hooper_896e.html" title="Edward Hooper">Edward Hooper</a> rejects the dates calculated using a fixed mutation rate on the basis that phylogenetic dating of "the most recombinogenic organisms known to medical science", immunodeficiency viruses, is "inherently incapable of making any allowance for recombination". <sup id="_ref-1930s_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1930s" title="">[3]</a></sup> However, in February 2000 one of the original developers of the polio vaccine, Philadelphia based <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wistar_Institute_4f01.html" title="Wistar Institute">Wistar Institute</a> found in its stores a phial of the original vaccine used in the vaccination program. It was analysed in April 2001 and no traces of either HIV-1 or <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simian_immunodeficiency_virus.html" title="Simian immunodeficiency virus">SIV</a> were found in the sample.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[4]</a></sup> A second analysis showed that only macaque monkey kindney cells,which cannot be infected with SIV or HIV, were used to produce the vaccine.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[5]</a></sup> While the analysis was done on only one phial of vaccine, most scientists have concluded that the polio vaccine theory of the origins of HIV is not possible.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Both species of the virus (HIV-1 and HIV-2) are believed to have originated in West-Central Africa and jumped species (<a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoonosis.html" title="Zoonosis">zoonosis</a>) from a non-human primate to humans. HIV-1 evolved from a <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simian_Immunodeficiency_Virus_9aff.html" title="Simian Immunodeficiency Virus">Simian Immunodeficiency Virus</a> (SIV<sub><small>cpz</small></sub>) found in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chimpanzee.html" title="Chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a> subspecies <i>Pan troglodytes troglodytes</i>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[7]</a></sup> DNA sequencing indicates that HIV-1 (group M) entered the human population in the early 20th century, probably sometime between 1915 and 1941.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[9]</a></sup> HIV-2 crossed species from a different strain of SIV, this one found in <a href="../../../s/o/o/Sooty_mangabey.html" title="Sooty mangabey">sooty mangabeys</a> (an <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_World_monkey_58fd.html" title="Old World monkey">Old World monkey</a>) of <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinea-Bissau_2d65.html" title="Guinea-Bissau">Guinea-Bissau</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>SIVs in non-human primates tend to cause non-fatal disease. Comparison of the gene sequence of SIV with HIV should therefore give us information about the factors necessary to cause disease in humans. The factors that determine the virulence of HIV as compared to most SIVs are only now being elucidated. Non-human SIVs contain a <i>nef</i> gene that down-regulates <a href="../../../c/d/3/CD3_6b88.html" title="CD3">CD3</a>, <a href="../../../c/d/4/CD4_f7b4.html" title="CD4">CD4</a>, and <a href="../../../m/h/c/MHC_class_I_5e1d.html" title="MHC class I">MHC class I</a> expression; most non-human SIV's therefore do not induce immunodeficiency; the HIV <i>nef</i> gene however has lost its ability to down-regulate CD3, which results in the immune activation and apoptosis that is characteristic of chronic HIV infection.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>One of the earliest documented HIV-1 infection dates from <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, and was discovered in the preserved blood sample of a man from Leopoldville, Belgian Congo (now <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinshasa.html" title="Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo_6e9c.html" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>).<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[12]</a></sup> However, it is unknown whether this anonymous person ever developed AIDS and died of its complications. The oldest documented case of the then-unknown syndrome was detected that same year, when a 25-year-old <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briton.html" title="Briton">British</a> <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailor.html" title="Sailor">sailor</a> who had traveled in the navy between <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> (but apparently not to Africa), sought help at the Royal Infirmary of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. He reported to have been suffering from puzzling symptoms, among them purplish <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skin_lesion.html" title="Skin lesion">skin lesions</a>, for nearly two years. His condition had taken a turn for worse during Christmas <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, when he started suffering from <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shortness_of_breath.html" title="Shortness of breath">shortness of breath</a>, extreme <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatigue_%28physical%29.html" title="Fatigue (physical)">fatigue</a>, rapid <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weight_loss.html" title="Weight loss">weight loss</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_sweats.html" title="Night sweats">night sweats</a> and high <a href="../../../f/e/v/Fever.html" title="Fever">fever</a>. The doctors thought he might be suffering from <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tuberculosis.html" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and, even though they found no evidence of bacterial infection, they treated him for tuberculosis just to be safe, to no avail. The sailor continued to weaken and he died shortly after in August 1959. His autopsy revealed evidence of two unusual infections, <a href="../../../c/y/t/Cytomegalovirus.html" title="Cytomegalovirus">cytomegalovirus</a> and <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumocystis_jiroveci_pneumonia.html" title="Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia"><i>Pneumocystis carinii</i> pneumonia</a> (PCP, renamed <i>Pneumocystis jiroveci</i> pneumonia), very rare at the time but now commonly associated with AIDS patients. His case had puzzled his doctors, who preserved tissue samples from him and for years retained some interest in solving the mystery. Sir Robert Platt, then president of the Royal College of Physicians, wrote in the sailor's hospital chart that he wondered <i>"if we are in for a new wave of virus disease now that the bacterial illnesses are so nearly conquered"</i>. It was only 31 years later, after the AIDS pandemic had become well-known and widespread, that they decided to perform HIV-tests on the preserved tissues of the sailor, which eventually turned out a positive result. The case was reported in the July 7, 1990 issue of the British medical journal <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lancet_6c53.html" title="The Lancet">The Lancet</a></i>; their claim was retracted in a letter in the January 20, 1996 issue where they admitted that the tissue sample was contaminated in the laboratory (Corbitt G, Bailey A, Williams G. <i>HIV infection in Manchester, 1959</i> . Lancet 1990; ii: 51.)<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[14]</a></sup> Another early case was probably detected that same year, 1959, in a 48-year-old <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haiti.html" title="Haiti">Haitian</a>, who 30 years before had immigrated to the United States and at the time was working as a shipping clerk for a garment manufacturer in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. He developed similar symptoms to those just described for the British sailor, and died the same year, apparently of the same very rare kind of pneumonia. Many years later, Dr. Gordon R. Hennigar, who had performed this man's autopsy, was asked whether he thought his patient had died of AIDS; he replied "<i>You bet</i>" and added "<i>It was so unusual at the time. Lord knows how many cases of AIDS have been autopsied that we didn't even know had AIDS. I think it's such a strong possibility that I've often thought about getting them to send me the tissue samples.</i>"<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, a 15-year-old <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a> male died at the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a> City Hospital from aggressive <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kaposi%27s_sarcoma.html" title="Kaposi's sarcoma">Kaposi's sarcoma</a>.

The doctors who worked on his case at the time suspected he was a prostitute, though the patient did not discuss his sexual history with them in detail.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>, a <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> sailor named <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvid_Noe_52c7.html" title="Arvid Noe">Arvid Noe</a>, his wife, and his nine-year-old daughter died of AIDS. The sailor had first presented symptoms in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, four years after he had spent time in ports along the West African coastline. Tissue samples from the sailor and his wife were tested in 1988 and found to contain the HIV-1 virus (Group O).<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[22]</a></sup> The next documented western death from AIDS was that of Dr. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grethe_Rask_0f37.html" title="Grethe Rask">Grethe Rask</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>. Rask, a <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Danish</a> surgeon, had worked in the Congo in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>It thus appears that either HIV existed in very low levels in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States</a> in periods prior to <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, or it may have gone <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extinct.html" title="Extinct">extinct</a> in the United States at times, with the present infection established in the USA about <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>. HIV in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> likewise was at first at levels too low to be noticed. In the United States and Africa HIV was at first mostly found only in residents of large cities. The infection is now more widespread in rural areas, and has appeared in regions such as <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, where it was previously not evident.</p>
<p>Author <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randy_Shilts_b3a4.html" title="Randy Shilts">Randy Shilts</a> mentioned that what was later called AIDS became evident in the <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> community in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_Island%2C_New_York_6eef.html" title="Fire Island, New York">Fire Island, New York</a> area in the four years after the 1976 Bicentennial celebrations. The infection tended to double in numbers about every nine to ten months. It therefore took a couple of years before a new disease was suspected because there were at first not enough symptomatic individuals to be noticed.</p>

<li id="_note-2"><b><a href="#_ref-2" title="">^</a></b> After the initial transfer of HIV from a non-human primate to humans, the virus ultimately spread via contact among humans to the rest of the world. Since a cross species jump is most likely the origin of HIV, and since HIV became a true epidemic, transmissible from human to human, then the following conditions were needed:
<ol>
<li>A large human population,</li>
<li>A large nearby population of the appropriate host animal,</li>
<li>An infectious pathogen in the host animal, that eventually produces a mutation that can spread from animal to human,</li>
<li>Interaction between the species to transmit enough of it to humans to establish a human foothold, which may take millions of individual exposures,</li>
<li>A mutation of same pathogen that can spread from human to human,</li>
<li>Some method that allows the pathogen to disperse widely. This prevents the infection from "burning out" by either killing off its human hosts or provoking immunity in a local population of humans.</li>
</ol>
Such requirements existed in the remote past with <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallpox.html" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a>, and also with the 20th century <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Flu_4751.html" title="Spanish Flu">Spanish Flu</a>, despite the latter's New World origin at Fort Riley, Kansas (there the animal reservoir seems to have been two species, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicken.html" title="Chicken">chickens</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pig.html" title="Pig">pigs</a>, which were of Old World origin.) Two species of <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a> infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more virulent and more easily transmitted. HIV-1 is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world, while HIV-2 is less easily transmitted and is largely confined to <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Africa_e6b4.html" title="West Africa">West Africa</a>.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socgenmicrobiol.org.uk/JGVDirect/18253/18253ft.htm http://www.socgenmicrobiol.org.uk/JGVDirect/18253/18253ft.htm]&lt;/li&gt;
