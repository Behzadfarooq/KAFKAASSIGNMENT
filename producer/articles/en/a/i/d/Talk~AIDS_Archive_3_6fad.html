<h2><span class="mw-headline">Polio vaccine theory</span></h2>
<p>I found a bit of inconsistency in the article. "History" section says&#160;: <i>"A common theory ... held that HIV came from Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), a virus virually identical to HIV, that causes AIDS-like symptoms in primates, and that this virus was transmitted to human populations in Africa during the course of controversial polio vaccine experiments on African villagers (<b>this theory has since been disproven</b>)"</i></p>
<p>"Current medical understanding of AIDS" says&#160;: <i>"HIV is closely related to viruses causing AIDS-like diseases in many primates, and is generally thought to have been transferred from animals to humans at some time during the early 20th century, though some evidence suggests it may have been transferred earlier in several isolated cases."</i></p>
<p>It goes on to suggest that this theory is still valid. So which is correct&#160;? Does the "animal to human" theory still stand&#160;? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay_ff70.html" title="User:Jay">Jay</a> 12:29, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's the polio vaccine theory which has been disproved. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 14:34, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>...but the confusion may stem from the fact that, and I'm a bit fuzzy on this part, it was chimpanzee livers (? kidneys? just cells?) that were used to culture the vaccine. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 15:05, Jun 18, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Kidneys - though chimps weren't used at all, according to the vaccine makers. The most recent proponent of the vaccine theory was Edward Hooper in <i>The River</i> - Hooper's comments and reviews from 1999-2000 are <a href="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/AIDS/River/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/AIDS/River/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and the more recent evidence against it is discussed <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/concerns/aids/poliovac-hiv-aids-qa.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/concerns/aids/poliovac-hiv-aids-qa.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/health/feeds/hscout/2004/04/21/hscout518504.html" class="external text" title="http://www.forbes.com/health/feeds/hscout/2004/04/21/hscout518504.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. But aside from questions about the mode of transmission, the basic animal-to-human theory is universally accepted - the genetic evidence is not in question (even, as far as I know, among people like Duesberg who attach no importance to HIV). --<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 17:28, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've not seen it written all in capitals for quite a while (at least here in Britain), but all references here are all in caps (and I just noticed <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> changed the reference from mixed case to all caps in <a href="../../../a/n/d/And_The_Band_Played_On_0055.html" title="And The Band Played On">another page</a>, which is what made me think of it). Do we have a standard on this; do we care? To me, it seems like a British English / American English issue, where both are acceptable and neither should be changed to the other, edit-war stylee.

<p>So far as I know the Aids form is only used by some of the British press (such as the Economist) who have a long-standing policy of rendering all acronyms like that. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 23:12, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One hopes that the downcasing mania proceeds no further or we shall be reading in the "nejm" about "hiv which causes aids" (or perhaps worse, "an hiv test"). Usage rather than logic dictates the use of capitals for abbreviations other than those standing for proper names, but noun forms (like AIDS) are usually uppercase, while adverbial forms (rpm, mpg) are usually lowercase. Long acronyms (NAFTA) tend to become lowercase (Nafta) as they are used more frequently, but I don't think AIDS is likely to do so because the use of capitalization makes clear that one is using the acronym rather than the everyday verb or noun "aids". -- <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 23:48, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not that all acronyms get lowercased (or <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a>'s worries of "downcasing mania"), it's that acronyms that are read as words (Nafta, Nato, Aids, Unesco) get rendered with an initial capital; ones that cannot (HIV, UN, EU, USA, NEJM) get rendered in all-caps. There's no danger of confusion with the dictionary word aids, as there is always an initial capital. Excessive use of capitals tends to be considered A Bad Thing(tm) — not least becaus ethey're more difficult to read. I'm not suggesting that we should standardise on mixed-case use, just that we shouldn't <b>enforce</b> standardisation on the all-caps form. — <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenBlacker_920f.html" title="User:OwenBlacker">OwenBlacker</a> 08:52, Jun 24, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well that may all be very logical but the fact is that everybody in the world except some British newspapers uses the AIDS form, and so does Wikipedia, so this article should conform to that. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 09:03, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

He claims "Smallpox was WAYYY more deadly than the Black Death". I can see this point of view, and I agree that the introduction of smallpox was probably far more influential in terms of long-term geopolitics, but I don't think the facts back up the specific claim.</p>
<ol>
<li>Although the Smallpox entry doesn't specify numbers (only percentages), the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandemic.html" title="Pandemic">pandemic</a> entry mentions Smallpox as a "local epidemic of extraordinary virulence", and the numbers in that paragraph add up to something like 2½ to 3 million, total. According to its entry, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_death.html" title="Black death">Black death</a> killed 25 million.</li>
<li>The sentence he modified is "These numbers have led some experts to call AIDS the deadliest pandemic in human history since <i>(something)</i>". Even if Smallpox was more deadly, this could still be untrue. Which experts have called it the deadliest pandemic since Smallpox?</li>
</ol>

<dd>The scientific basis of your statement is flat out, totally, completely, 100% wrong. Consensus is a positive - IE, theories that have <b>failed to be disproven</b> numerous times are said to be accepted as true and have 'scientific consensus'. In science, there is no such thing as "consensus against an idea" because by-default they are not accepted as true.

<dd>There's so many things wrong with that statement, I don't know where to begin. First, in science, NOTHING is ever "definitely proven". Only someone who knows nothing about science would ever make such a statement. As I already said above, scientific theories cannot be "proven", only disproven. "Correct" theories are theories that have withstood numerous and repeated attempts at falsification over a long period of time (think decades); however, no reputable scientist would ever say that they are "definitely proven" (just look at Newton's laws for a classic example).</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, saying that OPV theory has failed to be disproven is flat out wrong. 10 seconds of googling turned up the following choice quotes:
<dl>
<dd><i>The final nail is in the coffin for the now largely refuted theory that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) crossed into humans as a result of contamination of oral polio vaccine (OPV), according to a new study. In the April 22 Nature, Michael Worobey and colleagues report that the chimpanzees claimed to be the source of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) that crossed over actually contain a SIVcpz unrelated to HIV-1... Scientifically, this paper spells the end of the OPV theory,” said Edward Holmes, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study." --<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/news/20040421/02" class="external free" title="http://www.biomedcentral.com/news/20040421/02" rel="nofollow">http://www.biomedcentral.com/news/20040421/02</a></i></dd>
<dd><i>HIV is widely believed to have appeared when the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) jumped from a chimpanzee to a human, probably in West Africa in the early twentieth century. Exactly how the first human was infected is not known, but one theory that incited particularly vigorous debate has now been laid to rest. The theory claimed that HIV was inadvertently introduced during tests of a new oral polio vaccine (OPV), which was allegedly prepared using chimpanzee kidney cells and was administered to over a million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1958.</i> -- <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/fow/010426.html" class="external free" title="http://www.nature.com/nature/fow/010426.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nature.com/nature/fow/010426.html</a></dd>

<dd>When Nature magazine says a theory "laid to rest", it's dead. To say afterwards that such a theory is not supported by the scientific establishment is disingenius at best.

<dl>
<dd>"There have been claims that a small number of people have been infected with HIV from performing oral sex on an infected on an infected partner, but these claims are disputed in the scientific community and have yet to be proven conclusively."</dd>
</dl>
<p>That seems biased to me. There are many researchers who are convinced that HIV has been transmitted throgh oral sex. My understanding is that the documented cases of oral transmission are controversial only because they haven't been able to completely rule out the influence of mouth sores and unhealthy gums. (Personally, I think that's splitting hairs--oral transmission is oral transmission isn't it?) <a href="../../../u/r/a/User%7EUranographer_6078.html" title="User:Uranographer">Uranographer</a> 07:36, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I haven't kept up with the literature on this in recent years, but the last time I looked there was <i>no</i> undisputed case of oral transmission of HIV, and only a handful of even possible cases. Against that must be set the fact that it would be almost impossible to prove that oral transmission was the sole and undisputable cause of any case of HIV infection, because there are very few people who have oral sex as their <i>only</i> possible source of infection. I don't think there are "many" researchers who are "convinced" about oral transmission. I think most specialists accept that it is possible, but few believe it is at all common. The statement quoted is true as far as it goes, but it probably needs amplification. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 08:04, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, last time I did a literature search there was evidence for oral transmission that was compelling enough to get the cases published. I'm not saying they are entirely undisputed (although, if we want to split hairs I'm not sure there is much of anything in all of medical science that is universally undisputed) nor am I claiming I've done any kind of survey of AIDS researchers. But all the sources I've looked into (save for that Spanish study) seem to think there is enough of a risk that they suggest using protection for oral sex. For more info, check out the references at the end of the CDD's oral sex fact sheet (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/facts/oralsexqa.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/facts/oralsexqa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/facts/oralsexqa.htm</a>). <a href="../../../u/r/a/User%7EUranographer_6078.html" title="User:Uranographer">Uranographer</a> 04:19, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Concidering the fact that it is possible to contract HIV through the eyes (boyfriend's seminal fluid gets into the individual's eyes through bad timing etc and is absorbed through the blood vessels in the eyeball and passed into the blood stream), it should be possible to contract HIV through oral sex, whether through gum sores, small wounds, or any other form of entering the blood stream.. The argument isn't whether it's probable, the argument is whether it's possible, and thus it deserves it's place in the article.</dd>
<dd>Besides which, there will never be a consensus on anything in regards to HIV, especially when some 'scientists' still claim it's some sort of "gay plague". <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcuras_2416.html" title="User:Arcuras">Arcuras</a> 14:49, Oct 19, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's interesting, I had never even thought about the eye thing. Do you know of any documented cases?

<p>Recent edit by anon added: "<i>It is known that about one per cent of the White European population carries two genetic alleles that confer total immunity to HIV. Possession of one allele causes HIV to cause a less serious form of disease in that individual. This seems to indicate that in Europe thousands of years ago there was a virus or other pathogen that mimicked the entry method of HIV into human cells. This is another example of what is known as convergent evolution as HIV and this ancient pathogen could not have been closely related.</i>"</p>

<p>It was pretty well established (back in the 80's, I think) that about 1% of people did not get infected with HIV despite repeated exposure to the virus. All of these "immune" people had the described pair of mutated genes. However, researchers also discovered that a few HIV-infected people did have the mutated pair, so the so-called "immunity" is not complete. As for the rest of that statement, I think that old Eurpoean virus theory is entirely hypothetical.

<p>The sentences "Currently the most common ways to contract HIV are via unprotected sexual activity" appears scientifically incorrect (or at least confusing).

<p>As far as I know, teher is no single medical evidence that (leaving aside the other types of transmission as infected heroin needles, unsafe blood, etc.) sexual activity within a stable and mutually loyal relationship has ever resulted in an HIV infection.

<dd>Well folks, read from a different perspective then what I did, you're right. Protecting ones sexual life by having relations only within a monogamous relation with a seronegative partner is indeed also an answer to 'unprotected sex'. I justed wanted, one way or another, to add the information that condoms alone are not the best possible way to achieve safe sex. No scientist ever has pretended that just the use of condoms eliminates all risks (already because it is impossible that everybody uses condoms all the time when ncessary, and also exactly as they should be used. How should we formulate that, and the added information that a definitely monogamous relation with a seronegative partner is indeed also a very strong factor of protection? I made a try; everybody who can formulate it better, is free to irmprove it. --Rudi Dierick 14:32, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Politically charged paragraph</span></h2>
<p>The present wording: "Despite widely publicised fears about the possible "casual transmission" of HIV and AIDS, the risk of infection is virtually eliminated by following simple precautions, such as abstaining from sexual activity outside a definitely monogamous relation with a seronegative partner, and avoiding blood transfusions with unsafe blood." is wrong, inaccurate, bigoted and clearly holds a hidden agenda.</p>
<ol>
<li>Safe sex does not only refer to sex with condoms, but has a larger meaning that includes activities like non-penetrative sex. It is about as likely to cause AIDS as accidentally sharing blood from such mundane accidents as a paper cut or a broken glass. True, those are extremely unlikely, but they are possible. The exact same thing can be said of safe sex.</li>
<li>The present wording implicitly focuses of casual sex as immoral. The discussions on this Talk page reject the addition of the term "safe sex" in this paragraph under the pretext of different interpretations of what the term means. This is not what Wikipedia is for. Protected sex is mentioned only two paragraphs later in a different context.</li>
<li>No one chooses to be transfused contaminated blood. Being injected HIV is not something someone "avoids". In that regard, the present wording is extremely offensive. Without that remark, though, the paragraph no longer makes sense; it would be saying that one can only catch AIDS by being negligent or promiscuous, thus making people who got AIDS from transfusion one of those. The contributor seems to have added helpful advice on avoiding contaminated blood transfusions to cover up for this fluke.</li>
<li>The choice of the word "abstaining" is politically charged. The words "not having", or "avoiding" seem to have been rejected on purpose.</li>
<li>Even the title of the this Talk page's discussion "Gross negligence causing risk for human life?" is a poor rhetorical device meant to implicitly and immediately label those who oppose it as begin accomplices to murder. This is not encyclopaedic language, even for the Talk pages. It is about as manipulative as referring to "having an abortion" as "killing unborn babies".</li>
</ol>
<p>The text must at least say "as abstaining from <b>unprotected</b> sexual activity outside a definitely monogamous..." The people following this advice have their risk of contamination as "virtually eliminated" as those who follow the original statement's advice. And it will carry less of the huge political charge.</p>

<p>It's disappointing to see a neutral article go downhill and get taken over like this. The new lead section is particularly bad ("AIDS is defined as beginning when..."). The lead section doesn't even bother to mention one important point: AIDS is a disease. I don't pretend that I'm an expert on this subject, but it appears that sci guy is trying to downplay the importance of HAART, spread fear, uncertainty and doubt about its side effects, and downplay the overwhelming evidence for a connection between HIV and AIDS. A huge amount of information has been removed; the rewritten paragraphs are awkwardly written ("There is good evidence that if..."). I can't think of a good explanation for the removal of the entire "prevention" section.

<dd>I began the article with the current definition of AIDS, and cited the reference and included an external link. Since 1993 two thirds of AIDS cases in the United States are based on CD4 cell count below 200. These people are healthy, and have no opportunistic infections. I have reported that the WHO and CDC have progreesively changed treatment recommedations to defer HAART in people without symptoms and CD4 above 200. I have cited the reference and provided external links. The reasons for this change by WHO and CDC are clear. Drug toxicity has proved to be higher than expected and progression to AIDS in untreated controls was slowed than expected. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 01:12, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The CDC 1993 definition has expanded AIDS from a small group of people with rare opportunisitc infections to all people with a CD4 cell count below 200. This has trippled the number of cases in the US - but these extra cases are not progressing in the same way as <i>pre 1993 AIDS</i>.</p>

<p>The idea of <i>opportunitistic infections</i> is probably outdated. It was originally based on the idea that PCP and KS were markers of immune deficiency (because they were previously seen mainly in patients on immuno suppressive therapy). Now that PCP and KS have been better studied, it is realised that these diseases are the result of recent infection. The organisms causing PCP and KS are '<i>not</i> common in healthy people originally thought.</p>

<p>Where the Bangui definition *is* raised constantly is in stuff by groups like ACT UP San Francisco. That doesn't mean it's wrong. What it does mean is it's coming from the AIDS reappraisal crowd, who are well outside the overwhelming majority of medical opinion on issues relating to AIDS.</p>

<dd>The "Bangui definition" was developed by CDC and WHO in 1985, so it is part of the <i>scientific consesus</i>. It remains the basis for diagnosis where antibodies tests are not available - which is most of the world. The AIDS reappraisal group has consistently objected to the continued use of the "Bangui definition" because many of the people diagnoses with AIDS by this definiiton test are not infected with HIV.

<dd>That may be true. But what I'm trying to establish is that the Bangui definition <i>remains</i> the process by which the estimates of AIDS prevalence are made. Now. Not in 1985. Not in 1995. Now. If you can show me evidence (point me with some precision to one or two references, preferably in the peer-reviewed literature or from one of the big government AIDS organizations) that suggest that <i>current</i> AIDS statistics contain a bunch of people without HIV, then I might be convinced you have something of more than historical interest. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 22:50, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Explanatory note about UNAIDS/WHO estimates</span></h2>
<p>The UNAIDS/WHO estimates are based on the most recent available data on the spread of HIV in countries around the world. They are provisional. UNAIDS and WHO, together with experts from national AIDS programmes and research institutions, regularly review and update the estimates as improved knowledge about the epidemic becomes available, while also drawing on advances made in the methods for deriving estimates. Because of these and future advances, the current estimates cannot be compared directly with estimates from previous years, nor with those that may be published subsequently. <a href="http://www.unaids.org/wad2004/EPIupdate2004_html_en/epi04_00_en.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.unaids.org/wad2004/EPIupdate2004_html_en/epi04_00_en.htm" rel="nofollow">source</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 01:12, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In countries with generalized epidemics, estimates of HIV prevalence have primarily been based on blood samples left over from syphilis tests of pregnant women in antenatal clinics (or <i>sentinel surveillance</i>). Until very recently, these have provided the best available estimates of HIV prevalence in the population.</dd>
<dd>Surveillance systems often select clinics located in urban or peri-urban areas, both for ease of access and because those clinics serve a larger number of pregnant women and can yield sufficient sample sizes during data collection. Often this leads to few data being available from pregnant women in rural areas. This bias can be corrected, but it introduces a further layer of uncertainty (the extent of the differences between HIV prevalence levels in urban and in rural areas).</dd>
<dd>There is no gold standard for HIV surveillance.

<dd>It is true that many people besides Wangari Muta Maathai have made the claim that AIDS is a man-made disease. So what? That doesn't make the claim correct, or even reasonable.

<dd>Uther and Carl have already explained why the link was removed; one might also note that User:Wingover has done nothing but spam his conspiracy theory blog, and that the news story contained within the link in question was a verbatim copy of a News24.com article. (I'll go out on a limb and say Wingover probably doesn't have permission to duplicate the article.) As already stated, the link is only tangentially related; Wangari's comments are already documented at <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_conspiracy_theories_4054.html" title="AIDS conspiracy theories">AIDS conspiracy theories</a>. As for why Wangari's "theory" is not mentioned at <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">AIDS reappraisal</a>, one reason is that Wangari is not claiming something other than HIV causes AIDS, but rather that HIV is a synthetic bioweapon. (In other words, she's arguing the conceptual origin rather than the cause.) While these connspiracy theories (which have <i>no</i> scientific basis) <i>could</i> be summarized in the main AIDS article, care would need to be taken not to present any as being more than extreme fringe views. Linking to a random blog of tinfoil hattery is, IMO, not the best way to present these "alternative" POVs.

<dd>I know you're done with discussing the link itself, but because you mentioned me by name as having removed it without comment (with the later implication of lacking manners[!]), I thought I should make a statement for the record—belated as it was—rather than say nothing. I'm sorry if I've overstated these points in doing so. On the subject of tinfoil hattery, I'm not aware of any threshold of popularity beyond which a baseless and paranoid hypothesis becomes something different. To clarify, I meant the word "tinfoil hat(tery)" in its common (online) sense as a byword for <i>paranoia</i> (also in the popular culture sense), which is a requisite part of a conspiracy theory. Anyway, if you know the who/what/when/where/why of AIDS conspiracy theories and think these views need greater representation, by all means include them. (A less diplomatic person might boil this down to "so fix it!", but I mean no derision by it.) Personally I wouldn't feel comfortable enough with the material to make your proposed changes.

(By the way, it was the people who removed the link without comment <i>after</i> I'd posted my remarks here whom I thought guilty of poor Wikiquette, so you're in the clear...). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 13:02, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suggest that someone write an "AIDS Conspiracy Theories" article, and link to that article from within the body of the main AIDS article. Such an article would be the appropriate place for links to sites such as the one we are debating. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_Henderson_841b.html" title="User:Carl Henderson">Carl Henderson</a> 06:49, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But there <i>is</i> such an article (see above); that's not the issue (as I thought that my comment made clear). Additionally, it's hard to see why the notion that AIDS is a punishment from god should be called a conspiracy (I can think of a lot of other words for it, but 'conspiracy' isn't one of them). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:16, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that external links to blogs are to be avoided. Also there is no need to include every sensational newspaper headline about AIDS. But is the real issue here whether there is a place in this article for the voice of African women? AIDS has now been redefined from a disease of 25 affluent, promiscous, drug using, American men to a disease of 25 million Africans with limited access to western medicine, food or clean water. The estimate of 25 million is based entirely on blood tests on pregnant African women. I think we are misisng the point. Wangari Muta Maathai has questioned the idea that HIV came for monkeys. This is actually an unreferenced statement in the article - but my recollection is that this idea is based on evidence from frozen remains of one dead laboratory animal. We cannot dispute the claim by Wangari Muta Maathai that HIV is manufactured in laboraties, because this manufactured HIV is the basis for all antibody tests. Also as HIV has never been isolated from a patient (or a monkey) she is perfectly correct in stating the scientific facts, which are well within her area of expertise for which she was awarded the Nobel prize. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 15:04, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">rumors</span></h2>
<p>i have heard rumors of a possible cure, a vacccine based on the patients DNA and the ciruses DNA, works on a one to one basis only, but i was wondering if anyone can confirm this or disproove it... whichecver.</p>
<p>the other riumor for a cure is based on monkey DNA. can anyone confirm or disproove this as well?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Liver Failure as Leading US Cause of Death?</span></h2>
<p>From paragraph 2, under "AIDS epidemic": "In the United States, the most common cause of death for people with AIDS is liver failure caused by antiretroviral drugs" This sounds highly suspicious to me. Does anyone know of any scientific study that backs up this claim? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_Henderson_841b.html" title="User:Carl Henderson">Carl Henderson</a> 17:26, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've been unable to find any confirmation for the "liver failure as leading US cause of AIDS deaths" claim. I'm deleting it. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_Henderson_841b.html" title="User:Carl Henderson">Carl Henderson</a> 18:40, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
