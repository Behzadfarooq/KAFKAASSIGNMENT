	    <p>Verse of the Day<br />
<br /></p>
<ol>
<li>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in the heavenly realms. —<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Ephesians_54bf.html" title="Epistle to the Ephesians">Epistle to the Ephesians</a> 6:12<br />
<br /></li>
<li>You have heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy." But what I tell you is this: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you; only so can you be children of your Father in Heaven, who makes His sun shine on good and bad alike, and sends His rain on the honest and the dishonest. For if you love only those who love you, what reward can you expect? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what is there extraordinary about that? Even the heathen do as much. There must be no limit to your goodness, just as your heavenly Father’s goodness knows no bounds. —<a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Matthew</a> 5:43-48<br />
<br /></li>
<li>If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gospel_of_John_ec86.html" title="The Gospel of John">The Gospel of John</a> 15:7-8<br />
<br /></li>
<li>For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. —<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Romans_ce93.html" title="Epistle to the Romans">Epistle to the Romans</a> 6:23<br />
<br /></li>
<li>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the satisfaction for our sins. —<a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_of_John_f8a5.html" title="First Epistle of John">First Epistle of John</a> 4:10<br />
<br /></li>
<li>This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gospel_of_John_ec86.html" title="The Gospel of John">The Gospel of John</a> 15:12-13<br />
<br /></li>
<li>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. And though I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. —<a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians_a231.html" title="First Epistle to the Corinthians">First Epistle to the Corinthians</a> 13:1-3<br />
<br /></li>
<li>Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gospel_of_Luke_3f57.html" title="The Gospel of Luke">The Gospel of Luke</a> 6:37<br />
<br /></li>
<li>You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." But what I tell you is this: Do not set yourself against the man who wrongs you. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. If a man wants to sue you for your shirt, let him have your coat as well. If a man in authority makes you go one mile, go with him two. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gospel_of_Matthew_f4e0.html" title="The Gospel of Matthew">The Gospel of Matthew</a> 5:38-42<br />
<br /></li>
<li>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that you may have life, and have it more abundantly. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gospel_of_John_ec86.html" title="The Gospel of John">The Gospel of John</a> 10:10<br />
<br /></li>
<li>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gospel_of_John_ec86.html" title="The Gospel of John">The Gospel of John</a> 1:1&amp;14<br />
<br /></li>
<li>For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound unto the many. —<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Romans_ce93.html" title="Epistle to the Romans">Epistle to the Romans</a> 5:15<br />
<br /></li>
<li>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gospel_of_John_ec86.html" title="The Gospel of John">The Gospel of John</a> 3:16<br />
<br /></li>
<li>Let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth. —<a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_of_John_f8a5.html" title="First Epistle of John">First Epistle of John</a> 3:18<br />
<br /></li>
<li>As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. "Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men." At once they left their nets and followed him. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gospel_of_Mark_d33a.html" title="The Gospel of Mark">The Gospel of Mark</a> 1:16-18<br />
<br /></li>
<li>When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am God Almighty; walk before me and be blameless." —<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Genesis_35b0.html" title="Book of Genesis">The Book of Genesis</a> 17:1<br />
<br /></li>
<li>Do not let the sun go down on your wrath, nor give place to the devil. Let him who stole steal no longer, but rather let him labor, working with his hands what is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need. Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice. And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you. —<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Ephesians_54bf.html" title="Epistle to the Ephesians">Epistle to the Ephesians</a> 4:26-32<br />
<br /></li>
<li>But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed. —<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Isaiah_06a3.html" title="Book of Isaiah">The Book of Isaiah</a> 53:5<br />
<br /></li>
<li>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich. —<a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians_36a1.html" title="Second Epistle to the Corinthians">Second Epistle to the Corinthians</a> 8:9<br />
<br /></li>
<li>For all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God, being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus. —<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Romans_ce93.html" title="Epistle to the Romans">Epistle to the Romans</a> 3:23-24<br />
<br /></li>
<li>For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. —<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Ephesians_54bf.html" title="Epistle to the Ephesians">Epistle to the Ephesians</a> 2:8-9<br />
<br /></li>
<li>But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life. —<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_Titus_f38a.html" title="Epistle to Titus">Epistle to Titus</a> 3:4-7<br />
<br /></li>
<li>Therefore "If your enemy is hungry, feed him; If he is thirsty, give him a drink; For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head." Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. —<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Romans_ce93.html" title="Epistle to the Romans">Epistle to the Romans</a> 12:20-21<br />
<br /></li>
<li>But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. —<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Romans_ce93.html" title="Epistle to the Romans">Epistle to the Romans</a> 5:8<br />
<br /></li>
<li>You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gospel_of_Matthew_f4e0.html" title="The Gospel of Matthew">The Gospel of Matthew</a> 5:14-16<br />
<br /></li>
<li>Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight. —<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Proverbs_830a.html" title="Book of Proverbs">The Book of Proverbs</a> 3:3,5-6<br />
<br /></li>
<li>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. —<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_Galatians_45f5.html" title="Epistle to Galatians">Epistle to Galatians</a> 3:28<br />
<br /></li>
<li>And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God. —<a href="../../../m/i/c/Micah.html" title="Micah">Micah</a> 6:8<br />
<br /></li>
<li>There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death. —<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Romans_ce93.html" title="Epistle to the Romans">Epistle to the Romans</a> 8:1-2<br />
<br /></li>
<li>Then one of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?" Jesus said to him, "‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like unto it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' —<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gospel_of_Matthew_f4e0.html" title="The Gospel of Matthew">The Gospel of Matthew</a> 22:35-39<br />
<br /></li>
<li>Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things. —<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Philippians_f81f.html" title="Epistle to the Philippians">Epistle to the Philippians</a> 4:8<br />
<br /></li>
