<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/d/Talk%7EAIDS_NPOV_dispute_24d5.html" title="Edit section: NPOV Dispute">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">NPOV Dispute</span></h2>
<p>I am very concerned about the way this article tilts away from what I understand the scientific consensus to be. Specific areas of concerns include:</p>
<dl>
<dd>An estimated 60% of people with AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa, where poor economic conditions leading to the use of dirty needles in healthcare clinics and no effective screening of blood transfusions may contribute to high rates of AIDS.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The clear implication is that this is the primary source of the high infection rates, a claim further amplified in this sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Health clinics in some countries are responsible for as much as 30% of HIV transmission worldwide. reference <a href="http://tokyo.usembassy.gov/e/p/tp-20030804b1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://tokyo.usembassy.gov/e/p/tp-20030804b1.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> There is an urgent need to address medical transmission as a priority in these countries. see HIV transmission in the medical setting <a href="http://www.eldis.org/static/DOC11661.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eldis.org/static/DOC11661.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Firstly, the source of the 30% figure is based on a quote from a researcher, Yvan Hutin, in a US State Department press release. The relevant paragraph is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hutin told the lawmakers that WHO estimates that approximately 2.5% of all HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa are transmitted through unsafe healthcare injections but warned that his research of several "relatively reliable" HIV studies has revealed that medical transmission could actually be three to fifteen times higher than the conservative WHO figure.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To go from that, from a popular press source, to the phraseology currently in the article is inappropriate.</p>
<p>The second link goes to a report by a group called "Physicians for Human Rights", which argues for a higher priority to be given to medical transmission. I haven't had time to assess this report. I haven't heard of this group myself and have no idea of its credibility (one way or another; it's just that some organisations have established a reputation for getting it right over the years, and I don't know if this one has), and b) just because a report is clearly-written and has references doesn't make it credible. I've seen clearly-written, referenced reports by advocacy organizations where the references didn't actually support the article.</p>
<p>The article barely mentions the scientific near-consensus that the majority of cases in sub-Saharan Africa are transmitted through heterosexual sex!</p>
<p>Additionally, the article still talks about the "Bangui definition". My earlier concerns, noted earlier on this talk page, have still not been effectively addressed. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 07:09, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I will try and see if I can get a copy of this paper to have a look. However, I'm pretty skeptical. In effect, this paper claims that something other than HIV is causing AIDS. This is an absolutely sensational conclusion; if there was anything to it, it should have attracted a bunch of followup by now. However, that study that has not been cited by any *other* papers in PubMedSci. Just because *one*, seemingly "orphaned", paper says something is not evidence that the scientific consensus is that the paper is correct (or, more to the point, the conclusions you've drawn from it are the current scientific consensus).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are many other simliar studies, which I am happy to source and add.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please do so, particularly including survey articles, articles published in the top-end journals, or reports detailing the consensus views of policy-advising bodies like the CDC, WHO, or equivalent.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you can find any evidence of HIV testing in diagnosis of AIDS in Africa and other "developing" countries please provide it. My understanding is that few countries diagnose AIDS as thoroughly as the US - although I have read that most of the AIDS patients in Africa would not test as HIV positve in Australia, even many US and Eurpoean AIDS patients would not be considered HIV positive. This is because Australia requires more Western blot spots than any other country. The more stringent standard was required because so many Australians who tested negative on ELISA were postive on Western blot!</p>
<p>I am concerned that you think by adding information from WHO, CDC and UNAIDS, that neutral point of view is threatened!

<p>I have just added link to CDC January 2005 update stating that "According to the World Health Organization, the global burden of disease from unsafe injections worldwide accounts for an estimated 5% of HIV infections." <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/gap/pa_prevention.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/gap/pa_prevention.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> This is recognised as a major current issue by the so called "mainstream scientific consesus" <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 16:23, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's interesting. I'd like to know where the WHO said it. That's still a very long way from 30%.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For a fuller analysis I suggest you read <b>HIV infections in sub-Sahara Africa not explained by sexual or vertical transmission</b> <a href="http://www.africaaction.org/docs02/hiv0210t.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.africaaction.org/docs02/hiv0210t.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 16:27, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I just did. The article summary suggests that the current medical consensus is that heterosexual sex is to blame for the majority of infections; the authors dispute that consensus. What I am suggesting to you is that the consensus hasn't changed; the fact that there is scientific disagreement on the topic is worthy of discussion in the article, but implying that majority medical/scientific opinion is of the view that medical transmission is responsible for more than a fraction of AIDS cases is incorrect. ---<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 04:43, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest you read it again. There is no scientific disagreement. The 1983 "consensus" was a political decison based on the available evidence. After twenty years of collecting data from Africa, the facts no longer support the earlier ideas. This is happening all the time in AIDS research. New facts result in changes to the hypothesis. It is called the scientific method. 203.123.69.214 02:56, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is important to note that in 2001 the issue of preventing HIV/AIDS infections in health care settings has been identified by the United Nations as needing immediate attention. <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/aids/coverage/FinalDeclarationHIVAIDS.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.un.org/ga/aids/coverage/FinalDeclarationHIVAIDS.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

<p>I hope this quote helps you see the diffculties with the WHO simplified algorithms based on sequential screening tests, and in general confirm the lack of laboratory testing on AIDS diagnosis in many countries. The conclusion is essentially that most of the AIDS cases would not be confirmed by standard testing in France. (or any other Western country) <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 04:29, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The lack of expensive equipment and well-trained laboratory technicians in developing countries makes it difficult to use standard methods (2 EIA confirmed by western blotting) to diagnose HIV infection. This led the WHO to develop simplified algorithms based on sequential screening tests, with no confirmation by immunoblotting. These algorithms were tested in the normal diagnosis conditions of a medical unit in Maputo, Mozambique. We tested 402 sera, collected with the consent of the patients concerned. The sera were first tested for HIV according to French regulations (2 EIA with western blot if at least one EIA was positive). This strategy identified 53 sera as positive for HIV1 and 1 serum as positive for HIV2. We then tested who algorithms, one for a predicted rate of prevalence &lt; 10% and the other for a predicted rate of prevalence &gt; 10%. Neither algorithm performed adequately for diagnostic purposes. Further evaluation with a panel of local sera is required to select the most suitable algorithm in terms of specificity and sensitivity, and algorithms should be throughly tested before inclusion in national AIDS control strategies. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=10377498&amp;query_hl=2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=10377498&amp;query_hl=2" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></dd>

<p>Well at present we are having a discussion about whether WHO/CDC/UNAIDS information is breaching the NPOV! But apart from that the article is essentially the same as when you last edited. Vaccine has been moved to treatment. Duplicated material has been consoidated and many unreferenced speculations deleted. I have been attempting to restore all the deleted references.

<p>What's happened is that Sci guy has butchered what was a very complete and well-written Wikipedia article. Take a look at his 27 May 2005 edits, if you don't believe me. I've got no idea what his motive is. I'm tempted to take him up on his "feel free to add anything you think has been deleted in error" offer and revert the whole thing back to the 26 May 2005 version. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarl_Henderson_841b.html" title="User:Carl Henderson">Carl Henderson</a> 02:56, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have compared the 26 May 2005 version with the currect one. Main changes are correcting monkey to chimpanzee and adding references. The safer sex was edited to make the main issue clear: "put a condon on the penis to stop AIDS". Ideas about AIDS have changed so much in 20 years. Should this article be about gay men and IV drug users in the United States or pregnant women and children in Africa? Should Africans be given antiretroviral drugs or blood transfusions that have been screened for HIV? Why do different countries use different tests (or even no tests) to diagnose AIDS? What percentage of AIDS cases in the "developing world" would be confirmed by testing this the United States? As most people in the world dianosed with AIDS do not have HIV antibodies, what is causing their AIDS? All of these questions are part of the UNAIDS, WHO, CDC, and RED Cross "medical consensus".</p>

<dd><i>"How the crisis confronting Africa is defined, and by whom, will make a fundamental difference to the outcome. HIV is an exceptional disease which, in HIV prevalence countries, has a unique capacity to derail development progress. However, a line must be drawn between treating HIV as an exceptional disease (exceptionalism) and paying attention only to HIV at the expense of other diseases (isolationism) or development issues. The AIDS epidemic should be understood as part of the wider crisis of underdevelopment."</i>

<p>According to the WHO the cumulative number of AIDS cases from 1980 through 1997 for all of Africa was 620,000. For comparison, the cumulative total of AIDS cases in the USA through 1997 was 641,087. But the US cases were all tested for HIV antibodies and confirmed with Western blot! The African cases were not all tested for HIV. A study on Zaire published in 1993 found that of 465 patients with clinical signs of AIDS, 39.4% were seropositive. see Epidemiology and clinical manifestation of HIV infection in northern Zaire.

<p>This page has unfortunately been infected by one of the types that Wikipedia finds most-difficult to deal with; the well-informed zealot. Essentially, Sci Guy and his ilk are very vocal, well-informed advocates for a view well outside the medical mainstream. That doesn't make them wrong, but it does mean that they have turned this article into advocacy for their position. I'm not an expert on AIDS, but I do know that the article is pushing a very different line to the WHO and the like, and that Sci Guy is consistently misrepresenting the state of the scientific consensus. Hence, in the absence of either the expertise or the patience, I'm reverting to what appears to be one of the last "known-good" versions. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 04:41, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

As a researcher in a different field, I can quote all manner of studies to "prove" things that are way outside the consensus of it, which is exactly what you're doing. I invite others to compare the way the article ended up through your edits, compared to the version I'm reverting to. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 15:54, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you Whig! I have a completely open mind on where this article is going. There have been so many changes of direction in AIDS, that next year could bring anything. After the false starts of AZT, HAART and chemokines, I am reluctant to expect much of the new treatment vaccine, but the results are intersting enough to include in the article. My main interest has been to attempt to reference the article and bring it up to date. Also editing was required to remove material that was repeated within the article. The removal of material referenced from source like WHO, CDC, UNAIDS and National Institutes of Health and National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease is of concern to me. I would prefer to discuss how we can better summarise the facts, rather than discard the facts. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 15:51, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Quite frankly, I agree with Robert's assment of the situation, that Sci Guy seems to be pushing his particular brand of POV. I'm not expert on the topic of AIDS, but even I can recognize that what he's saying is at odds with the consensus of the scientific community. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 19:17, May 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure Wikipedia's encyclopedia article on AIDS should be written by someone who can characterize HAART as a "false start" - it's still current treatment, or who believes that chemokines were ever a "start" of any kind - they never had any significant clinical use. All opinions aren't equal, and the denialists are already more than adequately represented in that article: it doesn't have to be brought here, where it degrades the quality of the article. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 00:23, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really think there are more constructive ways to resolve things than revert warring. Rather than agreeing or disagreeing with Robert or Sci Guy, let's discuss here what changes the article needs to make it conform to <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. The mainstream scientific viewpoint is not universally held, but minority views should not be given precedence. The solution is not to state viewpoints as facts, but to attribute statements with appropriate citations. While Wikipedia encourages us to <b>be bold</b> I think that it would be best here for changes to be made in small steps with explanations given in this Talk section to back them up. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 00:33, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Newton's "law" of gravitation was actually a (very good) theory, and was replaced by Einstein's general relativity, which in turn does not reconcile with certain observations of quantum mechanics. Biological science (and consequently medicine) also evolves over time. We don't have final answers on the causes of many diseases and disorders, from multiple sclerosis to cancer to AIDS. We have inferences and treatment modalities based upon the best scientific research available, and we apply them and study whether they cure or treat the underlying condition or the symptoms. We do not have a cure for AIDS yet, so nobody can claim to have a full understanding of the cause or causes. We do have a generally accepted theory that HIV causes AIDS, and it is the basis of almost all current research. The article should represent exactly this, and the minority who disagree should not be given precedence. I've said this before. But the objections that some people seem to be making are that we ought to state the prevalent theory as <i>fact</i> and denounce the <i>possibility</i> of error.

<p><i>We do have a generally accepted theory that HIV causes AIDS, and it is the basis of almost all current research. The article should represent exactly this, and the minority who disagree should not be given precedence.</i> - Ok, let's take this idea and run with it. Let us compare the opening paragraph's of Sci-guy's version and Robert Merkel's version as they pertain to HIV:</p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>Robert Merkel's version: <b>AIDS</b> (<b>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome</b> or <b>Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome</b>, sometimes written <b>Aids</b>) is a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disease.html" title="Disease">disease</a> characterized by progressive destruction of the body's <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immune_system.html" title="Immune system">immune system</a>, thus destroying the body's ability to fight infection and certain cancers. It is widely accepted that AIDS results from infection with <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a> (Human Immunodeficiency Virus).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sci-Guy's version: <b>AIDS</b> (<b>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome</b> or <b>Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome</b>, sometimes written <b>Aids</b>) is a global, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> epidemic...These global estimates of AIDS are based on HIV antibody testing of small samples of pregnant women at selected clinics rather than actual reported AIDS cases.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Which one of these more accurately represents the generally held view that HIV causes AIDs? I think the answer is quite obvious - Sci guy's version is an obvious attempt to distance any connection between HIV and AIDs, and this attempt sticks out like a sore thumb. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 08:01, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you consider it a "generally held view" why declare it as a fact, instead? Why claim a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concensus.html" title="Concensus">concensus</a> when the questions of well-qualified scientists, well-documented in Wikipedia despite efforts to exclude their work, must be excluded from the notion of concensus for the notion to have merit? Sandlawould 20:45, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the first paragraph comparison, Robert Merkel's version is better, if we have to choose between one or the other. Fortunately we aren't forced to make these sorts of binary decisions on Wikipedia, we can work to edit things continually to a better state. I'd take a pass at proposing a revision, but it's way past time I went to bed for tonight. Maybe tomorrow.&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 08:23, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)My god is this old chestnut still being argued about? Oh I forgot, there are quite a few paranoid flat earthers out there.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree that getting the first paragraph right is a good start. It defines the scope of the article.</p>
<p>In 2005, the main issue is the global epidemic claims of WHO and UNAIDS. I assume we agree that WHO and UNAIDS are part of the <i>consesus</i>. I think reporting the range of these estimates is important to give a clear idea of the accuracy claimed for these estimates. Also the 60% in sub-Saharan Africa, as this is claimed to be the most affected area (and also the source of the epidemic, if we accept the chimapanzee theory).</p>
<p>It is also important to note that while screening of blood transfusions and using clean needles for each injection were adopted 20 years ago in the United States to "stop the spread of AIDS", these precautions have not been widely adopted in Africa. Back in 2001, the UN called for the adoption of these measures to stop the spread of AIDS in Africa. So once again this all appears very <i>consesus</i> to me.</p>
<p>Whether or not HIV causes AIDS is <i>red herring</i>. The fact is that since 1985 evidence of HIV antibodies has been required in the United States for an AIDS diagnosis and the WHO/UNAIDS estimates for Africa are based on HIV antibody testing of pregnant women, who had a blood test for syphilis. So by definition there is no AIDS without HIV.</p>
<p>The more difficult question is the thousands of US blood donors and army recruits who have tested positive in HIV antibody tests. In most cases the repeat test was negative or the western blot did not confirm. What caused all these <i>false positive</i> results.</p>
<p>I notice that "HIV carriers" is now the preferred term in RA Weis and RW Wrangham. From Pan to pandemic (<a href="http://faculty.virginia.edu/bio202/weiss%20pan%20to%20pandemic%201999.pdf" class="external free" title="http://faculty.virginia.edu/bio202/weiss%20pan%20to%20pandemic%201999.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://faculty.virginia.edu/bio202/weiss%20pan%20to%20pandemic%201999.pdf</a>). Nature 397, 385-6 (1999). Also the <i>scientific consesus</i> is always careful to say "estimated 23 million people with AIDS have died since 1981" rather than dying of or from AIDS. Is this pedantry or precise use of language.</p>
<p>I have no problem with "dumbing down" the facts for Wikipedia, as long as we avoid subtle shifts of meaning. If Sci guy has sinned in this regard, then edit his summaries by all means, but do not simply revert to delete advances in the <i>scientiic consesus</i> that you do not like.</p>
<p>Personally I think both versions need a lot of work! Fred2005 13:43, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Okay, I've made a pass at editing the first paragraph. Have a look, please edit appropriately if you can improve it, and/or comment here. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 21:24, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>"In most cases this weakening is progressive"</i></p>
<p>I still don't like this phrasing. Out of tens of millions of infected people, how many long term survivors are there? Dozens? Maybe a few hundred? I don't think it's unreasonable to say it's a trivial, negligible number. Saying that it is a progressive weakening 'in most cases' falsely implies that long term survivors are a non-trivial portion of AIDS patients. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 21:50, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Its a bad lede sentence for the same reason I think some may prefer it: it misses the point when it mentions "HIV antibodies" rather than "HIV infection". It uses a circular definition (AIDS is defined by having an AIDS-defining condition) while falsely suggesting that having a CD4 count of less than 200 is <i>not</i> an AIDS-defining condition. It suggests that the illness is "defined" rather than described. (And it advances Sci-Guy's preferred style of "Aids" rather than "AIDS", which is far more common, while suggesting that the idea that it is "sometimes called "Aids" is something quoted from the CDC (which it isn't)).- <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 00:20, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that many people consider the CDC definition to be a <i>circular definition</i>. Also you are correct the CDC definiton lists CD4 count of less than 200 and AIDS-defining conditions as two bullet points. They are two different catergories. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 00:55, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The methods used to estimate the spread of a disease may be very different for the methods to diagnose that disease. During the recent <a href="../../../s/a/r/SARS_4359.html" title="SARS">SARS</a> outbreak in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, sales of <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinegar.html" title="Vinegar">vinegar</a> provide useful information about the spread of [[[SARS]] within <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, because vinegar is a traditional Chinese remedy for symptoms associated with <a href="../../../s/a/r/SARS_4359.html" title="SARS">SARS</a>. This does not mean that eveyone who buys vingar has SARS. World wide sales of vinegar provide no useful information about the global spread of SARS.</p>
<p>HIV antibody tests have not been evaluated for use in Africa. Many common tropical diseases are known to cause a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_positive.html" title="False positive">false positive</a>. HIV antibody screening of all pregnant women in European coutries has confirmed no increase in positve results since 1985 and about two third of positve results are women from Africa. Also most African children who tested HIV positive have a mother who is HIV negative! The major risk factor for children in Africa appears to be unsafe medical injections. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci guy</a> 15:52, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In any case, mass deletions should always be justified.

To quote the style page: "Articles written in summary style have <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">lead sections</a> that are concise encyclopedia articles in their own right."

<dd>I agree with the comments above that mass deletions should be disfavored unless very well justified and I have said before that we ought to be addressing this article in a more conservative fashion, despite the general principle that editors <b>be bold</b>. Nonetheless I think that some of Fred's changes would be worthwhile had they been made in a more careful and constructive fashion. This article is honestly getting worse from a NPOV standpoint, not better, because of the strong views of those who wish to discredit and remove elsewhere any dissent. I am not taking sides on who is right or wrong, nor have I suggested that minority views be given precedence, but they ought not to be excluded either. My own efforts to clean up the introduction have been effectively obliterated. I think I will try to selectively apply some of Fred's wordings where they seem appropriate and invite constructive comment rather than mass reversions. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 07:13, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I restate my point. I am all for improving this article, but massive changes should come with good explanation, and superior support, not just an opinion that its superior. Revert wars are never the answer. The goal here should be comprehensive: Primarly show the majority mainstream view, "facts" and then note the minority views and where they come from--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 16:45, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you have to put "facts" in quotes, I think you recognize that the majority mainstream view is not necessarily factual. Again, the MMV should be given precedence, no question at all, but we should attribute and not state as fact. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 18:57, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The quotes are there to indicate that there are facts, and there are <i>facts</i>. Fact is one of those wonderfully misused word "Evolution is a fact/Not a fact just a theory" especially in science. For a while the MMV was that AIDS is a gay disease, something that modern statistics shows totally false. Facts to me, is anything properly cited, a definition used by the medical community, or anything else which the statement itself isn't debateable, just its implications. At any rate, as it is, this article is a bit large and could use some <b>careful</b> editing.</dd>

<p>The present article does not even make mention of the fact that there exists any controversy with respect to the cause and definition of AIDS, the accuracy of testing methodologies, the differing definitions in the US, Canada, Europe and Africa, the safety and efficacy of antiretroviral medications, and therefore presents a unitary POV that excludes any and all disagreement. Whether or not this POV is correct or false is not, and has not been, my concern. However, every attempt I have made to give even a suggestion of the existence of dispute has been removed, and there is not even a link now to the (very poorly written) article on <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">AIDS reappraisal</a>. The article now even begins by defining AIDS as infection by HIV. I am becoming increasingly inclined to mark this article totally disputed unless folks are willing to work constructively to work these issues out in a way which gives appropriate precedence to the mainstream view while <b>respecting</b> the existence of diverse views by respectable scientists. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 03:32, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, and you were inclined to endorse the 83% false positive rate for Western Blots in the dissenting article, too.

<dd>I'm not inclined to endorse or dispute any fact that I don't have a citation for. The 83% false positive rate was stated in the article, and similtaneously claimed to be negligible. That is inconsistent. Either the false positive rate is considerably lower than 83% or it is non-negligible. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhig_4cfc.html" title="User:Whig">Whig</a> 03:53, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, and you eliminated the wrong alternative. You <i>ought</i> to be inclined to dispute someone who says a test in clinical use has an 83% false positive rate. If you were in doubt as to which of the inconsistent alternatives was wrong - and you should not have been - you should have cleared that doubt up by doing research rather than simply picking the alternative you favored. . - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:54, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I try to copyedit articles by taking the facts as given in good faith.

Don't ask me to take sides because I won't do so, I am not going to push <b>either</b> POV. You obviously agree that the statements were inconsistent, and my edit history made clear the reasons for my changes, which led to changes in the article that hopefully improved the factual basis, and that is all for the better.

<dd>That's not original research, it's <i>actually looking at and reading the reference that was already there</i>! The 83% figure was most likely willful misrepresentation. Assuming good faith in the AIDS revisionist article is inadequate protection against error. If you can't take sides as to whether Wikipedia should misrepresent the sources it quotes, you shouldn't be editing.
