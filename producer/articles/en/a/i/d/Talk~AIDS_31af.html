<hr />
<p>The article talks about transmission through mucus membranes. I thought there was some evidence that there was transmission through dendritic cells, even without the presence of mucus. Is this correct?</p>
<p>Also, I wonder about sweat during sex. I have heard that sweat contains the virus. If one has sores on one's skin and if one is in prolonged sweaty contact with the skin of another, even if there is no contact through mucus membranes or dendritic cells, couldn't there be transmission?</p>
<p>Also, why isn't there more discussion here of whether sex is really voluntary behavior? It seems to me that for many people having sex is no more voluntary behavior than eating. It might be possible to stop it for a while, but not forever. It seems to me that asking sexually active people to protect each other from infection is like asking the fox to guard the hen house.</p>

<p>I am naive in the various AIDS debates, though I have known some victims of the disease. However, having just watched the famous 2004 <a href="../../../c/b/c/CBC_d905.html" title="CBC">CBC</a> documentary on <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Hooper_896e.html" title="Edward Hooper">Edward Hooper</a> theories, the <a href="../../../o/p/v/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis_8959.html" title="OPV AIDS hypothesis">OPV AIDS hypothesis</a> I found it very convincing and disturbing. I came to wikipedia for some reassurance and background, however, I was very dissappointed in the relevant party of this main <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> article. The origins section and alternatives are very shallow. They do not even link to other wikipedia articles treating the subject in more depth. <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_theories_about_the_origin_of_AIDS_f9d4.html" title="Alternative theories about the origin of AIDS">Alternative_theories_about_the_origin_of_AIDS</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:AIDS_origin_hypotheses" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:AIDS_origin_hypotheses" rel="nofollow">Category:AIDS_origin_hypotheses</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">AIDS_reappraisal</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/v/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis_8959.html" title="OPV AIDS hypothesis">OPV_AIDS_hypothesis</a> should at least be mentioned. I find this section really takes a side in the debate and departs from NPOV.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, they are mentioned in there actually, to my dismay. To me <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">AIDS reappraisal</a> and its ilk represent a POV Fork (<a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>) in which a new article has been created so that the main article can favor some viewpoints over others. They also are bad article ideas, as per (<a href="../../../b/a/i/WP%7EBAI_39d0.html" title="WP:BAI">WP:BAI</a>) because a new article is made to supplement an already existing one which you think is not putting your point across forcefully enough.</dd>
<dd>I also don't see any of the 'alternate' AIDS theory articles giving lipservice to <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> texts' as prominently as it to them, so take your pound of flesh and be happy. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 08:12, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I don't think they're POV forks. The AIDS article describes the consensus understanding of the disease, as it should, and refers briefly to various controversies. <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">AIDS reappraisal</a> is not really an alternate viewpoint on that article; it's a description of a scientific/political/ideological debate that, even for those who think it's entirely regrettable, has gotten a lot of attention and had undeniable effects. Most of the material there would be totally out of place in the main article. It still needs a lot of work but I think it does what it should: convey to a reader what those people are talking about, and the historical context in which the argument arose. Similarly, the OPV article is not a POV fork because it conveys a lot of detail on this notable (by definition, since it was very widely publicized) theory - detail that would, again, be out of place in the main article but is certainly of at least historical importance. You don't call a sub-article a POV fork just because the people it <i>describes</i> are at odds with the subject of the main article; otherwise we'd have to choose between having, say, <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights_movement.html" title="Civil rights movement">Civil rights movement</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/i/COINTELPRO_b137.html" title="COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a>. ←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 02:03, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perticularly the quote: "Subsequently, this hypothesis has been refuted by examination of these original polio vaccine stocks and establishing that they do not contain material of chimpanzee origin.[114]" is out of context, it should be on the OPV page where it can be disputed or verified. There is dispute of this finding, the most obvious being the logical impossibility of finding a sample to test that was also used.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't have the background to authoritatively change this, my reference is a TV show, albeit a good one. So I'm going to simply link these other wikipedia articles - even on a functional argument basis, the main AIDS trunk should lead to these branches. I'm not going to delete the offending quotation, because maybe it should be restated or by someone with a good reference to cite.154.20.109.121 06:31, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If anything the OPV hypothesis has been given much too much prominence in this article. It's very much a fringe theory that's been rejected by mainstream science.

<dd>Trezatium - now that you did such a nice job expanding and referencing that passage about OPV, I think it <i>is</i> too much!&#160;:) I mean, I think that kind of detail really belongs in the OPV hypothesis article. The AIDS article would be fine with a brief summary of what that debate was about; the fact that the consensus is now against it; and a "see" link to let the reader know that there <i>is</i> more detail available elsewhere. (I think an inline note like "See <a href="../../../o/p/v/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis_8959.html" title="OPV AIDS hypothesis">OPV AIDS hypothesis</a>." would be best - adding a "See also" section at the bottom of the article, for something that at this point is not a very central issue, would be overkill.) ←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 01:30, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I really like this article, it's great. I read not even half of it but I came across two parts of the text that I would like to comment on:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The risk of HIV transmission from exposure to saliva is considerably smaller than the risk from exposure to semen; contrary to popular belief, one would have to swallow gallons of saliva from a carrier to run a significant risk of becoming infected." - Im not sure what "popular belief" is, but most people I personally know know that you can not get aids (easily) through saliva... how do you define "popular belief" in this particular article?</li>
<li>"During a sexual act, only male or female condoms can reduce the chances of infection with HIV and other STDs and the chances of becoming pregnant." - I don't see what the use is of mentioning that only male or female condoms can reduce the chances of becoming pregnant, not to mention that this is, as far as I know, not even true... (not "only" condoms; see <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_control.html" title="Birth control">Birth_control</a>). if this sentence isn't supposed to mean that, shouldn't it be re-phrased?</li>

<p>As with most dominant discussions of HIV/AIDS, very little is said on this page about the socio-cultural and economic causes of the spread of HIV (that is, that it spreads primarily due to poverty and the low social status of women). Discussing the HIV/AIDS pandemic as though it is sheerly a health issue delimits the range of solutions to those focusing on health (and therefore driven by the "Northern" or developed health and research system. Poor people in Africa are creating great solutions (many based around home-based care and the empowerment of women) to HIV/AIDS at the community level, but it is very difficult for them to access funding for them.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to write a short section on these issues when I have a little time in the coming weeks. If anyone has a suggestion about where on the page it might go, please suggest away.</p>

<p>The following edit deleted a sentence about vitamin C; I reverted and restored the sentence. The deleting edit was: " 06:00, 6 December 2006 Grcampbell (Talk | contribs) (we don't need to add every alternative medicine that has been tested. We don't even list every type of ART used! Revert reversion.)"</p>
<p>I agree that we don't need to add every alternative medicine that has been tested. If, however, someone wishes to do so, I see no harm in it; if it takes up too much space it can be moved to a separate page. Ideally, information about the results of the tests would also be provided. Similarly for conventional treatments.</p>
<p>However, that explanation does not justify deleting the sentence about vitamin C, since this sentence was very far from listing the large number of alternative treatments that have no doubt been tried. The sentence was giving one example of an alternative treatment (very high doses of vitamin C) -- one which has been found in preliminary clinical trials to suppress the symptoms of AIDS and markedly reduce the tendency for secondary infections. Any treatment which does this deserves mention, in my opinion.</p>
<p>The section on alternative treatments is already much shorter than the section on conventional treatments and is at the end of a section and without a separate heading, where it is likely to attract less attention. Rather than shortening the alternative treatments section, a more <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">balanced</a> article could be achieved by lengthening the alternative treatments section and placing it where it is more likely to be seen (with a separate heading, or a topic sentence menioning it at the beginning of the treatment section, for example). --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 13:12, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My feeling on this is that section on alternative treatments is long enough. Allowing a gazillion different ones would be disproportionate to the amount of suggested clinical treatment out there suggested: a vast majority being HAARTs. In addition to all this, the "High doses of vitamin C have been used, for example, to treat AIDS, with good preliminary clinical results." is cited from a 1984 source; i'm guessing the 'preliminary clinical results' were preliminary because no one really reproduced it. It is probably why doctors don't give a Vit C. horsepill with all the other HAARTs pills when someone comes to them for treatment. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 15:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a>, therefore I again deleted the vitamin C reference. Preliminary results in 1984... yes, 22 years later I would hope that we would have gotten past preliminary results. Moreover, examples of alternative treatments are already given, try reading the article. Furthermore, we do not need to lengthen the quackery aspect of AIDS treatments, especially in an article of this length. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 15:59, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've restored the sentence about vitamin C for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia articles are required to show a <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a> according to Wikipedia policy. Deleting part of the alternative therapies section when it is already much shorter and less prominent than the conventional treatments section contravenes this policy.</li>
<li>The vitamin C sentence is the most important sentence in the alternative treatment paragraph. Much of the alternative treatment paragraph actually has an anti-alternative treatment slant. If the paragraph is too long, perhaps some other part of the paragraph could be deleted. If there is too long a list of alternative treatments, perhaps alternative treatments that don't have citations showing promising results could be deleted -- though the alternative treatment paragraph is already much shorter than the conventional treatment section.</li>
<li>Yes, I agree: I would hope that after 22 years, someone would have carried out a reasonably large randomized controlled trial of bowel-tolerance-intake vitamin C as an AIDS treatment. (Placebo control may not be possible for bowel-tolerance-intake levels, but randomized control is possible.) If someone can find a reference to such a study, it would improve this article. I encourage people to look for one. I It would be a sad state of affairs if no such study has been conducted after the encouraging results in the Cathcart study and the success of very-high-dose vitamin C with other viruses; although I hear it's almost impossible to get funding for such studies, and that any researcher interested enough in vitamin C to conduct a study using bowel tolerance intake levels is likely to have strong ethical concerns about placing anyone in the non-vitamin-C group when life-threatening illness is involved. If there has been a reasonably large randomized-controlled study of bowel-tolerance-intake vitamin C for AIDS which did not show any benefit, please mention it here and it may be a good reason for deleting the vitamin C sentence. Speculating that such a study might exist is not a reason to delete the vitamin C sentence.</li>
<li>Being 22 years old does not invalidate the results of a study. However, I'm adding a reference to a more recent study (although it is a study of much lower doses of vitamin C). --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 11:48, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm running out the door, but here's my take. I don't see this 'anti-alternative-treatment bias' that you keep on claiming. The section is proportional to the amount of suggested treatment in the real world (a majority being HAARTs). For similar reason's the reappraisal section is smaller than a majority of the article. I think deletion was a good call because the burden of proof lies on the editor and not the reader - doubly so for such a stringent scientific article. Using the word 'quackery' in the edit summary is hardly enough to call the bias-police. Also, especially in a case like this, it is a better idea to post the new source here instead of the article and dealing with a second revert and raised temperatures of editors. Like I said, I'm running out the door, but by first glance it is the same fellow doing in 1998 more of what he did in 1984 (note: we knew like nothing in 1984 about HIV/AIDS compared to what we know now). I'm thinking hes the only Vit C. fan out there in pertinence to HIV - any other scientists with peer reviewed journals who've supplied similar findings? <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 14:43, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why the emphasis on vit C? why not other nutrients/vitamins/minerals such as D or E? or selenium amongst others?

<dd>I see that <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> has cited the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy as grounds for expanding the alternative treatments section. I think this is a misapplication of NPOV - specifically, the stipulation to avoid "Undue Weight". To quote, "<i>Articles that compare views need not give minority views as much or as detailed a description as more popular views, and may not include tiny-minority views at all... We should not attempt to represent a dispute as if a view held by a small minority deserved as much attention as a majority view</i>". The idea that megadose Vitamin C can prevent, treat, or cure AIDS is the view of a small minority and has very little supporting evidence. To present it (or other unproven alternative therapies) on an equal, or near-equal, footing with treatments that have a massive amount of peer-reviewed literature behind them would be the NPOV violation. I think the current edit by <a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> is appropriate. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 19:01, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also: I would like to delete or change the last sentence "None of these treatments have been proven in controlled trials to have any effect in treating HIV or AIDS.[97]" because it is false or at least highly misleading: it implies that there are no controlled trials showing benefit from alternative therapies, when in fact there are such controlled trials showing benefit; and it implies that it is talking about all alternative therapies, when the Mills (2005) article referenced in the footnote specifically excluded examination of "trials of antioxidant and vitamin therapy", and for the therapies it did examine, did find some evidence of benefit for some of the therapies. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 02:27, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Vitamin and mineral statements have been included above the alternative treatment section in a manner that is more than adequate for the amount of research and data that has been put forward about these. there is also a reference to a review article should anyone want more info on this topic. This should close any further debate on the issue. As the vitamin section is no longer within the scope of alternative treatment, the mills article should stand. Also, as the statement regarding the Mills article states that they do not have any effect in treating HIV and AIDS, which is still true, then that statement should also stand. Quality of life and treatment of HIV are two different things. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 03:13, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not clear to me whether you're commenting on the list of criteria I suggested. If you wish to suggest different criteria, or if you wish to suggest an alternative means of resolving this dispute other than using a list of criteria, please state that clearly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since no one has (as far as I understand) objected to the list of criteria, I'm planning to write a paragraph which in my opinion satisfies the criteria, and present it here for review.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since one of the complaints is the length of the article, one thing that may help (partially) resolve this dispute is putting some material about alternative treatment for AIDS on other pages, with links from this page. Does anyone here object to the idea of me putting material on that topic on other pages (already existing pages and/or page to be created)? If you object, please state clearly that you object, what exactly you object to, and what is the grounds for the objection. Of course, such other pages would be subject to all the usualy Wikipedian editing etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In reply to Bob: I disagree; in my opinion the amount of information given about vitamins and minerals does not adequately provide information about the amount of research and data that exists about them. A reference to a review article, which is not easily and quickly obtainable over the Internet, is not adequate in my view. Several links to other Wikipedia pages with extensive additional information on the topic would be good, in my opinion. Debate on this issue is not closed: I am still not happy with the article as it stands. I don't understand what you mean by "the vitamin section is no longer within the scope of alternative treatment." I recognize that there is a very brief mention of vitamins just above the paragraph about alternative treatments and I think this can also be considered to be within the scope of this discussion. (i.e. I suggest we discuss the nutritional and alternative sections together here. If you prefer to discuss them separately perhaps you could start a separate section for one of them on this talk page, though I'm not sure they can easily be logically separated.) It's fine with me to retain a footnote to the Mills article; in fact, I may insist on it; however, it should not be accompanied by statements I consider to be false. It is not true that CAM have no effect in treating HIV and AIDS. For example, from the Mills article, p. 396, re Antoni, 2002 and stress management: "Men receiving stress management had significantly higher immune marker levels after six to 12 months follow-up."--<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 02:34, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd be concerned that starting a new article on alternative treatments would be a <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EContent_forking_70d0.html" title="WP:Content forking">POV fork</a> - a strongly discouraged method of dispute resolution. What might be a very good idea is spinning off a sub-article on "Treatment of HIV/AIDS", which could be linked from this page. The treatment of AIDS, which is a complex topic, could be dealt with in more depth there. There could of course be a section on "alternative" treatments, but it would likely be significantly smaller/less detailed than the sections on proven treatments, based on the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">undue weight</a> policy. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 18:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Making a separate page "Treatment of HIV/AIDS" as you suggest sounds like a good idea to me. It would have several advantages. (1) It would leave room for the conventional treatment section to be expanded as well as the alternative treatment section. (2) Currently, the HIV page and the AIDS page each have material on treatment. It seems a good idea to combine this material onto a single page, leaving a short summary on each page with a link to the treatment subarticle; this would avoid having pretty well the same subject covered on two different pages. (3) It would shorten the AIDS article, which is rather long.</dd>

<dd>I object to any criteria that wishes to lengthen the article. However, the current length passed FA not that long ago.</dd>
<dd>There are many topics that are not discussed in detail in this article, ones far better researched than vitamin and nutritional supplements. These include the role of CD8 cells and exposure times in relation to long term progression, the role of Tat in disease progression, the role of IL-4 and IL-7 in increasing viral load and quickening the progression to death. The effects of coinfection with CMV and combination antiretrovirals and ganciclovir, the effect of host genetic mutations such as CCR2-1-2518-G allele or polymorphisms of the CX3CR1 gene amongst many others. Regarding treatment, there is a plethora of research on HAART that isn't mentioned in this article, including mitochondrial disease, because this article is a summary of the important points regarding AIDS. Create your subarticle with your fetish for vitamin C within it and link to it from this article from the more than adequate attention this article gives it. The Mills article states <i>suggest that stress management may prove...</i>. I have to emphasise to you that it doesn't say that it def. does, one very small, poorly managed study doesn't make it so. The article also goes on to state <i>Despite the widespread use of CAM by people living with HIV/AIDS, the effectiveness of these therapies has not been established. Vis a vis CAM's popularity, the paucity of clinical trials and their low methodological quality are concerning.</i>. Now if you wish to argue that large scale clinical trials have been carried out and that CAM's are equivalent to or even close to treatment with HAART, and their effectiveness has been proven through tried and tested methods then your edits will be reversed quickly like edits inferring that HIV doesn't cause AIDS are reversed.

<p>Here is a suggested edit which I hope may solve both the dispute about the deletion of the vitamin C sentence and the dispute about the proposed deletion/modification of the sentence currently attached to the Mills footnote.</p>
<p>The suggestion:</p>
<p>Begin a new paragraph just before "Daily multivitamin supplements...", i.e. split the last two sentences off the second-last paragraph of the Treatment section. Combine these with the following paragraph and rewrite that paragraph so that the last paragraph of the Treatment section will read as follows:</p>
<p><a name="Draft_alternative_treatment_paragraph" id="Draft_alternative_treatment_paragraph"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/d/Talk%7EAIDS_31af.html" title="Edit section: Draft alternative treatment paragraph">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Draft alternative treatment paragraph</span></h3>

<hr />
<p>Reasons in support of this suggestion:</p>
<ul>
<li>This suggestion addresses two ongoing disputes and hopefully may be a compromise solution to both of them.</li>
<li>This paragraph is factual and supported by citations.</li>
<li>It provides links and footnotes allowing the reader interested in alternative therapies to easily find more reading material on the subject.</li>
<li>It is shorter than the original. Some editors had expressed the opinion that the alternative therapy section was "too long".</li>
<li>Unless someone finds some statement in it to be misleading, it satisfies the list of criteria above; the current version does not.</li>
<li>It increases the prominence of the result about vitamin supplementation by moving this information to the beginning of a paragraph. At least one editor seems to have missed seeing this interesting information on earlier reading of the article.</li>
<li>It removes vague, misleading and uncited (as far as I see) material about the changing definition of alternative therapy. The current paragraph give the misleading impression that alternative therapies are no longer used much. The phrase "community-based" doesn't seem to mean much: surely every AIDS patient is in some sort of community?</li>
<li>The proposed paragraph mentions four or five alternative therapies for which there is some evidence of effectiveness. The Mills paper lists studies showing statistically significant support for stress management, massage and boxwood, while the Cathcart and Hickey references provide evidence in favour of bowel-tolerance-dose vitamin C. (Does the Saltmarsh reference provide evidence in support of acupuncture for AIDS?) In contrast, the current version of the article mentions "flower remedies" for which I haven't seen evidence of effectiveness.</li>
<li>The current paragraph has no mention of vitamin C nor any link to further information on it. Mentioning vitamin C is important for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>People with AIDS are typically able to consume 40 to 100 grams of vitamin C, according to Cathcart (1984), without the diarrhoea-like symptoms that a normal healthy person experiences on ingesting about 2 to 6 grams of the vitamin. This suggests that the body of a person with AIDS is able to consume and utilise these amounts of vitamin C.</li>
<li>For a number of other illnesses during which people are able to ingest larger than normal amounts of vitamin C without the usual side effects, there is some evidence that ingesting these amounts leads to reduction of symptoms of the sickness and improvement in health.</li>
<li>There is evidence from anecdotal reports from two different authors that large doses of vitamin C lead to clinical improvement in AIDS patients.</li>
<li>Vitamin C is known to be used in a number of ways by the immune system -- for example, chemotaxis, production of interferon and production of hydrogen peroxide for killing pathogens.</li>
<li>When animals who produce their own vitamin C (most mammals, for example) get sick, they produce increased amounts of vitamin C comparable to the bowel-tolerance-dose in humans.</li>
<li>Vitamin C is of low cost and low toxicity, therefore a simple cost-benefit analysis suggests that if there is a reasonable likelihood that it may be beneficial, it is worth using.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The last sentence of the Treatment section is currently in dispute. The last sentence of this proposed edit is a version of that sentence which more closely reflects the actual citation: for example, the quote given above from the citation in support of the current sentence does not use the word "proven" but does use the words "concerning" and "established". The vocabulary and overall message of this new proposed sentence are closer to the original meaning of the citation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone objects to anything about this proposed edit, please discuss it here, and please propose alternative edits which address the above concerns, which satsify the list of criteria (which I proposed earlier and which no one has objected to), and which you believe are likely to be accepted by all involved. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 16:06, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Too many weasel words, is vague, and gives a false air that these are effective treatments. Why mention just five? Why not more, why not less? Why bother listing at all? Give references from this decade please, a study in 1984 is hardly reliable as a guideline for today. Also, it presents suspect results that are, as yet, unvalidated by other studies carried out by other people/cohorts. Why the absolute requirement to mention vit C? I really don't understand the obsession with vit C. Other vitamins have shown better results in better studies. Humans are not other animals. Your reasons are speculative at best. The current version gives an historic basis for the terminology used, your version ignores this completely. The current version states clearly that quack approaches have become less common, your version ignores this. Current version is factual and researched and gives more information than yours. Perhaps integrate some of the forms of quack medicine that you have listed, but the rest, no. It is too focused on unresearched orthomolecular medicine. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 03:11, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the interesting information about selenium. I suggest that this information be included in the Treatment section of the article.

<dd>Thanks for adding the selenium footnote to the article.

The evidence suggests that vitamin C, in amounts comparable to the amounts produced by mammals when they are sick, i.e. bowel-tolerance levels or tens of grams, is likely a very effective treatment for AIDS. Results do not become less valid with the mere passage of time, but only when other experiments add more information. If you know of more recent experiments with bowel-tolerance-dose vitamin C for AIDS, please mention them.</p>

<p>Bob, what do you think of changing just the last sentence? You quoted the Mills paper as saying:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Despite the widespread use of CAM by people living with HIV/AIDS, the effectiveness of these therapies has not been established. Vis a vis CAM's popularity, the paucity of clinical trials and their low methodological quality are concerning.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Currently, our article states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>None of these treatments have been proven in controlled trials to have any effect in treating HIV or AIDS.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I suggest that a more accurate, less misleading (and possibly grammatically more correct) representation of the information given in the citation is the last sentence of the draft paragraph, i.e.:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There is a concerning shortage of studies to establish the effectiveness of complementary and alternative treatments for HIV/AIDS.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The word "paucity" could be used instead of "shortage" to be even closer to the wording of the original, though I prefer "shortage" as likely understood by a wider audience. Changing this sentence in this way would address the concern I raised about the current version of this sentence being false or at least highly misleading. When I read the Mills paper, I was surprised, because the sentence giving it as a citation seemed to me to be saying that there was no statistically significant evidence in support of alternative therapies for AIDS, yet this paper lists a number of studies showing such evidence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it doesn't. It states that there have been no properly controlled trials that state that show any effect of quack science in treating HIV/AIDS. Again, show me one properly controlled clinical study that Mills cites that backs up your claims. That is all I have time for now. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 07:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Re vitamin C: I've given a list of reasons above for mentioning it. I would prefer to say more about it but am compromising by cutting it down to a single noun phrase with a link and footnotes. Humans apparently use vitamin C for all of the same purposes as other mammals and there is no evidence that the optimal amount for humans is any less (scaled by body weight) than that for all other mammals.</p>
<p>The reason I listed five treatments is that those are the ones for which some evidence of effectiveness has been presented here (except perhaps acupuncture, which can therefore be deleted). This is in conformity to the list of criteria established earlier in this discussion. The current version also lists a number of treatments. Such a list constitutes information, the provision of which is the purpose of an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I fail to see how a single noun clause can constitute a "focus" on orthomolecular medicine. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 14:45, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Modified the data set to include some of your extra things (<s>the boxwood thing has never been published, so has not been peer-reviewed anywhere</s>appears in <i>Phytomedicine</i>, not listed in Pubmed).

<dl>
<dd>The Mills article has been published, and presumably peer-reviewed, and says of boxwood: "Low-dose SPV-30 group was significantly superior to placebo for preventing therapeutic failure. Viral load reduced in active group." This is more than sufficient, even without the other study, to place boxwood ahead of acupuncture or flower remedies in terms of the amount of evidence that's been presented here for it, as far as I've seen; and anyway, merely to list a treatment as an alternative treatment, without stating that it provides benefit, doesn't require randomized controlled studies. Once a treatment has been established with top-quality evidence one hopes that it becomes a widely-used conventional treatment and no longer has to be referred to as "alternative".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>May I take your italicized sentence above as implying that you're OK with a mention of selenium in the article? How about: "Daily multivitamin/mineral supplements, or selenium alone, have each been found to ..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>no, you may not. however, as I wrote it in the article would be what I would be ok with. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 02:26, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The previous paragraph doesn't even mention vitamin C, let alone mention the alternative treatment which involves amounts of vitamin C comparable to the equivalent of what a typical sick mammal produces, not does it give links to additional reading material on the subject, so it is certainly not sufficient. Preferably the article would mention the promising preliminary clinical results of bowel-tolerance-dose vitamin C therapy; the draft paragraph is a compromise with a mere brief mention and links, and no statement about the benefits of the treatment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What is your reason for saying that the multivitamin sentences are better placed above? --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 01:23, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The previous paragraph mentions multivitamins with an appropriate reference. The references you propose are BS studies that have not been proven. We should not be linking to BS studies within a treatment section, but to reviews of these studies if we are to link to anything at all. In my opinion, and it seems to be a consensus in this article for a while now, we only link to studies that have been proven in proper clinical trials. You may have observed the removal of many so-called miracle cures from this article over the past year, the latest Iranian herbal remedy as a recent example. Finally, my reasoning for placing them above is that, in some cases, they have proved promising in proper clinical trials and read better there as well, instead of after a bit about PCP and toxoplasmosis --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 02:26, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Simply referring to something as "BS" is just labelling; it isn't a valid argument and doesn't convince anyone of anything.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think we've established above that alternative treatments can be mentioned even if there isn't a large-scale clinical trial of the type that would tend to reclassify the treatment from alternative to mainstream.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure that we can resolve the issue of the positioning of the multivitamin sentences before resolving the issue of the content of the final paragraph.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Re selenium: OK, I wasn't sure, that's why I asked. Nevertheless, I propose mentioning "selenium" in the article. If you oppose this, please explain why. And I do appreciate your finding the selenium article and putting the footnote into the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also see no reason not to mention boxwood; we now have two published studies with statistically significant results about it, (Durant published in Phytomedicine and Pharo published in Int Conf AIDS) compared to zero presented here for acupuncture or flower remedies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to me that no one opposes changing the last sentence of the last paragraph to the version in the draft paragraph. It seems to me that Bob's "no" above is referring to something else, not to the proposal to change that last sentence.

<dd>I think this is where I'm supposed to chime in (ive been trying to follow a bit, it isn't easy, heh). If the last sentence you want it to become is 'There is a concerning shortage of studies to establish the effectiveness of complementary and alternative treatments for HIV/AIDS. [7]', then I'd say no. It think it sounds POV, eg who is concerned, this Mills fellow?

<p>Coppertwig, my <i>no</i> was referring to your version of the last sentence. I didn't bother replying to your continued assumptions as I thought it was more than obvious, but hey probably not. I agree with JoeSmack and reaffirm the validity of <i>None of these treatments have been proven in controlled trials to have any effect in treating HIV or AIDS.</i>. Some papers state that there is an effect, but these are not properly controlled and do not hold widespread support. The current statement upholds the current medical opinion. I object to the changing of the last sentence. Clear enough now? On another note, I now see why you wish to include vitamin studies within this paragraph, as the uninformed reader may believe that there is a link between all the alternative treatments... Yet another reason to keep them apart in the position where I put them before being reverted. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 07:19, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In reply to your comment further above: The studies do not merely state that the treatments are effective; they present statistically significant results from controlled trials supporting the treatments. The existence of "methodological weaknesses" does not transform a number of controlled trials into zero controlled trials, and the Mills <i>et al.</i> article doesn't claim that it does.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Suppose we assume that "current medical opinion" is expressed in this quote from Mills <i>et al.</i>: <i>Despite the widespread use of CAM by people living with HIV/AIDS, the effectiveness of these therapies has not been established. Vis a vis CAM's popularity, the paucity of clinical trials and their low methodological quality are concerning.</i> This is not what the last sentence of the treatment section currently says. There is a difference between "not proven" and "not been established". To use the terminology "proven" when this terminology is not being used in the reference is to violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. There is a still more important difference between "a paucity" and "None".</dd>

<dd>In reply to JoeSmack: I'm glad to see that you've been watching this discussion. More collaborators can lead to a more polished result in the end. Re the proposed last sentence: Perhaps you are concerned about the word "concerning"? &#160;:-) I think it fits the pattern from Wikipedia policy quoted below. What do you think of these variations? (each to have the Mills <i>et al.</i> footnote)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>There is a shortage of studies to establish the effectiveness of complementary and alternative treatments for HIV/AIDS.</i></li>
<li><i>There is a paucity of studies to establish the effectiveness of complementary and alternative treatments for HIV/AIDS.</i></li>
<li><i>Experts have expressed concern over the shortage of studies to establish the effectiveness of complementary and alternative treatments for HIV/AIDS.</i></li>
<li><i>Writers of a review article on complementary and alternative therapies have expressed concern over the shortage of studies to establish the effectiveness of such treatments for HIV/AIDS.</i></li>

<dd>The first two eliminate the word "concerning" completely (although this word does appear in the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">RS</a>).

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The last one is simply a direct quote from Mills et al. Surely the quote is an accurate representation of itself! However, if the acronym "CAM" is used, it either needs to be expanded in the article (within square brackets if necessary) or a link to a definition. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 01:58, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the problem with all these variations is they all assert there should be more studies. Who is asserting this? Mills. Is Mills the end all be all on how many studies should be made before the world should stop being concerned? All those variations are POV for this reason as we're not all Mills and I don't think he should be telling me not to feel comfy until we get more studies to his liking. I think a perfect NPOV way of phrasing it would be
<ul>
<li><i>To date there are a small number of studies to establish the effectiveness of complementary and alternative treatments for HIV/AIDS.</i></li>

<p>Yes, I do. If we are to change it, and I suppose that Coppertwig won't stop until we do (not a personal attack, just an observation), why don't we change it to the exact wording of the Mills et al article? ie. <i>Despite the widespread use of complementary and alternative medicine by people living with HIV/AIDS, the effectiveness of these therapies has not been established.</i> This way we do not cherrypick the parts that we wish to include to support a specific POV, but something which has been peer removed, nor do we twist the words to mean something that they don't mean. I cannot see any valid objection to this. It states the facts as is.</p>
<p>On the subject of boxwood, I would be under the impression that boxwood therapy, published in the well renowned journal of phytomedicine and reviewed in another, as <i>herbal and flower remedies</i>.

<p>The fact that AIDS was originally referred to as GRID and the reason the name was subsequently changed is mentioned 3 times in the article; that's approximately 2 times more than necessary. If subsequent mention is needed it can be expressed as a short phrase such as "Originally dubbed GRID, ..." below, rather restated as a sentence. If possible two of the three similar stories can be simply edited away. Here I'm simply trying to reduce repetition; expanding one of the three versions with more detail can also be OK.</p>
<p>Under "CDC classification system for HIV infection":</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention_f18d.html" title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) originally classified AIDS as GRID which stood for <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_Related_Immune_Disease_693d.html" title="Gay Related Immune Disease">Gay Related Immune Disease</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[</span>citation needed<i>]</i></a></sup> However, after determining that AIDS is not isolated to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> people the name was changed to the neutral AIDS.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Under "Origin of HIV" it says:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Originally dubbed GRID, or <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay-related_immune_deficiency.html" title="Gay-related immune deficiency">Gay-Related Immune Deficiency</a>, health authorities soon realized that nearly half of the people identified with the syndrome were not homosexual men. In 1982, the CDC introduced the term AIDS to describe the newly recognized syndrome.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Under "HIV and AIDS misconceptions" it says:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>When scientists first recognized the syndrome in 1981 initially they termed it <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay-related_immune_deficiency.html" title="Gay-related immune deficiency">Gay Related Immune Deficiency Syndrome</a>, a possible source for the misconception holding that AIDS infects only homosexual men; scientists soon renamed the disease in recognition of transmission other than by male-male intercourse.</i></li>

<p>This proposal came out of the "Alternative treatment" discussion above. The proposal is to create a new page "Treatment of HIV/AIDS", and move the content of the "Treatment" section of this (AIDS) page onto it, and also move and merge the content of the "Treatment" section of the HIV page onto it. On the AIDS page and on the HIV page, a short (few paragraphs) summary will remain along with a link to the new page. See <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a>. Advantages of creating the new page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing the current <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">content fork</a> where the similar topic of HIV or AIDS treatment is covered on two separate pages.</li>
<li>More room to expand the material on conventional treatments.</li>
<li>More room to expand the material on alternative treatments.</li>
<li>Partially or completely resolving the ongoing dispute under "Alternative treatments" above, because one of the root causes of the dispute is whether there is enough room to include certain material on alternative treatments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll also put a note on the HIV talk page, directing discussion here. Comments? --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 05:05, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Conditional support</b>: I think creating a new page is worthwhile because the topic is complex/detailed and it will improve readability for both articles. The material in the current <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> article on treatment could be summarized, with more in-depth info on the new page. However, even on a new page we need to observe <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and undue weight - in other words, a new page wouldn't be a license to expand the alternative treatment section out of proportion to its relevance. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 18:56, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Conditional support</b>: I support the proposal I described above assuming it includes a message in italics at the beginning of the section such as "For main article see ..." with a link to the in-depth article. I oppose any duplication of the sentence "None of these treatments have been proven in controlled trials to have any effect in treating HIV or AIDS.[97]" which I would like to delete or change and which is under discussion above under "Alternative treatments". If duplication, rather than moving or summarizing, is to occur, I would like to see more about Wikipedia policy or guidelines as it applies to the situation of having sections of two articles covering almost exactly the same topic or a section of one article covering the same topic as another whole article. I've found Wikipedia policies or guidelines covering closely related situations but they don't seem to me to bear on this exact situation. By the way, I apologize if I've misused the term "content forking"; I simply intended to use it to mean the existence of more than one article covering the same topic, and on reading further into Wikipedia policy I see that it may usually mean something a bit different I didn't intend, and I apologize for any misunderstanding that may have occurred as a result. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 02:49, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Now that the last sentence of the Treatment section has been changed (the sentence with the Mills <i>et al.</i> footnote), one barrier to forming a separate Treatment page has been removed. As far as I can see, the only issue remaining is whether to keep the Treatment section at its current length while also making a new, longer Treatment page, or to shorten the Treatment section into a "summary". I've searched around in Wikipedia policy and haven't found anything definitive about this. I'm hesitant about having a lot of similar information on separate pages; I think Wikipedia policy tends to frown on that. In this case there's also the HIV page treatment section which is another page with similar information. If anyone can find clarification in Wikipedia policy about this situation I would appreciate it.

<li><b>Support</b>: Being recently diagnosed myself and trying to wade through the HUGE amount of information that is available on the Internet (coupled with the fact that much of that information is outdated), I think it's important to not only "show the facts" but it's also of critical importance to learn about ALL the various treatment options that are both "Currently Available", and also those that are being "Explored". I'm not only referring to "Alternative treatments" but also to the various "Drug and Vaccine Trials" that are occurring. At the very least a reference link to "<a href="http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/" class="external free" title="http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/</a>" or one of the other Trials repositories should be added. I've got to tell you that it is my opinion that the very first sentence "There is currently no vaccine or cure for HIV or AIDS." is not only heartless, I believe it's just an extreme oversimplification of the issue. I understand the "Encyclopedic" nature of Wikipedia, but we simply can not deny that there is an emotional "impact" of the information presented here. There is also the fact that "Treatment" is undergoing a rate of updates that would be considered radical compared to the treatment of other diseases, so "centralizing" all of that information in a single entry would be much better than maintaining similar information in two places. —<a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZacWolf_b2af.html" title="User:ZacWolf">ZacWolf</a> 13:07, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In spite of low cost, low toxicity and promising preliminary results from the use of high-dose vitamin C in the treatment of AIDS, apparently no randomized controlled studies have been done on this treatment. People with AIDS are able to take very large amounts of vitamin C (on the order of 100 grams a day) without getting the diarrhoea-like effects healthy people would get if they consumed that amount of vitamin C by mouth -- a sign that their body is using the vitamin. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 03:02, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A couple of issues; the first reference/point ("used to treat AIDS with good preliminary clinical results") is an entirely anecdotal paper from <i>Medical Hypotheses</i> from 1984 (3 strikes?). Second, vitamin C wasn't "shown to reduce viral load" in Allard's paper; there was a trend toward lower viral load (p=0.1) which did not reach the standard criteria for statistical significance. You may as well note that the vitamin C group had more infections than the placebo group (9 vs. 7) - also a "trend" which did not reach statistical significance. I'm not sure of the source for the final claim (that people with AIDS can tolerate higher doses of vitamin C). I understand no large-scale clinical trials of high-dose vitamin C have been done, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not the place to right great wrongs</a>; it's more a place to report on the studies that <i>have</i> been done. I do think something about the 2004 multivitamin study (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15229304" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15229304">PMID 15229304</a>) should be included under treatment, both because of its relevance and because its findings are so often misrepresented. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 05:21, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We should not push a certain POV on wikipedia, we should also follow evidence from respectable sources and we should also cease to cherrypick data. On another note, (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15229304" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15229304">PMID 15229304</a>) is already referenced in the article: <i>Daily multivitamin supplements have been found to reduce HIV disease progression among men and women. This could become an important low-cost intervention provided during early HIV disease to prolong the time before antiretroviral therapy is required.</i> This is more than sufficient reference to vitamins as a treatment for AIDS. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 08:45, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow i didnt know there were so many versions of this. hopfully we get the cure soon. well like i said i heard on the radio that the source of the cure was found on the secretions of a toad in south africa or something like that. I guess that was a little to good to be true. In anyways Thanks much for all the feed back! and feel free to continue i like hearing the diffrent points of views and researches.<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaverick423_0974.html" title="User:Maverick423">Maverick423</a> 18:24, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Re Allard's paper: There was a statistical significance level of 0.1 given, presumably for the comparison with controls, which is not quite statistically significant according to the usual criteria; however, there was also a 95% confidence interval given with both endpoints negative, indicating, if I understand correctly, a statistically significant decrease in viral load with vitamin C treatment, comparing after-treatment to the same patients before-treatment. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 09:58, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, drinking 2 liters of someone else's saliva isn't possible. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 04:48, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would think it would be a matter of probabilities: that the probability of getting infected from two litres of saliva would be approximately double the probability of getting infected from one litre of saliva, and thousands of times the probability of getting infected from a drop of saliva. Presumably all rather small probabilities. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 02:16, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What about a drop of saliva on a open wound would that infect? <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaverick423_0974.html" title="User:Maverick423">Maverick423</a> 15:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would guess that would have more chance of infection than drinking a drop of saliva, but less than getting a drop of blood on an open wound. I think any open wounds in the mouth or digestive tract greatly increase the risk from swallowing such fluids. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 02:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem as far as oral infection is not with saliva, but with semen, vaginal discharges, milk or blood coming into contact with a torn mucous membrane due to tooth injury, gum abbrassion, retracting gums and things like that. Get two people with poor gum health to kiss deeply for an extended period, and there is real risk of infection. 88.152.19.206 23:46, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The footnotes are not displaying correctly. In the last paragraph of the Treatment section are two references to an article with author Saltmarsh and title "Voodo or Valid?", but this article does not display in the list of references. I've tried with two different browsers. It appears as footnote 93, but footnote 93 display as a different article.

<dd>OK, I've figured out what the problem is. Two different references are named "Saltmarsh". I'll fix it.

<dd>I've repaired the Saltmarsh reference and abbreviated a few identical references. Near the end of the Stigma section, attached to the phrase "even sex between two uninfected men.", I found a footnote containing two citations, the second of which was not displaying. I repaired it to display as two separate footnotes; I'm guessing either both, or just the second footnote was intended to be cited here. The second source seems to me to definitely support the statement, while the first may also be relevant. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 19:22, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At "Draft alternative treatment paragraph" above, I suggest moving the two sentences about vitamin supplements from the end of one paragraph to the beginning of the next paragraph. The positioning of these two sentences is under discussion, along with the rest of the draft paragraph, and this issue is not yet resolved.

<p>The section you have flagged was not originally part of the <i>discussion</i>, yet you have included it now. There is no real <i>discussion</i> taking place here. A discussion would involve people talking about it. The only thing I see here is an insistence of the inclusion of a POV. Namely vitamin C research which has not been clinically proven. I have tried discussing this with you, yet you are apparently unable to see the facts of the matter as published in the article written by Mills et al and others. Furthermore you only revert the parts that are not in agreement with your POV. If you wish to have a <i>discussion</i> take the matter to the wikiproject medicine and ask them to review your <i>facts</i> and theories and ask the other doctors who contribute to articles whether or not biased, unproven research deserves a place within this heavily read article. I, for one, do not wish to see this article degenerate into the piece of trash that it was just over a year ago. A lot of hard work was carried out by many contributors to get this article to FA status. Insistence on the inclusion of quackery will only lead to it being delisted.

<p>And thank you, Bob, for catching and fixing that extra ref tag.</p>
<p>Although the positioning of the last two sentences of the second-last paragraph of the treatment section was not part of the discussion at the beginning of the "Alternative treatment" discussion, it has been part of the discussion there since January 28, when I proposed moving these sentences to the beginning of a paragraph for the purpose of increasing their prominence. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 00:52, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have to understand that when we hear somewhat vague claims like "uses nanotechnology" and "has no side effects", the red flags go up. I think the reason IMOD hasn't been included is the lack of scientific data. If we could get a scientific paper, published somewhere in a peer-reviewed journal, that supported these claims, I'd be a lot more comfortable with it. IRNA is not a scientific source, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> cautions (used to caution?) us, "Avoid citing the popular press on scientific matters". <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 19:44, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well then why not at least say "it is <i>claimed</i> to have no side effects"? The section already says "None of these treatments have been proven in controlled trials to have any effect in treating HIV or AIDS". So why raise a red flag here, and not for the others mentioned? The person who has made these claims is not some joe blow. He's authored 2 text books in medicine, published several peer reviewed papers in int'l journals, and is the Minister of Health of Iran. And having "nanotechnology" and "biotechnology" in these sentences isn't a far fetched thing to object to either. These areas have high priorities in Iranian R&amp;D.<a href="http://www.nano.ir/en/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nano.ir/en/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a><a href="http://ijb.nrcgeb.ac.ir/index.php/ijb/index" class="external autonumber" title="http://ijb.nrcgeb.ac.ir/index.php/ijb/index" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> Iran even ranks its laboratories in nanotechnology research.<a href="http://www.wikiran.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_Iran#Nanotechnology_research" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikiran.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_Iran#Nanotechnology_research" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></dd>

<dd>Suffice to say, when the <i>entire</i> paragraph is deleted (instead of being modified to address these issues), it only makes it seem that some people are advocating the idea that scientific progress is an enterprise exclusive to the west, and that western approval is required for any recognition.

<dd>It seems relevant information to me. We can state that Iran has announced a treatment. This statement is apparently true and does not in itself claim that the treatment is effective. I think the article being linked to is interesting. I think the word "nanotechnology" should not be used here; I don't see it in the article. The article says it's an herbal remedy, which is makes much more sense. Zereshk makes a good point that other alternative treatments are mentioned in spite of a lack of solid scientific evidence backing them. That's almost the definition of alternative treatments. There are good reasons for mentioning alternative treatments even if there is no solid scientific evidence that they work. In this case, there is some evidence that it works: it says they've tried it on 200 people. Please see also the discussion "Alternative treatments" above. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 02:52, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Iran may have an herbal remedy, but until it is scientifically supported and has peer reviewed studies behind it, it should not be in this article.

<dd>How often does the health ministry of a country make an announcement like this? If not often, it's notable and I think it's important to put a link to the article about it. If often, I think we should summarize, e.g. "In the year 2006, for example, 5 governments announced advances in treatments" (or whatever the actual number is) with links to similar articles about the announcements. This would provide the reader with context for evaluating the importance of any similar announcements.</dd>
<dd>I tried to find the official website of the health ministry of Iran. I think I found it, <a href="http://www.mohme.gov.ir" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mohme.gov.ir" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> but the English version wouldn't load. I can see the Persian, but I can't understand it. Would someone who can read Persian please check whether the website makes an announcement like the one described in the article, and provide a specific web page address pointing to the announcement?</dd>
<dd>We do not need solid scientific evidence to prove that the government of Iran has made an annoucement relevant to AIDS. We do not need solid scientific evidence that a treatment works before listing it as an alternative treatment. Because of often severe side effects and deaths from drugs, drugs are normally subjected to stringent criteria before being used. There is no need for this article to apply that same stringency to the mere mentioning of alternative treatments. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 11:47, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Iran's government chose to use this as a treatment. I'm guessing they didn't choose it randomly, there were probably scientific studies that were conducted beforehand to support Iran's choice.

<dd>Let’s just take a short reality check here.<br />
FACT: Iranian news claims that IMOD is in the final stages of the licensing process in the EU (<a href="http://www.payvand.com/news/07/feb/1113.html" class="external free" title="http://www.payvand.com/news/07/feb/1113.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.payvand.com/news/07/feb/1113.html</a>).<br />
FACT: It hasn’t as yet even been submitted to the European Medicines Evaluation Agency for approval by either the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) or Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) (please do feel free to check at <a href="http://www.emea.eu.int/" class="external free" title="http://www.emea.eu.int/" rel="nofollow">http://www.emea.eu.int/</a> .. the only references to “imod” you find are in an entirely different context in Danish and Norwegian language documents, where imod simply means “against”’).<br />
It hasn’t even undergone the testing required for it to be so much as considered for approval .. and even if it had, that approval would still be at least a year off (because it doesn’t as yet have the advantage of the US approvals that would shortcut the normal approval process.<br />
Even a drug that is already licenced in the US and doesn’t contain any components that aren’t already licenced for exactly the same use and in exactly the doses in the EU, would still take at least six months to gain approval. (e.g. Atripla, which is simply a single dose formulation of the already popular sustiva and truvada and is still awaiting EU marketing approval).<br />
Given that demonstrably untrue claims are being made about IMOD, would it not be prudent to first see how the rest of the claims for the drug stand up to scrutiny?<br />

<dl>
<dd>I agree with Hne123 that there is a problem here. A Wikipedia article should not contradict itself and should not take sides. Although putting "is widely believed" near the top of the article would solve this, to me it sounds too weak in this case. How widespread is the minority view? Rather than "is widely believed", near the top of the article it might sound better to put something like "has been determined by medical science to be..." Can the Alternative Hypothesis section be written to mean "Some people believe X, but they are wrong"? The Myths section is like that. However, for the Alternative Hypotheses section, that seems a bit too POV to me. Maybe just renaming the heading of the Alternative Hypotheses section might help. What about the hypothesis that, although HIV is one factor causing AIDS, the presence of HIV alone is not enough to cause AIDS? I'm surprised this more reasonable hypothesis isn't mentioned, when the more extreme one is. In summary, I agree that there's a problem here but I don't know how to fix it. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 11:30, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 'majority view' is scientific consensus. We're not going to lie in the intro to satisfy an alternative hypothesis that is for the most part bumpkis, nor is 'undue weight' a valid NPOV arguement, nor should weasel words like 'it is widely believed' be anywhere in this article. This has been argued again and again, nothing more than the test of time has shown that the <i>specific</i> wording, AIDS is caused by HIV, is the best way to phrase it.

<dd>I think Hne123 has a common misunderstanding about <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The actual policy mandates that we don't give undue weight to fringe theories. The view that HIV doesn't cause AIDS is that of a small fringe/minority, and is primarily a political rather than scientific movement at present. Given that, its mention <i>at all</i>, and the <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">article dedicated to it</a>, probably represent undue weight, but there you go. The idea of "cofactors" as an "alternative" hypothesis is too vague - the course of every infectious disease is modified by host cofactors, but here it seems to be some kind of code implying that HIV is harmless. There is evidence on the progression of HIV in drug users, those with Hep B or C, etc, and perhaps this warrants a sentence or two. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 17:36, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ok guys i have a question here</p>
<p>as we recall on a earlier conversation about saliva and infection. 2 liters of saliva isnt enough to get infected if ingested orally. in the same note it is more probable to get infected through a wound. meaning the mouth and digestive system might be stronger to the threat of aids. however breastmilk when ingested can give a child the virus. what is the diffrence between these if they are both ingested orally? yes i read the article but i cant seem to find it anywere <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaverick423_0974.html" title="User:Maverick423">Maverick423</a> 18:24, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The difference is more in the child than the breastmilk as i understand it. If you were to down 2 litters of breastmilk now you'd probably be fine. However, in the first 6 months or so of a baby's life, it gets a strong dose of natural antibiotics through the mother's breastmilk. The baby uses this essentially to keep it from getting lots of diseases before its immune system is up to its own snuff. If this breastmilk has a HIV virons and the baby is still quite young, it makes for some pretty infectious chances. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 18:36, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>During the first few months of life a baby consumes dozens of litres of breast milk. In addition to having undeveloped immune systems, babies also have immature digestive tracts which are more vulnerable to infection. The risk of transmission is highest among babies who are fed other foods or liquids as well as breast milk, probably because these other substances irritate the digestive tract, or contain other microbes that facilitate transmission. Also I believe that the concentration of HIV in saliva is lower than in breast milk, though I don't know of any specific figures. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 22:14, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact most studies have concluded that life expectancy for people on HAART is around 20-30 years after infection - that is at least 10 years longer than without treatment (e.g. <a href="http://www.aidsmap.com/en/docs/48862A81-A5F0-4279-8A40-FD9B96355CD8.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aidsmap.com/en/docs/48862A81-A5F0-4279-8A40-FD9B96355CD8.asp" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=17063130" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=17063130" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, <a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/146/2/I-39" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/146/2/I-39" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>).

<p>It can depend on a number of factors, age, weight, host and viral genetics, regime prescribed, adherence etc etc etc. Taking an <i>average</i> is difficult when talking about survival after treatment starts.

<p>A recent Danish study [Lohse N et al. Survival of persons with and without HIV infection in Denmark, 1995-2005. Annals of Internal Medicine:146: 87-95, 2007.] has suggested that in settings where there is easy and FREE access to care and HIV medication (commenced at 250 cells/mm3), a young adult diagnosed with HIV - but without HCV - has an estimated median survival rate of MORE than 35 years (getting better with every year that passes) and that, whilst this is still 10 years short of general life expectancy, death is now unlikely to be directly related to HIV. In the United Kingdom, most people newly diagnosed with HIV are told to expect a near normal lifespan, similar to that of anyone now in remission from the likes of cancer (if they are sensible) <a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrpingtonian_36fb.html" title="User:Orpingtonian">Orpingtonian</a> 11:50, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The presence of AIDS in in a blood sample from an adult male in Kinshasa, Zaire (then Leopoldville, Belgian Congo)in 1959 has not been independently confirmed. The virus was found using some of the early testing methods, which produced false positives due to the so-called "sticky sera" problem. Also, there are strong suggestions that the individual may have had G6PD deficiency, as well as possibly suffering from malarial-induced anemia.</p>

<p>The other famous case from 1959-60, that of the "Manchester sailor," was of course refuted by Dr David Ho in 1993.

As for the first AIDS case in the US, researchers at Tulane in 1988 were able to isolate antibodies to a virus closely resembling AIDS from autopsy specimens preserved since 1969. The victim, a teenaged black male from the Midwest, had died after a 16-month illness bearing many similarities to modern AIDS. The timing of the patient's illness and death (his illness dated to 1968, though the actual date of infection could not be determined), his apparent lack of risk factors associated with the current epidemic, and small differences in histology suggest that his case cannot be considered as among the progenitors of the present epidemic (his doctors believed that he had sexual behavior risk factors, but could not confirm their suspicions through interviews with the patient and his family). However, this case does serve to refute origin theories suggesting the virus emerged "suddenly" or "all at once" in the late 1970s/early 1980s.</p>

<p>Whilst the CDC classification would appear to be correct as stated, the accompanying text does actually use some unfortunate wording that gives a somewhat incorrect impression of the real state of affairs in the devloped world.</p>
<p><br />
1: Most <i>“devloped countries”</i> do NOT use the CDC classification. Almost all developed countries used the WHO disease staging system.</p>
<p><br />
2: In most <i>“developed countries”,</i> AIDS is ONLY diagnosed with the onset of AIDS defining illnesses (Stage II on the WHO staging system).</p>
<p><br />
3: In most “<i>developed countries”,</i> a CD4 cell count below 200 cells/mm3 does NOT trigger an automatic AIDS diagnosis.</p>
<p><br />
4: In most <i>"developed countries"</i>, the AIDS diagnosis does NOT stand when AIDS-defining illnesses have been cured.</p>
<p><br />
Most <i>“developed countries”</i> regard the CDC classifications as arcane and prejudicial .. and very far from setting a gold standard.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest that this section of the article be modified to remove this false impression. <a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrpingtonian_36fb.html" title="User:Orpingtonian">Orpingtonian</a> 11:11, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, most developed countries use either the 1993 CDC definition or the 1993 European definition, which is identical to the 1993 CDC definition except that it excludes CD4 criteria (see <a href="http://www.eurohiv.org/case_definitions/definitions_eng.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.eurohiv.org/case_definitions/definitions_eng.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>). A table of definitions used in countries in 1997 can be found <a href="http://www.who.int/hiv/strategic/surveillance/definitions/en/" class="external text" title="http://www.who.int/hiv/strategic/surveillance/definitions/en/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Note that this table is ten years old. I would guess that more countries have moved towards using either the 1993 CDC or the 1993 European definition since then.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the article is correct except when it says that, "The majority of new AIDS cases in developed countries use either this definition or the pre-1993 CDC definition." In fact the pre-1993 CDC definition is not exactly the same as the 1993 European definition. The latter includes three additional AIDS-defining conditions (pulmonary tuberculosis, recurrent pneumonia, and invasive cervical cancer) that were added to the CDC definition in 1993.</dd>

<dd>Does <a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrpingtonian_36fb.html" title="User:Orpingtonian">Orpingtonian</a> have a reference for that "arcane and prejudicial" statement? And do they have a reference to support their assertion that, "the AIDS diagnosis does NOT stand when AIDS-defining illnesses have been cured"? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 12:14, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Arcane and prejudical (and leading to stigmatisaion) are the exact reason why the European definition is there .. and why it is NOT identical to the CDC definition anywhere where it refers to CD4 cell counts (not just one singular place). I refer Trezatium to both UK guidelines and the European definitions as clear examples stating that the AIDS diagnosis does NOT stand when AIDS-defining illnesses have been cured.</p>
<p>I am not asking for the "arcane and prejudical" statement to be included (it would serve no purpose) .. simply that the wording <i>"The majority of new AIDS cases in developed countries use either this definition or the pre-1993 CDC definition."</i> be changed, so as to remove the four wholly incorrect conclusions that would be drawn from it.</p>
<p>Does anyone (not just Trezatium) have any credible reference to support the notion that an AIDS diagnosis still stands in most countries, even when the illness(es) that lead to the diagnosis have been cured? I very much doubt it. <a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrpingtonian_36fb.html" title="User:Orpingtonian">Orpingtonian</a> 12:30, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I still don't understand why you think that including CD4 criteria is arcane and prejudicial, but since this debate doesn't directly relate to the article perhaps we should drop it. I stated that the 1993 European definition "is identical to the 1993 CDC definition except that it excludes CD4 criteria". Do you think there is anything wrong with this statement?</dd>

<dd>All AIDS case definitions exist for surveillance purposes. More sophisticated staging systems for HIV disease are used in clinical care and research. CDC surveillance reports include data on "people living with AIDS", which means living people who have at some point been diagnosed with AIDS, regardless of their current state of health. European surveillance reports tend not to include such data. Is this what you mean by AIDS diagnoses "not standing"? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 12:53, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've just noticed that the article section in question is misleadingly titled. It confuses the CDC "Revised Classification System for HIV Infection" (used in medical practice and research) with the "Expanded Surveillance Case Definition for AIDS" (used in surveillance). This definitely needs clearing up. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 13:05, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think your suggested edit is perfectly fair; but I still think that <i>“The AIDS diagnosis still stands even if, after treatment, the CD4+ T cell count rises to above 200 per µL of blood or other AIDS-defining illnesses are cured”</i> needs to be clarified and moved futher up the paragraph, so that it comes before your suggested revision.</p>
<p>The reason that European surveillance reports tend not to include such data is that it is no longer considered particularly relevant and that there is a concerted effort to avoid stigmatising people (most of whom, in the devloped world, will ever die of an AIDS defining illness) with a diagnosis that pleases reporting, but doesn’t reflect their curent state of health. As individuals (not numbers), people in Europe are only regarded as having AIDS if they are CURRENTLY suffering from an AIDS defining illness. Whilst HIV can't be cured; AIDS is certainly reversable in most people .. even in those who are diagnosed very late and well beyond the point at which the CDC classifications would label them as suffering from AIDS.</p>

<dd>A statement that something in the article is "arcane and prejudicial" is certainly relevant to discussion of article content, and doesn't necessarily need a reference since it's a comment about how the article needs to be changed, not draft wording to be actually put into the article. (If we agree that something seems "arcane and prejudicial" to us Wikipedian editors we will probably want to delete it from the article or at least enclose it firmly in quotation marks.) However, in this case I think it does need an explanation: in what way do you see it as "arcane and prejudicial"? Oh, wait -- you didn't say you see it as arcane and prejudicial; you said most developed countries see it as arcane and prejudicial. In that case, maybe you do need to present a citation to convince us that they see it that way. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 13:56, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A very good overview of AIDS definitions, staging systems and classification systems can be found <a href="http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite.jsp?page=kb-01&amp;doc=kb-01-01" class="external text" title="http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite.jsp?page=kb-01&amp;doc=kb-01-01" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It points out that the CDC classification system was in fact not intended to be a staging system, although it is often used as such. I think that you and I have been talking at cross purposes, mixing up the different systems and definitions. This was my fault and I should have spotted it sooner.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the quoted sentence should be changed, and I agree with your statement about European surveillance reports. The differences between the US and Europe are mainly due to differences in systems of health care. As I'm sure you know, the distribution of US federal funding for HIV treatment and care is largely determined by the surveillance statistics, and is never sufficient to meet demand. In this context it is useful to distinguish between people who are still asymptomatic and those who have previously been diagnosed with AIDS, who are likely to need treatment. Generally in Europe, access to treatment is less of a problem, so the number of people "living with AIDS" has less relevance.</dd>

<dd>An "anti-HIV effect" can be a lot of things that are a very long way short of a "cure".

<dd>I don’t think MastCell is suggesting any sort of suppression or lack of worth - merely that the fact that extract of frog may, or may not, have anti-HIV properties, and may have found its way into an experimental environment, isn’t really of any particular relevance to this article .. although it could perhaps be of interest in an article about frogs.<br />
When stories like these crop up, they are, more often than not, seeded to highlight the importance of protecting biodiversity .. not to report an important medical discovery.<br />
If a chemical compound has been identified in nature and subsequently used in medicine (nothing even remotely unusual in that), then it is highly unlikely that it will forever be flagged as ‘extract of frog’ (in preference to its chemical name) .. or that there will be an easily identifiable trail back to the original reports about frogs. The fact that it isn’t now identified as ‘extract of frog’ doesn’t mean it hasn’t (or wont) receive a mention.<br />
Anyway, I have had a quick look through the material that I have access to and I don’t see any obvious sign of the frog connection cropping up again. <a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrpingtonian_36fb.html" title="User:Orpingtonian">Orpingtonian</a> 16:08, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Hence, also, the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> injunction to "Avoid citing the popular press on scientific matters." The same thing comes up at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> - every time a tumor shrinks in a rat somewhere, there's talk of adding a long section to the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> article about the new "cure".
