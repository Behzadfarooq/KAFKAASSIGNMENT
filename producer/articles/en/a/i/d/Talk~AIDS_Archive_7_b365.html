<h2><span class="mw-headline">Oral Sex?</span></h2>
<p>The article says AIDS can be transmitted by oral sex. I thought the risk for this was negligable?--<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonjaaa_33fb.html" title="User:Sonjaaa">Sonjaaa</a> 06:26, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course it can be transmitted by oral sex. If the receiving partner has sores or open wounds in the mouth, for example. Also I&#160;:believe it is possible to absorb it even without open wounds/sores, but I lack an actual source and I'm about to sleep&#160;:) -- take it&#160;:for what it's worth, though I'm sure you will find evidence if you look for it. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiepants_dbc7.html" title="User:Piepants">Piepants</a> 02:10, 15 June 2006 (UTC)Piepants</dd>
<dd>As the CDC table makes quite clear, the probablilty of transmission is small but nonzero -- 0.01% per act for the person giving the BJ and 0.005% per act for the person recieving it. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 06:34, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually the article says that "HIV is transmitted through oral sex" and this is a direct quote from UNAIDS <a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/Resources/faq/faq_transmission.asp#7" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unaids.org/en/Resources/faq/faq_transmission.asp#7" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> This is precisely the problem that editors have when sources are removed by other editors.

<dd>The CDC table implies that the risk of catching hiv by having se with an infected person is less than 1%? If it is that low, why so much money spent on the safe sex issue? <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungSpinoza_c6a3.html" title="User:YoungSpinoza">Javier</a>
<dl>
<dd>Because that's the risk per "encounter". If the risk is 1% each time and you do it 50 times, on average you'll be infected. Sure, nobody does it 50 times in a single one-night stand, but it doesn't take a terribly long relationship to reach those numbers. Colden46 06:40, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If I recall my statistics lessons correctly, after 50 times, you will have a 39,5% chance of being infected ((1 - 0,99^50) *100%) --<a href="../../../w/o/u/User%7EWouterstomp_b006.html" title="User:Wouterstomp">WS</a> 11:13, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but u must do it 50 times with an infected person, and most probably, unless you live in swaziland, your partner will not be infected. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungSpinoza_c6a3.html" title="User:YoungSpinoza">Javier</a></dd>

<p>What if you have got one with a condom on. Will that cause Aids?</p>
<p>Over at medhelp.org, in their HIV/Safe sex forum, the doctor there says on several occasions that no known case of oral-only transmission is on record. Can anyone produce a medical jounral that contradicts what he's telling people? Or are the statistics that are presented here are several orders of magnatude higher than reality? 206.156.242.36 14:24, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This reference (Rothenberg RB, Scarlett M, del Rio C, Reznik D, O‚Daniels C: Oral transmission of HIV. AIDS 1998, 12:2095-2105) <a href="http://www.aidsonline.com/pt/re/aids/fulltext.00002030-199816000-00004.htm;jsessionid=GR9Ly9g7b9L2TdpnrL06kHtwBl7MyNrRpbkpL3G4vQF2mkCL3HzG!-1110070904!-949856144!8091!-1?nav=reference|" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aidsonline.com/pt/re/aids/fulltext.00002030-199816000-00004.htm;jsessionid=GR9Ly9g7b9L2TdpnrL06kHtwBl7MyNrRpbkpL3G4vQF2mkCL3HzG!-1110070904!-949856144!8091!-1?nav=reference|" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, may be helpful, specifically the section titled "transmission estimates". Quoting: "In an assessment of per-contact risk for transmission associated with four types of homosexual contact, Vittinghoff et al. [28] estimated that the risk for unprotected receptive anal sex (0.24%; 95% CI, 0.05-0.43) was eight times the risk for unprotected receptive oral sex (0.03%; 95% CI, 0.01-0.18)." In light of this, and other statsistics from this journal article, I think it would be fair to include oral sex as a method of transmission. However, seeing as it is less risky (by almost an order of magnitude), it perhaps should be mentioned seperately from the more common transmission events. We don't want to give the impression that it is as easy to get it from oral sex as it is from anal sex, or blood transfusions. -20:17, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just glanced through the article, and noticed that the main body is a bit disorganized (it reads in a very 'disjointed' manner, with topics being dropped and/or interrupted, and then resumed (and subsequently dropped again) farther down the page). I don't really trust myself quite yet to re-structure it at that scale, so I thought I'd mention it here. DarkMasterBob 10:08, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>under Infection by HIV heading, "the median survival time after developing AIDS is only 9.2 months", and under symptomology, "After the diagnosis of AIDS is made, the average survival time is estimated to be 2-3 years".

<dd>Someone has misinformed you. AIDS results from infection with the HIV virus, and the virus can only be transmitted during sex if one of the people having sex is already infected by HIV. If two men who are not infected have sex, they will remain not infected afterwards. (Note, though, that this doesn't mean that sex with someone who has a negative HIV test is risk-free: one can be infected for weeks before the test becomes positive.). - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 16:54, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Is there a way to number the references in the reference section with the numbers generated throughout the text?

<dd>The template {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_label_71be.html" title="Template:Ref label">ref label</a>}} is probably what you want.

<dd>So the numbers have to be put in manually then... not good if the references are changed and added to over a period of time by different authors. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 23:37, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, I misunderstood your motivation for including numbers in the footnote seaction. Since the references throughout the body of the document use {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_0622.html" title="Template:Ref">ref</a>}}, they each get their own number, so what about ordering the footnote section to match and changing its unnumbered list ("*...") to a numbered one ("#...")? The subsequent challenge is to keep the order of the references in the document the same as the order in the footnote area. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a> 23:49, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You could always use the new &lt;ref&gt; and &lt;references/&gt; tags. For example: "A is a letter in the [[English language]]&lt;ref name=English&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The letter A is derived from Egyptian [[hieroglyph]]s&lt;ref name="English"/&gt;.". Then type "&lt;references/&gt; into the refrence section. This produces:</p>
<p>A is a letter in the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a><sup id="_ref-English_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-English" title="">[1]</a></sup>. The letter A is derived from <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_hieroglyph.html" title="Egyptian hieroglyph">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a><sup id="_ref-English_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-English" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><a name="References_2" id="References_2"></a></p>

A useful approach may be found in the thinking of Dr. Leo Galland, M.D. He has made a practice of complicated immune cases, and has subsequently developed protocols that he has written about (search online for him, his Foundation for Integrated Medicine, and/or his articles on Leaky Gut Syndromes).</p>
<p>He breaks down such cases into a cycle of allergic reaction (usually dietary), malnutrition, bacterial disquilibrium, then the resultant strain on liver function and expression of relevant symptoms.</p>
<p>Based on patient lab tests, a physician can ascertain the likely systemic cause of the situation, then goes about an appropriate course of treatment--generally meaning a person first avoids their allergens, then rids themselves of internal problem microgrowth (sometimes with antibiotics), then builds back their immunity, with a basic rotation diet of natural unprocessed food supplemented with vitamins, minerals, amino acids, probiotics, and herbs.</p>
<p>(Galland's credentials include degrees from Harvard, New York University, and training at Bellevue Hospital.)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Prevention section</span></h2>
<p>No objections to the above... and it might give room for a suggestion for one more portion for the prevention section--something like "other prevention technology" which would include post-exposure prophylaxis, and vaccine and microbicide development. I don't have time to do this in the next couple of days but can help later if folks are interested. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoewright_b777.html" title="User:Joewright">Joewright</a> 15:46, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like this idea, and have an extra paragraph to suggest at the end of section 4.1 ("Sexual Contact", under "Transmission and Prevention", to discuss a previously unmentioned potential protective measure which I think should follow on well from the previous paragraph on current research into circumcision. This paragraph would go as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Current research is also in progress towards the development of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microbicide.html" title="Microbicide">microbicides</a>: creams or gels containing pharmaceutical agents and lubricant properties which might help prevent the transmission of HIV and/or other STIs. The advantage of such an intervention is that it might allow a woman in a relationship with a male partner who is unwilling to use a condom to have some measure of protection, and it might also provide an extra security net in the case of condom breakage. "</p>
<p>If nobody objects, I'll append this paragraph to the indicated section next week or so. Vaccines and PEP would probably deserve a separate section, however.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Acronym formatting</span></h2>
<p>The formatting of the <i>AIDS</i> introductory paragraph has some problems that I hope to resolve here before its back and forth editing blooms into a war. Two problems I notice with the formatting are its capitalization and disruptive italics. It currently appears as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>AIDS</b>, or <b>Aids</b>, is an <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym_and_initialism.html" title="Acronym and initialism">acronym</a> for <b><i>A</i>cquired <i>I</i>mmuno<i>D</i>eficiency <i>S</i>yndrome</b> or <b><i>A</i>cquired <i>I</i>mmune <i>D</i>eficiency <i>S</i>yndrome</b> and is defined as a collection of symptoms and infections resulting from the specific damage to the immune system caused by infection with the <b><a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">human immunodeficiency virus</a></b>, commonly called <b>HIV</b>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Although treatments for both AIDS and HIV exist to slow the virus' progression in a human patient, there is no known cure.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since the expansion of <i>AIDS</i> is not a proper noun, the capitalization seems wrong. I.e., contrast the lowercase common noun expansion of <i><a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a></i> as <i>human immunodeficiency virus</i> and of <i><a href="../../../s/a/r/SARS_4359.html" title="SARS">SARS</a></i> as <i>severe acute respiratory syndrome</i> with the uppercase proper noun expansion of <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/NATO_bffc.html" title="NATO">NATO</a></i> as <i>North Atlantic Treaty Organisation</i> and of <i><a href="../../../n/a/f/NAFTA_941e.html" title="NAFTA">NAFTA</a></i> as <i>North American Free Trade Agreement</i>).</p>
<p>It may be helpful to identify the letters used to make non-obvious acronyms, but identifying them with italics only seems distracting for an obvious acronym like <i>AIDS</i> .</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html#Acronyms_and_abbreviations" title="WP:MoS">Wikipedia Manual of Style standard for acronyms</a> does not specifically address formatting for acronyms in titles and related words:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Do not assume that your reader is familiar with the acronym or abbreviation that you are using. The standard writing style is to spell out the acronym or abbreviation on the first reference (wikilinked if appropriate) and then show the acronym or abbreviation after it. This signals to readers to look out for it later in the text, and makes it easy for them to refer back to it, for example:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_New_Democratic_Party_0991.html" title="Ontario New Democratic Party">New Democratic Party</a> (NDP) won the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1990.html" title="Ontario general election, 1990">1990 Ontario election</a> with a significant majority. The NDP quickly became unpopular with the voters, however.....</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As the MoS stands, the proper formatting of our introductory paragraph would probably be more like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome</b>, or <b>acquired immune deficiency syndrome</b> (or <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym_and_initialism.html" title="Acronym and initialism">acronym</a> <b>AIDS</b> or <b>Aids</b>), is a collection of symptoms and infections resulting from the specific damage to the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immune_system.html" title="Immune system">immune system</a> caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (<a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a>).<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Although treatments for both AIDS and HIV exist to slow the virus' progression in a human patient, there is no known cure.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Does that look right? If that looks right, an update to the MoS may help show that the style is appropriate for titles as well. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a> 16:25, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

HIV/AIDS have entered into common parlance, both Webster's and Oxford dictionaries have entries under the abbreviations, and most users will intuitively enter <b>HIV</b> or <b>AIDS</b> (or <b>Aids</b>, or even <b>aids</b>) in a search box; that's where I think the articles should reside. The various spell-outs can act as redirects. I'm not rigid on this, though. Perhaps this is begging for a standard too?

<dd>I guess that sums it up, but not totally. I'm unsure if the guideline you cite above is authoritative, even though examples like <a href="../../../s/e/v/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome.html" title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome">Severe acute respiratory syndrome</a> adhere to it. Contrast this, however, with other popular acronyms/articles (for arguably cryptic spell-outs, as noted in the guideline further above) like <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/t/SETI_0570.html" title="SETI">SETI</a>. Similarly, I maintain that the simpler form <b>AIDS</b> is so overwhelmingly known that to move/redirect it would be unnecessary. In addition, the article is not merely medical, it's encyclopedic: serving as a resource for professionals and not alike, and few of the latter (methinks) would know the spell-out to type it out. Moreover, which long form name should such an article be entitled under: ...immunod.../...immune d.../...Immunod...? And what of <b><a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a></b>?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">real quick question</span></h2>
<p>it's been a while since i've contributed in the AIDS article here, but i wanted to ask anyways.&#160;:) does the CDC definition of AIDS diagnosis only apply to those when they are unmedicated? for instance, if one is HIV+ and the cd4 drops under 200, yet after <a href="../../../h/a/a/HAART_c681.html" title="HAART">HAARTs</a> they pop up to say 350, do they still have AIDS? for that matter, if they develop say esophageal <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candidiasis.html" title="Candidiasis">candidiasis</a>, an <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opportunistic_infection.html" title="Opportunistic infection">opportunistic infection</a>, and it is successfully treated, does that change the AIDS diagnosis? i was under the impression once you are diagnosed that was it, but nothing is stated to this in the text (or maybe so and i just haven't seen it). the article should say 'regardless of treatment effects' if it is true just to make things more clear. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 02:10, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Font size for references</span></h2>
<p>Hi all. There is a proposal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29#proposed_change_to_css_.28.references.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29#proposed_change_to_css_.28.references.29" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> to create and use a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascading_Style_Sheets_981c.html" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</a> class "references-small" which would specify the font size for references in articles where small reference font is wanted, as in AIDS. The proposed changed to AIDS would then be to replace</p>
<dl>
<dd><code>&lt;div style="font-size:90%"&gt; &lt;references/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code></dd>
</dl>
<p>with</p>
<dl>
<dd><code>&lt;div class="references-small"&gt; &lt;references/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code></dd>
</dl>
<p>The manual of style favors font-sizes in CSS instead of in articles (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MOS#Formatting_issues" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MOS#Formatting_issues" rel="nofollow">Formatting issues</a>). The definition for references-small in the CSS would be</p>
<dl>
<dd><code>.references-small { font-size:90%; }</code> in <a href="../../../c/o/m/MediaWiki%7ECommon.css_d42e.html" title="MediaWiki:Common.css">Mediawiki:common.css</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So there would be <u>no visible change</u> for the AIDS article. I also have no intention to ever change the definition of "references-small" to a larger font, despite me wanting to have a 100% font for the references. The advantage of moving the font size into CSS is that I (and others) can use my own private CSS file (which overrides the default only for me) (example: <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_monobook.css_8643.html" title="User:Ligulem/monobook.css">User:Ligulem/monobook.css</a>).

<p>hi everyone. i'm sure this has been discussed before, but i was over at [[Randy Shilts]'s article, (who wrote <a href="../../../a/n/d/And_the_Band_Played_On_5d32.html" title="And the Band Played On">And the Band Played On</a>, great book on the beginnings of AIDS), and it is phrased there that he 'died from AIDS'. shouldn't it be 'died from AIDS-related illness'? and why the heck isn't there that article yet, or at least a redirect to <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opportunistic_infections.html" title="Opportunistic infections">opportunistic infections</a>? <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 02:39, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If someone dies of an AIDS related illness, one is simultaneously dying of AIDS. It's better to be specific if one can. A man who dies of an acute myocardial infarction secondary to thrombus formation in the left anterior descending artery is also dying of a hypertension-related illness and a hypercholesterolemia-related illness, but the former formulation is more informative. (In short, nearly all proximate causes of death have ancillary, underlying, or related secondary causes of death. If someone dies of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia secondary to AIDS, that's the most informative way of specifying it.) - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 03:42, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>of course, if the illness is described it would be better to state it in addition to being afflicted with AIDS. however, AIDS never really kills a person per se, it makes them suceptable to extremely dangerous and fatal disease. at least thats how i understand it. so would it not be more accurate to describe someone 'dying of AIDS' as 'dying of AIDS related illness'? the cons i can think of for that are however that it sounds more vauge (even if it's more precise), and that if i kill someone with a gun, i killed them just as much as the bullet did. opinions anyone?</dd>

<dd>If the proximate cause of death is unknown (i.e., if the death is reported as "of AIDS-related causes") then "dying of AIDS" and "dying of AIDS-related illness" provide exactly the same amount of information. I don't know that uniformity is necessary. What <i>would</i> be good is determining the actual cause of death. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 20:12, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should somebody maybe update the chart about transmission rates of AIDS?? It's from 1992.. Not very helpful. thanks, <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdo191_0ce6.html" title="User:Ardo191">Ardo</a> 22:59, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Guys, this thing is written like an 8th grader with a medical dictionary. How did this happen? It first of all needs to be a bit more accessible; it isn't actually that hard. For example 'malignancies' to 'malignant cancers'. Also, the long run on sentences are tiring, especially when packed with like 8 diseases in their original latin that you'd never remember anyways. Try and keep examples to 2 or 3. Here's what i mean:</p>
<pre>
  High-grade B cell lymphomas such as Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt's-like lymphoma, 
  and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including primary central nervous system lymphoma, 
  have substantially increased incidence in HIV-infected patients and often portend a poor prognosis.
</pre>
<p>to something a little easier on the eyes:</p>
<pre>
  High-grade B cell lymphomas such as Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt's-like lymphoma, and diffuse
  large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), show up a lot more in HIV-infected patients. These particular 
  cancers often foreshadow a poor prognosis.
</pre>
<p>I'm pretty sure this is all related to people adding little bits here and there, but it just kinda got out of hand. This whole article could use a good thorough copyedit. Anyone else agree? <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 17:51, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. Sorry guys, i'm hung over and <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">being bold</a>, so if i remove anything that is totally vital you let me know (as i'm being kinda ruthless on my edits here).</p>

<dd>Agreed. This article is needlessly overloaded with medical terminology in parts. ---<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 05:50, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
