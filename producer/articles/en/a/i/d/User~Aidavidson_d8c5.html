	    <p><b>== Music of Scotland: The Jacobite Era ==</b></p>
<p>The Jocobite era in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> from 1688 until 1745 gave way to a new type and style of music, but to understand the music a brief history is necessary. No other time period is looked upon so proudly and romantically. This era got its name from the Latin word Jacobus which was after King James II and VII. The <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobite_rebellion.html" title="Jacobite rebellion">Jacobite rebellion</a> was spawned from a political movement whose goal was to restore the Stuart kings to the thrones of England and Scotland. These uprising ended with the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Culloden_e0f1.html" title="Battle of Culloden">battle of Culloden</a> under the command of a young Prince Charles Edward Stuart or more commonly known as “Bonnie Prince Charlie” and was the destruction of the proud Highland army.</p>
<p>Many songs evolved from this time period, many which have become very popular folk songs in Scotland today. The lyrics tell the story of <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnie_Prince_Charlie_d6fd.html" title="Bonnie Prince Charlie">Bonnie Prince Charlie</a>, the many battles they fought, and loves that they missed. One such song entitled, “Ballad of Glencoe/Massacre of Glencoe” truly encompasses this time period with lyrics like, “They came in the night when the men were asleep, This band of Argyles, through snow soft and deep, Like murdering foxes amongst helpless sheep, They slaughtered the house of MacDonald.”</p>
<p>The music of Scotland can be described as pulsitile, three or four beat rhythm with tradition European scales. The music that evolved from this era is no different. The instruments used during these years of war were usually small and light; instruments that were easy to transport. The instruments were considered either professional or amateur instruments. Most likely, the Jacobite military played the “amateur” instruments. These amateur instruments included the recorder (up to about 1740), <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flute.html" title="Flute">flute</a> (from about 1725), <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violin.html" title="Violin">violin</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cello.html" title="Cello">cello</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagpipe.html" title="Bagpipe">bagpipe</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harpsichord.html" title="Harpsichord">harpsichord</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinet.html" title="Spinet">spinet</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clavichord.html" title="Clavichord">clavichord</a> (these last two up to about 1740), and the <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> (from about 1780). The <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennywhistle.html" title="Pennywhistle">pennywhistle</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fiddle.html" title="Fiddle">fiddle</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banjo.html" title="Banjo">banjo</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandolin.html" title="Mandolin">mandolin</a>, the bombarde, and of course, the bagpipe were all instruments seen and heard during the marches to war and ones that still have quite and influence in today traditional Scottish music. The bagpipe was used more in the early eighteenth century and was used to intimidate the enemy going into battle. With its loud harmonics and deafening drone, the bagpipe was a good instrument to do just that. It was also used for communication between clans and troops. The pennywhistle and mandolin were the most common instruments used to pass the time traveling long distances.</p>
<p>Many songs sung today in Scotland have a strong influence from this time period; this is largely correlated to new printing technology during this era. Some examples of music printed during the early 1700’s include James Watson's Choice Collection of Comic and Serious Scots Poems both Ancient and Modern 1711 and Ancient and modern Scottish songs, heroic ballads, etc.: collected from memory, tradition and ancient authors 1776. The latter included ballads such as “Ye Jacobites by Name,” “Wha'll Be King but Charlie?”, “Battle of Culloden” and “The Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond.”</p>
<p>Dancing was an important part of Jacobite culture. These Scottish dances reflected religious beliefs, narrative ballads, and ceremonial rights. Almost any form of music could be used for dancing. The fiddle was the most popular instrument in the eighteenth century for dancing, but if a fiddle was not available its place could be taken by the bagpipe, by the pennywhistle, by a harp, singing, or diddling (a sort of vocalization in which the tune is articulated to 'dum-di-diddle-um' syllables). It was also common in earlier periods for dancing, singing, and playing to proceed simultaneously. Many of the types and styles of dancing that were performed during the Jacobite Era are still performed today within more traditional circles.</p>
<p>Music, lyrics, and dance spawn from experiences and from cultures telling a story. The music of Scotland from the Jacobite era tells of story of regaining freedom through war and trust, love and hate. The instruments used during this time are instruments still used today, the lyrics of that period are lyrics still sung today, and the dances that were performed are danced today. Such an important time period has left its print in the hearts of the people of Scotland and the music they enjoy.</p>
