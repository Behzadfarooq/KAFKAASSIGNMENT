<h2><span class="mw-headline">Citations needed</span></h2>
<p>I'll start tackling some of citation-needed tags... better referencing would certainly be useful. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 16:28, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like your edits to the content, and most of your references are good. However, the references on HIV and STIs were related more to increased transmission risks than to epidemiological comparisons, so I cut them.

<dd>Also, it's worth noting that false positive rates depend on the population being tested, and testing procedures vary around the world (e.g. Western blot tests are not standard in the UK, where three ELISAs are used, and the WHO recommends that fewer tests may be used in areas where prevalence is very high). <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 20:25, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Appreciate the review... I will find another reference for the HIV/STI link; there are quite a few out there. I think we're close to being able to remove the "sources" tag; I'm not as familiar with the dissident literature, so perhaps someone who is can fill in a few of the requested citations for dissident claims. I believe the Western blot detects actual HIV antigens (eg p24) as opposed to antibodies, so have changed that back; I'll triple-check this (a minor point). You're absolutely right about the effect of prevalence on test accuracy and I'll try to specify that in the article (eg low- vs. high-risk populations). I can only speak to the testing situation in the US; thanks for clarifying. I'll consider looking at the Duesberg hypothesis page, but my blood pressure can only take editing so many controversial topics in a single day. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 20:32, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm quite sure that the HIV Western blot test detects antibodies (for example see <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001431.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001431.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). The HIV/STI statement we need a reference for is: "the risk groups for AIDS are generally the same as those for other sexually transmitted diseases". This can easily be seen by comparing AIDS stats with STI stats, but it would be nice to have a single document to reference. The article's looking quite good now, and I agree that the "sources" tag could be removed soon. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 20:51, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Further Reading"</span></h2>
<p>Here's a thought... how would people feel about removing the "Further Reading" section? It's ballooned to an ungodly length and is one of the reasons that this article is so unwieldy. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 23:08, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the "Further reading" section consists of documents that were once highly relevant. A few months ago the article (which had become quite lengthy) was "hacksawed" and all the orphaned references were dumped in this section (see <a href="../../../a/i/d/Talk%7EAIDS_reappraisal_371e.html#References" title="Talk:AIDS reappraisal">earlier discussion</a>). It might be a good idea to consult <a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> before making any major changes, since he wrote most of the original article. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 19:11, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm going to remove the "Further Reading" as the article is just too long; if these sources are directly relevant, they should be cited in the article. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 00:29, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name=".22Not_verified.22_tag"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Not verified" tag</span></h2>
<p>How would people feel about removing the "not verified" tag from the top of the article? I think it is almost fully sourced. The few "citation needed" tags remaining deal with the claims of AIDS dissidents; these are duly noted. If anyone can provide sources or citations for these claims (eg AIDS reappraisal literature from which the claims are taken), that would be very helpful. But I do think we can remove the scarlet letter of the "not verified" tag, since almost everything in this article (certainly all scientific claims) are sourced now. Thoughts? <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 01:05, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the tag was there to indicate that some of the dissident claims were not verified, but not to indicate that it was not verified that those claims were made. Initially many of the dissident claims were simply stated as fact without indicating who made the claim, and there is still some of that left. However, I think that the citation needed tags make this clear as well. So I think removing the tag sould be fine. But wait for others to chime in since this article gets pretty contentious. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets"><font color="red"><u>Nrets</u></font></a> 01:15, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">peer review</span></h2>
<p>i just gave this article a peer review. i've made lots of {{citationneeded}} as this article makes a lot of claims that aren't backed up. also to note that the simple prose "HIV causes AIDS" was stepped around a whole <i>ton</i>. Examples i've simplfied:</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">
<tr>
<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">
<ul>
<li>The dissidents assert that the currently dominant view of AIDS, based on causation by HIV, has resulted in inaccurate diagnoses...</li>
<li>Dissidents allege a lack of sound scientific method proving causation of AIDS by HIV.</li>
<li>AIDS has been the subject of many thousands of peer-reviewed studies over the past twenty years, and a clear consensus view has developed that HIV is the causative factor for AIDS.</li>
<li>According to dissidents, failure to satisfy these postulates, especially the first two, may cast doubt on HIV as the cause of AIDS.</li>
<li>Skeptics of the HIV theory of AIDS claim that the process of testing individuals for the presence of HIV is flawed.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Also this article takes a heavy 'us vs. them' viewpoint, which seems pretty POV to me. I know the nature of the article leads towards minority vs mainstream, but i don't think that it needs to be this bad. Example from Patterns of spread:</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">
<tr>
<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Dissidents also note that in North America and Western Europe, AIDS spreads non-randomly, affecting specific groups of people, and, moreover, that it is fragmented into distinct sub-epidemics with different distributions of AIDS-defining diseases. According to dissidents, AIDS in Africa looks completely different from the corresponding syndrome in North America and Western Europe; one example that has been cited is that in Africa AIDS affects roughly equal numbers of men and women, while in North America and Western Europe it affects more men than women. Dissidents also point out that the parts of the world worst affected by AIDS tend to have widespread malnutrition and poor living conditions.</td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Every sentence starts with 'Dissidents think this' or 'Dissidents call to that'. It is a frequent fallback to this article. It sets up a kind of straw man which half the time or more is followed by an unverified claim. Combine this with it being used over 30 times in the article...you get what i mean. 'Skeptics of _______' is another phrase used too much. This needs to be changed.</p>
<p>There is a source from <a href="http://www.harpers.org/OutOfControl.html" class="external text" title="http://www.harpers.org/OutOfControl.html" rel="nofollow">Harpers Magazine</a> written by Celia Farber that is used 7 times, and often very very prominently. She is a reporter and not a doctor, and this source should be removed and replaced with scientific peer reviewed research. It's friggin Harper's Magazine, not a journal.</p>
<p>Finally, the HIV test accurancy section states:</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">
<tr>
<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Skeptics of the theory that HIV causes AIDS claim that the process of testing individuals for the presence of HIV is flawed. They assert there is a high probability of encountering a false positive, which would falsely identify someone as HIV-positive when in fact they were HIV-negative[citation needed], e.g. because of pregnancy or cross-reactivity with malaria antibodies.</td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>which is followed up the paragraph after the next with:</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">
<tr>
<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Current methods of HIV antibody testing are remarkably accurate: the false-positive rate among the American public ranges from 0.0006 to 0.0007 percent.[34][35] The false-negative rate for HIV antibody testing ranges from 0.001% to 0.3%, depending on the risk factors of the tested population.[36][37][38]</td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>

<dd>My hearty congratulations for having slogged through. As to the last point, though, it's both, not one or the other: Dissidents claim that HIV testing is inaccurate, but the facts don't bear them out. That doesn't stop them from repeating the claim, of course. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 19:55, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Peer review</span></h2>
<p>Thank you for the peer review, <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a>. I appreciate the need for citations. Can you help find citations for some of the things you've tagged? I'm struggling a little; it seems most of the people who really believe in AIDS reappraisal (and thus might be a little more conversant with useful sources for the claims) have left and migrated to their own AIDSwiki, after realizing that Wikipedia was not a place where they could expound their beliefs free of scientific criticism and verification. At least, that's the impression I get from this and related talk pages.</p>

<dd>I went over to AIDSwiki and its pretty much defunct (3 user pages, low content, etc.) so i don't think i'll be able to pull much from there. I'll see what i can do.</dd>

<p>Celia Farber's article is frequently referenced because it is a compendium of quite a few dissident ideas and rationales. You won't find scientific, peer-reviewed evidence for these claims - or I should say, I haven't. If you are able to, PLEASE add it, because I agree the article would be stronger if it didn't rely on Farber's article for so many dissident claims. The AIDS reappraisal movement seems to be predominantly a social movement of lay activists, rather than a scientific movement, so I think the Harper's article is a reasonable source.</p>

<dd>This article is a direct critique of mainstream <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> consensus theory. Much of that critique is questioning the very scientific peer-reviewed evidence that backs it up. To say that AIDS reappraisal can't be held to the same scientific standards gives them a cart blanche to say whatever they want. And, that isn't allowed here on wikipedia, as we have <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>.</dd>

<dd>I agree 100%. AIDS reappraisal cannot meet the same scientific standards as consensus AIDS theory; virtually all peer-reviewed science discredits the AIDS-reappraisalists. Farber's article is a reliable source for the <i>claims</i> dissidents make; of course, it's not a reliable source for science or scientific claims. In order to point up this distinction, I've prefaced everything with "Dissidents claim..." etc, and tried to follow it up with the actual scientific evidence which addresses the claim. Unforuntately, that's made the article kind of unwieldy, as you pointed out. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 19:35, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Taking things from the "AIDS Wiki" is a bad idea. Besides being deliberately biased, it's much less reliable than the Farber article, which itself is a poor quality reference. There are plenty of articles written by dissident scientists to be found on numerous web sites, some of which have been published in peer reviewed journals. Try duesberg.com, <s>perthgroup.com</s> theperthgroup.com and virusmyth.net for starters. Or try looking through the "Further reading" list that was recently (and sensibly) cut from this article. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 21:54, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you have a work-around for the "Dissidents claim..." intro to every sentence, I'd be open to it. I agree it gets awkward and repetitive. However, the alternative is to present these claims as factual, when in fact they are the view of a vocal minority which is unsupported by scientific consensus. The compromise has been to present the dissident claim, followed by the response of the mainstream scientific community. It's not great for readability, and certainly if you have a better way of doing it, go for it. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 19:51, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>From what I've read, much of the early skepticism about the viral theory of AIDS did stem from a minority among the American gay community, and was in part related to (perhaps not unreasonable) distrust of government scientists. I think this deserves a mention. I'll try to find some references.</li>
<li>Several of the "citationneeded" tags were unnecessary; in each case the reference cited at the end of the paragraph was sufficient to cover everything that preceded it. Please take more time to read the references in future before adding the tags.</li>

<p>I totally agree that "estimates of deaths" is accurate, and I think we've provided reliable sources for the claim. I differ with Nuhn-huh in that I think "alleged harm" doesn't suggest the allegations are false, just that they are alleged rather than proven. The accusation that AIDS denial kills is a serious one that AIDS dissidents often use to portray the mainstream community as alarmist or unbalanced. I happen to think it's clear that the aggressive propragation of these views has a human cost (see <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Maggiore_14e4.html" title="Christine Maggiore">Christine Maggiore</a>), but i think that if it's presented in an inflammatory fashion it's going to polarize people rather than letting them make up their own minds. As always, though, I'll go along with whatever the general feeling on the talk page is; I don't feel terribly strongly about this particular point. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 19:50, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, sir. Those deathful effects are <i>"alleged"</i> by AIDS Officialists and denied by "AIDS Denialists" (or <i>AIDS Reappraisers</i>). If you give factual status to those effects you are talking from hte Officialist POV, and thus violating POV rules, due to the fact that this is an Encyclopedia, not the <a href="../../../c/d/c/CDC_b451.html" title="CDC">CDC</a> website. Sorry for calling you <i>"AIDS Officialist"</i>, but you started using charged expressions like <i>"Denialists"</i>.

<dd>Yes, that's one of the dissident arguments which I believe is discussed in this article. The response from the mainstream medical community (see the NIAID source) has been that drinking, starvation, VD, TB, etc have all been around for ages, but the epidemic explosion in cases of PCP, KS, etc is a new phenomenon, coinciding with the epidemic of HIV infection, and epidemiologically correlated. Again, these arguments are addressed in the article and in the sources cited therein.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Antibodies to HIV</span></h2>
<p>This section needs to be altered as it’s giving out a distorted message. By suggesting that antibodies cannot neutralise HIV implies that all people infected with are doomed. This is an unfair and wrong statement to make, especially if someone who is HIV positive reads this page. Humans have evolved alongside viruses for millions of years. Even bacteria have to deal with the threat of viral infection so all species of life on earth have developed perfectly evolved mechanisms for dealing with viruses. Therefore with this in mind, for a single virus strain to be 100% effective at killing all humans seems pretty unlikely given our past record of fending off viruses. Also, Wikipedia even has a page dedicated to HIV progression rates which states that there are individuals who are Long Term Non-Progressors (LTNPs) to HIV (i.e. immune to the effects of HIV) and never develop AIDS even without drugs. This has been scientifically proven to occur in at least 3% of people infected with HIV so it seems to me unfair to say that antibodies cannot neutralize HIV because they obviously are in LTNPs. This information needs to be taken into account because HIV positive people looking at this section will automatically assume they are going to develop AIDS when in actual fact they may never do. More work needs to be done to understand immunity in LTNPs and how the mechanisms of HIVs destructive capabilities can be negated. Without referring to this information in this section on antibodies I think debate is being stifled and the full story is not being told. Maybe the section could be renamed to resistance to HIV!! Does anyone else have any opinions on this? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by A4705693 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A4705693_c594.html" title="Special:Contributions/A4705693">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>There are clearly long-term non-progressors (LTNP's); they make up anywhere from 2-3% to 13% of HIV-infected patients in the US, depending on the study population. Some of them do produce neutralizing antibodies to HIV;
<dl>
<dd>EVERYONE produces "neutralizing antibodies to HIV", HIV is COMPLETELY neutralized by the immune system...that's why you can barely find it, and when you do, it barely does anything!!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>the majority also have a vigorous <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cellular_immunity.html" title="Cellular immunity">cell-mediated immune response</a> that likely keeps the virus in check. I've edited the paragraph in question to reflect that, in a small minority of cases, neutralizing antibodies to HIV may be produced and may contribute to becoming an LTNP. However, the idea propagated by some dissidents (eg Celia Farber) that antibodies=immunity is patently false; that was the thrust of the paragraph.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let's see, are you going to compare HIV to chronic herpes, shingles, etc., etc.?? Those are like night and day. With the latter, antibodies neutralize the virus, to a dormant state, the immune response subsides, at some point for some reason, the virus is reactivated, and reproduces, producing very large numbers of viruses, then the antibodies come back again to neutralize it, and so on and so forth...and this is what is called a chronic herpes/shingles infection. With HIV, this is night and day. Here, it is supposedly neutralized for 10 years, and then when it comes back, there's still no virus to speak of, there's hardly any of it to find, and it doesn't do anything. Nice comparison, though. 69.252.201.61 20:02, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Please: Sort out the crazy stuff from actual arguments</span></h2>
<p>As crazy and downright dumb as some of the statements may seem ("HIV does not cause AIDS!!!!11oneeleven"), some of the arguments do have some merit and are accepted by the mainstream. Stuff like the chance to get HIV as a man from a positive woman in an act of sex - 1/500. A lot of people - educators who like to tell "educational lies" - would prefer such figures to remain hidden, since they might incline people to stop practising safer sex. However, one of Wikipedia's strictest guidelines is that it is not censored. The question is how to present the facts in a sensible manner. Here's my hopefully inspiring try:</p>
<p>A HIV-infection does not cause AIDS 100% of the time - not within the 20 Scientific consensyears of research - meaning, a number of people who do get infected with HIV, will probably never develop AIDS in their natural lifetime. This is not to be confused with the (~2-3%?) number of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection because their immune cells lack the entry-vectors the HIV-1 virus needs. Vice versa, there are many known natural causes for immunodepression that do not involve HIV (although other viruses often play a role).</p>
<p>The problem with a lot of the "dissenters" (read: gays)</p>
<dl>
<dd>????????????? What planet are you on??</dd>
</dl>
<p>is wishful thinking: Since HIV and immunodepression can occur seperately, even though we *do* find a huge correlation between HIV and depression of the immune system, it *must* not be that the HIV is the cause of the immunodepression. A critical mind should be asking: Why the hell not?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ummmm...because correlation doesn't prove causation? Because HIV is biochemically inactive? Because HIV test results over 20 years vary continuously across categories of race, age, geography, and other categories incompatible with an infectious microbe?? Because of 1,001 different reasons??</dd>
</dl>
<p>Fact is still, a large number of the people infected with HIV will die within a short time, and the medication is utterly ineffective.</p>
<p>I want to point out the necessity that - even in this article, which I am sure is a shitfest of edit warring and batshit insane people, me included - objectivity has to be maintained. Both sides have good and bad arguments, a lot of science has gone through the window with both of them. Point out which arguments have merit, and which ones are stupid denial and whishful thinking, and those that are "educational lies". Right now the article contains about zero good arguments for either side.</p>
<p>As a final note, regarding the statistics: They're basically out of my ass. I remembered them from reading them sometime, they might be out of date or plain wrong. So they are "to the best of my (lazy) knowledge" 84.75.130.173 15:59, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BTW, do your homework, study the chain of factual concretes behind the different AIDS theories (official and unofficial), start to think for yourself (a very difficult task for the mayority of the people) and maybe <i>"HIV is the cause of AIDS"</i> is the assertion that will start to sound to you as <i>"crazy and downright dumb"</i>.</dd>

<dd>You missed my point, it was about the quality of the arguments in the article. Here's an example "HIV is the cause of AIDS" - Now, that may well be false, since there is no proof or mechanism known for this. But the statement "HIV does not cause AIDS" is just as false - Because you, I, nobody really, has any proof or evidence that HIV does *not* cause AIDS. Just because immunodepression can and does occur without HIV does not mean that the presence of HIV is somehow beneficial to the immune system.</dd>
<dd>This is a linguistic thing that you have to understand: AIDS is *defined* as a depressed immune system in the presence of HIV. Now what the statement "HIV does not cause AIDS" implies is that the presence of HIV does cause the nonpresence of an immune system deficiency. That is obviously nonsense: Since we defined AIDS as requiring HIV, AIDS is - linguistically - caused by HIV. Saying HIV does not cause AIDS is a falsism and that's the reason why people will not listen to you guys, even when you are right, if you don't change your marketing strategy quick. Try the following, true statement: "There is no known mechanism with which HIV destroys the immune system." That is much more precise as a way to sum up the dilemma in one sentence. 84.75.130.173 19:45, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you 100%. There is a shorter way to say your argument: <b>You can not be prove a negative</b>. To "prove" a concept is to provide a chain of reasons and arguments going backwards, leading to concretes. In case of a negative, there are no concretes, so a ngative (i.e., the non-existence of God) can not be proven. BTW, Kary Mullis and Peter Duesberg also said what you have just said. The burden of the proof is on the consensus side. The debate is on the quality of the proof that the consensus side has presented until now.<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandroide_fda5.html" title="User:Randroide">Randroide</a> 19:58, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think your argument is a little confused. We're not talking about a supernatural phenomenon (such as the existence of God), which of course cannot be proven or disproven by the scientific method. And we're not talking about "proving a negative". There are any number of methods for proving that HIV causes the constellation of immunodeficiency referred to as AIDS; there is also scientific consensus that the burden of proof has been met. Most HIV scientists have moved on to things like developing antiretrovirals that dramatically improve the survival of people with HIV. The burden of proof has shifted to the dissident side. It's going to take more than conspiracy theories and linguistic sophistry. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 20:00, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh, yes. They have "moved", <i>in the wrong direction</i>, but they have "moved", indeed.</p>
<p>Sophistry?. There is a nice piece of sophistry in your text: <i>developing antiretrovirals that dramatically improve the survival of people with HIV</i>.</p>

<p>"Antiretrovirals" had nothing to do with that improvement. I will tell you the real causes:</p>
<p><b>1.</b> The definition of AIDS was changed in 1993, to make it more inclusive of healthy people.</p>

<dd>Ahem. First of all, no matter how many times, studies, whatever that come up as proof, i've found reappraisalists as unsatisfied. It's quite frustrating really, but ce la vie. Second of all, just because you say it doesn't meet scientific consensus doesn't make it true.</dd>

<dd>Randroide, you think that someone with AIDS is gonna be helped by taking Aspirin? Of course science thinks that AZT helped people, there were labs, trials and mass perspcriptions that prove it. It isn't a case of <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc.html" title="Post hoc ergo propter hoc">Post hoc ergo propter hoc</a>.

<dd>Plus, as has been stated multiple times in this page, almost nobody is currently prescribed AZT monotherapy, AZT is not the only retroviral agent used to treat HIV infection and several others have been proven effective.

<p>On the other hand, perfectly healthy people "suffers" AIDS according with current AIDS definitions. YThose folks were not "AIDS patients" in the 1980´s, now they are. That´s one of the reasons of the "success" of the not-so-new "drug cocktails".</p>
<p>One thing is clear: <b>No one is going to be better taking immunosuppressants as AZT</b>. Read the Physician's Desk Reference: Drug manufacturers say openly that "side effects" from AZT are identical to the supposed effects of "HIV infection".</p>
<p>Only under a very, very narrow meaning of "consensus" it can be said that there is a "scientific consensus" about HIV and AIDS. Do you want to say that <i>"there is consensus"</i> discarding all the other menaings of the word?. O.K., go ahead.

<p>This (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandroide_fda5.html" title="User:Randroide">Randroide's</a> comment) is what I mean by sophistry. "<a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_consensus.html" title="Scientific consensus">Scientific consensus</a>" has a specific definition (narrow, if you wish). It doesn't mean every last person with a Ph.D. behind their names agree. Of course a consensus doesn't "create reality"; it reflects the best understanding available with current methods. Your arguments attempt to muddy these relatively straightforward points. The point about redefinition of AIDS is flatly incorrect, and reflects AIDS dissidents' reliance on out-of-date data. HAART (NRTI/NNRTI plus protease inhibitors) was introduced in 1995-1996, <b>after</b> the change in AIDS definition; the well-documented drop in mortality rates with HAART was therefore not due to redefinition. Finally, people with HIV are not treated until they progress (CD4 below 200-350 or AIDS-defining illness). To argue that "perfectly healthy" people are the ones being treated with antiretrovirals is also outdated and incorrect. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 18:46, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think we can agree that "perfectly healthy" youngish folks generally have a life expectancy better than 1-3 years; hence, HIV+ people with a CD4 &lt;200 are hardly "perfectly healthy". About tone, personal attacks, etc... I think <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> is doing a disservice to his argument by behaving abrasively on these pages (I assume this reflects, in some way, one's behavior in other venues).

<p>"and more specifically, with their dissatisifaction regarding the thoroughness of the evidence for the current thinking" A line that i inserted into the intro of the list of complaints aids reappraisalists have. There are no weasel words in the sentence. They are dissatisfied with the level of evidence. Its unfair to classify the group as a whole without focusing on the fact that their main unifying factor comes not with their personal opinions on the existence of aids and hiv and their relationship, but on their displeasure with the evidence behind the current status quo opinion on aids/hiv. If you can offer a better rephrasing that isn't, "weasled", perhaps that will work. I didn't want to delete the first clause in the sentence. I am just starting to explore this topic, but it strikes me that this article tends to overlap the opinions of various aids questioners. The other edit I made on the number of deaths caused by aids reappraisal was totally biased, and referred to no real numbers, but conjecture.</p>

<dd>Ah, hi there. I removed the wording to the title because it was argued over earlier on this talk page, and I presumed that someone stepped in after a while to push it back to something else. What you did by openning discussion here on the talk page again was the right thing to do. As per the wording "and more specifically, with their dissatisifaction regarding the thoroughness of the evidence for the current thinking" it just sounded like cruft; the line before "The community is united by their disagreement with the concept that HIV is the cause of AIDS" said it all to me. You don't think that the concept of HIV causing AIDS doesn't include evidence? I thought every word added there was unnecessary. As per that thought usually an alarm in my head goes off 'weasel wording', and so I marked it as such on the revert. (I also saw on your user_talk someone talking about vandalism, sorry if I infered that further).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My feelings about your additions: I think that <i>Concerns over Reappraisal's Effects</i> is softer sounding than <i>Estimated numbers of deaths caused by dissident views</i>. It does refer to real numbers, 'thousands of lives'. There are refs attached to that number; im guessing you missed it because it was a number like '1,000' but was 'a thousand'. Both refs are detailed, i did read them. Now, as per the other wording <i>The community is united by their disagreement with the concept that HIV is the cause of AIDS and more specifically, with their dissatisifaction regarding the thoroughness of the evidence for the current thinking</i>. I think it is just very redundant. <i>The community is united by their disagreement with the concept that HIV is the cause of AIDS.</i> Sounds the best to me. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup><small>(<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_sandbox_peerreview_b694.html" title="User:JoeSmack/sandbox/peerreview">p-review!</a>)</small> 04:11, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My point being that though there may be estimates of numbers, the previous title suggested that there was death caused by discussion and that the deaths were so concretely connected to discussion that they could be counted to an exact total. that is just too strong an implication for any serious scientific inquiry.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I also felt the inserted phrase was redundant, but didn't want to remove the previous clause, though it is unsourced and undoubtedly a generalization. Many aids reappraisalists appear to question the success and saftey of retroviral treatments, or accept that HIV is a cause of aids, but just one of many. Their true uniting factor is their discomfort with the completeness of our understanding of AIDS.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThechosenone021_3d5d.html" title="User:Thechosenone021">Thechosenone021</a> 18:30, 2 October 2006 (UTC) (oh and the vandalism thing on my talk page, while admittedly was deserved, had to do with one of those wikiality jokes, and was not like, an attempt to destroy the fabric of truth that is wikipedia.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the phrase about "disagreement that HIV causes AIDS" is a generalization. The problem is that AIDS reappraisalists are a diverse group: some don't believe HIV exists, some do, some focus on antiretroviral toxicity, some push a drug-related hypothesis, etc etc. It was an attempt to summarize the common ground of the movement for the purposes of a Wikipedia article. It can't really be sourced, since it's a generalization about thousands of individual viewpoints, but if there's one common factor about AIDS reappraisalists, it would have to be that they don't think HIV is the cause of AIDS. Like I said, I have no strong feelings about adding the sentence about dissatisfaction with the evidence; I think this is also true for the vast majority of AIDS reappraisalists. Bascially the question is how to best sum up the diverse viewpoints that make up the movement. About the section title, it's not my favorite (I think it's a little inflammatory), but as JoeSmack pointed out, it was arrived upon after extensive discussion on the talk page, so I've accepted it. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 19:12, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hey Randroide</span></h2>
<p>Talking about "veracity" is not kosher??? I'm not making a claim about the veracity of anything!! Read closely. I'm making a claim about what DEFINES DISSIDENTS. And saying that what defines a dissident is to deny the veracity of the HIV/AIDS hypothesis is a simple statement of fact, and I fail to see how it's not "kosher". Sorry, I just don't think you've thought this subtle point through well enough. 69.252.201.61 06:25, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV??? =</span></h2>
<p>I thought I had seen everything here at Idiotpedia, but this takes the cake.</p>
<p>Look up the meaning of the word veracity in a dictionary.</p>
<p>There are two concepts involved here:</p>
<p>CONSENSUS: roughly meaning, the vast majority of members of a group have come to a certain conclusion VERACITY: roughly meaning, truth of a claim or conclusion</p>
<p>Do the vast majority of dissident DENY the consensus? In other words, do they DENY that the vast majority of scientists disagree with them?? NO! Of course most dissidents know they are in the minority. Denying the consensus would be tantamount to saying "everyone agrees with us", "most people think HIV doesn't cause AIDS", etc., etc. This is absurd. It's patently obvious that we're in the minority. I don't deny that. Most dissidents don't.</p>
<p>What we DO deny is the VERACITY of the consensus. In other words, we deny the conclusions of the consensus that HIV causes AIDS.</p>
<p>A subtle difference. I know, one SO subtle that it likely goes way above your peon head.</p>

<p>Fair enough... I've excised the section from the article and moved it here (see below); if we come to a consensus about what it should say and whether it should be included, we can put in back in the article. I guess I've always been interested in the reaction when dissidents are confronted with evidence that HIV does cause AIDS, HAART works, etc... but I see <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandroide_fda5.html" title="User:Randroide">Randroide's</a> point. Just because it interests me doesn't make it encyclopedic, and certainly anecdotal evidence could be provided from both sides.

<dd>It's certainly purely anecdotal insofar as one considers it as evidence that the dissidents are wrong. But I didn't think that was why it was being included - that's been demonstrated scientifically, and doesn't need anecdotes. But though anecdotes are not science, they are history. Insofar as this information is included to illuminate the activities and attitudes of dissidents, rather than the fact that AIDS medications work, I think it a worthwhile addition. After all, the article purports to be about "the AIDS reappraisal movement", not merely about their claims. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 21:12, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Former AIDS dissidents have noted that, after they themselves developed AIDS, they were blackballed by the dissident establishment to which they had belonged. Writing in the <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Bay_Guardian_c3b7.html" title="San Francisco Bay Guardian">San Francisco Bay Guardian</a></i>, Bruce Mirken spoke with several HIV-positive former dissidents about how they were treated by the dissident community after developing AIDS.<sup id="_ref-bg_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bg" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>

That could certainly be included, but should probably go under "Points of contention", rather than in the intro, since it's fairly specific.

<p>When the discoverer of HIV himself tell's the scientific community: "There are too many shortcomings in the theory that HIV causes all signs of AIDS. We are seeing people HIV-infected for 9, 10, 12 years or more, and they are still in good shape, their immune system is still good. It is unlikely that these people will come down with AIDS later."

<p>Also, that is a fact. The goal of AIDS dissidents is to achieve funding for alternative causation studies. This has always been the goal. The evidence supporting that claim is clearly self evident and does not require additional sources.</p>

I could not find any significant discussion of alternate causes of AIDS in the piece.

<p>In the beginning of the HIV epidemic, Kaposi sarcoma was a common stigma in AIDS patients and one of the leading causes of death. While Kaposi sarcoma is seen less frequently since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, lymphoma and other malignancies are an increasing therapeutic challenge. The incidence of HPV-related anal carcinoma and its precursor lesions is rising so dramatically that screening programs as they are already established for cervical carcinoma should be implemented. The role of HPV in UV-associated tumors is not yet determined. Additional risk factors like smoking and HCV co-infection seem to play important roles in the high incidence of lung and hepatocellular carcinomas. While fewer patients die from opportunistic infections, we face a growing problem with malignancies in HIV-positive patients.</p>

<p>It is clear that those pesky co-factors arnt going away.</p>
<p>In addition, the use of Nitrate inhalent has also been on decline due to laws that have prohibited the sale of those chemicals - which I might add occured roughly around 4-5 years <i>before</i> the use of antiretroviral therapy became widely used. Would you like a reference for that too?</p>

<p>Unless you can prove that the effect of co-factors are not applicable then the justification for further studies into causation of AIDS is still an avenue which is being sought by AIDS dissidents.

<p><a href="../../../y/o/g/User%7EYogiudo_3ece.html" title="User:Yogiudo">Yogiudo</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, unless you can justify the non existance of co-factors in the progression to AIDS then this article is not neutral and biased. I am thus re-instating the neutrality issue of this article until co-factors are elimitated from the current medical paradigm surrounding AIDS, or until you remove the tag again. - unsigned</p>

<dd>Can you really be unaware that Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by infection with Human Herpes Virus 8 in HIV infected people? That's mainstream, not dissident! And unfortunately for your nitrate theory, the use of nitrates isn't associated, even statistically, with the diagnosis of AIDS. Your argument that nitrates are a cofactor because their use declined while AIDS increased in fact is an argument against your proposition. Your complaint about co-factors is difficult to unravel. What are you trying to say, in relation to this article? What does justifying "the non existance of co-factors" mean, and what does it have to do with "neutrality"? - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 20:58, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My point up top wasn't that I wanted "more sources"; I wanted you to accurately represent the sources you use. You're arguing that smoking causes lung cancer, and Hep C causes liver cancer - no argument there. However, that doesn't cast any doubt on the role of HIV in AIDS. The point is that those cancers are <i>more common</i> in folks with HIV, since the immune system plays a role in containing and preventing them, and HIV suppresses the immune system. Plus people are living longer and not dying of opportunistic infections, <i>thanks to HAART and prophylaxis</i>, so AIDS-related cancers are becoming more of a problem. There's absolutely nothing in what you've cited that casts any doubt on the HIV/AIDS model. About nitrate use; I can cite data that McDonald's stopped using lard to fry their French fries a few years before AIDS death rates dropped. That correlation proves absolutely nothing about causation. Finally, please re-read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>; you seem to be under a fairly substantial misconception that because you're not convinced HIV causes AIDS, this article is POV.

<p>No problem... just keep adding every known mode of HIV transmission to your list of "cofactors", and you've got the perfect circular argument.

<dd>Statistics are not good science. You said "About nitrate use; I can cite data that McDonald's stopped using lard to fry their French fries a few years before AIDS death rates dropped." Which is what the entire HIV/AIDS paradigm is based on - statistics. HIV+ + Kaposi's sarcoma = AIDS. Kaposi's sarcoma + HIV- = Kaposi's sarcoma. Of course there is 100 percent relationship between HIV and AIDS. That is because, by definition "AIDS" cannot exist without the existance of an HIV+ test. Furthermore, explain AIDS without HIV. Because that is also well documented and does exist. We should probably update your mention to Koch Postulates since those are not furfilled by the existance of AIDS without HIV.</dd>

<p>Sigh... has it occurred to you that dissident arguments are also based on statistics? Since you categorically discount the value of statistics, I'm not sure what the point of arguing this is. Epidemiology is based on statistics. You're reciting every out-of-date dissident argument under the sun, starting with your mischaracterization of Montaignier's views and moving on through Koch's postulates. Please read the Wikipedia page on Koch's postulates. They <i>have</i> been fulfilled, and besides, plenty of other pathogens are accepted as disease-causing in spite of not fulfilling the postulates completely. Viruses are particularly notorious for this; virology did not exist as a concept or field when the postulates were devised, so they don't function optimally for viruses. Nonetheless, perhaps you could point out which postulate you regard as unfulfilled? <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 21:46, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK... so you categorically disbelieve in the field of statistics. You've mischaracterized your sources (Science/Montaignier). You repeated the old saw that HIV doesn't fulfill Koch's postulates, but won't explain what you mean or provide specifics. Your comments are starting to sound less like rational debate and more like <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">trolling</a>. How about the lab technicians and physicians who have become accidentally infected through handling live virus or infected patients? What was their cofactor (or were they all promiscuous drug users?) The reason the study you suggest has not been done is that there is scientific consensus that HIV causes AIDS. "Good science" doesn't involve wasting resources on things that have already been proven to the satisfaction of the scientific community. Finally, you really need to re-read the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_FAQ_00b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ">NPOV FAQ</a>. Specifically, pay attention to the parts on "equal validity" and minority views, and the section on "pseudoscience", which states that we should "represent the majority (scientific) view as the majority view and the minority (sometimes pseudoscientific) view as the minority view." The article does this; AIDS reappraisal is characterized as a minority view which the community holds to be pseudoscience.

<p>I think it's worth emphasising that this page is not supposed to be a discussion forum for establishing whether or not a particular scientific theory is correct. We're trying to write an encyclopedia article, so our task is a great deal simpler. All we need to do is establish what is believed by notable mainstream scientists and dissidents. For example, it is indisputable that most HIV experts believe that heterosexual HIV transmission does occur, and whether you or I disagree with them is irrelevant.</p>
<p>But since you asked for examples, how about 117,887 reports of heterosexually-transmitted AIDS in the US alone, plus another 44,208 cases of HIV that has not yet progressed to AIDS (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/reports/2004report/pdf/2004SurveillanceReport.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/reports/2004report/pdf/2004SurveillanceReport.pdf" rel="nofollow">CDC report</a>, Table 17)?

All other cases among self reported heterosexuals not meeting this definition are placed in the undetermined category."</p>

<p>Now that the guns have stopped firing, and the debate has raged on, it appears clear at this time that a section could be added about the dissidents proposed experiment.</p>
<p>Unless somebody can provide me with a citation that proves it should not be added as it has been disproved by previous experimentation, I think it should be added. Perhaps something Neutral like:</p>
<p>Many dissidents most notably Dr Peter Duesberg have proposed an experiments to prove that HIV, in the absence of disputed co-factors does or does not cause to AIDS. These experiments include studies such as:</p>

<li>Injecting himself with HIV</li>
<li>Injecting a cohort of willing participants with HIV</li>
<li>A cohort of heterosexually positive willing participants in the absence of co-factors</li>

<p>... etc ...</p>
<p>The proposed experiments have not been done yet so they may or may not be able to provide additional information to the scientific community. or The proposed experiments may or may not be able to provide additional information to the scientific community.</p>
<p>I think it is relavent because it is an important element to AIDS reappraisal and has been raised by numerous dissidents. It may also be relavant because it is one of the major fuelers of the controversy.</p>

<p>Er... it <i>is</i> proven. That's why it would be unethical. Just because you choose not to accept that doesn't give me, or the NIH, the right to infect you with a potentially deadly virus. If you told me you didn't believe rabies was harmful, and wanted to inject yourself, it would be still be unethical of me to provide it to you. Hey, rabies has been around for much longer than HIV, and science has yet to produce a cure... it requires a "cofactor" (animal exposure)... how do we know it's the rabies virus and not, say, the neurotoxic properties of bat saliva that cause the disease? Maybe this could be tackled with the same amount of energy as the HIV/AIDS "lie" someday? Or better yet, go after hepatitis C - people often have "cofactors" like alcohol abuse or IV drug use, you can write off the people who acquired it via transfusion as another "cofactor", deny the existence of people who acquired it occupationally... science has yet to produce a vaccine or cure (proof positive the virus is harmless)... why are we giving the hep C virus a free ride? <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 02:54, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"If there is evidence that HIV causes AIDS, there should be scientific documents which either singly or collectively demonstrate that fact, at least with a high probability. There is no such document."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dr. Kary Mullis, Biochemist, 1993 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.</p>
<p>With regards to your comments on Hep C and Hemophilliacs: If HIV is transmitted in blood and other bodily fluids, one would expect health care workers who are most likely to be exposed to these substances to be infected quite regularly. Of 733,374 AIDS cases reported in the U.S. through the end of 1999, only 25 are believed to have been occupationally transmitted. And, this conclusion is from negative evidence (i.e. health care workers who are HIV-positive, but not homosexual, drug abusers, haemophiliacs or blood transfusion recipients are assumed to have been infected occupationally). The CDC has reported not a single case of confirmed occupational transmission in surgeons and paramedics (CDC, 1999).</p>
<p>Not one paramedic, emergency medical technician or surgeon in the U.S. has contracted AIDS from on-the-job exposure (CDC, 1999). Out of 733,374 total U.S. AIDS cases through 1999, only 25 are thought to be occupationally acquired, based on presumptive evidence as described previously (CDC, 1999). In Canada, out of 16,235 AIDS cases through 1998, only 3 are reported as occupationally acquired (LCDC, 1998), based on circumstantial evidence (CCDR, 1992). Consider that the 1 million needle-stick injuries among health care workers in the U.S. each year result in about 1,000 cases of hepatitis among health care workers annually. That means that in the 18 years of AIDS, health care workers contracted 18,000 cases of hepatitis and 25 cases of AIDS. Pretty strange if HIV is a blood-borne virus!</p>

<p>So you obviously read the various materials and publications. <a href="../../../y/o/g/User%7EYogiudo_3ece.html" title="User:Yogiudo">Yogiudo</a></p>
<p>So what.</p>
<p>Just because something might be unethical does not mean ignoring evidence which is also unethical makes the latter "ethical". The execution of 700,000 africans per year via toxic AIDS drugs might also be considered unethical <b>if</b> HIV was not the cause of AIDS. The stakes of human suffering are high enough to mandate the need for scientific experiement to rule in <b>or</b> out HIV as the sole cause of AIDS. Experiements the scientific community is strangely unwilling to perform such experiements.</p>

AIDS reappraisal is the viewpoint of a tiny minority which has been roundly rejected by every major scientific and medical organization. To <i>not</i> reflect that fact in the article would be POV. A good article on this topic will present AIDS dissident arguments, reflect the fact that this is a minority viewpoint widely considered erroneous, and summarize the impact of the movement. That's what we're trying to accomplish here; your input is welcome.</dd>

<dd>I have read the neutrality policy and my complaint is within the scope represented by that document. The document cites: "Please be clear on one thing: the Wikipedia neutrality policy certainly does not state, or imply, that we must "give equal validity" to minority views." I would argue that since this article is about AIDS reappraisial that it is infact perfectly logical that this article should present the body of information in such article in a more neutral way. For example a page about <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_Denial_7a44.html" title="Holocaust Denial">Holocaust Denial</a> should not be a platform to bash <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_Denial_7a44.html" title="Holocaust Denial">Holocaust Denial</a> but rather disseminate any such information as neutrally as possible.

<dd>Exactly - AIDS reappraisal is a minority view. Hence, we do not need to give it equal validity to the mainstream view. If you look at the actual page on <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a>, it follows a very similar model to what we have here - views are presented, then it's made clear that Holocaust denial is a fringe/minority viewpoint regarded as erroneous and unfounded by the political/social/historical mainstream. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 03:08, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's revealing that you place a low priority on actually reading the sources and documents involved. As far as occupational exposure, post-exposure AZT has been used to prevent occupational HIV transmission since 1988,<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4450.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4450.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> which partially accounts for the low transmission rate. The accepted chance of acquiring HIV from a needlestick is 0.3% per exposure. Seems low, but then for Hep C it's only 1.8% per exposure (MMWR Recomm Rep. 2001 Jun 29;50(RR-11):1-52), and again, no one's making a fuss about hep C virus being harmless. If you take into account the prevalence of HIV in the population, number of needlesticks, and rate of infectivity, and the effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis, the number of cases of occupationally acquired HIV makes sense.</dd>

<dd>And before you line up to volunteer to be infected with HIV, consider reading the article about how dissidents are treated when they "inconviently" develop AIDS.

<dd>I can cite many instances of children, and other biological organisms inheriting poor immuno systems from environmental causes "co-factors". Many of these causes are also predictable. Many are also similiar to AIDS but lack an HIV+ test. These do not require additional citation in this forum. You are correct, this is not a forum. However it is important that this article present information as neutrally as possible. I suggest that we consider a disclaimer for this article to also warn of <b>not</b> taking any such information in such article as professional medical advice.</dd>
<dd>I am happy to review new materials. I thank you for providing me with new information. Obviously, I have not encountered the said items. As a non expert in this field I am not able to know all of the facts. But the lack of such clear references in the article made to said viewers may justify's the neutrality clause because said article does not provide some of those references. I would argue that providing such information to said viewers does not breach a scope of such article. Since I am not an expert on such material, I can only suggest that a vote should be made for the neutrality status of this article. Voting will provide a democractic way to decide on the status of such articles. <a href="../../../y/o/g/User%7EYogiudo_3ece.html" title="User:Yogiudo">Yogiudo</a> 00:56, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if you believe that the kids inherited some unspecified immune deficiency from their mom (besides HIV), maybe you'll consider this: identical twins born to an HIV+ mom, where one twin acquires HIV in utero and the other does not (the rate of mother-to-child HIV transmission is not 100%, so there are such cases). These twins are genetically <i>completely identical</i>, and have the same inheritance. <i>Yet only the twin who is HIV+ develops AIDS</i>. Here's the reference: Menez-Bautista et al, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=3012996" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=3012996">PMID 3012996</a> (monozygotic = identical, <a href="../../../h/t/l/HTLV-III_637a.html" title="HTLV-III">HTLV-III</a> = HIV). If you're looking for a place to start in terms of understanding why scientists are so convinced that HIV causes AIDS, I'd encourage you to check out <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Factsheets/evidhiv.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Factsheets/evidhiv.htm" rel="nofollow">this fact sheet</a> from the U.S. National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (it's the top mainstream "External Link" in the article). It's a good summary of the evidence, and also tackles the dissident arguments in detail (contrary to what some have asserted, these objections <i>have</i> been debated by the scientific community). As far as a disclaimer, I agree 100% - "no medical advice" is covered under Wikipedia's general disclaimer (click on "Disclaimers" on the footer at the very bottom of any Wikipedia page); we're instructed not to attach our own disclaimers since the "no medical advice" issue is covered by the general disclaimer. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 02:17, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any one of these findings could be written off in isolation (which is how the dissidents prefer to attempt it).

<dd>Please read the paper carefully, Randroide. As it explains, the efficacy of AZT (zidovudine) for preventing mother-to-child transmission has been demonstrated in several randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (in ACTG 076, only 8% of the women randomised to AZT transmitted HIV to their babies compared to 26% among those on placebo); longer courses of AZT lead to less HIV transmission than shorter <s>trials</s> regimens; and combination therapy leads to lower rates still. What more do you need to demonstrate causation?

<p>Nice to see. Everyone read the recent Rodgriguez et al article in <i>JAMA</i> 27 September 2006?? Might learn something. The completely incoherent editorial accompanying it and the bizarre, Orwellian Jon Cohen piece in <i>Science</i> should alert any average reader that something's not quite right. To summarise:</p>
<p>THE HOLY TRINITY (in jeopardy):</p>
<p>Padian 1997: sexual transmission, &lt;&lt; UCK &gt;&gt;<br />
Rodriguez et al in <i>JAMA</i>: viral load means jack-shit: &lt;&lt; UCK &gt;&gt;<br />

<dd>You seem to be misinterpreting the results of the Rodriguez paper, if "viral load doesn't mean jack shit" was what you took away. For the study group as a whole, initial viral load correlated with rate of CD4 loss: as the authors wrote, "<i>higher presenting HIV RNA levels were associated with greater subsequent CD4 cell decline.</i>" The thrust of the article was that on an individual patient level, a single viral load measurement at presentation is not an effective predictor. As a mathematician, I'm sure this type of distinction is familiar to you. The result has significant implications for clinical management, and suggests avenues for further research, but in no way calls into question the causative role of HIV. You will probably not be surprised to learn that Rodriguez, like <a href="http://www.aidstruth.org/nancy-padian.php" class="external text" title="http://www.aidstruth.org/nancy-padian.php" rel="nofollow">Padian before him</a>, felt compelled to warn against the misrepresentation of his results by the AIDS denialist camp (<a href="http://www.aidstruth.org/rodriguez-lederman.php" class="external text" title="http://www.aidstruth.org/rodriguez-lederman.php" rel="nofollow">see here</a>). The authors of both studies take strong exception to the misuse of their results to claim that HIV doesn't cause AIDS. I'm not sure which Lancet article you're referring to - they've recently published a few studies of structured treatment interruption, but it must be something else - so I can't comment on that. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 18:03, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but if they are admitted as experts, it's news, and if they are rejected as experts, it's news. I'm guessing Australian courts are as capricious as any other, so there's no telling which way they'd go. Some of the things they've been testifying to elucidate their current POV. It's fine to wait for a while, but an interrim report of it might not be amiss until further developments. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 19:50, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The news article presented it thus: "<i>According to the Padian paper, a man would have to with his wife three times a week for 27.4 years to expose her to a 95 per cent risk of passing on HIV.</i>" Score one for <s>denialist</s>dissident PR - there's no mention of the fact that in Padian's paper, <i>condom use and safe sex were encouraged and widely used</i>, accounting for the low rate of transmission. Oh well, maybe Eleni's 50-page PowerPoint presentation on how semen causes AIDS (but only with anal-receptive , not l ) will convince the jury to let this upstanding citizen go free to infect a few more people.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Finally</span></h2>
<p>I am impressed that finally someone has cited something which states a point. <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc.html" title="Post hoc ergo propter hoc">Post hoc ergo propter hoc</a> is also true. A car door is always opened before the ignition is turned on. That doesnt mean that opening the car door turns on the car. I am going to say this carefully. It is a shame that the type of information you just presented is not presented to people first. You expect people to take everything they read at face value. Well I dont. But if I can come across an article like the one you just stated, (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=3597757" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=3597757" rel="nofollow">Park 1987</a>) - Then it gives me the gut feeling that HIV is probably the main cause of AIDS. However regardless of weither it is, or is not - they should still be dedicating some more research into other causes, and other things such as life style prevention. But I have no explanation for the twins, if thats what you thought I would say. Remember - I am not a illogic person, I just need proof, and that is more convincing then other stuff I have read. P.S. I still think injecting herion mixed with drywall 3 times a day for 10 years constitutes a high risk of immune system collaspe and probably a few dozen kinds of cancer. Some of which would probably be considered AIDS in the presence of an HIV+ test. And just because your looking for another cause does not make you a pseudoscientist. <a href="../../../y/o/g/User%7EYogiudo_3ece.html" title="User:Yogiudo">Yogiudo</a></p>

<dd>Well, how do we ever prove causality? To extend your analogy, turning a car key always turns on the ignition. How do we know that one <i>causes</i> the other, as opposed to your car door analogy? Well, we understand the mechanism by which the key turns over the engine, and we've seen it happen again and again. Similarly, we now understand much (not all) of the mechanisms by which HIV causes immunosuppression, which in turn reinforces causality.</dd>
<dd>I appreciate your desire to think things through for yourself; I don't think that's illogical. This is a complex, confusing issue and it's easy to twist things to confuse people. The debates you mention have occurred; scientists didn't sit down one day and say "case closed". It was a process which happened throughout the 1980's and into the 1990's. Duesberg's (and others') objections were meaningful in those early days. They've now been examined and convincingly rebutted, yet a small handful of folks still cling to them, regardless of how much evidence piles up. Questioning a consensus doesn't make you a pseudoscientist, as you point out. You become a pseudoscientist when you start using the trappings of science and the literature to advance a point which is just not supportable anymore; the only way to do this is through cherry-picking and mischaracterization.</dd>
<dd>The research you mention is occurring as well. The JAMA paper which Revolver cited above will undoubtedly provoke quite a bit of research into lifestyle or genetic factors that affect how quickly HIV progresses to AIDS.</dd>
<dd>And I'd certainly never encourage the injection of heroin nor drywall, but I can guarantee you that only heroin users who are HIV-positive will develop AIDS; this has been borne out in multiple studies (see <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/hivaids/20.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/hivaids/20.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8095571" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8095571">PMID 8095571</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8099613" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8099613">PMID 8099613</a>, etc).

<dd>Show me an HIV-negative person who died of "a combination of KS and PCP". Such a thing was virtually unheard of before HIV/AIDS; only a handful of physicians had even seen either KS or PCP. Suddenly any doc who worked in an urban hospital was seeing tons of young people with advanced KS, PCP, etc - in HIV+ folks. This is silly, and it's not even circular logic at all. You can turn yellow and develop liver failure without Hep B virus infection. We only call it "hepatitis B" if you test positive for the virus... otherwise you're "just" a hepatitis case, even though your clinical course may be similar. Including a microbiologic test when establishing a diagnosis is basic medical practice, not some kind of logical fallacy. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 17:37, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The opinions expressed are all attributed to concrete people and organizations; weasel words aren't being used.

To make the section more balanced, we could add a rebuttal from <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celia_Farber_ae2f.html" title="Celia Farber">Celia Farber</a> (for instance), who has argued that blaming dissidents for AIDS deaths or comparing them to Holocaust denialists is ridiculous and overly prejudicial. I'm sure we can dig up a few quotes from her or other dissidents to rebut the charges from Moore/Geffen. As far as alleged harm of AZT, there is already such a section under "AIDS treatment toxicity". It's in relatively poor shape, so if you have some citations for the dissident claims of toxicity, or would like to rewrite or amplify the issues they have with AZT, I'd suggest focusing on the pre-existing section and improving it. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 02:30, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Gilbert_4197.html" title="Walter Gilbert">Walter Gilbert</a> once said that the HIV theory was unproven; according to the AIDS journalist Richard Jefferys, he's since changed his mind: <i>"I am afraid that those comments go back to the late 80's.

<dd>Thanks for digging that up. There are actually a few other people mentioned as "AIDS dissidents" who have since been convinced by the accumulation of data (eg Sonnabend, Root-Bernstein).

<p>Perhaps it should be made clearer that Sonnabend and Root-Bernstein have never denied that HIV might play some role in causation, though they've argued that cofactors are also necessary. Both of them have for a long time disagreed with Duesberg, as explained in their letters to Science (Vol 267, Issue 5195, 13 January 1995). The <a href="http://www.poz.com/articles/451_2788.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.poz.com/articles/451_2788.shtml" rel="nofollow">recent POZ article</a> says that Sonnabend "has not changed his view that developing AIDS, like other infectious diseases, requires cofactors such as other viruses and bacteria," and Root-Bernstein says that, "Both the camp that says HIV is a pussycat and the people who claim AIDS is all HIV are wrong." <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 21:08, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Both Sonnabend and Root-Bernstein were, and still are, advocates for "AIDS reappraisal", so perhaps they don't belong in the "Former dissidents" section. What seems to have changed is that they're both now convinced that HIV has some role to play in causation, whereas previously they were unsure. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrezatium_aae7.html" title="User:Trezatium">Trezatium</a> 21:34, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that's a valid distinction - if you want to take a shot at rewording it, by all means. It seems relevant that the accumulation of evidence has convinced some of the more scientifically grounded of the reappraisers that HIV is pathogenic, but of course we shouldn't misrepresent their original views, and you're absolutely right that both R-B and Sonnabend still attach caveats to their acceptance of HIV. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 22:09, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(Not that Richard Jeffreys himself is unreliable, but citing a blog as a source is the issue).

<p>I agree that Walter Gilbert's disassociation from the AIDS dissident camp is important, relevant, and telling -- but not for the reasons you think he is. He is useful for influence purposes, not for scientific purposes. He is an example of a <a href="http://www.insideinfluence.com/year04/11/vote/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.insideinfluence.com/year04/11/vote/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Convert Communicator</a>, who is "someone who used to believe or behave in a certain way but who has changed" according to psychologist Robert Cialdini. Talking about people "switching sides" is great for getting people into your camp (whether you're in the mainstream camp or the dissident camp is of no importance -- the principle works either way), but it distracts people from the evidence. And we all should be looking at the evidence, not changing allegiances -- especially in a scientific matter. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoundry_b5c4.html" title="User:Loundry">Loundry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/u/User_talk%7ELoundry_680f.html" title="User talk:Loundry">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Loundry_a144.html" title="Special:Contributions/Loundry">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Ultimate Answer</span></h2>
<p>Though there are arguments on both sides that have merits the simple matter is if people who do not believe HIV causes AIDS could end this argument easily but simply volunteering to be injected with HIV. If they contract AIDS then all the arguments are thrown out.</p>
<p>With the possible exception that HIV might be a cofactor and when combined with another virus in the body (such as HPV6) the two cause AIDS.</p>
<p>Yet no advocate of the side HIV does not cause AIDS has ever volunteered to do so? Why not? This has never been explained.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are a few explanations. First of all, where would the HIV come from? No lab could ethically provide HIV with the intent that a person would infect themselves. A couple of dissidents have proposed such an idea (infecting themselves), but they've either attached ridiculous and unfulfillable clauses (<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Rasnick_9f83.html" title="David Rasnick">David Rasnick</a>) or claimed that they need NIH "approval" (which could never ethically be given) - see <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Duesberg_a1b6.html" title="Peter Duesberg">Peter Duesberg</a> - rendering it essentially a publicity stunt. So what happens to HIV-positive dissidents when they die of AIDS (or get sick, go on meds, and get better)? See <a href="http://www.aidstruth.org/bad-science.php" class="external text" title="http://www.aidstruth.org/bad-science.php" rel="nofollow">here</a> for how the dissident community reacts (hint: blame the victim). What about an HIV-positive dissident mom who infects her child through a refusal to take meds? See <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Maggiore_14e4.html" title="Christine Maggiore">Christine Maggiore</a> - after the child dies of AIDS, she denies it and blames <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amoxicillin.html" title="Amoxicillin">amoxicillin</a>. The point is that these beliefs are so deeply held that even if someone is infected with HIV, has no other risk factors (e.g. Maggiore's child), and dies of AIDS, it will still be denied. Finally, as someone who believes that HIV is the cause of AIDS, I would never want someone to knowingly infect themselves, regardless of their beliefs. It's a basic ethical question. As I said above, even if you believe the rabies virus is harmless, that doesn't justify allowing you to infect yourself with a deadly virus to prove a point. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 17:26, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>RE: the above. Read further up, this study has been done, by accident. Out of thousands of needle-pricks and emergency crew exposure - virtually no one has been diagnosed with AIDS. This is a far bigger study than any peer reviewed study could ever dream of. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/5/9/User%7E159.105.80.219.html" title="User:159.105.80.219">159.105.80.219</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/9/User_talk%7E159.105.80.219.html" title="User talk:159.105.80.219">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_159.105.80.219_a03c.html" title="Special:Contributions/159.105.80.219">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>The issue of the transmissibility of AIDS via needlestick has already been discussed here - see <a href="../../../y/o/g/User%7EYogiudo_3ece.html" title="User:Yogiudo">Yogiudo's</a> thread above. The argument has been made (see the Science magazine series) that the "study" indeed has already been unwittingly performed, in people who have received blood transfusions contaminated with HIV prior to the advent of testing and blood product safety measures. (Hemophiliacs in particular, but also people like <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Asimov_1d17.html" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Ashe_c0c4.html" title="Arthur Ashe">Arthur Ashe</a>, etc to name a few famous examples). Needless to say the results were tragic, and provide evidence of the infectivity and pathogenicity of HIV, even in the absence of Duesberg's proposed causes. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 18:41, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry but hemophiliacs are extremely ill people - their survival and condition is precarious throughtout their lives. Saying HIV caused their death is like saying my 96 year old grangmother died from ( you name it ). Asimov, Ashe, etc prove very little unless we know more about their personal lives. Studies on how many people have died after transfusions ( wroth with problems because if you get a transfusion you are obviously not in great shape) versus how many of their blood donors died would be interesting - perr review guys can line up for the federal funds. My personal opinion is why if you live by getting federal funds would you kill the golden goose ( self-interest). Which is why I suspect this goose seems to live on and on. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/5/9/User%7E159.105.80.219.html" title="User:159.105.80.219">159.105.80.219</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/9/User_talk%7E159.105.80.219.html" title="User talk:159.105.80.219">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_159.105.80.219_a03c.html" title="Special:Contributions/159.105.80.219">contribs</a>).</small></p>
