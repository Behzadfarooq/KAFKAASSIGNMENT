<p>Under "symptoms and complications" we have the following: "Without antiretroviral therapy, death normally occurs within a year." Nevertheless, the adjacent graph shows that death in an "untreated HIV infection" occurs after about 11 years. Any ideas? Ivan Kassal, 31 May 2006</p>

<p>Death is not immiment in Aids cases. For example, I was diagnosed with full, blown Aids (I was sick and dying) I took the anti-virals for a period of time. I learned about what Aids is and is not. I am now what is termed an Aids Rethinker, as I do not believe that hiv has scientifically been proven to cause Aids or anything else. Currently, I am on my 7th month off of all Aids medications. My blood work is fine and I have no clinical symptoms. I would be happy to elaborate if necessary. Noreen Martin Noreen martin 18:36, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The link is that AIDS was originally publically conceived as a 'Gay related immune deficiency syndrome' or <a href="../../../g/r/i/GRIDS_2b79.html" title="GRIDS">GRIDS</a>. Once the fact that it could be spread by both vaginal/anal sex, as well as needles/blood transfusion, (and other methods, see article) came out in the 80s, it was renamed to just AIDS. While much of its start dwelled in gay populations, it is and always has been independent of homosexuality. A rather famous quote in the field: "HIV doesn't care about your sexual orientation". It doesn't matter if you're gay, straight, bi, trans, asexual, whatever... anyone can get HIV. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 04:33, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>See <a href="http://www.amazinginfoonhomosexuals.com/hiv_spread.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.amazinginfoonhomosexuals.com/hiv_spread.htm" rel="nofollow">here then</a>, that in the USA, in the year 2000, figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 75.8% of US males who were infected with HIV contracted it via homosexual contact. I know that you don't like to see statistics showing a link between homosexuality and HIV/AIDS infections, so I'm guessing your not going to like the next bit.</dd>
<dd>Ethnicity has played a part in establishing the variations which you see globally in rates of infection. A significantly larger proportion of the population who are of 'African-American' or 'Asian/Other' in ethnicity will engage in bisexual relationships with heterosexual women, than will the section of the population which is of 'White' or 'Hispanic' ethnicity, causing the spread of the HIV virus from outwith the group which is naturally at the greatest risk, homosexual males (The dangerousness of anal sex follows from the thin epithelial tissue that forms the rectal wall) , to the population at large, within those ethnic groups. This is one of the reasons why you see a marked difference in the ratios of HIV infection for heterosexuals in African Nations than in what are known as 'Western' nations. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by TheCatWhoChatOnTheMat (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheCatWhoChatOnTheMat_4336.html" title="User talk:TheCatWhoChatOnTheMat">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheCatWhoChatOnTheMat_cf2d.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheCatWhoChatOnTheMat">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>In a nutshell, the points being made are&#160;: Yes there is a link between homosexuality and AIDS (or HIV), and that ethnicity plays a part in how AIDS (or HIV) spreads, or doesn't spread, throughout the general population, in different regions of the globe.</dd>
<dd>The article (the AIDS article) says&#160;: "In many developed countries, there is still a perceived association between AIDS and homosexuality or bisexuality". Well, in short, there <i>is</i> an association. If you live in a 'developed' country, you're much more likely have become infected with HIV (or AIDS) as a result of homosexual male anal intercourse than by any other means. It's not just perceived, it's correct. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by TheCatWhoChatOnTheMat (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheCatWhoChatOnTheMat_4336.html" title="User talk:TheCatWhoChatOnTheMat">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheCatWhoChatOnTheMat_cf2d.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheCatWhoChatOnTheMat">contribs</a>) .</small>

<dd>Ithink there might be some clarification in order.

<dd>You know, I just realised what that bit is saying in the article. It's saying that if you believe there to be a link between homosexuality and HIV (or AIDS), as I do, then you are more likely to hold prejuduced viewpoints and/or be stupid. Is this just made up on the spot? I can't believe that people are allowed to put such hateful and patently untrue text in here. I don't see a hyperlink anywhere in it which points to another document which would corroborate any of what the author is alleging, and to be honest, it actually sounds quite, well, <i>prejudiced</i> is the word which springs to mind. It's saying that anyone who doesn't hold the same viewpoint as the author is "less educated". Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this simply a denigration of anyone who dares to hold a viewpoint which is not in keeping with what the author deems to be acceptable? Why not just start burning books which you don't agree with, and get me to wear little yellow badges so that I stand out better?</dd>

<dd>Responding to TheCatWhoChatOnTheMat in re: an "association" between homosexuality and AIDS. The problem with your statement is that you run the risk of confusing (intentionally, it would seem) circumstance with causality. Being homosexual doesn't cause you to get AIDS: practicing unsafe sex does (among other things, as already written). While it's apparent that worldwide male homosexual behavior is frequently practiced unsafely (in many cultures, I would argue, owing to the social stigma that just your sort of statement propagates), it's just not reasonable to use terminology that implies that the very state of being homosexual causes AIDS. Straight sex can be just as unsafe as gay sex. AIDS is caused by behavior, not orientation. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraham_1d8c.html" title="User:Graham">graham</a> 09:21, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To add to this intelligent gentleman above me, the classification of "homosexual contact" does not stipulate the orientation of the person. A person can, and often will, partake in homosexual sex between another man yet not be homosexual. To make a relation between homosexual contact and homosexual sexuality is like saying that riding a bike means you were in the Tour De France. Additionally, I am interested that there's no real conversation on the social and evolutionary undertones of homosexuals contracting HIV/AIDS. Most experts agree that men are, by and large, geared to reproduction with as many mates as possible. So what is different between homosexual contact and heterosexual contact besides the end result of a child? Absolutely nothing. That is probably another debate for another time, though. My main message is that contraction through homosexual contact does not mean the person who contracted the disease is homosexual. 68.51.57.237 23:13, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Woah, easy on the agenda there. The factual occurance is that there appears to be almost 3 times the number of gay males with AIDS than straight males with AIDS (of the surveyed nations). The way it reads is analogous to, "a slight majority of those infected with HIV were males named John (58% of all cases)." You just expect people to sit back and say, "OK, even though 58% of people with AIDS are males named John, I'm not going to say that being named John has any connection to AIDS whatsoever."

Debating about why that is isn't important I guess, since it seems like we're just discussing the actual figures with no implications of the reasons behind. My point: am I missing something here?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Original Transfer?</span></h2>
<p>Should it be noted that the current most substantial (and common) reason for the jump of the virus from primates to humans is that it came from the practices of many poor and starving Central Africans of going into the bush/forest and subsequent unchecked butchering of various animals for meat? All kinds of animals, primarily primates, were indiscriminately consumed at home or sold at market this way and many people keep doing this. The viruses probably jumped due to continued handling/eating of a certain monkey species which was locally infected. This was mentioned in a Discovery Channel documentary on Ebola, AIDs, and other viruses of continental African origin. Discuss?--<a href="../../../e/x/a/User%7EExander_de26.html" title="User:Exander">Exander</a> 00:56, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I came here wondering about this as well. How was the virus first introduced to the human species, does anyone know? I ask because the rumours I've been exposed to insinuate that tribal religious rituals involving primate blood were where the original transfer was made. The above information at least sounds more plausible (due to greater opportunity of infection). But there must be cited research on the matter somewhere? I believe a majority of the other romours I have encountered are well addressed in the article, so I feel addressing this one would also be a service to the readership. Thanks.&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesset77_297d.html" title="User:Jesset77">Jesset77</a> 16:33, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>AIDS originating from poor and starving Central Africans just does not make sense to me. I feel that is a man made virus and it's main goal is human elimination (poor, gay. etc). Though many may not agree with me, I think the virus was originally created for race elimination. Plus Africa is a valuable land from a diamond and oil perspective that the westernalized governments would love to own. I could be wrong but I feel there is much more to this then what we see on the surface. (Jade) 12 July 2006</p>

I'm of the opinion that the graph currently is accurate and easy to understand. I understand your concern - you think that it is misleading.

<p>I think the controversy needs to be fleshed out on this page. It is not enough to say that there is some debate - the reasons for the controversy must be given. Peter Duesberg's 1987 paper in the journal <i>Cancer Research</i>, "Retroviruses as Carcinogens and Pathogens: Expectations and Reality," details "how and why the retrovirus HIV cannot cause AIDS" (Farber). I recommend reading the article "Out of Control: AIDS and the corruption of medical science" (<a href="http://www.harpers.org/OutOfControl.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harpers.org/OutOfControl.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) by Celia Farber in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, March 2006, which accuses researchers of no longer applying scientific standards to AIDS work, and then adding the appropriate information to this entry. Here are some relevant quotes: "He simply pointed out that no one had yet proven that HIV is capable of causing a single disease, much less the twenty-five diseases that are now part of the clinical definition of AIDS. He pointed to a number of paradoxes regarding HIV and argued that far from being evidence that HIV is 'mysterious' or 'enigmatic,' these paradoxes were evidence that HIV is a passenger virus. ... The classical tests of whether or not a microorganism is the cause of infectious disease are known as Koch's postulates. ... Although claims to the contrary have been made, Duesberg maintains that it has never been demonstrated that HIV satisfies all of Koch's postulates.... Another embarrassment for the HIV hypothesis is the extraordinary latency period between infection and the onset of disease, despite the fact that HIV is biochemically most active within weeks of initial infection." Instead, Duesberg's hypothesis is that "AIDS is a chemical syndrome, caused by accumulated toxins from heavy drug use." The very least that could be done with this section would be to link to the pages on Peter Duesberg, the Duesberg hypothesis, and AIDS reappraisal. --CloseWatch 23:42, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>More seriously, is there any credible science that show that HIV does not cause AIDS? Every single peice of information I have ever seen shows it does. Only a few undocumented sources have claimed otherwise in my experience. There are people out there that challenge everything, that is good, that helps science advance, but does it belong in an encyclopedia? Lets not confuse the readers unless some sort of science is involved. I don't know enough about the claim that HIV does not cause AIDS so I cannot offer opinion on that. Only that it should be well cited by reputable science. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 15:07, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay,... I recently read a paper by Yale University professor Serge Lang, Ph.D., detailing a Nature Magazine article attacking the Duesberg hypothesis. There is a link to the Lang paper from the Wiki article on Duesberg. Anyway, the paper seems to show strong evidence that proponents of the causal relationship between HIV and AIDS are guilty of bad science, if you'll read, according to this article, they omitted key information on a study of "random neighborhoods" in San Francisco, as well as failing to show differences between control groups and test groups. According to this Lang paper,</p>
<ul>
<li>Mortality rates of HIV infected Hemophiliacs have not increased, as they theorhetically would have according to current views of AIDS.</li>
<li>Some AIDS patients are HIV negative.</li>
<li>There are thousands of HIV positive Americans living without any apparent AIDS symptoms. EG: Magic Johnson.</li>
<li>In Africa, people with malaria antibodies tested positive for HIV resulting in much larger numbers than would be accurate.</li>
<li>People who die of AIDS related diseases are classified as having died of AIDS, without any tests proving AIDS infections, meaning that cancer, malnutrition, and other ailments are now blamed on AIDS.</li>
<li>Early drugs designed to fight AIDS may have actually caused AIDS-like symptoms, including cancer, death.</li>
</ul>
<p>These things being said, with the backing of Nobel laureates, hundreds of doctors supporting a re-evaluation of AIDS causes, and the lack of direct evidence of a <b>causal</b> relationship between HIV and AIDS, as it has been shown that HIV positive peoples have not all contracted AIDS, even after extended time periods, should not Wikipedia take a more progressive stance in asserting that while HIV has been linked to AIDS, the scientific community still needs to be more thorough in many areas including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classifying AIDS sufferers/deaths only as those infected with HIV dying from AIDS-related diseases</li>
<li>Eliminating as possibilities, other proposed AIDS causes such as exposure to nitrates, exposure to other diseases via blood transfusions, lowered immune system as a result of drug use.</li>
<li>Honestly and scientifically documenting results, rather than accepting the popular and accepted standard.</li>
</ul>
<p>I encourage you all to ACTUALLY READ all available information regarding this issue, because a comprehensive and complete article about AIDS must reflect the true nature of the disease,, where poor statistical representation, in my opinion, has skewed the truth, and damaged science in favor of a political agenda. --Darrenmwong 07:25, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why do AIDS dissidents always assume that if we only had their command of the medical literature, we'd come around? It's mildly offensive to suggest that, because I agree with the scientific consensus that HIV causes AIDS, I haven't actually read the literature. Since User:Darrenmwong, <s>or his various sockpuppets</s> have completely assimilated all the relevant literature, I'd encourage him/her/them to actually spend some time in the real world of HIV patients... those of us who have been around in the pre- and post-HAART era have seen the difference that these treatments (based on the fact that HIV causes AIDS) have made. Look, the AIDS dissident/denialist viewpoint is that of a tiny but vocal minority. It is already mentioned on this page, with a link/POV fork to its own highly detailed page. That is an appropriate amount of coverage (if not too much); we're already probably giving this minority opinion <i>undue weight</i> per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<dd>i don't really consider myself naive or anything, but i think that showing that these fancy drugs with fancy names and classes are simply pills is important. colors and shapes change, and i think we all sorta get that, so i don't think thats a place for worry there. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 01:33, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Information accuracy re swallowing?"</span></h2>
<p>"...contrary to popular belief, one would have to swallow gallons of saliva from a carrier to run a significant risk of becoming infected."</p>
<p>This seems like a HUGE statement to make that references a study from 1996. It could affect many people. I would consider removing it as it seems irresponsible and that many people could assume they are immune if they don't swallow or if they have oral sex with someone who's infected but swallow thinking it's safe since it's not "gallons." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.107.54.98 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.107.54.98.html" title="User talk:69.107.54.98">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.107.54.98_15cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.107.54.98">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Wooooah there. Think. You <i>believe</i> it's wrong. It doesn't make it wrong. And it's not. The amount of HIV virions in salivia are so low, and the the amount neccesary to infect someone else (which isn't 5-10 or something, in case you were wondering), makes salivia a non-issue in HIV prevention. This is why casual contact and kissing isn't a problem for prevention. You would have to swallow gallons of salivia in order to get enough of those virions into you to chance it (which, once they hit your stomach acid, would probably be moot).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, in terms of swallowing semen or at least getting into one's mouth: this does run a very distinct but very very low risk. It is 1:10,000 for the receptive party, and 1:20,000 for the insertive party. Keep in mind, however small this may be, it is worth mentioning. This is a seperate issue from your salivia issue; salivia does touch the penis or vagina in oral sex, but, again, not enough to even come close to calling it transmitable. It would have a risk into the hundreds of thousands if not millions.</dd>

<dd>Hope this helps clear things up. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 16:29, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
