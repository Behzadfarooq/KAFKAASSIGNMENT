<h2><span class="mw-headline">Changing this Article is part of the problem</span></h2>
<p>Orthodox AIDS proponents continually re-write paragraphs of this article to eliminate the actual claims of AIDS dissidents, substituting in claims dissidents don't actually make (often as a result of orthodox AIDSers not understanding dissident claims) and then refuting them with orthodox asssertions. This illustrates the hallmarks of the AIDS orthodoxy: 1) An open, neutral discussion is unacceptable, even on Wikipedia. And 2) Orthodox AIDS proponents often do not actually understand or truly investigate dissident claims. Thus, their rebuttals and re-writes aren't even to the point.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you have studies that back up the dissident view with scientific evidence, and not just essays refuting actual studies, the add them in by all means. However, most dissident studies don't actually use experimental evidence to assert their claims. Also, the phrase <i>those invested in the dominat HIV-causes-AIDS paradigm</i> replacing <i>most of the scientific community</i> is hardly the correct way to put forward the dissident POV.--<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 20:21, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To keep the "terminology" section related to terminology, I moved the claim of open debate suppression into a new "Claim: orthodoxy suppresses open debate" section. To try to move this article marginally closer to an encyclopedic tone, I removed references to "this article" and other Wikipedia edit discussion. Like with other controversial articles, we should be able to use this talk page to find NPOV language. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a> 02:59, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would recommend not to mention Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) as an example of infectious disease that behaves abnormally (although it is most probably an infectious disease, and it does behave abnormally). Other examples, such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), which is also caused by a retrovirus, might be closer to AIDS and prehaps less controversial than CJD. pierremegevand</p>

<p>I'm creating this section, and promoting it above the Pre TOC section, to address problems raised with general article content and layout. I have created other sections below to address specific article sections that need to be discussed (I think). If anyone has any input please speak up now. I'll probably start editing the article in a couple of hours if no one objects. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerda05_6232.html" title="User:Herda05">Herda05</a> 22:08, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article could not possibly be considered of encyclopaedic nature . I doubt any other article's content is so widely in opposition to its heading. This is not an attempt to put forward the views of AIDS dissidents, its an attempt to rubbish them from start to finish. The point of this article should be to put forward the views of the dissidents not to decide whether they are right or wrong. As such the rebuttals ,if their should be any, should be more muted and not put at the end of each paragraph as if they were clinching some sort of deal. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardigan3000_e325.html" title="User:Cardigan3000">cardigan3000</a></p>
<p><br />
I'm about ready to give up on this article. I have better ways of wasting my time. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a></p>
<p>Let me rephrase that. It appears that this topic is simply too <i>religious</i> to be developed as an article on wikipedia. When the different sides completely disagree not just upon facts, but upon basic ontological and epistemological viewpoints, it's impossible to say anything that anyone can agree upon. This is reflected in the constant debates over language and terminology. It's also reflected in the fact that dissidents and orthodox don't just disagree over "facts", they disagree over methods of thinking and methods of reaching conclusions. It often boils down to a "this is why; no, that's not a valid way of reasoning" argument. This is very difficult to reconcile to anyone's satisfaction. Also, the constant langauge of the orthodox ("denialism", "revisionism", etc.) reveals a clear POV that reflects the almost religious tone of the debate. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a></p>
<p><br />
I've been spending a lot of time on non-Wikipedia activities lately, but I've kept an eye on what's happening here. I agree with <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> that things are getting somewhat out of control, and am also tempted to forget I ever saw this article, but I <i>strongly</i> feel that we need this article, particularly because it is a matter of such near-religious proportions. Like the other <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_controversial_issues_fbb2.html" title="Wikipedia:List of controversial issues">controversial articles</a>, the very nature of this subject makes it almost impossible to find a neutral treatment of it. Wikipedia is one of the only places that such a neutral treatment is conceivable (if not entirely feasible).</p>
<p>From what I can gather from a cursory inspection of the editing conflicts to date, the disagreements generally seem to be about (1) what terminology to use, (2) what constitutes fact, and (3) what constitutes a valid line of reasoning (essentially what Revolver has indicated above).</p>
<p>It seems to me that the matter of terminology can be most easily resolved by an introductory statement similar to what is already there under "Terminology", but more explicitly designed to explain the choice of terminology used in the article. There is probably no such thing as a totally neutral set of terminology, so we must make it neutral by stating at the outset that "We call it the HIV theory, but this should not be taken to imply the correctness of any particular viewpoint" or some such.</p>
<p>As for what constitutes fact, at least regarding the "facts" about how the disease is caused and develops, we could just stick with facts about viewpoints. Duesberg observed X, which he believes indicates Y, but Kary Mullis thinks Z. Making purportedly factual claims about the disease itself is where the trouble begins.</p>
<p>The third point, what constitutes a valid line of reasoning, is probably just as easily resolved. Again, the article should present information <i>about</i> those who hold these particular viewpoints; the article itself should not hold these viewpoints. Wikipedia articles can't hope to resolve the deeply philosophical matter of what approach to understanding "reality" is the most appropriate or valid. In general, science prevails around here, but since there is disagreement on what even qualifies as scientific, it's probably best to let the players speak for themselves, and let readers do their own reasoning.</p>
<p>All of the above is simply a re-statement of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> policy, of course. We all gotta cooperate or we'll get nowhere. We know it can be done, since it has been done with so many other controversial topics.</p>
<p>My opinion is this: The first step towards getting this article into a worthwhile form is to begin mercilessly summarizing. There are a lot of tangential discussions, arguments and counterarguments, but nothing to really lead the reader along in understanding the significance of the debate itself. As a reader of this article, I feel as though I'm stuck in between two guys bickering with each other for an hour. I would much prefer brief, concise, and neutral-as-possible statements. Tell me the story of AIDS reappraisal. Don't make it a play-by-play. Take a cue from some of the fantastic journalists that have written on the subject, and let us in to walk around; don't ram it down our throats. Just my opinion&#160;:-) -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 22:31, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's not a debate, it's a scientific hypothesis capable of proof or disproof. I sympathize with your impatience: "reappraisers" need to do the science necessary to support their position, rather than debate it. Yours, the nuisance, Cheesemonkey 06:40, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And many people would say it has been more than disproven. How are you to say they're wrong? By interpreting available data and evidence. This is called "argumentation" and "debate". I don't know what you mean by "do the science necessary". Typical orthodox nonsense reasoning. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 08:34, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, clearly there is disagreement over how best to prove that hypothesis, and how to interpret the scientific (and non-scientific) data that we have. There certainly is some debate&#160;:-) But I don't think anyone is claiming that debate alone is enough to prove anything. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 11:12, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My concern in reading this article is that I know nothing more about the AIDS reappraisal science then when I began. I have to agree with what <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardigan3000_e325.html" title="User:Cardigan3000">cardigan3000</a> said, namely that this appears to be an attempt to rubbish the reappraisal side from the beginning. I'm not even overly opposed to the point/counterpoint form the article attempts. What occurs in practice here though is almost a bulletted list of reappraisers claims, followed by in-depth refutation. In the end I know the arguments against the reappraisal movement, but almost no explanation of the movement's own conclusions or how they arrived at them.--<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerda05_6232.html" title="User:Herda05">Herda05</a> 22:08, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately I'm not expert enough to fill in the data necessary. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> seems to be very knowledgable about the reappraisal arguments, and I hope he hasn't quit the article for good. I could help with formatting and other non-technical issues.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Completely Refactor Page</span></h3>
<p>I propose completely refactoring this page. Specifically, removing the "Arguments by dissidents" section. I think this is appropriate for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The only argument that the AIDS reappraisal group agrees on is that <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a> has not been proven to cause <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>.</li>
<li>Most of the arguments here are covered in the <a href="../../../d/u/e/Duesberg_hypothesis.html" title="Duesberg hypothesis">Duesberg_hypothesis</a> page.</li>
<li>We can create seperate pages for specific members of the movement. For instance, a page on the Perth_Group could describe their arguments, as well as contain the counter arguments by fellow AIDS reappraisal members and mainstream science.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the Duesberg page already exists, most of this format already exists and makes half the material on this page duplicative.--<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerda05_6232.html" title="User:Herda05">Herda05</a> 22:27, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No need to do this <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7ESci_guy_6796.html" title="User:Sci guy">Sci_guy</a>. Reappraisal is about all the minority views on the scientific side of the argument. Conspiracy theories can be found elsewhere. This page gives details on the views, and also tells us why they are not universally held by the scientific community. Something any respectable and responsible article on this subject should do. Sure, Duesberg hypothesis goes into more details on his hypothesis, but that shouldn't impact this page, as he is just one man, and the reappraisal movement asks more than what Duesberg offers. They are not the same, and thus, should not be cut from this page IMO --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 22:36, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not sure what your conspiracy comment comment refers to. I disagree this page describes the movement's views very well. It certainly doesn't describe who are the members of the movement. Shouldn't this page be more about the movement itself, rather than their member's specific views? As far as I can tell, the AIDS reappraisal movement is made up of specific scientists like Duesberg, the Perth Group, etc. who are solely united by their <i>general</i> agreement that HIV has not been proven to cause AIDS. They are specifically seperated by their <i>disagreement</i> regarding HIV.--<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerda05_6232.html" title="User:Herda05">Herda05</a> 22:46, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good point. Can we agree then that the article title does not fit well with the information within the article itself? If we can agree to that, then do you think I should create a second artcile titled AIDS reappraisal movment? That article would describe what I've outlined below? Would that be an ammicable situation? (Please note this makes what I've written below somewhat moot, but it was written earlier and we had a conflicting edit.)</dd>

<dd>The history section of the article, or the page history? I've been going through the page history since yesterday to try and build a better picture for myself. I'm not proposing, at least I don't think, a conspiracy theory or theories. I'm not suggesting that any of the dissident's views are being suppressed. What I am suggesting is this article, as it stands, is of very poor quality. It does little to enlighten the reader about its own page title. Most of the argument information I did get about the dissidents, I found by reading other pages, namely the Duesberg page and going to external links. Since any layman who comes here, like myself, to read and get informed about the topic will have to go elsewhere for the specific argument information anyway, why not make the article simpler? Let's take out the information that is controversial and leave it on the pages of the people who express those views. I don't think it's controversial to say that "the AIDS reappraisal movement argues that HIV is not proven to cause AIDS". Both sides can agree on this, no? I think the first and third paragraphs do this very well. We can then link to those pages involved. This page then would include the "history of the movement" section, then a section on the members. Relegate the arguments by both sides to the members espousing those arguments, rather then lumping the arguments together in a jumbled that sometimes contradict themselves (i.e. how can HIV testing be unreliable, yet at the same time it is argued that it doesn't exist?).</dd>

<dd>As for reappraisal being about "all the minority views on the scientific side of the argument" I disagree. The "movement" has one specific view, that there is no proof for a causitive link between HIV and AIDS. Sepcific members of the movement have evidence and publsihed papers that are refeuted by mainstream scientists. The analogy I would use is the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalisation.html" title="Anti-globalisation">Anti-globalisation</a> movement. Anarchists, communists, peace organizations, and others are part of the movement, but their arguments are not refuted directly on the page describing <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalisation.html" title="Anti-globalisation">Anti-globalisation</a>. That page treats its subject well in that it simply describes the movement. The other thing to note is that AIDS reappraisal movement is heterogeneous, a point that gets lost on this page due to the claim-counterclaim format. Not all of the movement's subscribers agree with the claims made on this page. Duesberg specifically refutes the non-existence of HIV, which seems to be the main argument of the Perth Group. I don't feel this page is the place for any of that discussion.--<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerda05_6232.html" title="User:Herda05">Herda05</a> 00:01, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your reasoning is backwards, Mr. Ed. The gay community supports the notion that HIV causes AIDS, which leads to presumptions that gay lifestyles are practicable if approached with due caution. The idea that HIV is not the primary cause attributes immunodifficiency to lifestyle related causes. The latter view was quickly deemed not to be politically correct by advocacy groups, funded by pharamceutical manufacturers, who lobbied for legalization of anti-viral drugs intended to stop replication not only of HIV but of other viruses which had grown resistant to common treatments due to repeated reinfection and retreatment that often followed continued practice of risky behaviors. However, motivation is irrelevant when weighing scientific evidence. Resting an argument on questions about motivation is ad hominum and does address the topic at hand. All the same, the short answer to your question about motivation is that those who would reappraise the science are motivated by an interest in precise science.</dd>

<dd>Discovery of the supposedly new HIV virus closely followed advent of technology (<a href="../../../p/c/r/PCR_c0ff.html" title="PCR">PCR</a> DNA replication) able to reveal the tiny strip of RNA. The questions advanced by those advocating reappraisal often involve recognition of the lack of extensive testing of samples prior to the current generation. Subsequent tests of such samples revealed older examples of HIV in corpses and in stored tissue samples, which bolstered the curiosity of scientists who were sceptical of the 1984 U.S. government declaration that HIV is the cause behind a newly recognized epedimic.</dd>

<dd>I don't think is a matter of denying anything; those who doubt that HIV causes AIDS do so because they do not believe there is sufficient evidence to show that it does.

<dd>In other words, if we have spent two decades under the assumption that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS, and it hasn't gotten us anywhere in terms of finding a cure or even treating it, it may be wise to consider other possible causes.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This doesn't make sense. We also know that malaria is spread by mosquito bites, and that knowledge has not led to the disease's eradication.

<dd>I think that everyone involved is trying to avoid death, but there are many differing perspectives on how to do that.

<dd>Peter Duesberg, for a while anyway, believed that AIDS was caused predominantly (even exclusively) by long-term IV drug abuse. If he were right, then making sure you have clean needles isn't going to help you, and having safer sex is irrelevant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ditto for this point: long-term IV drug abuse has been around for over a century, and no one ever get AIDS before HIV showed up. It's easy to check whether it's the <i>drug abuse</i> itself or <i>transmission of HIV</i> via contaminated needles is the cause of AIDS. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 14:45, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Duesberg and many others do not think that there is enough evidence to establish, without question, that HIV is the sole cause, and that if we are not certain about HIV being the sole cause, then it may be dangerous and even lethal to proceed as though it were. The known toxic effects of AZT (see above) are just one example of this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If there is any motivation in denying, or questioning, that HIV causes AIDS, I think it is simply scientific investigation at work. When a theory fails to adequately explain our observations, we tend to look for a better theory. Those who are doing this questioning do not think that the HIV theory is doing a very good job of explaining their observations, and a better theory may lead us towards better treatment, or a cure.</dd>

<p>Regarding comments above by Ed Poor: I personally do not have good answers to your questions. This very debate has been going on for somewhere around ten years, and very few compromises or agreements have been reached among the varying parties involved. But the fact remains: Many people have questioned how much we really know about how AIDS is caused. I don't know what causes AIDS, and I am certainly not interested in getting in a debate over it&#160;:-) But I would like to see this article happen. The problem with it thus far is that it tends to degenerate into a series of diatribes and internal debates. I don't think there's room in a single Wikipedia article to detail all the claims, counter-claims, and counter-counter-claims of each camp.</p>
<p>I agree with Rmhermen that the article could use some merciless summarizing, and possibly even a complete rewrite (no offense to <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> who wrote the original framework, but I don't think this format is going to work out after all).

<p>I just read the article without having been involved in any editing before. It was an interesting read but as this is a minority opinion, I don't quite understand why the article is longer than the AIDS and HIV articles taken together. A short summary of maybe 2 or 3 paragraphs should be enough; I don't think the arguments of the debate should be stated here in any breadth. I am not going to do this though as I don't want to hurt the feelings of some of the people that are very involved here. SmilingBoy 01:00, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

It's a minority opinion, but very inflammatory and controversial, and I don't think a short summary can really provide the necessary explanation. There is no doubt that this article needs a lot of work, though. As I stated above, the point-by-point description of the various sides of the argument is probably not the best way to do it, so I agree with you that the arguments should be summarized if possible. Please feel free to do some rewriting - you won't hurt my feelings!

<dd>Revolver, even if you had evidence for the assertion that "the U.S. is the most sexually active and promiscuous country in the world", I think you'd still be attacking a straw man, since "promiscuous... screw with prostitutes" etc. does not appear in the article. I think this is just an unnecessarily vague summary sentence; what it is most likely referring to is the idea that heterosexual anal sex is relatively common in Africa, as well as the use of astringent substances for "dry sex", and that both of these practices increase the risk of HIV transmission. I can't be sure that that's what the author of the above sentence was talking about, but it is an accurate characterization of arguments that have been made against AIDS skeptics, and more well founded than your caricature suggests. --<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 04:55, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I can give you a reference for the "most sexually active nation" claim, if you want. It's a survey done once every few years by some research institute. The way I related the mainstream argument is the way it has been described to me again and again by mainstream "scientists" or doctors. (i.e. YES, they really say, "Well, Africans have more sex, esp. the truck drivers and the prostitution problem.", of course not quite that way in publications, but in communications) This is apparently supposed to be taken on faith, as rarely is any evidence given to support this. I find it really hard to believe that some difference in heterosexual anal sex behaviour can account for the massive qualitative difference between the two epidemics. Heterosexual anal sex is relatively common in the U.S. I have never seen any kind of accurate numbers on sexual behaviour that would account for the difference in the epidemics. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 04:10, 9 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Claim: Drugs cause AIDS</span></h3>
<p>Some dissidents claim that <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrites.html" title="Nitrites">nitrites</a> ("<a href="../../../p/o/p/Poppers.html" title="Poppers">poppers</a>"; a drug commonly used to enhance the sexual experience, principally among homosexual men) were the initial cause of AIDS in the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. They further claim that since nitrites weaken the immune system enough that opportunistic diseases take over and kill the patient and since HIV spreads through sex more easily through anal intercourse that analisys of the cause of AIDS was misled into following the trail of HIV rather than the drug use that caused its transmission. This theory of AIDS thus claims that drug users using nitrites were the first wave of AIDS patients as the nitirites caused AIDS symptoms.</p>
<p>Dissidents further claim that azidothymidine (<a href="../../../a/z/t/AZT_8980.html" title="AZT">AZT</a>) was the primary cause of AIDS symptoms for modern patients diagnosed with HIV. After diagnosis the patient would be prescribed AZT as a preventative drug. AZT works by inhibiting DNA synthesis, thus preventing the creation of new cells. It was hoped that in small amounts this would work on HIV alone. Dissidents claim that in small amounts the drug never reached HIV and affected normal cells, including T-cells, which then caused AIDS symptoms. Since it was prescribed to patients already diagnosed with HIV and has itself caused AIDS, it is considered by dissidents to be a self-fullfilling prophecy. Dissidents commonly site that when AZT fell out of favor as the principal treatment around 1995 that deaths associated with AIDS dropped dramatically <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/stats/hasrsupp81/fig9.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/stats/hasrsupp81/fig9.htm" rel="nofollow">CDC</a>.

<p>This is an important topic It is a paradigm that HIV causes AIDS. Most people are unaware that there are well credentialed scientists who have their doubts and the points they bring up are valid. To suggest that HIV is not equal to AIDS usually results in the speaker being treated like a flat earther.</p>
<p>However if the skeptics are right then our approach to AIDS is wrong! The money being spent on AIDS research and programs in AFRICA could be diverted to providing Clean water and sanitation which may well result in huge advances in the health of Africans.</p>
<p>Furthermore large sums may be spent on drugs which are worse than useless and potentially cause more harm than good.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">false positives</span></h2>
<p>It is a well-known fact that when conducting binary tests for which prevalence is extremely low (such as the prevalence of testing positive for HIV), that the raw rate of false positives, or even the specificity and sensitivity of the test are not always enough to determine how useful the test is. This is why we use the positive/negative predictive values. If prevalence is very low, the specificity and sensitivity may be very good, while the positive predictive value not so good. It is the latter that is important to patients -- you want to know the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conditional_probability.html" title="Conditional probability">conditional probability</a>, the probability that you actually have the disease, given that you test positive. Imagine a disease in a population of 1,000,000, where 1,000 have the disease, and all test positive, but another 1,000 who don't have the disease also test positive. The specificity (Sp = P [ Test is negative | Patient is healthy ]) is very good, namely 998,000/999,000 or roughly 99.9%. The sensitivity (Sn = P [ Test is positive | Patient has the disease ]) is also very good, namely 1,000/1,000 or 100%. Yet the test is worse than useless from a patient's perspective, since the positive predictive value (PPV = P [ Patient has the disease | Test is positive ]) is only 1,000/2,000 or 50%. In other words, although the specificity and sensitivity are very high, and the rate of false positives (1,000/1,000,000 = .1%) quite low, if you are a patient, and you are told that you have tested positive, you only have a 50% of actually having the disease. The study given in the article had a population of about 130,000, with only 15 reporting positive, and a single false positive. It's ridiculous to draw such conclusions from such a small number of actual positive results, esp. in a population in which prevalence is very rare. The fact that the WB test is itself questioned as a gold standard only adds to the confusion. The conclusion of the paper is basically, "it's okay to thumb your nose at <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayes%27_Theorem_e36d.html" title="Bayes' Theorem">Bayes' Theorem</a>", which coming from HIV researchers, doesn't surprise me. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 23:19, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, yes, we all know there are many measures of the usefulness of a test. This 1988 paper was accepted and published by the New England Journal of Medicine, whose reviewers clearly did not share your opinion of the paper. Other studies in blood donors (confirming positivity with HIV RNA specific tests) found rates of false positivity of 4.8% of Western blot positive donors and 0.0004% for all donors. Surely you don't prefer the blatantly deceptive version of this article that falsely claimed the study cited demonstrated an 84% false positive rate? - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 23:27, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, did I put that back in? (No.) I'm not sure where that came from. Regardless of what the reviewers thought, the statement in the abstract shows a misunderstanding of the use of these terms. The whole point of positive predictive value is that it is supposed to give a more accurate value of usefulness when the prevalence is extremely low. If the purpose of the study was to "determine the usefulness of the test in low-prevalence populations", then the raw false positive rate per patient tested is not the right measure to use, esp. in a population where prevalence is on the order of 1 in 10,000! Whether or not the reviewers chose to ignore this fact out of stupidity or political reasons is not my place to say -- the fact remains, and simply quoting the 1 out of 130,000 number and saying "that proves it's good" without giving the actual number of positives is misleading. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 23:36, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the total attention of AIDS research is directed toward its predicated viral etiology, the intestinal stress and tissue cortisone release factor induced physiology of the body, over a long period of time, and dependent on the mode and frequency of homosexual practice, can possibly be the precipitating cause of this condition. It is proposed that in homosexuals, AIDS is an intestinal stress induced metabolic disorder and, opioid peptides being markers of stress to regulatory systems of the body, excessive use of opiates can possibly cause an indirect promotion of stress physiology that can bring about the associated immune system inhibition and disturbance.</p>

<dd>You didn't bother to mention what his "distinguished credentials" are; in fact he was rather famous, but as a crank who claimed most diseases could be cured with water.

<dd>But just supposing the water cure stuff is irrelevant; the article you linked to is still terrible. First, it's <i>16 years old</i>; even Peter Duesberg has taken the trouble to update his arguments slightly in that time as more information has emerged. Second, it's full of suppositions and wild leaps (e.g. that recreational drugs "possibly" have "antihistaminic properties"), repeats some common and easily disproven arguments (e.g. if you have antibodies, the disease can't be progressing), and relies heavily on a rather bizarre notion of what the average gay man does in bed ("severe and unceasing [injury] to the intestinal tract").

The rest of the conspiracy article is about people who believe HIV was created deliberately, but unlike most of the people discussed in "AIDS reappraisal", they pretty much agree with mainstream science on the disease-causing properties of the virus. <a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob"></a>←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 22:56, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm aware of very few scientists, dissident or orthodox, who actually believe this. And I was a member of a dissident mailing list for a couple years, back in 1996-98, where John Lauritsen, Celia Farber, Fred Cline, Paul Philpott, and many others were regular contributors. I don't remember any of them claiming the kind of "AIDS as biowarfare" that you're talking about. It's true that Lauritsen often uses the term "AIDS War", but I don't think he means it in the sense of "biowarfare". He's referring to the psychological and sociological aspects of the phenomenon. As far as a conscious conspiracy to create a biological agent to cause AIDS, this actually makes little sense, since most dissidents don't think AIDS is caused by a biological agent, so the whole "biowarfare" claim would strike them as strange. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 05:38, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's an opinion, not a fact. Although I believe HIV causes AIDS, and there is a lot of evidence pointing towards this, it still remains that their theories cannot be completely discounted, no matter how much you disagree with them. As has been pointed out, these people have credentials and have written papers, they may have made mistakes in those papers or they may not, but that doesn't give you reason to offhandedly dismiss them as denialists. They've taken time to think about this, they haven't leapt forward with no reasoning, so they deserve to be listened to. Wikipedia is neutral, and as such does not take sides in a debate. It can show both sides of an argument, but I have to say that this article has a lot of bias towards the people who propose the link between HIV and AIDS. Regardless of your personal opinions, Wikipedia's rules outlaw this style of writing. These people are citing opinion mixed in with fact, but so are the other side, so the debate deserves to be presented neutrally.Humpelfluch 20:57, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">General Bias</span></h2>
<p>I have noticed a general bias running throughout this article. The format of reappraisal claims consist of a short paragraphs explaining this alternative view and is followed by multiple, in-depth paragraphs explaining why this viewpoint is wrong. Maybe this cannot be avoided, but it seems to me that a lot of the information provided and claims made against the "AIDS reappraisal" theory are stated as proven scientific fact instead of merely an opposing opinion.</p>
<p>The article is very thurough, very well cited, very well researched. But it is told from a biased point of view and structured in what seems like a very deliberate manner in order to provide a concise argument debunking this alternative theory on AIDS. Again it isnt an argument that I necessarily disagree with, and the support it has could be why this article has taken on this structure, but it should be presented with the appropriate diction and format to let the reader make their own decisions from unbiased information. Not to be just shuffled into one camp or another by an eloquant argument.</p>

<dd>An encyclopedia's job is not to judge "credence" it is to neutrally report the cited allegations of nobel peace prize winners and report any cited counter criticisms and arguments. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 18:25, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Silly me. I thought the role of an encyclopedia was to state fact, not opinion. It is the opinion of these people that HIV doesn't cause AIDS. Unfortunately, they produce no evidence to prove this POV, whereas the mainstream scientific community has produced evidence in such substantial quantities that it is now fact. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 20:45, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a ton of evidence if you look for it. An encyclopedia is still required to neutrally report someone's relevant opinion and accusations (and cite it to that person and not dismiss it). The mainstream scientific community itself doesn't even have a firm grasp on the mechanics of AIDS so there isn't much conclusive "evidence" either way. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 22:02, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is your point of view, and it's very interesting you and Grcampbell are both so adamant on this subject and psychologically manipulative at the same time. Instead of trying to dismiss the critics view in absolute terms why don't you simply attempt to scientifically butress the mainstream view? Despite your insistence on scientific fact you haven't actually gone into any details, factual or other. The issue is neutral reporting that includes all viewpoints, it's not about some absolute conclusion. Though, I am actually completely disinterested in continuing this conversation and/or test. The evil cabal's days are numbered and/or the cabal behind the cabal to expose the evil cabal has a master plan of exposure in motion, it appears as if my work (if any) is done or is inapplicable and I will mostly just sit back and watch I guess. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 23:04, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

At one point I assumed AIDS reappraisal covered the "conspiracy theory" angle but boy was I wrong, perhaps I errantly assumed a more neutral portrayal would begin from this article.

<dd>There is no justification to present any subject with the "conspiracy theory" label, see Wikipedia:Title Neutrality. Why are you so adamant that I have somehow been deceived?

<dd>Your interpretation is incorrect, I stated above that the appearances you cling to apparently have deceived you. Whatever it is that you claim to have "agreed" to is befuddle inducing but I should expect no less. Any method of presentation that discourages an investigation and iterative testing of both "fact" and "theory" is biased and taints pristine mental clarity. This article omits the fact that some AIDS "reappraisers" have made biowarfare accusations, how do you explain that? The word "reappraisal" insufficiently conveys the vastness of error should the purported mainstream understanding of AIDS be intentionally or even inadvertently incorrect. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 09:34, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>That is an errant interpretation for multiple reasons. For starters a proponent of "conspiracy theory" in titles, I believe it was Adhib, just updated the counter argument within Wikipedia:Title Neutrality so other editors are actively working on it. Secondly, a week or two ago there were half a dozen users on <a href="../../../9/2F/1/Talk%7E9_11_conspiracy_theories_b1d3.html" title="Talk:9/11 conspiracy theories">Talk:9/11 conspiracy theories</a> that agreed "conspiracy theory" is pejorative for a proposed subsection split to a sub article (6 other editors or so disagreed so there was no consensus). Thirdly and fourthly, title neutrality is drastically different and updated compared to the original conspiracy theory proposal but even it it wasn't the vote closed over 6 months ago which is more than enough time to have elapsed before proposal resubmittal.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Orthodoxy?</span></h2>
<p>The statement: <i>A observation of AIDS dissidents is that orthodox AIDS proponents prevent an open discussion or presentation of AIDS reappraiser or dissident positions. To AIDS dissidents, that observation illustrates the hallmarks of the AIDS orthodoxy: that an open, neutral discussion is unacceptable; and that orthodox AIDS proponents often do not actually understand or truly investigate dissident claims.</i> is highly POV. Do you have an actual source that confirms this or is this just your opinion? Unsourced material does not belong in WIkipedia, and if you can find a source that actually makes this claim, then you should include it, otherwise this material will be deleted.</p>
<p>To call a mainstream scientific view as "orthodox" is highly POV terminology as well, but again, if you can find a source then cite it. Otherwise this terminolgy has to be changed. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 20:21, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Language is inherently subjective. Read the definition of orthodox, learn a little about AIDS, and you will realize that AIDS dissidents are NOT orthodox and HIV-promoters are. It's simple. If YOU think orthodoxy is an insult, then it is a comment on your metaphysical views, not on whether dissident are in fact orthodox or not. Sgactorny 20:32, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Some language is less subjective than others. "Orthodox" is a bad word to use in this context. Please keep [[[WP:NPOV]] in mind.

<li>Sgactorny, Wikipedia is not a place to "promote views", that's where "point-of-view" comes from.

<ul>
<li>Most of the article is written from the orthodox POV. DIssident positions aren't even accurately stated on most of this page. I agree it could use more sourcing. But you are repeatedly choosing to censor the DISSIDENT part, instead of trying to cut out the nonsense written by the orthodox people. Ask yourself why you are doing that? I am a dissident, who has worked quite prominently in the dissident community. Why not calm down and let me, over time, try and clean up the mess in this page? It is a COMPLETE mess. I'm going to contact other eloquent dissidents, perhaps they will be interested in editing it too. But for now, please stop censoring dissident positions while selectively leaving in orthodox positions. That's just wrong. Sgactorny 20:48, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There's a reason the "orthodox" views are called "orthodox" and a reason the "dissident" views are called "dissident".

<li>Thanks for your admission in your latest message. You are making my case for me. All you are doing is stating that you are a member of the orthodox by arguing in a circle that you are right and we're not, saying you have more evidence and we don't. Of course, having spent ten years reading AIDS research, I think you're insane. And you think I'm insane.

<li>Sgactorny, This is not your page, first of all. It is not a platform to espouse views. It is very convenient to portray yourself as a victim of censorship, to justify you putting out your own point of view. This is basically what creationists do in order to put out a view under the auspices of so-called sacientific evidence. The reason there is so much more mainstream science on the page is basically due to the fact, that there is an overwhelming amount of evidence out there suggesting HIV causes AIDS. That being said, perhaps this page could be shortened dramatically, to simply state something like: 1) Some people disagree that HIV causes AIDS, say who they are. 2) This is why they think so, cite your sources. 3) This is what their critics say. And all this could be done in 3 paragraphs with no POV terms like orthodoxy or whatever. There is no need to have such a lengthy article on such a fringe movement. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 21:15, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>After reading the definition of orthodoxy, as listed on Wikipedia, I agree it is a POV term. I will remove it soon. However, I will continually replace all dissident arguments and claims that are taken out by the AIDS mainstream promoters who keep coming on here and censoring the dissident page. The very fact that this keeps happening shows those who read this without an investment in either "side" exactly what the orthodoxy has been doing ever since Gallo's press conference in 1984, when he got his patent on his HIV antibody test: dissidents are censored and their arguments distorted. And most AIDS dissidents, in my experience, do not view AIDS as a conspiracy of any sort. The AIDS conspiracy theorists believe things that are ENTIRELY different than the scientists, drs., activists, etc. that comprise the AIDS dissident community. If the two pages overlap, then it just shows how messed up Wikipedia still is about these two issues. However, no doubt mainstreamers will do their very best to confuse readers and try make dissidents the same as the conspiracy theorists. Sgactorny 00:48, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Thanks for leaving the POV tag with your last edit. I'm sure we can all work toward a complete, verifiable, and encyclopedic article. Maybe it would help to lay out a plan on the talk page for moving toward that goal. Any suggestions? The Rod 00:45, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Rod, my general tip would be to stop the AIDS mainstreamers with their agenda from distorting AIDS dissident views on the dissident page...until dissident like myself who have actually read AIDS research for over a decade can get to fixing this ridiculously messy page. The problem with these other folks is that they know very little about even the mainstream views, let alone what the dissident scientists say, so their edits end up being tacit or overt censorship of dissident views and arguments. WHat would help is if they would simply butt out until the page can be cleaned up by those who actually know what the scientific arguments are in favor of the dissident views. No one who is editing this page is familiar with their views. it is obvious from the statements they make. So if everyone would just take a deep breath, I actually sent email to some prominent dissident activists, and invited them to come and make some NPOV contributions. Maybe they'll respond. Until then, I'll work, slowly, to make an ACCURATE non-POV page. BUt I have a full life and that will take a while. In the meantime, I won't allow mainstreamers to come on constantly and delete the VERY FEW accurate dissident positions on this page. As for the constant insults from the mainstreamers on these talk page, the FACT of the matter is that there are BOOKS written about the dissident positions, by scientists from all over the world, with hundreds of scientific references. The fact that none of these people have read them is evidenced by the fact that they continually say there is hardly anything in favor of dissident views. And when they do present what they think is a dissident view, they are wrong. One editor is not even apparently aware that the orthodoxy calls AIDS dissidents AIDS DENIALISTS in most of their writing, and has for years!!! So why should these people, who don't even know dissident views, be editing this page? Ridiculous. Sgactorny 00:54, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sgactorny, It seems like the only claim you make for "your side" is the claim that your claims are distorted. Why don't you start with that list at the beginning of the article that summarizes the view of the dissidents? From what I see of the article, most of what you call censorship is basically scientifically sound claims easily debunking all of the claims made by dissidents at the beginning of the article. So far, your contributions to the article are about how your views get distorted. So, if you complain that nobody understands these so-called dissident views, especially those orthodox scientists you keep mentioning, then maybe you should start by addressing how those claims are not the claims of the dissident movement, rather than accusing everyone of censoring you.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As a practical suggestion, why don't you start a temp page at Talk:AIDS reappraisal/temp where you can work on the article to your liking and then upload it to the actual article? <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 01:08, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'll argue about whether HIV causes AIDS with any person who has actually read the dissident, peer-reviewed articles. But I'll never be baited into a conversation with you Nrets, when not only do you have NO idea about what dissident claims actually are, you aren't even familiar with mainstream arguments. And worse than your admitted ignorance, is your willing and continual censorship of the AIDS dissident page. The temp idea is tempting, however, other dissidents may soon appear who will have more time than I to contribute. I do not have much time right now, and that is why I haven't done much else but block your censorship. I DO have time for that, I'll get to fixing the article towards NPOV slowly, but surely. People who actually know what the dissident arguments and evidence is of course have a basis for editing the article. You and the others who know nothing about dissident science, but who only insult it and censor it, please just stop. Sgactorny 01:17, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Once again, all I hear from you is complaints about being censored. I am more familiar than you think with AIDS research, and yes, my knowledge about so-called dissident claims is limited. Nevertheless, any claims that this article makes about HIV not causing AIDS are scientifically unsound and easily disproven, and that is what I have been editing. If there are any better arguments out there, I would be happy to hear them, but I somehow suspect that there aren't which is why you have resorted to personal accusations against me and other editors. It is the lack of basic science education in the US that makes questionable scientific claims polular (take creationism for instance), and I am comitted to fighting this type of irresponsible misinformation whenever I encounter it. Again, your argument that you are being censored leads me to believe that you really have no better defense for these claims. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 01:43, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"my knowledge about so-called dissident claims is limited. Nevertheless, any claims that this article makes about HIV not causing AIDS are scientifically unsound and easily disproven, and that is what I have been editing."</p>
<p>What a remarkably illogical contradiction. I notice that most scientists are not ever required, as they pursue their careers, to prove they understand logic or critical thinking. I would submit that were scientists required to prove mastery of critical thinking skills and receive classic logic training, that many of the people killed by the AIDS establishment would still be living today. I personally have witnessed people killed and maimed by the "miracle" anti-AIDS drugs. And that is one reason I'm passionate about this subject. But back to you, "any claims about HIV not causing AIDS are unsound" even though you admit you aren't even familiar with dissident evidence. What could be more orthodox than that?????? It fits the definition entirely. It is scientific ignorance and religious devotion. Period. Sgactorny 01:47, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I fail to see the lack of logic here. Once again, its yourlack of logic that fails. And you resort to personal attacks. If you have such a strong case, let's have it. Again, all your contributions to the article are about how evil orthodox scientists are out to kill, maim and censor people like you. Are you going to tell me that vaccines are not effective in protecting against diseases? That antibiotics are a conspiracy by the medico-industrial complex?

By the way, nrets, when are you going to take the time to educate yourself on the other side of AIDS?!???? I've been reading boths sides for over 10 years, not the propaganda from either side, but the actual peer-reviewed AIDS literature. When do you plan to get equally informed about both sides? And if you're not informed about AIDS dissident positions, how do you know it won't convince you of something? Even if you don't, nrets, others see the insanity of rejecting scientific positions you admit you haven't even considered. That isn't science, that's religion. And that is why so many AIDS dissidents call you all the ORTHODOXY. That's exactly what you are, by your own admission.

<p>This is a direct criticism of the dissident movement by an established source. This fits with all the guidelines of NPOV, the fact that you are deleting this shows that your agenda here is not to have a factual discussion about dissident claims, but really to stiffle all criticism of them and accuse everyone else of censorship.

<p>You dnot even understand the difference between an actual ARV and a drug that works by mass destruction of the immune system being USED AS an ARV. That is how ignorant you are of scientific reality and dissident views. You admitted you know nothing about dissident views. You admitted you are an orthodox AIDS promoter here, to promote the AIDS orthodoxy. STOP IT. Go to the mainstream AIDS page and bash dissidents, not here. This page isn't for a "rational discussion about the issues." It is for NPOV about AIDS dissidents. You are not capable of seeing what that is, since by your own admission you are IGNORANT of their views. So stop adding orthodox POV to this page, especially since you don't even KNOW you are adding orthodox POV to the page. And the reason you don't know it, is because you don't know dissident evidence. On AZT, the very reason it killed tens-of-thousands of gay men in this country is BECAUSE it was NOT an ARV, but was given to healthy gay men (along with sick ones). It maimed and killed them, and most of the orthodoxy admits that, even if you don't! And if you don't realize that, then you are profoundly ignorant of ALL AIDS science, dissident or orthodox. So stop editing this page until you take the time to READ ABOUT the ACTUAL dissident positions. Otherwise, you aren't qualified to edit the page. Sgactorny 18:58, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sgactorny accuses others of censorship, yet it is exactly that which he is doing to this page. A NPOV article should outline both POV, and the fact that he continues to delete and dare I say it, censor the fact that mainstream scientists have indeed studied and have come to the conclusion that they disagree with AIDS dissidents in the highly credited journal <i>Science</i> only emphasises the fact that this user does not want to work towards a NPOV article, but simply one that bashes real factual evidence. If this user is able to contribute data and evidence from real scientists who work in the field that discredits the mainstream view, without cherry-picking data, then he or she should do so.

<li><b>Comment</b> Counter criticisms belong in a section for counter criticisms, a summary of the mainstream view is already covered in the <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> article and it would be (or is) redundant and biasing to excessively include them here. Let the AIDS "dissidents" present their arguments, specific counter criticisms should be put in a subsection dedicated for that purpose. Historically, this article and subject within Wikipedia seemingly has been written from the POV of excessively comparing and constrasting the dissident view with the "mainstream view" for the purpose of trying to reject, or discourage an investigation of, the "dissident" views, which is exponentially non-neutral and unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 00:53, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Having read the Science article about 50 times, and knowing probably none of you have read it once, and even if you have you never checked out its accuracy (I have) I will not allow it to be characterized as actually refuting dissident positions, because it doesn't. Instead, it misstates dissident positions, leave out the real evidence dissidents point to in their writings, and then refutes the straw man. This is propaganda, plain and simple. Having worked with many of the scientists who fight for dissident views to be accurately repoorted, I got used to it. Having lost so many to AIDS, I just won't let it happen on Wikipedia too. I'm just not THAT cynical yet. Sgactorny 22:21, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>OK, here is a more direct version of the paragraph:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In 1994 the journal <i>Science</i> conducted a 3-month investigation to examine the validity of the dissident claims. <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/cohen/266-5191-1642a.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/cohen/266-5191-1642a.pdf" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> They interviewed AIDS supporters and detractors, examined the primary AIDS literature including Duesberg’s publications. This investigation found that “...although the Berkeley virologist raises provocative questions, few researchers find his basic contention that HIV is not the cause of AIDS persuasive. Mainstream AIDS researchers argue that Duesberg’s arguments are constructed by selective reading of the scientific literature, dismissing evidence that contradicts his theses, requiring impossibly definitive proof, and dismissing outright studies marked by inconsequential weaknesses.” The <i>Science</i> investigation also found that although Duesberg and the dissident movement have garnered support from some prominent mainstream scientists, most of this support is related to Duesberg’s right to hold a dissenting opinion, rather than support of his claims that HIV does not cause AIDS.</dd>

<p>Like past AIDS dissidents who have tried to make an honest, NPOV page, I will now yield to the two or three AIDS orthodox promoters set on changing this page so the public can't know the truth about what AIDS dissidents say.

<p>Can you honestly say you believe these others, who admit they don't know dissident science, believe in the orthodoxy, and repeatedly insert orthodox positions are interested in this page accurately presenting an encyclopedia article to the public? From the dissident perspective, the mainstream has had its views in the public for 20 years! And whenever we try and present the alternatives, supported by scientists with as much credentials (or more) as the orthodox scientists who make their money promoting HIV and AIDS meds, those orthodox people are right there inserting POV and censoring and getting us banned wherever possible. It isn't a conspiracy, any more than when people believed leeches cured illness was. But societal heirarchies and the fact that most people do not actually have good critical thinking skills make Thomas Kuhn's time-tested maxim true: When an establishment exists that is invested in a paradigm, the masses defend it to the death, even though the masses know nothing about it. For this is what must occur for a society to survive: THere are leaders (duesberg, gallo, montagnier, mullis) and followers (nrets, grcampbell). The only thing that eventually changes a dominant paradigm (such as HIV-causes-AIDS) is time: as the orthodoxy literally dies, and the next generation has no investment in either side. And a new paradigm can occur. This is what has occurred all throughout human history, and AIDS is no different. In my 10 years working on this issue, I have noticed that when people come to AIDS with no investment in either side, and they actually take the time to read the actual dissidents' writings, they become a dissident. I can hardly think of any exceptions to this observation. QuestionAIDS.com or Virusmyth.net are a couple of the best repositories of actual dissident data. I've noticed that dissidents don't try and censor the orthodoxy, in fact we're the first to say READ THE ORTHODOXY DATA! We find that upon actually reading what the the orthodoxy says is its science, critical thinkers come to the conclusion its crap. Interesting how dissidents WANT the public to read orthodoxy articles, but the orthodoxy does everything it can to suppress the debate and free flow of dissident information. No surprise, history predicts this. As for this article, it is 98% nonsense, as I've said in many previous posts. It is designed to make people think there is nothing to dissidents' views. You know, is the orthodox people, like nrets, were so confident in the orthodox positions, why do you think they need to come on here and do edit wars with dissidents? I think the answer is obvious... Sgactorny 23:22, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
it sounds wrong. The definition of anti-retroviral should be a drug that specifically targets a retrovirus -- hence "ANTI-RETROVIRAL." AZT doesn't. It specifically targets DNA synthesis and was discovered long before HIV. It was shelved before it ever got to humans because it was so toxic, killing lab rats quite swiftly. The fact that it rather indiscriminately kills dividing cells of the immune system is why it kills so many people (and also why they thought it might SLOW the progression of AIDS -- but there are no studies that show it does anything good for anyone, and the orthodoxy admits that now)). If you were HIV-negative and took AZT, you would likely progressively lose your health and immune system. You would soon lose your hair, muscles and energy. Soon, you would exhibit many of the illnesses in the category called AIDS. You would likely eventually die. Dissidents argue that calling AZT, and other drugs like it, "anti-retroviral" is a symptom of what is wrong with the AIDS orthodoxy. Misleading language about the nature of this chemical misleads HIV diagnosed individuals into going along with very bad suggestions. Your suggestion is that we just simply call the drug what the orthodoxy calls it? That is no solution, since calling things by names that don't fit what they are is a big cause of the ignorance surrounding HIV and AIDS. Another example in the AIDS world of this Orwellian approach to naming things is the notion of "viral load." The person who invented the technology that gives rise to "quantitative PCR" is Dr. Kary Mullis. He got a nobel prize for creating PCR. And guess what? He's an AIDS dissident. And he says "quantitative PCR" does not actually count virus. It COPIES fragments of DNA assumed to come from a virus. Even if the assumption was correct that the DNA comes from fragments of a virus, and dissidents say it isn't, counting DNA fragments is not counting actual infectious VIRUS. Why does the establishment use "quantitative PCR" to "count" DNA fragments and call it virus? BECAUSE ALL THE CLASSIC WAYS FOR COUNTING VIRUS DO NOT WORK FOR HIV, NEVER HAVE. Because, as Duesberg would claim, you often can't find infectious HIV in AIDS patients. So lots of the problems caused by the AIDS orthodoxy in fact revolve around using terms that don't actually match the reality. You are suggesting we do that in the AIDS dissident page. We will NOT do that on the AIDS dissident page. Because to do it, by definition, is to put in orthodox POV. Do you understand? I think it is stupid to continue this discussion through talk. Rod, you seem like you actually have an open mind, you just don't know much about the issues. I respect that. Rather than my spending time answering your reasonable questions here, I think it is best to let me prepare what I consider a NPOV referenced article. Sound cool? In the meantine, rather than asking me questions, go to virusmyth and enter in search terms that you are curious about, like viral load, you will then find referenced articles explaining with clear logic and evidence the problems with the orhtodox logic. If you indeed have an open mind, are genuinely interested in the subject, and have the ability to think critically, I think you will quickly find that the AIDS orthodoxy is like "Alice in Wonderland." I've been reading basic AIDS research for over 10 years. And to quote a leading AIDS dissident, AIDS research attracts the worse kind of scientists: interested in fame and fortune. AIDS research is the "dung heap of science research." The reasoning is most often absurd, the definitions of things are smoke and mirrors, and more than anything else, the data in the studies do not match the abstracts and the conclusions.

<li>Maybe WE CAN SAY...sorry...we can say that AZT is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, use for it's anti-retroviral effects. Many drugs (such as chemotherapeutic agents used against cancer) work by interrupting normal cellular function which has been harnessed by the disease-causing agent. At the time it was first used, AZT was one of the few drugs that could slow HIV replication, despite its side effects. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 02:03, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for your response, Sgactorny. Maybe I'm being dense here, but I think my suggestion is consistent with your sentiment, i.e., the article should say that the AIDS reappraisal movement disputes the AZT's antiretroviral classification. Anyway, I look forward to seeing your suggestions here on the talk page. Then we can work toward agreement and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_page_protection_b2ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for page protection">request unprotection of this article</a>.

<p>There was never any evidence it slowed "HIV replication." Especially since viable, infectious HIV can't be found is most AIDS patients. That's why they started using Dr. Mullis's PCR technology to count fragments of DNA assumed to be from HIV. Why don't you busy yourself with responding to what I'm saying? I'd LOVE to see what you come up with. Sgactorny 03:11, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sgactorny, look, with all due respect, everyone here is trying to work with you but you keep on insulting other editors with your personal attacks. Would you like to be blocked again for attacking users? We know you have been reading AIDS research for the past 10 years, we know you have worked with Duesberg, we know you have lost firends to AIDS, but many of us have been reading AIDS research, doing research, treating patients, etc. for longer than that. So rather than accusing the "orthodoxers" of "ignorance" and nit-picking every word, why don't you post some constructive alternatives to the question posed by <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a>?

<p>I cannot acctept your invitation to debate the affectiveness of AZT, Sgactorny, as Wikipedia isn't a forum for such debate. This talk page, however, is the appropriate place to discuss what content to put on the AIDS reappraisal page. We are awaiting your comment on how to improve my original suggestion for how this article should describe AZT. As a reminder, that suggestion is this:</p>

<p>I was talking to nrets. And I wasn't suggesting a debate, I have a life. I was suggesting he actually try and refute anything I say, instead of just making constant orthodox POV on the dissident page. As for your suggestion, it is putting the cart way before the horse. The page you see will soon cease to exist entirely, as it is really an orthodox page masquerading as a dissident page, except for the intro part. The rest is orthodox POV. You'd know that if you actually read dissident literature.&#160;:) Anyway, I will be slowly putting together a dissident page elsewhere, and we'll bring it here when the time is appropriate. It will be referenced and NPOV. And then if the orthodoxy tries to insert orthodox POV and censor us, i'll take it all the way to the top... I've watch too many people die to just let it go and not care. For now, goodbye. Sgactorny 04:32, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sgactorny, I appreciate your enthusiasm and look forward to your proposed replacement content. In the meantime, however, this article page is locked to encourage us to work out content differences here. If you are planning to work elsewhere instead of here, please let us know about how long your effort might take.

<dd>That is a good source. It would be inaccurate to refer to the purported mainstream view of AIDS as something approaching a consensus scientific view. I've been thinking, it seems the entire concept of a "mainstream view" is nothing more than a media construct -- a random scientist would present their findings and solicit comments and criticism, not portray conclusiveness a certain way. Some segment of the media would be complicit in vast error should the purported mainstream view of AIDS be incorrect. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 09:18, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>This list hardly makes the dissident view "manstream". You can get anybody to sign a petition. There is no media conspiracy here, scientists don't get together in back rooms and say "let's suppress some dissident views". Scientific consensus is bulit upon thousands of scientific observations, validated over and over again until everyone pretty much agrees on something. Sure, you can always find studies that conntradict each other, and if you focus on that you can say that "the whole theory is wrong". No scientist will tell you that we know everything there is to know about how HIV works, not even its most avid proponents. But that doesn't mean that there is no consensus, and that what we do understand is wrong. Most of the data cited by dissidents as problematic, seems to be 10-20 years old. Scientific progress moves at a great pace and many of those original criticisms have been addressed. You still have a right to your dissenting opinion of course, but if someone shows you evidence refuting it, respondinng by calling them an ignorant idiot is certainly not going to help your case. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 16:49, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There were ONLY a few dozen "experienced virologists" in the whole world when HIV was promoted as causing AIDS in the 1984 press conference, without any studies published establishing this. Peter Duesberg was probably the leading retrovirologist in the world at the time (he says HIV doesn't cause AIDS), so said Robert Gallo (co-discoverer of HIV). Robert said HIV caused AIDS, Peter said it didn't. Robert was better at the press conferences, Peter was horrible at them. Robert's science papers are a joke, Peter's are not. Science by press conference is the theme of the HIV-causes-AIDS paradigm, and the primary or even sole reason the paradigm got entrenched. Duesberg was extremely self-destructive in refusing to learn about how to do PR. Gallo, Montagnier and Ho were opposite, rather poor scientists, and liars to bat, but exceptional at manipulating the press and government. A common question from the orthodox is, How could all these people be wrong? The answer is that hardly anyone was wrong in the beginning, just a handful of scientists. But since they used the press, INSTEAD of peer reviewed journals, to adjudicate thier science, they convinced the world, literally overnight, that HIV caused AIDS. By the time the other handful of scientists who were experts started to realize the original sin of HIV science (there wasn't any good science), it was too late. The press said HIV caused AIDS, so did the government and AIDS activists. By this time, there was no way for the establishment to consider AIDS might be more complicated than HIV without hundreds of careers utterly in ruins, and billions of dollars of lawsuits from the invalid HIV tests, toxic AIDS meds, etc. So the establishment has been the last 20 years trying to explain all the absurd contradictions in AIDS science to keep HIV the sole cause of AIDS. There has never once been any legitimate inquiry to it, except by President Mbeki, who was immediately attacked by the entire world as insane. All the articles put on this site as legit consideration of dissident views are bullcrap. None of them do that, not Maddox or Cohen or Ascher. They were written to try and protect HIV, not to genuinely examine all sides. Anyway, all this is why Thomas Kuhn's maxim will be true for AIDS: Reigning paradigms never die until the establishment promoters literally die off. Too much is at stake for them to consider they've been wrong, and it will scare the world way, way, way too much about the fallibility of science and authorities. But many of you reading this have no investment in whether HIV causes AIDS, and you will learn a lot if you read questionaids.com and virusmyth.net .

<li>Sgactorny I think the science article is fairly impartial and set out without any agenda, and if you read then series of them they seem to do a fairly thorough job of debunking dissident claims. Of course you say that what they claim are dissident claims are not dissident claims, but they directly review Duesberg's papers and Duesberg himself. But no matter what we say here, it seems like any criticism of the dissident claims you will categorize as "propaganda". But this is ridiculous, for you to say things like "the press said HIV caused AIDS, so did the government and AIDS activists" makes little sense because there is no one unified opinion in the press, the government nor in the scientific establishment. You are talking like there is some vast conspiracy here, but there isn't. There are literally hundreds of virologists around the world working on HIV, publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and to say that they are all "in on it" or have been brainwashed somehow is absurd. Scientists vary in their opinions greatly about pretty much anything. You claim that scientists do HIV research for the fame and glory, but I can guarantee you that if someone conclusively shows HIV does not cause AIDS they will get far more fame and glory and attention than by plodding away into one obscure gene sequence or another. Your view about how science is done is very distorted, you do not realize how mundane the day to day aspect of it is. There is very little glory in it, believe me. Meanwhile you take publicity-hungry people like Kary Mullis to champion your cause, who in an interview I just read with him he basically claims that anybody with AIDS that is not gay or a drug user is basically lying about his lifestyle. Get off your high-horse, you are not the only educated person here. Maybe you would benefit from spending some time working in an actual laboratory rather than reading over-hyped accusations about this vast conspiracy. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 19:37, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Nrets, are you telling us you are in a laboratory doing some kind of research and yet you simultaneously think that you can judge dissident claims without actually reading any dissident literature, only the CRITICISMS of it? I can think of nothing less scientific. SCARY. You admit you don't know dissident claims or literature, and you judge dissident claims as absurd. Can the readers of this talk page see how insane this reasoning is? The Science article by Cohen DISTORTS Duesberg's views, ignores the evidence in favor of it, and MOST importantly ignores the FACT that Duesberg and Mullis are but TWO out of hundreds of dissident scientists. I think Duesberg is an idiot about certain things. That doesn't mean HIV causes AIDS. I think HIV hasn't even been properly isolated. Duesberg and I disagree. But Duesberg is right about AZT, it is murder to give that to people. So using an article in Science which doesn't even accurately present dissident views, and which ignores the fact that other dissidents explain things Duesberg doesn't, and that YOU are fooled by it and want to insert into the dissident page, is a comment on your ignorance and agenda. You never independetly verified that article, period. Period. Read through questionaids.com and virusmyth.net -- VERIFY or DISPROVE the claims YOURSELF. Stop having faith in the authorities...That's your original sin, faith in Jon Cohen, faith in authorities. It is why we're in this mess to begin with. Sgactorny 20:28, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Root-Bernstein's article in Genetica 95: 111-132, 1995</span></h2>
<p>He states:</p>
<p>A number of widely repeated and factually incorrect myths have pervaded the AIDS research literature, misdirecting research and treatment. Five of the most outstanding are:</p>
<ol>
<li>that all risk groups develop AIDS at the same rate following HIV infection;</li>
<li>that there are no true seroreversions following HIV infection;</li>
<li>that antibody is protective against HIV infection;</li>
<li>that the only way to treat AIDS effectively is through retroviral therapies; and</li>
<li>that since HIV is so highly correlated with AIDS incidence, it must be the sole necessary and sufficient cause of AIDS. A huge body of research, reviewed in this paper, demonstrates the falsity of these myths.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, this is a dissident stating what mainstream science is telling us, it seems to me that he is very much mistaken on a number of points</p>
<ol>
<li>Mainstream scientists know that different risk groups progress at different rates</li>
<li>There are a few cases of retroconversion known, but these correlate with defective viral strains, or false tests</li>
<li>We know that CTL's are important against HIV infection. However, antibodies against Tat have been proven to be correlated with slower disease progression.</li>
<li>It is not the only way, but one of the most effective. Life expectancy increases when you take these drugs.</li>
<li>HIV is the underlying cause of AIDS, and has fulfilled Koch's postulates fully</li>

<p>No, I don't actually just dismiss things-- that's what the orthodoxy does. We dissidents take pride in considering whatever you send us. So I read them and understand them. They're fine. I will be happy to read ANYTHING you present me that you think disproves dissident views. I have only asked you to read two articles start to finish -- which you refuse to do. The first article I gave you was written in 1998. And your quote comes from that, not the second one which you referenced. Good try though.</p>
<p>1) As AIDS cases dramatically decline in the U.S., which began in 1993 (4 years before the introduction of HAART, by the way), women make up an increasing percentage of AIDS cases. They make up a slightly increasing percentage of a shrinking pie. Big deal. True infectious epidemics do not discriminate based on sex like AIDS does. AND FURTHERMORE, the fact is that the definition of AIDS was changed in 1993. This resulted in dramatically increasing the likelihood that women would get diagnosed with AIDS. This was done because the orhthodox POV that AIDS should become a hetero epidemic in the U.S. NEVER occurred -- because AIDS is not infectious in the U.S -- it is a multifactorial event. And even after changing the definition of AIDS in 1993 to cause more women to get AIDS (for insurance purposes, by the way), AIDS STILL does not appear infectious, as Duesberg wrote in 1998. So your point is crap. I could actually add several more reasons here, but it is available in the dissident literature you simply REFUSE to read, even though you're so confident you know we're all whackos.</p>
<p>2) Same thing with #2. As AIDS cases continued to decline, and AIDS-causing AIDS meds were given to people from the general poulation, so too did AIDS cases begin to appear in heterosexual drug consumers, either recreational or pharmaceutical, AIDS-causing drugs. Overall, AIDS cases declined starting in 1993. The homosexual community, of which I am a part, cleaned up its act BIG TIME in the 80s and into the 90s (with the end of the batthhouse culture and LESS drugs and FAR less STD rates in our community). It follows that AIDS cases would naturally decline many years later, regardless of HIV or AIDS meds playing a role. And that is exactly what happened. There are more explanations, but all you have to do is read dissident literature with an open, but skeptical mind, and you'll find them. I can't write textbooks here.</p>
<p>3) No idea what point you think you are making about Injection drug use. But I will say that one reason AIDS cases have declined in populations such as Injection drug users (it isn't intravenous, by the way, its injection), is because treatment for OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS among those with destroyed immune systems has dramatically improved over the past 20 years. This is the ONE triumph of the orthodoxy. Their HIV hypothesis is absurd, if you bother to learn about it. Their AIDS meds cause AIDS. HIV tests don't measure HIV and may not measure antibodies to HIV. BUT the individual OI treatments are, as a whole, very helpful. Also, many more addicts have clean needles. This helps slows the transmission of ALL KINDS of microbes and dirty DNA, regardless of HIV.</p>
<p>4) AIDS in children has always been a rather tiny occurence in the U.S., the vast majority (over 80%) occurring in children of drug-addicted parents. Thus, they have plenty of reason to have destroyed immune systems without HIV. Second, pregnancy causes false positive HIV results. Third, what occurred when AIDS increased in children is that children were given toxic AIDS drugs as they were experimented on (most of them were poor and black). This caused AIDS in children to increase temporarily in the U.S. As dissidents screamed nazi experimentation, very quietly many of the treatment recommendations were reversed, and reports appeared in the medical literature throughout the world that giving kids AIDS meds was disastrous. Other than that, I don't see what difference it makes, the whole sentence, in terms of HIV causing AIDS. But hey, if you think this proves HIV causes AIDS, then you'll believe anything.</p>
<p>5) Many of the 57 cases have been examined in the medical literature by dissidents. They are not what they seem and offer NO EVIDENCE HIV causes AIDS. You are simply making an assertion here, and hoping everyone will believe you. You didn't verify it yourself. I, however, have personally read many of the accounts. Factors such as the person's own drug use, AIDS meds use, etc., perfectly explain occassional sickness among healthcare workers with one of the 29 OLD ILLNESSES now called AIDS. THE FACT OF THE MATTER is that if HIV caused AIDS, THOUSANDS of health care workers would have gotten AIDS over the last 20 years, not 57!!!!!!! or even 150!!!! Did you know that for the last 20 years about 1,000 healthcare workers have gotten HEPATITIS from accidental needlestick injuries EACH YEAR???????? If HIV causes AIDS, where is the similar or even WORSE epidemic all over the world among healthcare workers or PROSTITUTES? Nrets, you have not researched anything. You are just spewing what you read, never bothering to question it, and with complete faith in the establishment literature. I, however, have ZERO faith in what I read. I CONFIRM IT. Gosh, I'd like to see your score on the LSAT. That would give me a good laugh.</p>
<p>Taken together, even if all that you wrote had NO explanations, none of it is evidence HIV causes AIDS or that AIDS is infectious. I have no idea what point you thought you were making. And I suspect you don't either. Now the reason I bothered to write this stuff is that I suspect you will go on mischaracterizing the articles I asked you to read, and delude yourself into thinking you are rebutting them. I won't sit here and respond point by point. But I did respond to these to show OTHER readers that the things you say have explanations and even if they didn't, are irrelevant to the points of those science articles. I have no doubt that further quotes from you will be distortions and misunderstandings, because you clearly are not interested in actually learning about another POV than your own. You only interested in one thing, promoting the orthodox POV, even though you admit you don't know much (or ANYTHING) about what AIDS dissidents actually believe.

<li>The point I'm making is that one of your articles that you claim represent your point of view starts with flawed/outdated data and uses it to build its case. You can explain away anything you want, but I can give you far more plausible explanations that this data does not support your hypothesis. I now see that it is pointless to argue with you. Good luck in your endeavors and your campaign of misinformation. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 22:33, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The epidemiology is slightly outdated data because it was written in 1997!!!! Duh. But so what? None of the new data are evidence HIV causes AIDS -- etiology. You made no point at all. If you think you made an important point, or that anything you said proves HIV causes AIDS, you are living in Wonderland! Sgactorny 22:35, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not saying that these data show HIV causes AIDS, I'm saying that the data supporting one of the main arguments against HIV not causing AIDS is no longer valid, therefore that argument is no longer valid. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 01:48, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>NONE of what you wrote was a "main argument" HIV doesn't cause AIDS. You know nothing about the main arguments since you have a closed mind about science and won't read dissident literature. Collaborate with people who won't read the dissident literature before editing the dissident page??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? INSANITY. Period. Sgactorny 03:07, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>How do people collaborate in the face of continued insults ("your point is crap", "HIV hypothesis is absurd", "spewing what you read", "your score on the LSAT [...] would give me a good laugh", "no idea what point you thought you were making [and] you don't either", "mischaracterizing", "delude yourself", "quotes from you will be distortions and misunderstandings", and "you clearly are not interested in actually learning", "you are living in Wonderland"). Sgactorny says it will take at least a few weeks to complete the proposed replacement content. In the meantime, this article is locked and I'm at a loss on how to move this article forward. Has anyone reading this has seen similar disputes? <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodasmith_14c0.html" title="User:Rodasmith">The Rod</a> 22:56, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sadly Rod, I don't think collaboration in this article will ever be possible with this editor. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 01:48, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
