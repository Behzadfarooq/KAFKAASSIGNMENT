	    <p>Removed POV category "pseudoscientists". Even if you believe AIDS dissent is "pseudoscience" (although arguably the mainstream AIDS myths are textbooks examples of such), the AIDS dissidents themselves (well-known for their contributions to other areas of science, including previous to AIDS itself) are not collectively "pseudoscientists". They are established scientists with reputable records of contribution. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 19:24, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, it's more accurate to say it's a <i>disputed</i> science. Given 2,000 scientists and doctors who disagree, and given the manifest shortcomings of the HIV theory, "pseudoscience" is a bit POV. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 19:38, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"Pseudoscients" are those who do not adhere to the scientific method. I know of few orthodox believers who actually believe dissidents don't believe in the scientific method; even if they disagree with their conclusions. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 19:40, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>AIDS dissent is only "pseudoscience" to the extent that it does not agree with current consensus. This is not the same thing as pseudoscience, as I said, it's more accurately <i>disputed</i> science.</dd>

<p>So, "Duncharris", are you calling 2 Nobel Prize Winners in Chemistry, several hundreds professors of biology and chemistry, math, and engineering, and hundreds of doctors all "pseudoscientists"?? <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 19:41, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just to clarify for future posterity, these are the individuals who are being *ACCUSED* of being "pseudoscientists", by idiot savant minds who could never approach their accomplishments and thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peter Duesberg -- author of 300+ articles on cancer/AIDS, fully peer-reviewed, first scientists to genetically map the structure of retroviruses, youngest scientists ever elected to the National Academy of Sciences, recently developed work on aneuploidy theory of cancer (acknoweldged by many as a breakthrough in cancer research)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Harvey Bialy -- received one of the first Ph.D.'s in molecular biology, author of numerous articles in genetics, molecular and cell biology, founding editor of Bio/Technology Nature magazine</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Serge Lang -- one of the most prodigious and influential mathematicians of the century, author of dozens of influential textbooks, hundreds of papers, made fundamental contributions to number theory, complex analysis and algebraic geometry, occasional member of Bourbaki, member of the National Academy of Sciences</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Kary Mullis -- inventor of PCR, winner of 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>David Rasnick -- developer of protease inhibitors, colleague of Duesberg's who has helped him develop aneuploidy theory of cancer</li>
</ul>
<p>Some group of "pseudoscientists" you're labelling there.

<p>I demonstrate why 9 of the 11 persons included in this category cannot be called "pseudoscientists:" The unattributed quotes are from the above justification by an anonymous Wikipedian (64.185.56.165):</p>
<p>Harvey Bialy -- "received one of the first Ph.D.'s in molecular biology, author of numerous articles in genetics, molecular and cell biology, founding editor of Bio/Technology Nature magazine." Significant mainstream scientific career outside of AIDS dissent, thus not a pseduoscientist.</p>
<p>Hiram Caton -- Fellow of the Australian Institute of Biology, so he has a significant mainstream scientific career outside of AIDS dissent, thus not a pseduoscientist</p>
<p>Peter Duesberg -- "author of 300+ articles on cancer/AIDS, fully peer-reviewed, first scientists to genetically map the structure of retroviruses, youngest scientists ever elected to the National Academy of Sciences, recently developed work on aneuploidy theory of cancer (acknoweldged by many as a breakthrough in cancer research)." Significant mainstream scientific career outside of AIDS dissent, thus not a pseduoscientist.</p>
<p>Celia Farber -- Journalist, not a scientist, thus pseduoscientist classification does not make sense as she has not claimed to do original research.</p>
<p>Serge Lang -- "one of the most prodigious and influential mathematicians of the century, author of dozens of influential textbooks, hundreds of papers, made fundamental contributions to number theory, complex analysis and algebraic geometry, occasional member of Bourbaki, member of the National Academy of Sciences." Mathematician, not a scientist, thus pseduoscientist classification does not make sense as she has not claimed to do original research on this subject.</p>
<p>Kary Mullis -- "inventor of PCR, winner of 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry." Significant mainstream scientific career outside of AIDS dissent, thus not a pseduoscientist.</p>
<p>Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos -- her Wikipedia article describes her as a "medical physicist based at Royal Perth Hospital in Australia." Significant mainstream scientific career outside of AIDS dissent, thus not a pseduoscientist.</p>
<p>David Rasnick -- "developer of protease inhibitors, colleague of Duesberg's who has helped him develop aneuploidy theory of cancer." Significant mainstream scientific career outside of AIDS dissent, thus not a pseduoscientist.</p>
<p>Matthias Rath -- much work unrelated to AIDS. Significant (though controversial) mainstream scientific career outside of AIDS dissent, thus not a pseduoscientist.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>As for the other two:</p>
<p>Phillip E. Johnson -- I can't argue against this guy being a pseudoscientist, but accoring to his WP article he is far more notable for his pseudoscientific work on "Intelligent Design" than he is for being an AIDS skeptic.</p>
<p>Jonathan Wells -- same as Johnson. I would argue that he is a pseudoscientist because of his anti-evolution views which seems to be his main thing.</p>
<p>Hence with so many of the members of this category not belonging in the "pseudoscientists" category, I feel the best thing to do is to remove the category tag and either directly insert Drs. Johnson and Wells in it, or include them in anti-evolution categories that are members of the pseudoscientists category (both of them are very indirectly a part of pseudoscients through an evolution related link currently). --Sonic5view 15:06, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>"Aids dissent" is seen as pseudoscience, so it seems logical to me that this category should either be a subcat of <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudoscience_c4dd.html" title="Category:Pseudoscience">Category:Pseudoscience</a> or <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudoscientists_9073.html" title="Category:Pseudoscientists">Category:Pseudoscientists</a>.

<dd>1) Please go through the history. The HIV/AIDS category was gone before I became aware of this page. I had no idea it was ever included, and I by no means object to it. I am not even sure when this was ever part of the page.</dd>
<dd>2) Pseudosciense is "a term applied to a body of alleged knowledge, methodology, belief, or practice that is portrayed as scientific but diverges substantially from the required standards for scientific work or is unsupported by sufficient scientific research," according to its WP page. Since when is simple disagreement or skepticism pseudosciense? Asserting "God caused AIDS because He's miffed" would be obvious pseudoscience, but AIDS dissent clearly refers to any kind of skepticism or questioning of the prevailing hypothesis -- that is not "pseudoscience," but part of the scientific method. --Sonic5view 15:42, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My point is that (a) <i>this</i> isn't the place to debate whether AIDS dissent is pseudoscience or not, and (b) anecdotes don't prove anything. Stating the credentials of the people listed does not address the question of what they are doing - lots of people have started on solid ground and then wandered off the deep end (even the great Pauling did with Vitamin C). This isn't the place to debate the parent cat. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 16:04, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So essentially you are saying that even though all of the debate about the appropriateness or relevance of the category is on this page, and the code for the inclusion is on this page, the proper place to debate this is on the parent category's page? That certainly is not clear to me. The AIDS reappraisal page is part the category "psedoscience," so that seems a place for a different fight. Don't bite the newcomers. Also, even though Pauling had wandered "off the deep end," the label of "pseudoscientist" is inappropriate and cheap. --Sonic5view 16:18, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not expressing an opinion on whether Pauling on Vitamin C qualified as pseudoscience or not - I am saying that one cannot simply trust people, based on <i>who they are</i>, which appears to be your strategy. It isn't "inappropriate" or "cheap" to label pseudoscience as pseudoscience - there's a valid definition of what constitutes <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> (see the article and its talk page).</dd>
<dd>And yes, discussing the appropriateness of the category belongs at the parent article, not here. If AIDS denial is pseudoscience, then the category here should be here. If AIDS denial is not pseudoscience, then the category does not belong here. However, if AIDS denial is pseudoscience, then it's wrong to remove the category here. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 17:11, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have reverted the addition of the Pseudoscience category because it is not clear that <i>all</i> AIDS dissidents belong in this category. Certainly some of them do, but others are simply skeptics that are not putting forward their own theories, and so cannot rightfully be described as practicing <i>pseudoscience</i> (perhaps <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathological_skepticism.html" title="Pathological skepticism">Pathological skepticism</a> would be more appropriate). Please do not add the category back without discussing it here, since this is clearly a complex issue. --<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 05:20, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. This was a sub cat of the Pseudoscientists category (now CFD'd) for quite some time. I've re-added it. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 05:26, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Pseudoscientists category was CFD'd because a category – allowing for no annotation – isn't appropriate for this type of use. There is much <i>legitimate</i> debate as to whether all AIDS dissidents should be seen as doing pseudoscience, and so it's POV to apply the label. Pseudoscience doesn't simply mean "incorrect" – it has a more nuanced technical meaning that simply doesn't apply to the position of many AIDS dissidents. If you believe that AIDS skeptics (who fall under the category of AIDS dissidents) are practicing pseudoscience, please justify your claim in detail here. Until then, please do not add the category back. --<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 05:32, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, now I see; it was you who CFD'd the Pseudoscientists category to begin with. First you get, Pseudoscientists, a useful and informative category deleted. Now you're back here at this sub cat, and only this sub cat, objecting to it being included in the meta cat. What's next, CFD the Pseudoscience category? This strikes me as a bit like a campaign... So, considering that, no, inclusion of this sub cat in the Pseudoscience cat is justified for the same reasons and stated above. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 05:33, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, your criteria for keeping a cat, annotation, is flawed and baseless. Also, read <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_FAQ_00b9.html#Pseudoscience" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/FAQ#Pseudoscience</a>.

<dd>That's not my "criterea for keeping a cat", it's the reason that inherently pejorative labels shouldn't be categories. There is no way to explain – or annotate – the application of a category; something is either in a category, or not. In cases where there is an overwhelming consensus that a particular <i>theory</i> is pseudoscience (such as, say, <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrenology.html" title="Phrenology">Phrenology</a>) it is probably acceptible to include it in the category without explanation or qualification. However, for controversial and disputed cases like <b>AIDS dissidents</b> – where some members of the community <i>do</i> put forth theories that are clearly pseudoscientific while others merely express skepticism or criticism of the prevailing view or methodology – it's not reasonable to apply a label without further explanation. A category does not provide any mechanism for such annotation or clarification.</dd>

<dd>Additionally, I'm not sure what makes you think you can veto the consensus reached on the CFD page for the pseudoscientists category. The pseudoscience category itself is arguably more useful, because placing article B in category A doesn't necessarily imply that B <i>is</i> and A – unless that's directly implied by the name of the category (as is the case with "pseudoscientists" but not with "pseudoscience" – although if the category were named "pseudosciences" then I might be inclined to nominate it for CFD as well). --<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 05:54, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>[ec]Oops - missed this - it wasn't "unexplained". My bad. But FM is right - the daughter cat was cfd'd, so it's appropriate to restore the parent cat - after all, there was nothing in the cfd which addressed the issue of pseudoscience. The category is a topic in pseudoscience even if the term cannot be applied to <i>each and every person therein</i>. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 05:36, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is getting tiring, and political agendas irritate me. If you want to argue that AIDS skepticism (a type of AIDS dissidence) <i>in the absence of any alternative theory</i> is a form of pseudoscience, then please justify your claim here. I'm talking specifically about the type of criticism put forward by <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kary_Mullis_c230.html" title="Kary Mullis">Kary Mullis</a> (who merely argues that current AIDS research is sloppy and jumps to too many conclusions, and that more methodical testing of the null hypothesis is needed) as opposed to (say) the <a href="../../../d/u/e/Duesberg_hypothesis.html" title="Duesberg hypothesis">Duesberg hypothesis</a> (which is arguably pseudoscience).</p>
<p>However, if you think that this category should be included as a subcategory of pseudoscience because they are often associated with each other – whether or not this association is merited – then I think some sort of disclaimer should appear on this page that explains why the category is included. As it stands now, it looks as if <i>all</i> AIDS dissidents are practicing pseudoscience, which is patently untrue. --<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 06:19, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Political agendas? If you have one and you find it tiring, please stop pushing it. That's really pretty simple. First you call it perjorative, now you call it inaccurate - you need to pick a consistent line of argument and stick with it. The category has stood for a long time - <i>you</i> need to justify your case for removal.</dd>
<dd>I don't know where you get the idea that inclusion of this category in cat:pseudoscience is an assertion that "<i>all</i> AIDS dissidents...practic[e] pseudoscience". <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Shermer_b2d1.html" title="Michael Shermer">Michael Shermer</a> is in cat:Pseudoscience as well - not as a practioner, but as a critic. AIDS dissent is pseudoscience, thus it and its advocates belong in this category. Simple enough. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 11:57, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have created a list at List of pseudoscientists and added <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_reappraisal_4ba3.html" title="AIDS reappraisal">AIDS dissidents</a> to it with some clarifications. --<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 17:32, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
