<dd><i>"Although the marriage to Fell was a stroke of luck, Wuornos was too destructive to understand when things were good for her. Wuornos treated Fell badly, getting into fights at the local bar and was sent to jail for assault."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think the above is particualar good nor NPOV wording. An encyclopdia shouldn't pass judgement on what is 'a stroke of luck' for someone (to me personally, for a 20 year old marrying a 69 year old typically doesn't sound like a stroke of luck but that's besides the point). Perhaps if she considered it a stroke of luck it could be changed to say just that. Otherwise (her reported lifestyle certainly doesn't support that Aileen Wuornos considered herself particularly lucky) I think the bit should be changed and just stick to the facts, that is that they married, she got jailed for assault and that the marriage was annulled soon thereafter --84.190.188.5 23:00, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "publicity" section at the end says Aileen had engaged an agent within weeks of her arrest to sell the rights to her story. This is WRONG. Her lover and members of the police sold their stories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This page gives only the briefest mention that she was a prostitute, and the specifics of how that played into the majority of her killings. Seems a bit remiss.</dd>

<p>Does anyone know whether Aileen was suspected of killing more than she was convicted for?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The opposite, in fact -- she confessed to more than she was convicted of. Naturally there were some unsolved cases that the police tried to pin on her as well, but she categorically denied involvement and there was no evidence either. -- <a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJpatokal_73ec.html" title="User:Jpatokal">Jpatokal</a> 15:12, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, to be more precise, she confessed to 7 murders, was convicted of 1, and pleaded no contest to 2 and guilty to 3; the seventh wasn't prosecuted because they still haven't found the body. However, yes, some investigators believe there may be two other victims. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 18:45, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How can Wuornos be categorized as a serial killer? Her motivations appear to have been traditional (need for money and transportation). Shouldn't she just be considered a thief and murderer?</p>
<dl>
<dd>While robbery was clearly part of her motive, there was psychiatric testimony that she was partly motivated by the desire to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial_killer.html#Power.2Fcontrol" title="Serial killer">control</a> her victims. In all other respects of the usual definition ("three or more murders over an extended period of time with cooling-off periods in between; in between their crimes they appear to be quite normal") she fits exactly. A history of child abuse is quite common in power/control serial killers, who often ritualise a related form of abuse on their victims before killing; this may well explain why some of Wuornos' victims who were extremely unlikely to be prostitution customers, were found naked. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 18:45, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I agree, it only mentions the victim who would have been most likely to have committed the crimes she accused all the men of, based on his past record. The article seems to focus on the tragedy of her life and the miscarage of justice (whether her story was believed or heard, whether the State of Florida should have executed an insane woman).</li>

<p>How can the men Aileen Wuornos killed be considered victims? They violently attacked her, and she killed them in self-defense. The only reason they've seen as victims is because women's lives are worthless to the US legal system, as women who act in self-defense are regularly sent to prison or labelled insane. If a man killed someone who was trying to rape him, there is no way he would be labelled insane and he would probably have the sympathy of the judge.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Except that you are extraordinarily naïve in your belief that the story that Wuornos told (which is the only basis for your assertion that she was "attacked" by anyone, or that any rapes were attempted) is true. Murderers tell the stories they think will result in the least punishment for them, and Wuornos did, too, though not terribly effectively. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 22:04, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It disgusts me that people call into question the validity of violence against women. At least Holocaust deniers are only denying history, whereas you are denying women being raped and killed constantly all around you. When their lives are so worthless, I guess their voices become worthless as well. I hope you never get raped and then have a court inflict further violence on you by calling you a lying whore.</dd>

<dd>By the way, Aileen ended up saying she killed the men in cold blood when she became suicidal after being left to rot for years on death row. But then she admitted in secret (as depicted in the film "Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer" that she really did act in self-defense. Where is her reason for lying then?</dd>

<dd>Doubting the word of a convicted murderer is not equivalent to "denying women being raped and killed constantly all around you". You seem to be unable or unwilling to notice the fact that just because something happens doesn't mean it has happened in every instance in which it is alleged. Aileen Wuornos is a completely undeserving candidate for poster-girl for violence against women.

<dd>I believe she <i>was</i> responsible for her crimes (as responsible as one be, considering her mental state); however, she was clearly very mentally ill. She suffered her entire life, and saying that "she was crazy as a fruit bat" is very tasteless, imo. Show some compassion. As for not being very bright; she ran away at 14 due to an abusive household and other traumas, so I'm assuming she never got a good chance at an education. --<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBat_c7e7.html" title="User:DrBat">DrBat</a> 00:15, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whereas I think "crazy as a fruit bat" is mostly unfair to the fruit bat.

<dd>Yeah, in Florida. "In some societies, she might have been given life in prison considering her circumstances, but she lives in Florida, so it's no real surprise that the jury has her executed. It's like a sport there."-MrCranky.</dd>
<dd>And they did a real good, foolproof job at her trial. <i>Wuornos cited self defense for Mallory's murder, maintaining that he had attempted to rape her. She was convicted for this first murder in January 1992 with help from Moore's testimony. In November of the same year, Dateline NBC reporter Michele Gillens uncovered that <b>Mallory had served 10 years for violent rape in another state</b>. Despite this, Wuornos was never given a re-trial.</i> But I'm sure its just a coincidence that the first person Wuornos said had tried raping her was an actual rapist, right? --<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBat_c7e7.html" title="User:DrBat">DrBat</a> 19:12, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unindenting a little. They did a good job: prior offenses don't impact on whether one has done the offense presently charged. That's why a prior record is generally inadmissible in court. Even if we spot Wuoros one murder, there were still six others for which she quite rightly paid a penalty. Her story that all seven of the men she murdered were trying to rape her is, quite simply, ridiculous. It's like the killer in <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_%28musical%29.html" title="Chicago (musical)">Chicago</a></i> whose excuse for stabbing her husband to death was "He ran into my knife. He ran into my knife ten times."

<p>First of all, she killed several people. That's a bad thing to do no matter what the circumstances. The fun part about self-defense is that it has to be somewhat reasonable. That she managed to get into circumstances in which killing the sod is the only way to defend herself seven times (or how often was it exactly?) is a bit unlikely. Maybe she was just incredibly unlucky, but <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a> suggests there's a considerable probability she might have not been speaking the truth.</p>
<p>Now, I know some feminists think that everything <i>the man</i> does is just trying to put women down, but not every person who seeks sex with prostitutes is a rapist or psychokiller, just as not every prostitute ends up on death row (and I'm saying this in a country in which prostitution is a legal business and the death penalty is unheard of). Even though I do think the United States might have a tendency to produce an awful lot of fucked up nutcases (some of whom may or may not run for governmental offices), I wouldn't consider the self-defense scenario any further, because apparently those people who do law stuff for a living didn't deem it trustworthy either.</p>
<p>The reason the lack of re-trial was considered a bit disturbing was not that she may have actually been acting in self-defense but that she may have been mentally unstable and thus not sane enough to be capable of committing a crime in the technical sense (or at least not capable of being tried for it, when she was tried) -- not like killing people should ever be considered much of an indicator of sanity anyway.</p>
<p>Yes, she did have a fucked up childhood, but that's pretty much a non-issue if she's considered sane enough to be able to be aware of her actions. If she wasn't technically sane enough and the trial was, thus, a farce, that's a shame and I mean it, but as she happens to be dead now, there's no way to find that out retroactively and no point in wasting any time on speculations. Dead people have the tendency to stay dead no matter how long you contemplate whether or not they should have been put to death in the first place.</p>
<p>Secondly, I really like the film. Charlize Theron is playing a pretty credible character (although, especially in some of the first scenes, it's obvious she's having problems with the make-up -- especially the false teeth) and Christina Ricci is always kinda cute, even if the person she's based on happens not to look anything like her (but I guess a lesbian romance between a lunatic and Christina Ricci sells better than a lesbian romance between a lunatic and a butch). The film is pretty emotional and makes you really feel sorry for the fate of the poor woman and the fucked up life that she must have had -- but that's the movie and not an accurate description of real events. Even if it were, the murder of the guy who seems to be the only good human (with the whole "love thy neighbour" shite every real-life fundie seems to forget about) in the whole movie and the murder of the cop who really didn't do anything appaling and the murder of the guy she only killed because he had questionable erotic fantasies (arguably pedophile but by no indication an actual child molester or bad person) and, oh, pretty much every other murder after the first one, all this didn't exactly make her look like a saint either, even though crimes and misdeeds committed by the "good guy" always tend to feel less wrong in films than in real life.</p>
<p>That said, I'm by no means a chauvenist, conservative or any other long c-word I can think of right now. I don't have a problem with lesbians OR gays (or homosexuals, or bisexuals, or transexuals, or heterosexuals, heck, I just don't care what you have under your shirt, skirt or panties, or whom you screw -- as long as you do it with mutual consent) and I don't even find lesbianism particularily sexy or gay-...ism particularily nasty. I don't think the death penalty is a particularily good concept (but maybe it's just its application that sucks so bad) and I do believe she might have come off a lot better in a legal system giving her a more considerate benefit of doubt.</p>
<p>The whole mess is pretty sad, but life just happens to be incredibly unfair and cruel, even though the occassional high points and nude scenes help selling it. She was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of several men (and please spare me any demonisation of prostitution and what it does to women -- that would carry this whole discussion REALLY off topic) who may or may not have (intended to or have actually) had sex with her and/or tried to rape and/or attack her, that's pretty much the accepted reality. The exact specifics about her mental state are disputed, but she was never re-tried. That's also accepted reality. In other words, the whole thing smells a bit fishy, but not any more than your average US trial.</p>
<p>There's not an awful lot anyone can do to fix this mess up retroactively, so the energy of all the feminists and other nutjobs (note that I'm talking about feminists in the "women (should) rule, men suck" sense, not normal egalitarians) would be better spent on preventing future cases like this by doing something useful, like, I don't know, try to fix the US legal system or something. Maybe try to legalise prostitution so prostitutes who become rape victims can actually go to the police -- or try to find the root cause of this kind of problems rather than fighting the consequences and symptoms.

<dd>You seem to misunderstand the purpose of the article, which is not to convey how <b>I</b> feel, and not to convey how <b>you</b> feel, but to portray how people on all sides of the issue feel, and to convey facts. You began the "reform" of the intro by adding that she was executed "despite protests" which requires the addition of the opposing views. You were not content with the removal of the "despite protests" clause, so they were added. You have repeatedly removed attributed, referenced opinions because you disagree with them (not because you disagree with their placement in the article, for you removed them rather than moved them!), and this is inappropriate. In fact, Wuornos's execution was notable because there was so little protest, probably because she was such an obnoxious human who alienated those who might otherwise have been sympathetic. The real Wuornos was unsympathetic: sympathy seems to have been engendered primarily by the fictional "movie" Wuornos. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 01:27, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As for bias; you've referred to Aileen as 'evil', 'obnoxious' and 'crazy as a fruit bat.' You mean to tell me that isn't bias? And the fact that you're trying to make it look like she wasn't mentally ill, when you stated she was 'crazy as a fruitbat', just reeks of hypocrisy.

<dd>I do not understand how people can state as fact that she was "mentally ill", when a team of psychologists examined her and fond her competent. While they are state appointed for the purpose, the fact that there are three who attested to her sanity is compelling enough that one cannot state unequivocally she is crazy. She may be wicked and crazy, or just crazy, or just wicked. But please do not state as fact that she is crazy as if everybody agrees.
<dl>
<dd>Oh please; they interviewed her for only fifteen minutes so they could say she was fit and go on and execute her. She believed her mind was being controlled by radio waves and that she would be taken away by angels on a space ship.

<dd>Your 15 minute interview was more like 30 minutes, which is more than enough time to determine what they had to determine: that she knew that she'd die when executed, and that she understood what crimes she is being executed for.

<dd>The link I posted wasn't the interview Bush's people gave her, it was the interview Broomfield gave her; Bush's people interviewed her for 15 minutes and judged her to be mentally fit, despite the fact that she was clearly delusional.

<dd>I watched the video Dr.Bat provided, but it does not attest to her mental state when she committed the crimes, it only addresses her state several years later. I once again disagree with your view, and state that not everybody thinks she was unfit to stand trial or receive the punishment she received. I do believe she had a childhood detrimental to a helathy view of the world, and that her ability to live what we might generally view a normal and helathy life would be difficult. I also think she chose a wicked lifestyle, and could not reconcile that with what she knew intrinsically to be true principles of healthy living. The fact that she seemed concerned about "getting right with God" implies that she knew what a right path would be, but she had not taken that path. Her mental difficulties result from that, and therefore would have been resolved could she have resolved that issue. --Howardd21
<dl>
<dd>She chose a "wicked lifestyle"? What are you trying to get at? What lifestyle?</dd>
<dd>And why is it so hard to accept the fact that she was mentally ill, considering the hellish life she had? Just because some people with horrible lives managed to overcome them doesn't mean it's unusual for someone to snap after enduring a lifetime of suffering and abuse. At one point in her life (before she became a killer), she attempted to kill herself by shooting herself in the stomach. --<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBat_c7e7.html" title="User:DrBat">DrBat</a> 17:59, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes - she chose her lifestyle - one of self love and lack of care for others. At the expense of oversimplifying, her adult life measured in the whole is a testimony to seeking her own gratification. I have no doubt that the seeds of this were sewn in her childhood and poor examples from everybody around her; but that does not negate the fact that this is the way she acted, and that she on many occasions acknowledged the wrongness of it. She knew right from wrong, and she had chosen wrong. That is a wicked lifestyle that no lasting society can stand with. Let me also state that the “johns” are equally seeking self-gratification at the expense of anybody who may rely upon them (e.g. family), and the prostitutes they consort with. In other words, people thinking of self is a wicked, wrong, unloving approach to life. Her actions describe externally the extent she had gone to internally with that. If you do not believe that people are to be held responsible in love that is your choice; but that is not a sustainable architecture for a culture. --Howardd21
<dl>
<dd>Umm... it was the other way around; no one loved her. And she did love her girlfriend, but I'd guess you'd consider that to be a 'wicked lifestyle' as well. In fact, she confessed to her crimes in the first place so her girlfriend wouldn't get in trouble for what she did (though unbeknownst to her, her girlfriend was secretly working with the cops against her). --<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBat_c7e7.html" title="User:DrBat">DrBat</a> 18:59, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I acknowledge(d) that she received very little love and concern from others, especially in her important formative years. But her love for her girlfriend was also a manifestation of self love – she did things for her girl friend so she would not leave her, emotionally or physically. When Aileen chose to kill a john for the “love” of Tyria Moore who was using Aileen, is nothing more than an attempt to maintain control and use of Tyria. Had she been more caring for everybody around her, and less caring of herself, would she have killed as she did? I think we agree that Aileen received little love, and I would hope we agreed she showed little. I am simply expressing the thought that it was her choice to do so, as a fulfillment of love for self rather than others. That is a wicked lifestyle, and no culture can be sustainable that does not demand that it cease. As we can clearly see, it propagates from generation to generation, and person to person when unchecked by the twin pillars of love and discipline.--Howardd21
<dl>
<dd>Gee, I'm glad everyone here sees the world in black and white.</dd>
<dd>Aileen confessed to her crimes so Tyria wouldn't get in trouble for what she did. I'm sure her love for Tyria was more deeper than you make it out to be.</dd>
<dd>And seeing as how Aileen tried killing herself once, I'm sure she had more self-loathing than self-love. --<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBat_c7e7.html" title="User:DrBat">DrBat</a> 19:34, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would view suicide is really the ultimate self love – it is saying “the world is not treating me the way I deserve to be treated, so it will not be blessed with my presence”. Only a person who truly loves themselves would be able to do that, regardless of the impact to others. --Howardd21

<dl>
<dd>I am not ignoring her confession – I am consistent with my stance that it is still an act meant to save the relationship she valued – not the person on the other side of the relationship. Simply put: she confessed to save the relationship not the girlfriend. If she valued the person on the other side of the relationship she would seek for her a better way of life; one of self-capability rather than dependence upon Aileen. What she fostered was a dependence; not a better person. Why would she be any different in her confession? It is consistent with her life to that point. Please do not ignore my point below that it is not a universal stance that she was mentally incompetent and that the victims names should be listed. --Howardd21

<p>Now we need to discuss why DrBat feels that "despite protests that she was not fit to be executed due to her mental illness," is appropriate in the introduction. It suggests that said (unreferenced) protests should have been determinative, and so gives only one side of a question that is disputed. I'll wait for [1] a citation as to what "protests" took place, and [2] justification for presenting only one (unattributed and uncited) opinion in the introduction before proceding to its removal. But as NPOV is not negociable, either it must go or all views must be represented: we cannot privilege one view by presenting it prominently as unopposed. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 02:42, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

In one case, the main page on the site states a death row inmate was ‘exonerated’ because he received a new trial. That is not exoneration in a legal or language sense, it is a new trial and the possibility of exoneration exists, bit has not happened. This site would appear to not be reliable (<a href="http://www.oranous.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.oranous.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oranous.com/</a>). I suppose if these sites are cited, then Rush Limbaugh’s site is also valid.

<p>"In her final interview before her execution... When she discovered the camera was still on, she became hysterical and was led away." The events this paragraph refers to actually take place over two different interviews. I also think the paragraph distorts the reason for her rage in the latter interview. In the film's penultimate interview, where Broomfield secretly records her "confession" from behind the glass, she's all smiles at the end (I think this is the one where she says "I love you Nick" as she leaves). The hysterical outburst is in the next interview, her final one. She describes herself as a "rape victim", he implies that she has contradicted herself and asks her what really happened, she sees her fasttrack execution under threat, and raves about press manipulation. There's no indication that she ever knows about his betrayal in the previous interview. I wanted to check that I wasn't alone in interpreting it like this before I made any changes. --80.189.250.66 09:23, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
i dont know what your name is who has writen above me but you are correct about the interviews because she was only angry in the last interview with nick broom field because, like you said, she felt that her execution might be affected if she changed her story. when you look at the reason she wanted execution, its really quite sad because after all she had been through in her life, all she wanted to do in the end was die, it was her way of commiting suicide i guess. she was betreyed by everyone that was close to her and her only real friend was Dawn Botkins who was with Aileen when she had her last meal. she was never going to get out of prison and she knew it and she didn't want to spend the rest of her life in a 6 by 8 cell with nothing but her thoughts and 12 years of that had already taken its toll on her mind and if i was her i would have done the same thing. i find her life so interesting and im always feeling sorry for what she had to go through because everyday was a long grinde to survive. she was a stronger person than i would ever be.</p>

<p>I just fixed some minor spelling errors on this article. I would like to copyedit some of the run-on sentences in this article for clarity without changing the meaning in any way.

I would also like to see an external link to the Opera Wuornos <a href="http://www.wuornos.org" class="external free" title="http://www.wuornos.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.wuornos.org</a> and something about the opera in the music section. I don't think I should be the one to add anything about the opera, though, because I consulted on their program insert/links page. The opera was awesome, so I'm biased. Carla Lucero, the composer and librettist, didn't take a position on Aileen's guilt or innocence by the way.

Furthermore I have gone through and removed the unnecessary links in accordance with <a href="../../../o/n/l/Wikipedia%7EOnly_make_links_that_are_relevant_to_the_context_c7de.html" title="Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context">Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context</a>. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenLouise_6ad3.html" title="User:JenLouise">JenLouise</a> 07:52, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've replaced the inappropriate tone banner, as someone else had removed it. Until this article gets a really thorough scrubbing, and lines like <i>Wuornos was too destructive to know when things were good for her</i> are fixed, the tag should stay.</p>

   Fixed the paragraph about her insanity examination.  The entire artice does need a good scrubbing, I started with what jumped out at me first.  Tag should stay, as stated above.  Anacita 07:23, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>It is my opinion that this legal system is totally corrput. Recently the Andrea Yates case has been closed and she was found not guilty by pleading insanity. Aileen Wuornos was proven to be totally sane and she was given the death sentence several times. Now what does this say about our legal system if we are executing the sane and releasing the insane? I personally think that she should have been offered counseling while serving time in prison. I do not think she should have been given the death sentence. As I do believe in eye for an eye I just think this case was totally wrongful. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.104.25.150 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.104.25.150_1536.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.104.25.150">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Andrea Yates was not "released", she was committed to a state mental facility. Being committed in such a manner may mean that an individual never lives outside of the hospital again. You might want to make sure you actually know what you're ranting about in the future.-kel123 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.57.175.173 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.57.175.173_a1cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.57.175.173">contribs</a>).</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>Even so, Andrea Yates killed her own children, Aileen Wuornos murdered 7 men in her words of self defense. Aileen being proven sane at the time of the murders she would still have a slight possible reason for commiting those crimes seeing as she was a hooker. Now, What slight possible reason would a woman like Andrea Yates have for murdering her children?? And what about the new girl they have on trial Deanna Laney for bludgeoning her children to death leaving one serverley injured for life, She was found sane right off the bat, What was her excuse for doing what she did? I think the legal system has it's views on sane and insane messed up, They look at the person and examine what's on the outside such as body language. When where the true sanity or insanity lies within the chemicals in the brain. This is why they will sometimes take the brain of serial killers after death to prove these theories. Such as they did with Jesse Pomeroy and John Wayne Gacy. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tsam89 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tsam89_7e26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tsam89">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I rewrote the references using predefined templates and fixed some minor markup stuff here and there. However, I did not verify the content of all referenced articles. I also removed the following links from the article: <a href="http://www.ccadp.org/aileenwuornos-news2002.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccadp.org/aileenwuornos-news2002.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/oct2002/exec-o11.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/oct2002/exec-o11.shtml" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://www.prisonactivist.org/pubs/crossroad/6.3/wuornos.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prisonactivist.org/pubs/crossroad/6.3/wuornos.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.movienet.com/aileen.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.movienet.com/aileen.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, they were placed at the bottom of "Execution and last words" section.
