<hr />
<p>Children are repeatedly being denied their basic human rights, to live a life free from abuse and neglect, by the very organisation that is supposed to protect them.</p>
<p>The organisation to which I refer is -Social Services "Child Protection" - (I use that term very loosely).</p>
<p>I would not have beleived this level of ignorance corruption and abuse of position existed, but I have had first hand experience of this disgracefully inadequate organisations inability and refusal to protect children , further, what seems like deliberate attempts to protect themsleves, even if it means sacraficing the child at risk, I can confirm that all the bad press Social Workers moan about is well deserved, in fact I will go as far to say, the appalingly poor reputation earned by Social Services is understated, this organisation is far more corrupt than any of us can begin to imagine.</p>
<p>My grandaughter is a current "victim" of their corrupt and biased approach to their job. I have been dealing with Social Services Departments in Dundee and Angus since my grandaughter was abandonded just over 2 years ago by her mother who is a Heroine Addict- (the baby's father had died of a drug overdose) - my grandaughter was nine months of age and homeless at the time. We had cared for this child ever since unitl very recently.</p>
<p>The mother (still an addict) made no attempt to have contact with the child for almost two years.</p>
<p>After numerous attempts to extort money from us in exchange for the child - the birth mother realised that we were not the soft touch she first thought we were. When we continued to refuse to "buy" the baby, she sought legal advice for the return of the child. We were so used to receiving these threats we were not at this time very concerned, each time we called her bluff and each time she "went away", but what was different about the last threat we received was that she had said she had had an "offer" from another party for the baby and if we did not "cough up" she would accept the offer.</p>
<p>She involved a solicitor, who demanded the return of the baby.</p>
<p>When It became clear we had no rights to keep the child with us and therefore safe, I called every professional supposedly involved with the protection of children, I called The baby's Health visitor- Social Services and The childrens Reporter - No-One listened.</p>
<p>No-one from within this system, with the power to protect this child stepped up.</p>
<p>She now lives with the Birth mother who has threatened on a number of occassions to "sell" the child - she abandoned her - neglected her - pumped the baby full of heroine throughout the whole term of her pregnancy then carried on the habit long after the baby's birth! (She is an addict to this day)</p>
<p>Perhaps I am being niave - but I ask myself time and time again-What kind of world is this&#160;? Who would, with all concience do nothing, when a child is at risk from abuse neglect and death? This child has options she has us!!</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is - She had No Voice and therefore No choice.</p>
<p>Social Services have not thanked us for saving this child from a situation of risk when they failed to protect her - even given that the child, at the time of her abandonmennt was on The "At Risk" register. No they have not thanked us - but they are now attempting to discredit us. They have twisted everything we have said, they have engaged in false reporting and blatant lie telling, obviously comfortable in the beleif that they will never be challenged or brought to account.</p>
<p>Since it was I who lodged reports to Social Services, about the threats to this childs safety and wellbeing, I know beyond all doubt, they are aware of this child's plight. However since I have been outspoken regarding their failure to protect this child in the past, they are now closing ranks and being deliberate Champions of the abusive and neglectful birth mother. Meanwhile they seem to forget that there is a child's life at risk.</p>
<p>It would seem that neither Social Services or our government have learned anything at all, from their past catalogue of mistakes and neglect of our children which have ultimately led to 1000's of child deaths?</p>
<p>The Law surrounding the Protction of Children is greatly flawed and only serves the interests of Adults- there is nothing that Social Services or the Courts offer by way of protection for our Children. The child protection act merely pays lip service to child protection - I have reminded Social Service in every letter of their act and quoted " Children's Protection is everyones responsibility"- it should read, "we hold everyone but oursleves accountable for childrens safety"!!</p>
<p>I intend to have the laws changed, and will Campaign to have the current corrupt and inadequate Social Services Disbanded, if it takes me to my dying breathe!</p>
<p>Those wishing to become involved can visit our site (currently under construction) www.novoicenochoice.co.uk - Because we are a free service our site is fairly basic, we would welcome donations of services from web builders, marketing companies, printers etc... in fact anyone who can help us raise our profile.Solicitors and phsycologists too please. We wil be travelling the country delivering our story to various groups who have an interest in the safety of children.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention- this baby's adoptive grandfathe, who refused to help this child in any way, is a Senior Manager within the "Child Protection" department currently dealing with her case!!!</p>
<p>Any doubts about my experience of Social Services false reporting and lies? Speak to the charity Grandparents Apart, you will hear endless accounts of the same corrupt behaviour by Social Workers.</p>
