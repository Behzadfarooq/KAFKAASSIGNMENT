<p>American Institute of Business was founded in 1921 by Everett O. Fenton and Ray Hansen. The institution was first located at the Victoria Hotel on Sixth Avenue in Des Moines. In 1935, AIB moved to Tenth Street and Grand Avenue, the heart of the downtown business district. It educated students at that location for 37 years. In 1941, the college was reorganized as a nonprofit. In 1957, Keith Fenton becomes AIB's second president. In 1986, AIB became accredited with the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Institutions of Higher Education. In 1998, Keith Fenton retired as president of AIB after 42 years of service. The Administration Building was renamed the Keith Fenton Administration Building. In 1999, Nancy Williams was elected president of AIB after 16 years with the College. In 2000, the college changed its name from American Institute of Business to AIB College of Business to better reflect its mission and purpose.</p>
