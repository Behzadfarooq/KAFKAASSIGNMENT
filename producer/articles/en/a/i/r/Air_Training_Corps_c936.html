<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Adrian_Chamier_d009.html" title="John Adrian Chamier">Air Commodore J A Chamier</a> is affectionately known as the father of the air cadet movement<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. He was the son of a <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major-General_fd05.html" title="Major-General">Major-General</a> and joined the army himself as a regular officer. In the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">Army</a> he learnt to fly and was loaned to the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Flying_Corps_45d7.html" title="Royal Flying Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (the forerunner of the Royal Air Force) during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>.</p>
<p>He transferred to the Royal Air Force in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> and eventually retired from service in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>. His love of aviation and his tremendous capacity for hard work was such that, following his retirement, he became the Secretary-General of the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_League_659b.html" title="Air League">Air League</a><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> - an organisation made up of people who could see a bright future for aviation and who wanted to make the British public aware of its potential.</p>
<p>Against a background of rising interest in aviation and with the clouds of war beginning to form over Europe, Air Commodore Chamier thought of the idea of starting an aviation cadet corps. He knew that in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">1914-1918 war</a>, in desperate moments, hand picked young men with only a few hours of training were sent to do combat in the air - only to fall victim to well trained enemy aviators. He knew also that the winning of air power would need the services of many highly skilled and highly trained men using the best equipment and that the sooner such training could be started the better<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> Air Commodore Chamier came up with a plan to form an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Defence_Cadet_Corps_b28e.html" title="Air Defence Cadet Corps">Air Defence Cadet Corps</a> (ADCC). His idea was to attract and train young men who had an interest in aviation, from all over the country. He planned to set up <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadron.html" title="Squadron">squadrons</a> of young <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadet.html" title="Cadet">cadets</a> in as many towns and cities as possible, and ask local people to organise and run them.</p>
<p>Air Commodore Chamier's idea seemed to capture the mood of the British people at the time. In their eagerness to help the nation in preparation for war, young men rushed to join the Corps in their thousands. The cadets were asked to pay a weekly subscription of 3d (<a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_pence.html" title="Old pence">old pence</a>) which today is equivalent to 1<a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny.html" title="Penny">p</a>.</p>
<p>Each squadron's aim was to prepare cadets for joining the RAF or the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Air_Arm_8044.html" title="Fleet Air Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a>. They tried to give the cadets as much Service and aviation background as possible as well as giving instruction in <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drill_commands.html" title="Drill commands">drill</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discipline.html" title="Discipline">discipline</a>, how to wear the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniform.html" title="Uniform">uniform</a> and how to behave on <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_station_1d39.html" title="RAF station">RAF stations</a>. The training the cadets received also meant development of personal physical fitness. <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_education.html" title="Physical education">PT</a>, games and <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletics_%28track_and_field%29.html" title="Athletics (track and field)">athletics</a>, especially <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_country_running.html" title="Cross country running">cross country running</a> and long route marches, soon became standard squadron activities. Cadets were also encouraged to take part in activities such as <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shooting.html" title="Shooting">shooting</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camping.html" title="Camping">camping</a> and, of course, flying. By 1938 the activities of the ADCC were severely restricted because of the approach of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Many ADCC instructors and squadron officers were called up into regular Service. Buildings were <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commandeer.html" title="Commandeer">commandeered</a> by either the Service or by local government for war work and cadets went to work on RAF stations. Cadets were used to carry messages, they helped with clerical duties, in providing extra muscle in handling aircraft and in the movement of stores and equipment. They filled thousands of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandbags.html" title="Sandbags">sandbags</a> and loaded miles of belts of ammunition.</p>
<p>Throughout the early stages of war, the government received good reports as to the quality of cadets entering the RAF and Fleet Air Arm. It was so impressed that it asked the ADCC to begin training young men who were waiting to be called into Service. The ADCC willingly took on this very responsible job and in a very short space of time produced thousands of well qualified individuals who went to pass quickly through basic training.</p>
<p>Towards the end of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> the government realised the true value of the work done by the ADCC and agreed to take over its control. This meant a number of changes to the corps, and in fact brought about the birth of a completely new organisation, called the Air Training Corps. So on the 5 February <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a> the Air Training Corps (ATC) was officially established, with <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_VI_d01c.html" title="King George VI">King George VI</a> very kindly agreeing to be the Air Commodore-in-Chief, and issuing a <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Warrant_3ef1.html" title="Royal Warrant">Royal Warrant</a> setting out the Corps' aims.</p>
<p>The number of young men responding to this new ATC was spectacular. Within the first month the size of the old ADCC had virtually doubled to more than 400 squadrons and after 12 months it was about 8 times as big. The new ATC badge was designed and, once approved by the King, it was published in August 1941. The motto VENTURE ADVENTURE, devised by Air Commodore Chamier, was adopted by the ATC and incorporated into the badge.</p>
<p>The new ATC squadrons adapted their training programmes to prepare young men for entry to the RAF. Squadrons arranged visits to RAF and Fleet Air Arm stations as part of the cadets' training and to let them fly as much as possible. Everybody wanted to fly but, with so few flights available, many cadets were disappointed. One solution designed to get cadets airborne was to introduce them to <a href="../../../g/l/i/Gliding.html" title="Gliding">gliding</a>. This would give cadets a chance to get the feel of an aircraft in flight and allow them to handle the controls. This obviously could not happen over night. It would be many years before this dream could be realised.</p>

<p>The ATC is the larger part of the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Cadet_Organisation_43d1.html" title="Air Cadet Organisation">Air Cadet Organisation</a> (<b>ACO</b>), along with the RAF sections of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combined_Cadet_Force_7050.html" title="Combined Cadet Force">Combined Cadet Force</a>. It is divided geographically into six regions, each of which are sub-divided into <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wing_%28air_force_unit%29.html" title="Wing (air force unit)">wings</a>. There are currently 36 Wings, most named after the one or two counties that they operate in. Wings are divided into four areas and further sub-divided into <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadron.html" title="Squadron">squadrons</a>.</p>
<p>Headquarters Air Cadets (HQAC), based at <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAFC_Cranwell_f89e.html" title="RAFC Cranwell">RAFC Cranwell</a>, controls the organisation; and there are subordinate HQs at Region and Wing levels staffed by officers of the RAF Reserve and civil servants.

The Current Commandant Air Cadets is <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Moulds_003f.html" title="Gordon Moulds">Air Commodore Gordon Moulds</a>.</p>
<p>The ACO forms one of the seven functional areas of <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_22_Group_RAF_838e.html" title="No 22 Group RAF">No 22 (Training) Group Royal Air Force</a>, which is responsible for the recruitment and selection of all RAF personnel and for the policy and delivery of RAF non-operational training (including Flying Training).

<p>Two Air Cadet National Adventure Training Centres are controlled by HQAC - at <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llanbedr.html" title="Llanbedr">Llanbedr</a>, Wales and <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windermere_%28town%29.html" title="Windermere (town)">Windermere</a>, England.

<p>ATC Squadrons are established in most large towns in the UK and there are also units in <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Channel_Islands_90b3.html" title="The Channel Islands">the Channel Islands</a>. In recent years, there have always been 926 squadrons. The first 50 squadrons formed have their squadron numbers followed by an F to show they are <i>founder</i> squadrons. Only 30 are still in existence, as the other 20 have disbanded over time.</p>
<p>In towns not large enough to sustain a squadron of 30 cadets, a Detached Flight (DF) may be formed. This operates much like any other unit, but is technically a component part of a nearby larger squadron. The establishment of <a href="../../../o/f/f/Officer_%28armed_forces%29.html" title="Officer (armed forces)">Officers</a> and cadet NCOs (<a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Commissioned_Officer_471a.html" title="Non-Commissioned Officer">Non-Commissioned Officers</a>) is dependent on the size of the Squadron or DF. There are approximately 48 Detached Flights currently in being.</p>
<p>Each squadron is commanded by a <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAFVR%28T%29_a8c9.html" title="RAFVR(T)">RAFVR(T)</a> Officer. The commanding officer (or CO) has a good deal of autonomy in running the unit but also carries heavy responsibilities. Additionally where a unit has other members of staff the CO allocates their duties and also provides recommendation on appointment, retention and promotion of those staff.</p>
<p>Another member of the adult staff with a lot of responsibility within a unit is the Squadron Warrant Officer (Sqn WO). This person will hold the rank of <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrant_Officer_34e0.html" title="Warrant Officer">Warrant Officer</a> and will have typically have spent many years working within the squadron or at least within the ATC. In the case of no commissioned officers being present, the SWO will take charge of the unit. At all other times, the SWO will usually hold a closer relationship with the cadets than the CO will.</p>
<p>This basic structure has many permutations - varying numbers of cadets and staff, accommodation and facilities. A typical Detached Flight consists of the Officer Commanding and a minimum of fifteen cadets and is often housed in rented accommodation. At the other extreme a large Squadron can consist of 120 plus cadets, 4 commissioned officers, 2 non-commissioned officers and a half dozen Civilian Instructors.</p>

<p>Young people can join the ATC at any time between the ages of 13 and 17. Cadets can stay in the corps up until age 20 but must have reached the rank of Cadet Sergeant by 18 to be eligible for this, except in Edinburgh and South Scotland Wing, where this does not apply. Those who stay on beyond 18 are termed Instructor Cadets. All cadets are issued with uniform and must each pay a small amount in <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subscriptions.html" title="Subscriptions">subscriptions</a> (or 'subs' as they are commonly known), usually around £50 per year. The subscription money covers parts of the activities undertaken by the Cadets for example Adventure training, local camps etc. Each squadron also has to pay a fixed amount to the wing to which it belongs for each cadet 'on its books'. Activities such as target shooting, flying and gliding are paid for by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a></p>
<p>The cadets of a squadron all join as probationers, becoming full cadets when they are enrolled. As they become more experienced, and if suitable they (cadets) can be promoted by their Squadron Commanding Officer (CO) to the status of Cadet <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-commissioned_officer.html" title="Non-commissioned officer">NCOs</a>. The NCO ranks within the ATC mirror those of the RAF and are <b>Cadet Corporal</b>, <b>Cadet Sergeant</b>, <b>Cadet Flight Sergeant</b> and <b>Cadet Warrant Officer</b> (<b>CWO</b>). It is common within the ATC to abbreviate these ranks by dropping the prefix "Cadet". The rank of Cadet Warrant Officer require's a promotion interview by the Officer Commanding of the wing (Wing Commander), his deputy or the Wing Staff Officer (WSO) of that area; promotion to the lower ranks is in the power of the squadron's Commanding Officer. Unlike Warrant Officers in the Regular British Armed Forces, CWOs are addressed by their rank, rather than "<i>Sir</i>".</p>
<p>All cadets who are over the age of 18 have the prefix "Instructor Cadet" before their rank. Instructor Cadets must hold the rank of Sergeant or above, and are required to leave if they don't by their 18th birthday. These NCOs now wear a rank slide with the words 'INSTRUCTOR CADET' embroidered below their rank insignia, although some still wear the old insignia - a white band attached to the rank slide. An instructor cadet has extra responsibilities over under-18 year olds which include a duty of care to the younger Cadets and NCOs. Instructor Cadets are required to attend training to aid them in their transition from 'child' to 'adult'.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, instructor cadets have no authority over cadets below the age of 18 holding the same or a more senior rank. This has been the source of much debate within the ATC.</p>
<p>Not all cadets who join the ATC can expect to receive promotion. However all cadets can progress through the training system and, by passing exams ), achieve different classifications. The classification levels are <b>Second Class Cadet</b> (commonly known as a 'basic'; this is automatically achieved on commencing service), <b>First Class Cadet</b>, <b>Leading Cadet</b>, <b>Senior Cadet</b> and <b>Staff Cadet</b>. For each of these qualifications cadets study a variety of subjects including <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airmanship.html" title="Airmanship">airmanship</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navigation.html" title="Navigation">navigation</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_aid.html" title="First aid">first aid</a>, communications, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principles_of_flight.html" title="Principles of flight">principles of flight</a>, airframes and <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_propulsion.html" title="Air propulsion">propulsion</a>. These subjects are studied using Air Cadet Publications or ('ACPs'). Each successive qualification allows a cadet greater participation. For example, cadets must be First Class before they can take part in some activities such as UK annual camps or air experience flying, while Leading Cadets can participate in overseas activities. Cadets who have achieved the Staff Cadet classification have completed their academic training and can attain a <a href="../../../b/t/e/BTEC_5e84.html" title="BTEC">BTEC</a> Award in Aviation Studies. Staff cadets wear a yellow <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanyard.html" title="Lanyard">lanyard</a> over the left shoulder, and are allowed to teach other cadets.</p>
<p>Cadets can also qualify for various other <a href="../../../b/t/e/BTEC_5e84.html" title="BTEC">BTEC</a> awards through the training that is carried out at their squadrons.</p>

<p>The staff who run the ATC at unit level come in 3 types: <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commissioned_officer.html" title="Commissioned officer">commissioned officers</a>, adult <a href="../../../s/n/c/SNCO_ce76.html" title="SNCO">SNCOs</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergeant.html" title="Sergeant">Sgt</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_Sergeant_49e5.html" title="Flight Sergeant">FS</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrant_Officer_34e0.html" title="Warrant Officer">WO</a>) and civilian instructors. Officers are commissioned into the <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_VR%28T%29_b4f7.html" title="RAF VR(T)">Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, Training Branch</a> Unless an officer has previous service, he or she is commissioned as a <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot_Officer_be76.html" title="Pilot Officer">Pilot Officer</a>, being promoted to <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Officer_50d9.html" title="Flying Officer">Flying Officer</a> after two years. After 9 years commissioned service, the rank of <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_Lieutenant_db7d.html" title="Flight Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> is bestowed. Squadrons are usually commanded by <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_Lieutenant_db7d.html" title="Flight Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenants</a>, who are also found as Wing and Regional staff officers along with <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadron_Leader_315c.html" title="Squadron Leader">Squadron Leaders</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wing_Commander_%28rank%29_fd97.html" title="Wing Commander (rank)">Wing Commanders</a>. Particularly large squadrons are sometimes commanded by <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadron_Leader_315c.html" title="Squadron Leader">Squadron Leaders</a>.</p>
<p>Adults may also be appointed as Adult <a href="../../../s/n/c/SNCO_ce76.html" title="SNCO">SNCOs</a>, these being ranks within the ATC so unlike the officers they are not directly part of the RAF. Adult NCOs are uniformed in the same way as their RAF counterparts with two exceptions: a small gilt <i>ATC</i> badge is worn on the rank badge and Warrant Officers (unless they have previous regular warranted service) wear a different rank badge. Civilian Instructors, known as <b>CIs</b>, play an important role in training cadets. Unlike Adult NCOs and Officers, CIs do not wear uniform and do not form part of the chain of command in the squadron.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Training_Corps_c936.html" title="Edit section: Civilian committee">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Civilian committee</span></h3>
<p>For each level of command there is an associated <b>Civilian Committee</b>. There is a minimum of 5 members to any "Civ Com", and there must be a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairman.html" title="Chairman">chairman</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treasurer.html" title="Treasurer">treasurer</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary.html" title="Secretary">secretary</a> as well as the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commanding_officer.html" title="Commanding officer">CO</a> (an ex-officio member) and someone to take "minutes". The Civ Com is responsible for overseeing the initial unit formation and direction. The committees, consisting of respected members of the community often including parents of cadets and retired staff, also manage finances (in particular <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fund_raising.html" title="Fund raising">fund raising</a>) but do not have any executive authority.</p>
<p>The ATC is a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charitable_organisation.html" title="Charitable organisation">charitable organisation</a>. The Royal Air Force provides funds for a few of the key activities such as flying training. These finances are known as 'public funds'. The great range of other activities offered by the ATC however are financed from 'non-public fund'. Here the Civilian Committees come into their own in their tireless effort to seek the necessary financial assistance which allows these other activities to take place.</p>
<p>Squadrons are "charities excepted from registration". This means they enjoy all of the legal benefits of a registered charity without the burden of registration.</p>

<p>Within the framework of the training programme ATC cadets have the opportunity of taking part in many activities. On most Squadrons the only compulsory activities in the ATC year are attendance at various <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">church</a> parades, usually ATC Sunday (to celebrate the founding of the Air Training Corps on 5 February 1941, see below) and <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remembrance_Sunday_5a4c.html" title="Remembrance Sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a>.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Training_Corps_c936.html" title="Edit section: Parade nights">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Parade nights</span></h3>
<p>Every squadron meets or parades during the evening, twice a week. Parade nights always begin and end with a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parade.html" title="Parade">parade</a>. First parade is usually used as an opportunity for uniform inspection and to instruct cadets on the evening's activities, while final parade is usually used as an opportunity to inform cadets of upcoming events that they may wish (or may be required) to take part in. On some squadrons subscriptions 'subs' are paid on a per-parade night basis. On other squadrons, subs are paid monthly either in person or by automated standing order. Subs vary from squadron to squadron and are set by the civilian committee in consultation with the squadron's Commanding Officer and other staff. Each night's activities, between first and final parade, are normally structured into two sessions with a break in between. The activities are normally pre-planned and range from lessons to drill including aviation type activities including areomodling, radios and map reading - some squadrons have physical training. Some nights are called green nights and this is when cadets practise skills needed in the field.</p>

These flights typically last 30 minutes; as part of a structured syllabus of training it is usual for the cadet to be offered the chance of flying the aircraft or of experiencing <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerobatics.html" title="Aerobatics">aerobatics</a>. The staff are all qualified service pilots, usually serving or retired RAF officers. Prior to the introduction of the Tutor, AEFs were equipped with <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Aviation_Bulldog_eaf5.html" title="Scottish Aviation Bulldog">Bulldogs</a> as a temporary measure following the retirement of the <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Chipmunk_0973.html" title="De Havilland Chipmunk">Chipmunk</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>. The Chipmunk was introduced in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> and during its service flew many thousands of cadets. Prior to the Chipmunk and established AEFs, cadet flying was a more <a href="../../../a/d/-/Ad-hoc.html" title="Ad-hoc">ad-hoc</a> affair, although during the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airspeed_Oxford_797c.html" title="Airspeed Oxford">Airspeed Oxfords</a> and <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avro_Anson_d582.html" title="Avro Anson">Avro Ansons</a> were used specifically to fly cadets.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Training_Corps_c936.html" title="Edit section: Gliding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gliding</span></h3>
<p>Cadets can also undertake elementary flying training at a <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volunteer_Gliding_Squadron_ca1f.html" title="Volunteer Gliding Squadron">Volunteer Gliding Squadron</a> (VGS) in <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> Gliders. The staff are all qualified service gliding instructors, usually made up of a mixture of regulars, reservists and Civilian Instructors.</p>
<p>Gliding initially consists of three one day Gliding Induction Courses, GIC 1,2 &amp; 3. Each GIC consists of learning about controlling the aircraft in one of the three axes of flight. GIC 1 is pitch, GIC 2 is roll and GIC 3 is yaw and a demonstration of stalled flight. A VGS will either fly the winch-launched Viking T Mk1 glider or the <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grob_Vigilant_cbd1.html" title="Grob Vigilant">Vigilant T Mk1</a> self-launched motorglider.</p>
<p>At age 16 onwards, cadets can apply for gliding scholarships through their squadron staff. If selected, the cadet will receive up to 40 instructional launches on the Viking conventional glider, or up to 8 hours of tuition on the Vigilant motor glider. Cadets who successfully complete either of these programmes will be awarded blue wings. Cadets who show the required aptitude and ability may go on to perform a solo flight and be awarded silver wings. Further training is available to a select few cadets who show potential to progress onto Advanced Gliding Training (AGT) where on completion they are awarded gold wings. Usually these cadets will be enrolled as Flight Staff Cadets (FSCs) and further training to instructor categories is possible.</p>

<p>A FSC can achieve a Grade 2 award, which recognises them as a competent solo pilot, a Grade 1 award, allowing them to carry passengers in the air and perform the basic teaching tasks involved in the GIC courses. Ultimately an FSC can achieve a C category instructors rating. A 'C cat' is a probationary instructor who is qualified to teach the Gliding Scholarship course.</p>
<p>Once a cadet reaches 20 years of age, he can no longer be a FSC and must become a Civilian (Gliding) Instructor, CGI, (although a FSC has this option at age 18) or a commissioned officer. Once either of these adult statuses has been gained, progression onto 'B cat' and 'A cat' is possible. An A cat is able to send first solos, and B cat can send subsequent solos. Both can perform SCT (Staff Continuation Training) to keep other members of staff well trained and current in their flying categories.</p>

The 7.62 mm <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parker_Hale_805e.html" title="Parker Hale">Parker Hale</a> L81A2 Cadet Target Rifle is also used at long ranges for competition shooting. Although safety has always been the main concern when shooting, with everything done by the book, recent years have seen the introduction of a wider range of training courses for staff involved in shooting to improve quality and safety even further. There are many competitions, from postal smallbore competitions to the yearly Inter-Service Cadet Rifle Meet at <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rifle_Association_of_the_United_Kingdom_ccba.html" title="National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom">Bisley</a>, the home of UK shooting.</p>
<p>There are currently four types of marksman award that a cadet can achieve, ranging from "Squadron Marksman" - the easiest to obtain, through "Wing Marksman" and "Region Marksman", to "Corps Marksman". To achieve these awards the cadet needs to undergo a special shooting "marksman" practice and then achieve a high enough qualifying score depending on the award specified.</p>

<p>The highlight of the cadet's calendar is annual camp - a week away at an RAF station. Annual camps are organised for all squadrons so that every cadet who wishes to take part and who has achieved at least the <b>First Class</b> qualification may attend. Cadets usually stay in RAF barrack blocks and eat in the station's <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mess.html" title="Mess">mess</a> facilities. The itinerary is always packed with typical ATC activities such as air experience flying, shooting, adventure training and, of course, drill. Cadets will also have the opportunity to visit various sections of the station and meet the people who work there.</p>
<p>For older and more experienced cadets who have achieved the <b>Leading Cadet</b> qualification, the corps also offers overseas camps. These are more expensive than UK camps, as the cost of flights has to be paid for, and are generally more relaxed and seen as a reward for hard working and long serving cadets. Since the end of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, and the closure of RAF stations in Germany, the number of overseas camp opportunities has decreased.

<p>The Air Training Corps is the single largest operating authority of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Duke_of_Edinburgh%27s_Award_6b4b.html" title="The Duke of Edinburgh's Award">the Duke of Edinburgh's Award</a> system and celebrates its 50th year of providing this opportunity to its cadets in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. Cadets are often encouraged to achieve the Bronze, Silver and Gold awards as they progress through their cadet careers.

<p>An extensive range of communication training is offered where appropriately skilled instructors and equipment are available. This can range from handheld radio <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice_procedure.html" title="Voice procedure">operating procedures</a> to networked <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital.html" title="Digital">digital</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telecommunication.html" title="Telecommunication">communication</a>, and even encompasses publishing online (such as this Wiki).</p>
<p>The Provisional Radio Operator Certificate is the first step and has been part of the compulsory curriculum since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>. Cadets are then encouraged to pursue this training across a range of mediums and technology. Once a sufficiently broad spectrum of skills have been mastered and validated by the <i>Wing Communications Officer</i> the cadet is awarded the Communicator Badge to be worn on the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brassard.html" title="Brassard">brassard</a>. Communication training provides valuable practical lessons in information handling and management, develops interpersonal skills and meets one of the Corps' prime objectives: 'providing training useful in both civilian and military life'.</p>

<p>Cadets often volunteer to help at various national and local events. For their services a small payment is usually offered to their squadron's funds. Typical examples of such work includes car parking duties at events and delivering copies of Gateway Magazine to RAF married quarters.</p>
<p>The largest example of cadets involved in volunteer work is at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_International_Air_Tattoo_9a58.html" title="Royal International Air Tattoo">Royal International Air Tattoo</a>, an annual air display held at <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_Fairford_4f99.html" title="RAF Fairford">RAF Fairford</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Training_Corps_c936.html" title="Edit section: Uniform">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Uniform</span></h2>
<p>Cadets and staff of the ATC wear uniform similar to that worn by regular members of the Royal Air Force. This is issued to each cadet when they join by the supply squadron at the local RAF station. Items are then replaced free, as needed. Blue uniform consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black leather parade shoes (These are the only item of kit not officially issued, cadets are usually expected to provide their own footwear.)</li>
<li>RAF No. 2 Dress trousers (male cadets) RAF No. 2 dress skirts or slacks for females.</li>
<li>RAF Blue-grey belt with a polished brass/staybrite buckle. (Female Cadets may wear the RAF Purse Belt, or Female Pattern Stable Belt. Male Cadets may wear the RAF Stable belt.)</li>
<li>RAF working blue shirt, worn open necked, without a tie.</li>
<li>RAF <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedgwood.html" title="Wedgwood">Wedgwood</a> blue shirt. Worn with a tie (tied in a <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor_knot.html" title="Windsor knot">Windsor knot</a>), for formal inspections and parades.</li>
<li>RAF jumper, with Duke of Edinburgh's Award badge and/or flying/gliding proficiency badges ('wings') sewn to the shoulder patches as applicable</li>
<li>All Cadets wear a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brassard.html" title="Brassard">brassard</a> on the right arm. This is used to show badges depicting the cadet's classification (First Class, Leading etc), their squadron number, and awards for achievements such as marksmanship. An Air Training Corps distinguishing badge is also worn. Lord Lieutenant's cadets wear a separate brassard withg distinguishing badge and sqn number on the left arm during time in office.</li>
<li>RAF Blue-grey <a href="../../../b/e/r/Beret.html" title="Beret">Beret</a> with ATC cap badge. The ATC cap badge a circular silvered metal badge which depicts a falcon surrounded by the words 'Air Training Corps'. Staff wear the capbadge appropriate to them, i.e. the RAF Officer, Warrant Officer or Other Ranks badge. Officers wear a peaked cap when in blue uniform.</li>
<li><b>Staff Cadets</b> wear a yellow lanyard around their left shoulder, instead of the usual classification badge on the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brassard.html" title="Brassard">brassard</a>. This is replaced by a maroon lanyard if the cadet completes the Junior Leaders course.</li>
<li>Cadet Warrant Officers, Lord Lieutenant's Cadets and Members of ATC Bands are entitled to wear RAF Other Ranks No.1 SD Uniform when occasion calls for it.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../d/i/s/Disruptive_Pattern_Material_1641.html" title="Disruptive Pattern Material">Disruptive Pattern Material</a> (DPM) uniform generally comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li>DPM Shirt.</li>
<li>DPM Jacket.</li>
<li>DPM trousers.</li>
<li>Issued <a href="../../../b/e/r/Beret.html" title="Beret">Beret</a> with ATC cap badge.</li>
<li>Black leather combat boots.</li>
<li>2inch Belt.</li>
</ul>
<p>As DPM uniform is not issued and at the time of writing in December 2006, no regulations have been issued for its use, the wearing of DPM uniform varies quite widely across the ATC. Some units are able to issue cadets with DPMs, however many cadets purchase their own surplus DPM uniforms.</p>
