<p>There have been some news stories hinting at further delays. Singapore Airlines has <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?dist=newsfinder&amp;siteid=google&amp;guid=%7B16C910A3-63EB-48DF-A29C-3DDDC3B9A69E%7D&amp;keyword=" class="external text" title="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?dist=newsfinder&amp;siteid=google&amp;guid=%7B16C910A3-63EB-48DF-A29C-3DDDC3B9A69E%7D&amp;keyword=" rel="nofollow">commented</a> on these rumours, but states that they have not been informed of any further slippage, saying they are on track for a December 2006 entry into service. We should keep a close eye on this, but wait until we have a firm announcement before announcing any delays. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 22:06, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've reverted an edit quoting a UAE news report as a source for a delayed introduction into service. I couldn't get the link to work correctly, but a review of their recent stories on the subject shows nothing new. Singapore Airlines already have two A380s and they should fly commercially in late 2006 after completion of the certification process. There are other delays affecting future deliveries, but so far as I can see nothing affecting the initial entry into service. There have been several similar edits over the past few months, all claiming that operational flights will be delayed into 2007. We need to keep on top of this, as service entry draws closer and we can expect more readers of our article. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 09:16, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Singapore has not yet taken delivery of any A380s. You may be referring to two A380s, destined for SIA, currently undergoing interior fitting in Hamburg. From what I have read it is unlikely EIS will be in 2006... but I'll stay out of this issue since it will go away in a few short months. --<a href="../../../c/t/i/User%7ECtillier_c7a7.html" title="User:Ctillier">Ctillier</a> 21:16, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have again reverted an edit by <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_48c1.html" title="User:Ravedave">Ravedave</a>. The source he relies on does <b>not</b> mention any delays in the introduction of the A380. The relevant <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data/business/2006/September/business_September481.xml&amp;section=business" class="external text" title="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data/business/2006/September/business_September481.xml&amp;section=business" rel="nofollow">paragraph (towards the end of the article)</a> states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>However, an industry consultant reporting on the event also quoted sources as saying as few as four A380s would be delivered next year. He said all four planes would go to Singapore Airlines, which would get a "ceremonial delivery" at the end of this year.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Certainly there are serious delays in the A380 program, but these do not affect the entry into service of the first aircraft, which have been built, flown, fitted out, delivered and are awaiting full certification. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 19:29, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I read, possibly on SIA's site, that they have been delivered, but there will be a "ceremonial delivery" in December. Haven't been able to find the source again - keep getting sidetracked. But given that the only thing holding up EIS is certification, one wonders what the first two SIA A380s are doing in the meantime. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 21:31, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Singapore Airlines doesn't seem to have reacted to the <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_3.html" title="October 3">3 October</a> announcement, but I quote from a Reuters story:
<dl>
<dd><i>It marks the first time that Airbus has acknowledged it will not be able to deliver the first $300 million double-decker to launch customer Singapore Airlines this year, with the inaugural delivery now set for October 2007, 10 months overdue.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That looks pretty unambiguous to me. I'll tidy up, based on this. If anyone has any more information, please give a reference. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 02:11, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. The article should probably mention how badly this delay will effect airbus and how "EADS said it would also examine the actions of managers at Airbus itself" - I'll let you handle that. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/business/03cnd-airbus.html?ex=1317528000&amp;en=5f71b69d505393d0&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/business/03cnd-airbus.html?ex=1317528000&amp;en=5f71b69d505393d0&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> -<a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_48c1.html" title="User:Ravedave">Ravedave</a> <small><sup>(<a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_babyname_1bfa.html" title="User:Ravedave/babyname">help name my baby</a>)</sup></small> 05:49, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What we really need here is a list of: The original intended Entry Into Service date and the approximate resulting <b>EIS</b> for each slide. Otherwise it is very hard for a reader to figure out what has actually happened to the airplane and what it means for EADS and their airline customers. Komodon 20:23, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Virgin Atlantic's A380s are now delayed to 2013. Let's not forget that the original EIS was 2006. (N328KF)</dd>

<p>Would anybody object to ditching the lesson on wake turbulence physics? I'm referring to the middle two paragraphs of the wake turbulence section. It's interesting material, but not very relevant, and would fit better in the wake turbulence article. I'm trying to find ways to 1) shrink the article and 2) make room for the impending ICAO rules that will be coming out in the next few weeks. That will no doubt warrant a small paragraph in the wake turbulence section. So, does anybody feel strongly about keeping it? --<a href="../../../c/t/i/User%7ECtillier_c7a7.html" title="User:Ctillier">Ctillier</a> 06:03, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A summary follows of the editing I have recently done in this section. First, the opening sentence needs to say <i>why</i> this is relevant as a criticism, which is why I added back the wording that 81.179.188.91 removed because of perceived POV. The only reason it became POV is because 130.76.32.15 took out the conditional wording. Second, the EADS press release states clearly that while trailing separations are increased over the Heavy category, leading separations are also reduced. Where a 747 would have to trail another 747 by 4 nm, an A380 could trail it by 2 or 3 nm. Neglecting to mention this, as seen in reporting by various media outlets, borders on POV in my opinion. (Remember the media is smelling blood on the A380 program these days) Third, I have removed the physics paragraphs per above comments, and plan to integrated them into the wake turbulence article, which lacks a section on the physics of the phenomenon. Fourth, I have included the key numbers from the A380 vortex working group study, plain, unvarnished and without interpretation, because expressing them in terms of "X percent more than 747" again borders on POV. It goes without saying, please feel free to improve it. --<a href="../../../c/t/i/User%7ECtillier_c7a7.html" title="User:Ctillier">Ctillier</a> 04:59, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Removed sentence on business case in first paragraph as net result of the ICAO recommendations on the business case is not clear. Referenced article states as much: "It was not clear what actual impact the constraints would have, however." So it doesn't seem appropriate to then write about a possible undermined business case.</dd>

<p>There is no way that SIA can start commercial flights in 2007 with one airframe. I think we should leave a big question mark on this point in the article until we can find out definitively, but unless SIA does short hops or charters, there is simply no way they can operate scheduled flights with a single airframe. Perhaps they will use it for training or something; Given that they won't have a second airframe for at least a few months after that, there will be no spare aircraft nor the ability to do longer flights (which require a 2-3 airframe rotation.) These flights comprise the bulk of SIA's flying. —<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph/N328KF</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 02:31, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Joseph. Do short hops to Sydney with one airframe not count as EIS for you?

<dd>Yeah! I've been aware that some people have had inside info on this, but we can't really put down anything unless we have a solid source. We'll wait and see what happens, but when an A380 flies a scheduled route with paying customers onboard, that's EIS, even if they only fly one service a year or whatever. We source our facts, we put them into an article, and we polish it up. We don't speculate or act on tips. Personally I'm disappointed at the delays, but I'm not running an airliner business, and nobody comes to Wikipedia looking for my opinion - they want solid information. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 07:01, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know very little about how airlines allocate their aeroplanes. However I personally don't see why they could use the single A380 on one of their routes on the busiest day. E.g. Saturday.

<p>The article currently states in the opening sentence about delivery delays that Labinal supplied over 80% of the electrical harnessing. Why does it need to say that, especially in that context? If this is an implied assignment of blame, I'm not sure that meets our encyclopedic values... especially since I have found no source stating that Labinal was to blame for the delays. Is there a better way to rephrase it, or is the fact even relevant? --<a href="../../../c/t/i/User%7ECtillier_c7a7.html" title="User:Ctillier">Ctillier</a> 16:54, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I understand what you mean. As far as I know, it's not publicly known who exactly (if any one entity) is to blame for the wiring problems, and I didn't mean to suggest that Labinal was (although one German newspaper has indeed pointed the finger at them, see <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labinal.html" title="Labinal">Labinal</a>). I'm not opposed to any useful clarification in this regard. However, since the wiring problem is the central issue in an event very relevant to this article - the A380 production delays - it seems to be worthwile to mention the wiring subcontractor at some place. Maybe some other place in the article would be better suited for that? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 17:04, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He states on chart 13 that the problems arose in fuselage sections 13 and 18, but not the others. 13 and 18 are the two sections built in Hamburg. While he doesn't actually come out and point fingers, that's closer to blame than I've seen anywhere, and it comes straight from the PM, himself a German... Anyway, I will think of a way to work in the Labinal tidbit in a place where it cannot be construed for guilt by association. --<a href="../../../c/t/i/User%7ECtillier_c7a7.html" title="User:Ctillier">Ctillier</a> 22:25, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK. I'll be the first to say that I know zip about A380 production specifics, but at any rate, if Labinal is indeed the systems integrator responsible for producing and installing the wiring, it's probably not far-fetched to assume they share some responsability for the wiring problems with whoever is building the relevant aircraft components. Still, it's probably better to avoid any impression of guilt by association for now. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 06:19, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've seen the recommendation above to put the original and current estimated EIS dates to help get an idea of what the delays are like, something similar to this <a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=15048" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=15048" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> it's been suggested. However IMHO, a better way to get the effect of the delays across is to how many were supposed to have been shipped/EIS by e.g. 2010 and how many it's estimated will have shipped now. Perhaps choose 2 dates to help get the idea across. IMHO, this works better then simply giving the date changes for each airline <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 13:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have several times added an external link to the A380 page, and each time had it deleted. I am assuming this because the person deleting it thinks it is spam. While it is true that the link is to a website I work for, I feel that it is a valid link as it provides information not available in the main article (a list of major suppliers to the program) that is relevant, useful and of interest to readers, is not available elsewhere, and does not require any sort of registration or payment to view. The policy page on external links suggests that the best way to have this link added and not subsequently deleted is to post it on the talk page and have other editors view the website and decide as to its relevance and appropriateness. So here it is!</p>

<dd>Hi Jenny, thanks for discussing this here. The biggest suppliers (as relevant to an overview article such as this) are already mentioned in the production section of the article. Adding a link comes down to the value added by the linked content, compared to the other links already present. That's a judgement call that any editor is free to make. While I didn't remove the link, I share the opinion that it doesn't quite make the cut. (Neither does a380portal.com, for that matter...) I would support including the link as a footnote in the production section of the article, after the sentence that mentions that the suppliers are from all around the world. It's not as visible as a link, but it provides the information to those who seek it. --<a href="../../../c/t/i/User%7ECtillier_c7a7.html" title="User:Ctillier">Ctillier</a> 05:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I wrote is just a poor attempt at humor, and a little bit of ridicule aimed at Airbus. It's not meant to be taken seriously, nor is it meant to be offensive. Even when I do say something I wish I hadn't said, unlss it's just a complete misunderstanding about something that will cause more problems if it's left there, I let it remain posted. I know I have a big mouth, and it's OK if the world knows it. At least I know better than to put it in the article itself. You should the jusnk we take out of the Boeing articles!

<p>This explains the recent edits I made to this section, which I was increasingly concerned about.</p>
<p>(1) the failure in configuration management ultimately means the change control systems were overwhelmed by the huge number of design changes-- not that wires didn't plug into each other. The latter was a symptom of the larger change control failure, not a cause. The opening sentence is about causes, not symptoms. (2) the fact that Labinal corp makes the wiring is irrelevant -- the same company manufactures wiring bundles for the Boeing 787, which does not suffer from wiring problems. Mentioning the company in connection with the A380 wiring imbroglio is misleading at best. So I ditched the reference. (3) the IEEE news analysis states the same things as already referenced to Airbus and Flight International. It is redundant and there is nothing new here besides rank speculation by analysts. (4) the IEEE article clearly states that aluminum wiring was designed in from the very beginning. It points out that other sources have incorrectly jumped to the conclusion that there was a supposed 'switch' from copper to aluminum. This is a red herring as far as the wiring delays are concerned, and thus does not belong in the article. (5) the IEEE article quotes a random aerospace analyst (coincidentally located in Tacoma, WA next to Boeing's manufacturing sites). While that may be appropriate for a news analysis in IEEE Spectrum, I don't believe it makes the cut for an encyclopedia-- especially not with the vague statement that "other sources" say such-and-such. Gotta do better than this. (6) The Seattle PI article specifically quotes Richard Aboulafia in connection with the weight problems. Might as well state this clearly, rather than include a vague allusion to "some analysts"... if a specific citation is available, please use it. Regardless, I am uncomfortable with the selective quotation of analyst opinions (see (5)) and would rather see this reference removed. --<a href="../../../c/t/i/User%7ECtillier_c7a7.html" title="User:Ctillier">Ctillier</a> 04:14, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A small request: can we please wait for the dust to settle on the A380F news before we hastily hack up the article? There is no official announcement other than media reports of statements by Gallois and assorted spokespeople, and the status of the UPS order (cancellation or deferral?) is still unclear. Will the A380F even be on offer anymore? We will know much more in a few days, so in the meantime let's keep up our quality standards. --<a href="../../../c/t/i/User%7ECtillier_c7a7.html" title="User:Ctillier">Ctillier</a> 03:58, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>When Airbus moved workers off the freighter and to the passenger version, UPS realized that it would not get a plane until 2012. They can not officially cancel the order until an agreed to date, but the writing is on wall. Should we wait for the official announcement from UPS or Airbus or rely on multiple news reports from reputable sources? What is the Wikipedia standard on sources? <a href="../../../m/n/w/User%7EMnw2000_d6d1.html" title="User:Mnw2000">user:mnw2000</a> 19:57, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We can rely on the UPS press release and media coverage of it, and of the media coverage of the informal Airbus announcement of further delays / deferment of the Freighter model. The UPS press release is a reliable source.

<dd>It is correct that technically, UPS won't formally cancel until the summer, and firm orders still stand at 166.

<dd>The item seems like something added by an Airbus-hater to try to discredit the plane. Personally, I'm not too keen on Airbus, but having flown on Airbuses several times, I will say that they always got me where I was going in one piece (both me and the airplaine). As long as the so-called controvery is an old claim from a sub-contractor's disgruntled employee, I don't think it has a place here. There is a Wiki article on the man, and it does list several sources. However, as long as his claims remain unsubstantiated by outside investigtors, I don't see that it belongs here. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 23:32, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
