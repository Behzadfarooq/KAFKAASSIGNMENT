<p>Well let's see how long it take before someone proposes to delete this one... I'm betting two months or less. At least with this one theres the potential for information many unique aircraft that aren't talked about anywhere else, maybe that will save it from the hells of deleation. &lt;_&lt; <a href="../../../c/b/a/User%7ECbale2000_6999.html" title="User:Cbale2000">Cbale2000</a> 17:17, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's nice to see such a page at Wikipedia. I'll try to complete the whole article (in my spare time of course) with pictures for each aircraft. Although I must say I sort of think this article should be split into individual articles for each "notable" plane, becoz there is a subcategory called "Notable Aircrafts" so this article seems a little out of place (or non-conforming if you will).

<dd>Hey took me like 1.5 hrs to upload all the images and also post them to the article. Hey I know the quality is not good and I dunno how to merge images of the same plane as a group so if anyone can help me replace images if you have higher quality versions, and also group the images (I dunno the code to do it sorry), that would be great thanks Nicholas2020 00:21, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yikes, this definitely needs some clean up with the images. I understand the want to catalog all of the planes in this game, BUT we should probably limit it to the fictional (Delphinus, Asteroza, etc) aircraft as one could just as easily head to the F-18's page to get a basic idea of what the HornetADV looks like. Also, I propose that any images taken be from an emulator like <a href="../../../e/p/s/EPSXe_72af.html" title="EPSXe">EPSXe</a> for obvious quality reason. I appreciate the work of the photographer (literally, in this case), but I think we can do better. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 20:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the response. I agree with your comments on cleanup. Do you think we should just split this whole article up and just leave separate articles on the *most notable* aircrafts which I propose the following? (please comment which others you think should be having their own articles!)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>- R-103 Delphinus - XFA-36A Game - XR-900 Geopelia - X-49 Night Raven - UI-4054 Aurora</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I propose splitting things up because this article is really hard for me to complete because:</p>
<p>1) The introduction section is very hard to write without "in-universe" style. 2) If you want to give the article a background on the aircraft companies then it's gonna repeat the stuff in <a href="../../../e/l/e/Ace_Combat_3%7E_Electrosphere_3c44.html" title="Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere">Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere</a> 3) The title (Aircraft of Ace Combat 3) doesn't fit into the category "Notable Aircrafts" 4) If you search for any of the aircraft listed here, it's not going to redirect here. 5) No external references to any aircraft I can find!&#160;:(</p>
<p>As for the quality, yes I totally know how crappy the quality is (it's from a damn TV), as I only have all the aircraft on a PSX, not PC. I'll try to find time and actually try to finish this game all over again on a PC and get all the screenshots.</p>
<p>I have a question though, and I want your help... Do you think I violated any copyright laws from the pics I have posted so far? It's my first time posting pics here and I really don't want any lawyers chasing after me. If I have, then I'll have to delete them... So much trouble for being nice...&#160;:(</p>

<dd>Well, if we take a look at the Ace Combat meta-box, this page is listed under the notable aircraft section which puts it in line with the fictional fighters found in the other games. We could just as easily place a section in the front detailing the major differences found between these "upgraded" aircraft and their real-world counterparts (COFFIN, closed canopy, etc). <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_3_7eae.html" title="Ace Combat 3">Ace Combat 3</a> itself has a listing of aircraft in the game, so I think their inclusion is redundant here even if statistical information is included. As for copyright, I think you're covered under the copyrights applied to the images. As for ePSXe, it would be very simple to use gameshark or other codes via a plugin to that program. I may attempt it tomorrow. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 00:29, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nice! Well I had a bit of a browse on other AC articles and it looks like some pics were directly copied from Namco sites. So at least if anything happens I won't be the first one to be in trouble ^^ Well... I'm still trying to get all the "video and GS plug-ins" as I haven't bothered running emulators before. Hope you can take the screenshots inplace of me. Besides... I'm *really* busy these days, but I'll see what pics I can take if I can ever squeeze of time... (by the way... its pretty hard to get a good shot of a plane in AC3, during play you can't even see the side of an entire plane in one view, unless we settle with boring 3rd person view shots...)
