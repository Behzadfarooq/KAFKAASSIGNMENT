<dd>This is true. But I did change the first paragraph, since it said "much <i>weaker</i>". It ain't that much weaker. And I cleaned up the sentence structure a little, since it looked pretty ridiculous. Quite frankly, a lot of this article looks like the work of two warring sides - one trying to praise it and one trying to trash it. I think this whole article needs a little better flow. --<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightingirish_6a71.html" title="User:Fightingirish">Fightingirish</a> 06:59, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Last night the first paragraph read "much <i>stronger</i>" station. Sounds like someone is trying to turn this into an advertisement rather than a bio. --JDonks 13:09, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oops! Forgot to hit "Save" last night. I rewrote the first paragraph, split it in two, made it read a little better, and changed the "much weaker" description. I think everyone can agree on this rewrite. -As for whoever wrote "much stronger", perhaps it was written by someone who lives closer to the WWRL transmitter. I hear it does come in better in some parts of the area than WLIB, but that could be said about any station.-<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightingirish_6a71.html" title="User:Fightingirish">Fightingirish</a> 13:28, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since Air America is carried in it's entirety on XM satellite radio, is it even important that niche programming like Air America be carried on terrestrial radio at all? Atlanta's WWAA dropped Air America in favor of music programming with little outcry. I enjoy Springer In The Morning. I listened on XM even when it was on WWAA. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeamgoon_1f64.html" title="User:Teamgoon">Teamgoon</a> 00:26, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Profitability</span></h2>
<p>Of course profitability matters to a corporation. But if someone at AAR claimed profitability didn't matter to them that should be added here also with a credible source. I just don't think it's ever been said. --Kirby Morgan 18:51, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't know if we're misunderstanding eachother or what. I moved the profitability section down to a different area and reworded it for POV issues, not removed it outright. I agree - profitability matters and, if there's hand-wringing about it, the article should address it. However, there are ways to do it that can be done without piling on, which is at least how the part I moved and re-worded came across. The Franken bit, if you can find a link that chains the two together, then I won't try to remove it, but anything about his co-host outside of cited profitiability concerns should probably be in his show's article. Let me know what I can do to help out with this, because we both want the info in there, just not the same way, apparently.--<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> 19:17, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The whole section consists of nothing more than opposing sets of trash talk on both sides. Malkin has no idea what the finances of AAR are and it is pretty clear that money can be found to fund it even if it looses $15 mil a year or more. The Franken salary reported in the article is clearly an unsourced guess. I would have thought he could get rather more, he clearly has a stock deal, how much that is worth nobody knows. Almost certainly either zero or a very large figure. Its the same with Stern.--<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 01:16, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Section on Ratings</span></h2>
<p>I believe that the "Ratings" section should be deleted; the information is inaccurate and misleading. Unless someone is willing and able to keep on top of the ratings for all 67 Air America stations -- and more as the number grows -- the section perpetuates misinformation, as the data will always be incomplete and quickly outdated.</p>
<p>Further, citing the New York Radio Guide as a source is too selective, failing to encompass the entire network and, instead, focusing on two AAR stations. Then there's the fact that the "Guide" website relies on Arbitron for its data; Arbitron's data collection methods cast doubt on the validity of its ratings (see <a href="http://www.uga.edu/juro/2003/merck3.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.uga.edu/juro/2003/merck3.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and hit CTRL +F to find "Arbitron Data Limitations").</p>
<p>Finally, several attempts by political detractors of Air America to selectively quote -- and outright misquote -- both Arbitron and Nielsen numbers will no doubt result in many questionable numbers being added to the entry under this section. Better to delete it altogether. Semidi 01:35, 3 August 2005</p>
<dl>
<dd>The ratings section is key to understanding how the network is faring in the marketplace. Using numbers from <a href="http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRRatings/" class="external text" title="http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRRatings/" rel="nofollow">here</a> should take care of any questions in terms of accuracy. I know you dislike Arbitron's systems and see some doubt, but, when dealing with ratings and, thus, ad revenue, that's the industry standard, the standard that people understand, and the accepted way of judging the popularity of a station.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What we should do - and what I will do following posting this - is link the RRR ratings to the bottom of it so people are capable of validating the information on their own and, in the event of a misstatement, people can fix it if necessary. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">Badlydrawnjeff</a> 21:43, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The ratings have been a kind of mixed bag and in some markets they do better than others. To say they have "very low ratings" and offering no support is inappropriate for the lead. The total market has to be looked at in various ways to come up with real numbers before making a claim the reatings are very low or not. They might be, but it has to be sorced. This section needs good objective data. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalicocat_8d97.html" title="User:Calicocat">Calicocat</a> 01:46, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As there is now no mention of "very low" and the section is already sourced, perhaps you can remove the 'factual accuracy' tag. Are you claiming that they did not rank 24th in the New York metro area Arbitron ratings? <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlain_regular_ham_2811.html" title="User:Plain regular ham">plain_regular_ham</a> 12:44, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Me, too. I don't know how well they do in terms of hard numbers, but I know they're relatively successful in at least <i>some</i> markets, while not doing very well in others. How difficult is it to get the actual rating from Arbitron themselves? All I can seem to find is liberals that say they're going great, and conservatives that say they're in the toilet. Like most other things, I have little doubt that the truth is somewhere in the middle. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 15:06, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Too bad there aren't more radical moderates like me. I searched for actual ratings from a source like Arbitron and found nothing. Maybe something will turn up. I'd imagine the media prefer to spin the ratings before we see them, therefore making the raw data poorly advertised. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlain_regular_ham_2811.html" title="User:Plain regular ham">plain_regular_ham</a> 15:58, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like the neutrality factor. As you suggest, the best would be real sources like Arbitron. You have to be a subscriber for some of the professional services... Perhaps we can get some reports by asking Arbitron. I'm looking into that as well as other ways to get some real numbers. Blogs and AAR are both going to using raw numbers in various ways, doom and gloom or marketing pitchs mostly. This, too, can be covered in the article, but the bottom line numbers should be known as best we can determin. Trends will also be significant in time. Since AAR is still new, some of these data is not so easily available. Also, networks typically do private audience research which can guide development of new programs and promotions. Over time, I think more of these questions will be filled out.</dd>

<dd>I think we are headed down a slippery slope if we require raw data eyeball verification for every newspaper citation, and I disagree with the 'factual dispute' tag for that reason. I could ultimately dispute the factuality of anything in a philosophical sense. Note that I entered, "as reported in the New York Sun" which makes the statement true. You can look at the article and it does indeed say that. Whatever the case, though, I will stand down on this issue for a time as long as you can assure that you intend to pursue a source that could be deemed more 'raw'. This is assuming that you are comfortable leaving the tag on in light of the wording of the statement. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlain_regular_ham_2811.html" title="User:Plain regular ham">plain_regular_ham</a> 19:51, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In general, primary sources are preferred to secondary or tertiary sources. While it's true that the New York Sun reported that fact, the author himself is biased, and for that reason I'm uncomfortable with the statement. I honestly think that we should either remove it or replace the disputed tag until we can get some facts that aren't encumbered by partisan stickiness of either flavor. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 19:57, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm less concerned about the ratings as I am about the tone of the second sentence on the revival of the Fairness Doctrine: "equal time regardless of public interest" is not a very accurate rendering of the purpose of the Doctrine. In a section on ratings, this certainly makes it sound like Air America, through the Doctrine, would receive some kind of guarantee of air-time despite its alleged unpopularity - an assertion which doesn't relate to the provisions of the Fairness Doctrine in any reasonable way. Moreover, it's unclear from the description how this would actually benefit Air America, since "equal time" under the Fairness Doctrine presumably implies that their own stations would have to grant equal time to their opponents views. Bottom line: equal time = balance of opinion on controversial issues of public importance, not "radio welfare". – Borborigmus 12:52, 17 June 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the idea might be that popular talk stations would be forced to carry AA programming to balance their more-popular conservative talkers, or something like that. However, as you point out, a re-emergence of the FD would destroy AA itself as an actual network (as opposed to a producer of content), so the sentence in the article still makes no sense. I took it out, as it appears to be little more than a misunderstanding of <a href="http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_latimes-why_the_liberals.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_latimes-why_the_liberals.htm" rel="nofollow">this old article</a>.</dd>

<p>An anonymous user {216.119.139.11} has attempted, several times, to post ratings information gleaned from Byron York, a conservative author and commentator, in an article entitled "Radiogate" on National Review Online. York's writings exhibit a clear rightward tilt, and this article is by no means a neutral source. If the anonymous poster would like to post a raw data link asserting what York is claiming, that may be appropriate. Until then, the York article should not be cited as "proof" of anything but York's opinion.</p>
<p>A quick check of the history page shows a good deal of partisan bluster coming from the same anonymous user's {216.119.139.11} parenthetical comments. According to him, Air America has an "inflated" reputation, and any reversion of his edits receives a shrill "You could not be more wrong" from the Limbaugh School of Discourse.</p>

<dd>Done and done. I personally think that you're too focused on York while ignoring the numbers, but a quick use of the link for Radio and Records that's listed at the end of the ratings section would have verified his statistics.

<dl>
<dd>What an odd thing to say. "Inaccurate" in that Goldberg didn't say it, or that what he said was factually incorrect? He did in fact say it, said it <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/danny-goldberg/right-wing-media-gets-des_b_8029.html" class="external text" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/danny-goldberg/right-wing-media-gets-des_b_8029.html" rel="nofollow">right here in fact</a>--surely you could have discovered this on your own somehow, using the search engine of your choice. Danny Goldberg is the CEO of Air America Radio, so I would expect him to have a point of view in favor of Air America Radio; wouldn't you? If we're to disallow any and all statements of support for the network because statements of support are ipso facto POV, then presumably we'd have to do the same for any and all criticisms on the same grounds, and this would be a much shorter article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What basis do you have for saying that his remarks are factually inaccurate? As the CEO of Air America, he presumably has access to AAR's Arbitron books and has a basis for making his statements about the network's ratings. If you're going to stand up and call him a liar, you're going to have to be able to back it up somehow, which you don't seem to be able to do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It seems clear that the person who added the quotation almost certainly meant to put it right above the Clear Channel header instead of right above it. Easily fixable, yet you chose to lop the quote off entirely. Why? --<a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">PHenry</a> 17:48, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The accuracy of the existence of the quote is not in question. The accuracy of the numbers, however, is not, as detailed within the article already as well as by a quick look at the ratings books. Combine that with the insertion of the quote almost certainly to try and discredit the ratings numbers at the site linked within the article and to try to soften the blow of what was already a NPOV ratings section, I removed it on that account.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you disagree with my synopsis here, that's fine, but I'd suggest finding a way to justify what he has to say if you're looking to insert it as written, or pointing out his error if not. The article is probably much better off without quotes from AAR execs bemoaning any ratings facts on cherry-picking from a right wing smear campaign or whatever. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">Badlydrawnjeff</a> 19:03, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You do not have access to the Arbitron ratings books (or if you do, you certainly haven't shared that information with us). You have linked to summaries that convey much less information than the ratings books do. The summaries provide one number per station per ratings period. They do not break the ratings out by daypart (important, because most AAR stations broadcast other programming at different times during the day), don't provide raw listenership numbers, don't provide demographic information, provide limited longitudinal information, and differ in a number of other substantial ways from the full books. And in fact, what information the summaries do provide tend to support Goldberg's claim about ratings growth in most markets, so what's your point?</dd>

<dd>The CEO of Air America Radio, who probably spends several hours a day looking at the full Arbitron books, made three assertions of fact in the exerpted quotation: that ratings are up at most AAR stations, that the Spring 2005 book shows AAR affiliates with 3 million weekly listeners who listen for several hours a week on average, and that this represents a 300% nationwide increase from the Spring 2004 book. If you think you can refute any of these assertions, by all means do so, but surely Goldberg is enough of an authority to warrant a quotation on the matter. --<a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">PHenry</a> 19:36, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I'm not sure that a gushing commentary combined with a partisan attack warrants inclusion in an article we're trying to keep as NPOV as possible. "At the vast majority of our affiliates, Air America ratings are up" is patently false. Three million extra people is definitely a comment with omission, as they've added many stations. To accuse anyone, "right wing bloggers" or anyone else, of "cherry picking isolated pieces of ratings" when discussing the ratings situation is inherently POV. If we can't even the quote out with the facts, then the quote should be removed due to its obvious nature. By the way, the ratings numbers can be found <a href="http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRRatings/" class="external text" title="http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRRatings/" rel="nofollow">here</a> if you don't want to take anyone's word for it.

<dd>The link actually does nothing of the sort. It shows that AAR's ratings are not up in most markets, or even many, and certainly not a "vast majority," it shows WHY AAR has added X listeners (not because of popularity but because they're expanding), and the quote is STILL POV partisan crap. If you want the quote there, you're going to have to justify why it belongs and how it's NPOV and accurate as opposed to just dismissing those of us who are actually pointing out where he's wrong.--<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">Badlydrawnjeff</a> 02:08, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apparently you intend to hold on to this falsehood until it's ripped from your fingers, so I went and crunched the numbers for every single AAR station in the country. Let's take a look, shall we?</p>
<p>The first and, to my mind, the most important thing to note here is that ratings data for spring 2004, the period that Danny Goldberg specifically referenced in his HuffPo post, are not available at <a href="http://www.radioandrecords.com" class="external text" title="http://www.radioandrecords.com" rel="nofollow">radioandrecords.com</a> for most markets. Two-thirds of the stations for which I was able to find data only show ratings numbers as far back as last fall. Two thirds! That's a lot! What could possibly have made you think that the data on this site were adequate to allow you to mount a believable challenge to Goldberg's statement? This alone should be enough to discredit anything you have to say on the matter, but I'm a pretty tolerant guy and I'm in a good mood today, so I did your work for you and totted up the numbers anyway.</p>
<p>In all cases, gains and losses are listed ending with the spring 2005 ratings period, which Goldberg also directly and specifically mentions (unsurprising, as the summer 2005 Arbitron books won't be released until late October and early November). For markets for which spring 2004 data is available, gains and losses are listed from that period; for other markets, gains and losses are listed from fall 2004, the earliest period for which data is available. (Even that's not really kosher, because a lot of these stations weren't AAR affiliates for the entire year... but, I guess you go to war with the ratings data you have, not the ratings data you might want or wish to have at a later time.) I don't report ratings in three cases: when there was no data available, either for the market or for the station; when the station's format is listed as something other than "Talk" or "News/Talk," indicating that the format changed too recently for the data to be meaningful; and when a 0.0 rating was reporting for the earliest available time period, indicating that the station didn't exist with its current call letters at the time. Ready? Here we go!</p>

<p><font size="1">*AAR is simulcast on two stations in Boston; between F'04 and Sp'05 the strong-signal station gained more than the weak-signal station lost, making for a net ratings gain in Boston.</font></p>
<p>We can therefore see that, of the 31 stations for which we are able to get semi-meaningful data, 18 showed a net gain between the earliest available period and spring 2005, only 11 showed a net loss, and 2 showed no net change. So when you said that "AAR's ratings are not up in most markets, or even many," that was wrong! Why would you say it, if it was wrong? Why would you be wrong about something that could be checked so easily? Was that a deliberate choice you made, or did you just not bother to look at the data you were selling? Of the 11 stations for which data was available dating back to spring 2004, 7 showed net gains, only <b>2</b> showed net losses, with 2 showing no net change. That seems like a pretty vast majority to me; wouldn't you agree?</p>
<p>So if you intend to keep openly accusing Danny Goldberg of fabricating ratings data, you're going to have to find a different data source than the one you've been throwing at us again and again, as it actually tends to support him rather than you. Wait--before you go, here are <a href="http://www.airamericaradio.com/node/657" class="external text" title="http://www.airamericaradio.com/node/657" rel="nofollow">some other numbers</a> you may wish to accuse AAR of making up, although before you try you should bear in mind that the Arbitron books from which these numbers are putatively drawn get mailed out to radio stations across the country, many of which are right-wing talk stations that could easily expose any fabrication going on here, if indeed you are correct. Good luck. --<a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">PHenry</a> 06:45, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see you're actually suffering from the same cherry-picking Goldberg accuses right wing bloggers of. I don't know why I'm bothering at this point, as it seems like you have CalicoCat ready to revert regardless of what's said here, but whatever.</dd>
<dd>For starters, when a station doesn't have any data, it means they dropped OFF the ratings book because the ratings were so low. It's fascinating that you, for instance, fail to list Philadelphia's WHAT, which has dropped off the ratings books entirely after at one point showing a steady decline, being as low as 0.5 in the June books. I wouldn't have expected you to add a place like Providence, who <a href="http://www.projo.com/tv/content/projo_20050910_peop10.ccd123c.html" class="external text" title="http://www.projo.com/tv/content/projo_20050910_peop10.ccd123c.html" rel="nofollow">dropped AAR completely</a> due to ratings, either. Also fascinating that you say Akron's listed as "sports." Is it because the one that's listed "sports" isn't AAR affiliate WARF, but in fact the one that's moved back to the 1.2 peak from the early-summer 1.0 WKNR? Not a problem, you'd be incorrect whether you list it or not, and that's fine. KOKE in Austin is listed as "mexican?" Right, because it was added <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2005-03-25/pols_feature.html" class="external text" title="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2005-03-25/pols_feature.html" rel="nofollow">earlier this spring</a>. Yes, 0.7 in the latest books is certainly a welcome addition of listeners, but given that it's dropped from its debut at 1.20, it's not shocking it didn't listed here. You could have listed KIST in Santa Barbara without much protest, even though it's still listed at "alternative," as they've shown no change from their numbers a year ago (2.1-&gt;1.9-&gt;2.1)Oh, and Boston? WXKS is actually way off on your chart, peaking at 0.6 and dropping to 0.5 in the second part of spring, nowhere near the 4.9-5.2 you listed. You're also - and, in your defense, I don't have the information handy, either - not taking into effect the channels they've added over the last year that may not have a years worth of ratings to go by, which may be why we lack information. It's easy to say you've added millions of listeners when you've entered markets with 20 million potential listeners that weren't availiable to you, such as KOKE from above.</dd>
<dd>Now, I'm not going to bust my hump to fact check each and every one of your listings here, especially when you've got people who are willing to ignore the stuff here, but it's obvious your figures are less than trustworthy at this point. Even assuming each of your ratings table is 100% correct (which we know it certainly is not), it does not change the NPOV, partisan nature of the quote that ends up lying by omission (with the "more than triple the amount" commentary in the quote), and it certainly doesn't belong here. I'm fighting a losing battle given the way people will continue to add the quote without even considering what's here, but please quit being smug and start thinking about keeping the article NPOV instead of trying to defend poor statements with incorrect data. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">Badlydrawnjeff</a> 13:46, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, where to begin, where to begin? Your assertion that "when a station doesn't have any data, it means they dropped OFF the ratings book because the ratings were so low." didn't sound right to me, so I went back and did more research on those stations. Here's what I found:

<dd>So when you said that "when a station doesn't have any data, it means they dropped OFF the ratings book because the ratings were so low," that was a lie! Whoever told you that lied to you! Doesn't that make you angry? Man, I'd be <i>pissed off</i> if someone hung me out to dry like that! I did manage to add four new data points, after a fashion, and I thank you for that--but that only gives us two additional losses, one gain, and one steady - not nearly enough to make a dent in Goldberg's remarks.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also went back and looked at the stations that were listed with the wrong format or for which the earliest listed rating was 0.0. Here's what I found:</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Anchorage, AK (KUDO), 0.0 in Sp'04: joined AAR network on May 5, 2004; up from 0.7 in F'04 to 1.4 in Sp'05 (+100%)</li>
<li>Ann Arbor, MI (WLBY), listed as "sports": joined AAR network on August 24, 2004; up from 0.7 in F'04 to 0.9 in Sp'05 (+29%)</li>
<li>Austin, TX (KOKE), listed as "Spanish": joined AAR network on March 14, 2005</li>
<li>Baton Rouge, LA (listed as "Country": joined AAR network on July 12, 2005</li>
<li>Chicago (WCPT), 0.0 in F'04: call letters changed from WAIT on May 3, 2005; became AAR affiliate on May 5</li>
<li>Dallas/Ft. Worth (KXEB), 0.0 in F'04: joined AAR network on March 21, 2005</li>
<li>Detroit (WDTW), listed as "classic rock": joined AAR network on January 20, 2005; down from 2.7 in <i>winter</i> 2005 to 2.4 in Sp'05 (-11%)</li>
<li>Duluth, MN (KQDS), listed as "rock": joined AAR network on September 6, 2005</li>
<li>Eugene, OR (KOPT), listed as "adult standards": joined AAR network on November 10, 2004, about halfway through Arbitron's F'04 ratings period, so a comparison between F'04 and Sp'05 would not be particularly meaningful (though listenership did double during that time, if you must know)</li>
<li>Fresno, CA (KFPT), listed as "regional Mexican": joined AAR network on July 4, 2005</li>
<li>Honolulu (KUMU), listed as "adult contemporary": joined AAR network in June, 2004; down from 5.9 in F'04 to 4.3 in Sp'05 (-27%)</li>
<li>Minneapolis/St. Paul (KTNF), 0.0 in F'04: call letters changed from KSNB on November 16, 2004; became AAR affiliate on October 1, 2004; up from 0.9 in <i>winter</i> '05 to 1.0 in Sp'05 (+11%)</li>
<li>San Luis Obispo, CA (KYNS), 0.0 in Sp'04: joined the AAR network in April 2004; down from 3.4 in F'04 to 1.3 in Sp'05 (-62%)</li>

<dd>So if we add these stations into the equation, we get two more gains and two more losses--hardly the turnaround you were hoping for, I'm sure. One question, though--why are you worried <i>now</i> all of a sudden about "channels they've added over the last year that may not have a years worth of ratings to go by"? You certainly weren't this worried about the integrity of your vaunted data set when you were the one pushing it. Now that the truth has come out, all of a sudden, you're making the same argument I made last night. You have a decision to make: is this data set valid enough to impeach Goldberg's statement, or isn't it? If it isn't, as I said earlier, I suggest you look for another one.</dd>

<dd>Your opinions on what I'm trying to accomplish notwithstanding, I'm not at all convinced anyone's "lying" to me about them. We obviously have different ideas about what the data is telling us (I, for one, wasn't trying to start a turnaround, but point out that the quote is bad for the entry), but seeing as we've reached a useful agreement, I see no need to clog up this talk page any more, but I do welcome further discussion of it elsewhere if you feel the need. My goal was to keep the poor quote out, yours was to get the relevant information in, and I think we've reached a good compromise on it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">Badlydrawnjeff</a> 18:57, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In Arbitron's Spring 2005 ratings book, Air America affiliates showed significant percentage gains in a number of large markets, including Los Angeles, Denver, Washington, and Phoenix, though ratings in most markets continued to lag behind those of more established talk stations. The cumulative listening audience of Air America affiliate stations showed an increase from 1.3 million persons age 12 and up in fall 2004 to 3.1 million in spring 2005, much of which was due to listeners gained when the network added new stations around the country during that time. <a href="http://www.airamericaradio.com/node/657" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.airamericaradio.com/node/657" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<p>Arbitron only releases ratings for overall totals (ages 12+) to the general public. Arbitron does provide very detailed ratings information that includes demographic breakdowns by gender and age group, as well as breakdowns by time of day and by counties in the survey area. Because Arbitron is a business, and guards their information heavily, the only ratings often released to media outlets (such as Radio and Records and AllAccess) are the overall. The demographic breakdowns are considered to be the most valuable to stations, since it helps their sales reps when dealing with clients and potential advertisers who want to reach only a certain group. Overall (12+) ratings are solely for simple bragging rights. And many formats (sports talk is a very good example) tend not to do notably well in overall ratings, but they can be very lucrative because they target a very exact demographic. It is often said that <a href="../../../w/f/a/WFAN_d25c.html" title="WFAN">WFAN</a> in New York brings in more revenue than any other station in the country. WFAN's overall ratings are mediocre at best, but because they do so well in their targeted male demographic, advertisers who want to target that particular group and nobody else can do that with WFAN. I've seen some demographic and daypart breakdowns (some of that information is released by Arbitron selectively or Arbitron subscribers) that show AAR to be doing better than overall ratings would reflect. Perhaps this should be reflected somewhere in the article, if possible. --<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightingirish_6a71.html" title="User:Fightingirish">Fightingirish</a> 14:25, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some discussion of who's sponsoring ads is important. First it has to do wtih building the overall financial projections and market share data the article is lacking. Secondly, there are some ads you don't hear on other networks and those are worthy of mention being unique to AAR. It might be that the sections on sponsors and ratings should be merged. We don't have to list its entire broadcast log, no, but discussion of these things seems well placed. AAR's overall social message is part of its media economics strategy. Sink or swim the question of sponsorship and ratings is significant from the business stand point.

<p>Thank you! I think there have been some good edits. I put a lot of time into this and my view is to be informative. I like AAR, but at the same time I can be objective and neutral about it. So, I learn more about something I'm interested in. We've had some good, cooperative edits with few idological attackers... I look forward to see the article expand to continue offering a sound and valid entry for the project.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AAR journalism ethics</span></h2>
<p>I'm curious about the statement that all programs are rooted in the basic principals of ethical jounralism. The shows have an obvious bias (mentioned in the intro of the article) which contradicts the principles of "objectivity" and "impartiality." The hosts don't seem to intend to be objective but rather to provide an interpreation to the news and current events of the day. Any sense of why the statement is included in the section? <a href="../../../c/u/l/User%7ECultofpj_fe9f.html" title="User:Cultofpj">Cultofpj</a> 20:28, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the public affairs shows are based mostly on opinion, the hosts tend to clearly state when they're reading directly from a news source. I think that satisfies "unequivocal separation between news and opinion" as listed in the article on <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism_ethics_and_standards.html" title="Journalism ethics and standards">ethical journalism</a>. If anyone disagrees, though, we can change the wording of that sentence to "All programs, however, are rooted in <i>many of</i> the basic principles of ethical journalism." —<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairlunchdinner_d471.html" title="User:Chairlunchdinner">Chairlunchdinner</a> 05:20, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't see how this is encyclopedic anyway, even if qualified as Chairlunchdinner suggests. Are we saying that AAR hosts don't deliberately lie about established facts? or that they don't take payments from government entities to promote certain positions? I don't think such negatives are worth inclusion. We might as well be mentioning that they don't murder cats. Instead of this vague reference to "ethical journalism", I suggest we delete the sentence and substitute, at the end of the paragraph: "Although Air America Radio has a definite point of view, the hosts distinguish news sources from opinion." Would that be accurate?

<dd>If I were to do as you suggest, I would probably agree with the opinion that AAR is ethical journalism. So what? It would still be an opinion. I'm trying to figure out what encyclopedic content is being conveyed by this sentence. Alternatively, we could go with the opinion if it's attributed to someone notable. As it is, it just strikes me as saying, "We at Wikipedia have reviewed the assertions in AAR's broadcasts and found them to be correct and well supported" -- which would obviously be improper. On the other hand, we shouldn't unjustly impugn AAR, and I'm concerned that <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairlunchdinner_d471.html" title="User:Chairlunchdinner">Chairlunchdinner</a>'s suggested language would do that. To say that AAR complies with many of the basic principles of ethical journalism could be read as an insinuation that in some respects the network is unethical. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 10:47, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Speaking to the general question. First, lets look at the various genres of <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism.html" title="Journalism">journalism</a> as mentioned in <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism_ethics_and_standards.html" title="Journalism ethics and standards">journalism ethics and standards</a>. It would be accurate to say there's a difference between the AAR News and the Public Affairs approaches to journalism standards, that point is made in the article. The news delivers a standard report much like one would hear on any station, however, AAR does put some emphasis on <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor.html" title="Labor">labor</a> news, which other networks give almost zero coverage too; that last point is made in the article but can be expanded further. As far as the Public Affairs shows, they are more in the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">genre</a> of <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advocacy_journalism.html" title="Advocacy journalism">advocacy journalism</a> and editorial and opinion pieces. However, even in those, AAR does hold to certain of the cental canons of ethical journalism. AAR is perhaps even inventing a new a new kind of journalism which mixes comedy with factual reporting, as in Frankin's "kidding on the square." <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalicocat_8d97.html" title="User:Calicocat">Calicocat</a> 12:02, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see how adherence to ethics could ever be called "an objective fact", because opinions about ethics differ. Furthermore, even aside from the absence of a source for the statement now, I don't see what kind of source could possibly be cited to establish this point. If some journalism school conducted an inquiry to learn more about AAR's new kind of journalism, and issued a report saying it wasn't objective but was ethical, we could mention that report and attribute the conclusion to the source. On the other hand, if you're referring to sources provided by AAR for its assertions, that would make sense. We could then convey some factual information about AAR's sourcing of its stories. In its vague current form, it still seems to me to be not only opinion, but gratuitous, as if an article about a professional athlete were to say that he wasn't violently abusive toward women. Is there some specific allegation of <i>un</i>ethical conduct that should be mentioned? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 17:45, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Rather than ask questions, do some research. It's all in the archives of the shows. Listen to them and you'll hear it, then, you can include some of those quotes with dates and so on. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalicocat_8d97.html" title="User:Calicocat">Calicocat</a> 15:36, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The main question I'm asking is to try to understand what's meant by the queried sentence. No amount of research in AAR archives will answer that question. The most obvious meanings for the sentence would render it opinion, and unencyclopedic unless attributed. If I examined every single show they've ever broadcast and did follow-up research on every cited source, and came to the opinion that each assertion made on air was properly substantiated, that would still be just my opinion, and I'm not a notable person whose opinion deserves to be reported. I'm rewording the passage to report the objective facts that the hosts, along with giving their own opinions, state facts and give sources to back up the factual assertions they make. I don't think we need to give specific examples unless there was a particular controversy where AAR was challenged on its facts, in which case we could mention the dispute and report on AAR's documenting of its sources in response. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 16:43, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_11.html" title="July 11">July 11th</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, an agreement made between the ownership and management of Air America Radio and that of <a href="../../../x/m/_/XM_Satellite_Radio_9ff5.html" title="XM Satellite Radio">XM Satellite Radio</a> caused AAR to cease broadcast on <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirius_Satellite_Radio_4c94.html" title="Sirius Satellite Radio">Sirius</a>. This became quite a polarizing development among the listening community, particularly those who purchased the Sirius service on the understanding that AAR would remain accessible to them. Furthermore, this has become an issue of contention that has caused many AAR personalities, most notably <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janeane_Garofalo_36d8.html" title="Janeane Garofalo">Janeane Garofalo</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Seder_d90e.html" title="Sam Seder">Sam Seder</a> of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Majority_Report_f271.html" title="The Majority Report">The Majority Report</a>, to editorialize and voice disdain on the air regarding this decision.</p>
<p>I place the above paragraph here instead of in the actual article, because I'd like to hear other contributors' opinions regarding the validity of this information in the article, and if it is accepted, which section of the article might be most ideal for this information. I also am shamefully aware the above paragraph may need cleaning up prior to inclusion. So any input is appreciated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it might be useful or at least interesting to point out that some personalities occasionally editorialize negatively about the advertising for the station, particularly the inane lack of quality of the radio spots, though not particularly the quality of the goods or services in question themselves. Garofalo particularly finds most of the commercials grating, and has made statements about such live on the air. This could be construed as 'biting the hand that feeds.' Again, I believe this should be included somehow in the article but am open to suggestions on how to do it properly. Or if maybe it's already in there somewhere and I missed it..?</p>

<dd>Well, of course, you are attempting to "keep Spitzer out of it." You are also attempting to cover-up for the folks at AAR. AAR received the funds. They are a part of the scandal. Therefore, this article about AAR and the article about Franken and the article about Garafolo and all of the rest of AAR, who benefited from the illicit, illegal transfer of federal funds, that was set aside for the elderly and children to AAR, to get AAR on the air. The hypocrisy of AAR is amazing. You are attempting to keep Spitz out because you censored the AAR scandal in the Franken article and the Garafolo articles. Franken and Garafolo are beneficiaries of the illegal, scammed funds.--<a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeetoowah_9fe0.html" title="User:Keetoowah">Keetoowah</a> 03:08, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I removed the text from the Franken and Garofalo pages because I think it is inappropriate to copy large chunks of text verbatim from this page to those pages. That's why we have links between pages, isn't it? Also, I am not at all trying to cover-up for AAR. But it's important to understand the difference between the original owners, Progress Media, and the current owners, Piquant LLC. The newspaper accounts indicate that Piquant did not receive those funds, nor, apparently, did they assume the liabilities incurred by Progress Media, according to their press release. The investigations have only just begun, so I think it is premature to leap to the kind of conclusions you seem to be making.

<dd>I agree. I don't think you are editing with a neutral viewpoint. Your post sounds like you are Al Franken and AAR's attorney.

I'm not Franken's lawyer, or any kind of lawyer, but I have sold a business before. When I did, I sold the assets, not the liabilities, which is a very common way of selling a business. If I had procured an illegal loan while I owned the business, the people that bought it would not have been found guilty of the crime, I would have. You see this as a "technicality" but it is the essence of the case. Air America Radio is a set of assets which Progress Media sold or transferred to Piquant LLC. Assuming the transaction was an asset sale (it seems to be) it is not reasonable to hold the management of Piquant liable for the alleged criminal activities of Progress Media UNLESS there is more to this case we don't know about that would implicate them as well. But we simply don't know much yet. Therefore, I think it is appropriate to withhold judgement and just report verifiable facts right now. THAT is what NPOV is, I think. But ultimately, what is included in the wikipedia comes not from me, but from the collective consensus of all the maintainers, as you should know very well by now. --<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeronique_1654.html" title="User:Veronique">Veronique</a> 19:46, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Wrong. First of all, it does not matter from a non-legal point of view whether it was PM or P-LLC that took the money illegally. The point is that Franken, for example, worked there in both situations and he was paid by both owners of AAR. So, we need to know if Franken was on the take or not. Also, No, the difference of which owner stole the money is NOT the essence of the case. In either case AAR stole the money. In your bias, you want to MAKE that the essence of the case because it protects and defends AAR, and by extension Franken, et al from negative fallout, but that is not the issue. The issue is: What did Franken know and when did he know it? Also, the issue is: When did the money come into the AAR bank account and when did Franken get paid? These are the questions that you are trying, in your bias, attempting to avoid--to shield AAR, Franken, et al from negative publicity and damage. And that is NOT the point of Wikipedia or having a neutral POV. You obviously need work there.------<a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeetoowah_9fe0.html" title="User:Keetoowah">Keetoowah</a> 23:01, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's pretty clear that Piquant recognizes the potential PR damage to the AAR brand by having their name dragged through the mud. That's surely why they have agreed to replace the funds that Gloria Wise transferred to Progress Media even though they are apparently not legally obliged to. All that is mentioned in my last edit of the Controversy section. So I don't know where you get this idea I am shielding AAR. I am honestly trying to strike a balance between those that want the matter dropped entirely and those who want to leap to conclusions based on early reports in a couple of newspapers. It's your choice to believe otherwise, but right now, I'm stepping back from this to let the wikipedia consensus decide. --<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeronique_1654.html" title="User:Veronique">Veronique</a> 00:26, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AAR statment re Gloria Wise</span></h2>
<p><b>Statement from Air America Radio</b> Statement: If the allegations of mismanagement and corruption at Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Club are true, it is absolutely disgraceful.</p>
<p>As reported in the Wall Street Journal and the HBO Documentary, Left of the Dial‚ the company that <b>the Gloria Wise Boys &amp; Girls Club officials gave money to, Progress Media, has been defunct since May 2004. That company was run at the time by Evan Cohen who has not had any involvement in Air America Radio since May 2004.</b>(emphasis added)</p>
<p><b>The current owners of Air America Radio have no obligation to Progress Media's business activities.</b>(emphasis added) We are very disturbed that Air America Radio's good name could be associated with a reduction in services for young people, which is why we agreed months ago to fully compensate the Gloria Wise Boys &amp; Girls Club as a result of this transaction.</p>
<p>We at Air America Radio strongly believe in the mission of Boys and Girls Clubs to provide a safe and nurturing place for young people to learn and grow. As a result, we recently allowed the same club, Gloria Wise Boys &amp; Girls Club, to use our name in a fundraising effort for a summer camp for children in their community.</p>
<p>The funding for Camp Air America was raised and collected entirely by the Gloria Wise Boys &amp; Girls Club, and Air America promoted the camp on air and urged support for it. A link on our web site sent those interested in contributing to the camp to the Gloria Wise web site. Regrettably, the camp did not survive the closure of the Gloria Wise organization. <b>We have offered any individuals who contributed to the camp as a result of Air America's promotion the option of a refund paid for by Air America Radio and the Club offered the alternative option of having their donation redirected to Kip's Bay Boys and Girls Club.</b> (emphasis added)</p>

<p>The non neutral POV of top article. I observe that the top AAR introduction does not make sense. Isn't the fucntion to introduce AAR in one quick paragraph instead of describing day today AAR operation? (eg. AAR embroil in lawsuit, or etc etc. Then why not the fact Janeane is no in the show for one month long because she is doing a movie shoot? That has FAR more implication to AAR show quality.)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">So called "funding controvery" right-wing blogger 'fake news' whine festival</span></h2>
<p>This entire so-called "funding controvery" can be summed up in two words: smear campaign. Nothing more than that. The right-wing whiners are so worried about the growing popularity of AAR that they are now inventing publications that do not exist and making false and misleading accusations against AAR. It's really all very transparent.</p>

Now that I've seen your dispute tags, I'm removing them. There's no disputing that Bronx News reported this, as the link clearly shows and as it is cross-referenced throughout the section. I reworded the illegal section, but removed the tag because it's right within the article that such a transaction would be illegal. It happened, there's nothing in those areas to dispute at the moment. Please explain what you're disputing, why you're <b>factually</b> disputing it, and some sourcing besides your "fake news primer" that would indicate that this is all false, given the media attention thus far. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">Badlydrawnjeff</a> 14:15, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

User Keetoowah has now made five attempts to insert the unsourced text "The money spent by Air America Radio was supposed to be spent on care for the elderly and children." After the first attempt, I incorporated the part about GWB&amp;GC providing services for children and seniors - which is true and verifiable - along with a link to the organization's website. The truth of the rest of the sentence is not yet known and has not been reported in the New York Post, as Keetoowah has repeatedly tried to claim. Presumably the DOI and NY State Attorney General investigations will determine whether the money was spent by Progress Media on Air America operations or not. That's certainly not the only thing that could have happened to the money. At this point, as far as I can tell, nobody knows what happened to the money - not the press, Piquant LLC, Gloria Wise, Al Franken, Michelle Malkin or anyone editing the wikipedia. If you do know, please tell us so we can include it in the section, but if it is unsourced or misattributed speculation, I don't believe it belongs yet. --<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeronique_1654.html" title="User:Veronique">Veronique</a> 06:09, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Veronique and Calicocat: It is now clear that neither one of you knows what you are talking about. Dear Calicocat, you have stated that the whole thing is just a "scam" created by the right-wing. If that is true then where is the money??? Why hasn't Franken paid it back like he said he would???? Dear Veronique: You edited out my completely true and factual statement yesterday that not only can Evan Cohen be sued and but the new owners can also be sued for . And that is exactly what happened yesterday. So you were wrong. You like to pretend that you are right but you were wrong. Piquant LLC, the group that you have been attempting to paint as out of the scandal, was sued yesterday. <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/18840" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nysun.com/article/18840" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The lawsuit states that the transfer of assets from Progress Media to Piquant LLC was intended to rip-off creditors--a "sham" transaction--and the funny part is that Franken stated as such on the air.-----<a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeetoowah_9fe0.html" title="User:Keetoowah">Keetoowah</a> 11:50, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never said that Piquant could not be sued. I said the critic in the blog link you provided made no mention of another party being at risk of a lawsuit. The link did not support your broader statement. I don't think you read these articles carefully enough. For example, you said just now that Piquant was sued yesterday, but the Sun article you just posted says the suit was filed in May. I think it's important that the wikipedia be precise. As for Franken's on-air admission of the intent of the asset transfer, do you have a source for that? I would like to see it, too.

This wikipedia article gives the impression that the Multicultural Radio dispute had been settled in April. But the Sun article seems to indicate otherwise. I hope we can figure out what the true state of affairs is.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gloria Wise Loan Case</span></h2>
<p>This Gloria Wise Loan Case section needs to be rewritten for readability. Also the size of this section is becoming out of proportion with the rest of the page. The date-by-date reporting from NY Post and NY Sun is too much. I believe we have to summarize or push it out to a separate page.</p>
<p>I'm replacing the sentence "...Air America Radio has agreed by contract..." sourced to <a href="http://www.radaronline.com/web-only/media/2005/09/found-in-america.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.radaronline.com/web-only/media/2005/09/found-in-america.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. There is no mention of any such contract to repay the loan at this source. If there is such a contract or agreement then the page needs a source to it. If it is the settlement agreement which is being portrayed as a contract to repay the loan, then that it not accurate. The settlement agreement lists the funds loaned by Gloria Wise to Progress Media as transferred liabilities. The settlement agreement does not include any terms of the loan or any details about repayment. I will be replacing it with an on-air statement from Franken vis a vis moral obligation versus legal. But I would like a primary source back to transcript. Anybody?</p>
<p>Presently, I'm removing the reference to Michelle Malkin's blog concerning the paragraph on the NY Post and NY Sun's reports for September 8. It is a secondary source which simply refers back to the two primary sources.</p>
<p>Also, there is no primary source for the DOI comments other than an unreferenced insert in Malkin's blog. I've checked the NY DOI web site and I couldn't find these comments. These comments should be removed until a reference to the primary source is found.</p>

<dd>However, I agree that the section is getting too long. It could be shortened. The stuff at the beginning could be cut down because much of that was Air America and Piquant early on pretending that there was no problem or if there was a problem then it was all Cohen's fault. It is more than clear that Piquant and Air America Radio's managment knew about this loan for months ahead of when they claimed that they knew about it Also, Al Franken knew about this loan for months of ahead of his sanctimonous speech on the air that Cohen was a "crook" and that Franken just learned about the loan. He did not expect that Malkin would get ahold of the signed document. However, whatever changes that you make will not include a removable of the Malkin information because she is the primary source for that information and if you remove it then you are merely attempting to cover up the Franken signature.

<p>Keetoowah, yeah, I thought you might say that. Malkin is NOT the primary source of the extract from the DOI press release. The NY DOI is. To suggest otherwise is absurd. I revisited the NY DOI web site and the relevant press release is now there. I will be replacing the Malkin link with a link to the primary source, ie the press release on the NY DOI web site.</p>
<p>In addition, I am not attempting to cover up the fact that Franken signed the settlement agreement. To suggest this ignores the edits I have been making. There are multiple instances on the page now to the primary source: the settlement agreement which includes Franken's signature.</p>
<p>On the size issue, there are a number of ways forward: either the section gets summarized, moved to another page, possibly the content about the MRBI claims gets moved to another section (perhaps the Startup Difficulties section).</p>
<p>I am attempting to maintain a NPOV on this issue by including quotes and references from primary sources. I have read many of your contributions to this page as well as your discussion comments above. It is clear from the words you use above ("pretending", "sanctimonous" (sic), "cover up") that you do not have a NPOV on this issue. Also, Malkin may or may not be a syndicated writer (don't know, don't care). However it is also clear from her editorializing that she does not have a NPOV on this issue either. I urge you to put away judgements and follow Wikipedia's NPOV policies. --192.233.92.200 19:17, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Finally, please discuss the content of this page in a civil non-hostile manner without accusations or insinuations so we can avoid disputes and/or an edit war. Again, review the page on NPOV for notes on how discussions and debates on content ought to be conducted. Frankly, I'm not much interested in what you believe to be attempts to "cover up for AAR" in the past. However, I am interested in ensuring that this article conforms precisely to NPOV.--<a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmagnay_869d.html" title="User:Pmagnay">Pmagnay</a> 15:33, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Please refer to <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_terms_687f.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms">Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms</a>. I am changing "Goldberg claims..." sentence to simply 'Goldberg stated that Franken's role in the agreement "was simply to waive his own claims in order to facilitate the transaction and allow the network to survive under new ownership."'</p>
<p>More generally, the whole page needs a full review and a removal/replacement of all such weasel terms. In addition, I know there is some blogospheric traffic on this subject at the moment that is pushing a lot of claims and accusations and counter-claims. I would like everyone to work together to ensure this page follows a NPOV. --<a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmagnay_869d.html" title="User:Pmagnay">Pmagnay</a> 16:47, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm changing the following sentence in the Startup Difficulties section: "In July 2005, AAR was unable to pay its payroll on time and many AAR staffers were worried that AAR was, once again, strapped for money." The date is not precise giving the impression that the problems may have been all through the month of July rather than a delay of a few days. And the alleged "worries" of AAR staffers cannot be confirmed. The source that is referenced (Brian Maloney) uses unethical methods such as unnamed/unidentified sources with phrases such as "...insiders think..." and "...according to sources..." to support a claim that "AAR staffers were worried that AAR was, once again, strapped for money". This claim cannot be confirmed and will be removed. --<a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmagnay_869d.html" title="User:Pmagnay">Pmagnay</a> 17:25, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That it has its own article is great, but it really merits a brief mention in 'Difficulties' or 'Controversies'. I've written a paragraph that I believe is quite NPOV; I note that it was the parent companies of AAR that were involved (and further note Evan Cohen). I note AAR's characterization of it as disgraceful, and I quote Al Franken, not to entangle him with the issue, but because his views were widely reported at the time, and I also believe he did characterize and summarize the issue very nicely. (A 'crook' 'robbed Peter to pay Paul'). If you've issues with what I wrote, I would ask that you discuss them here either before or in conjunction with any edits of what I wrote.

The given source which is only analysis/opinion piece doesn't support these assertions.</p>

<p>The above paragraph seems odd to me. Surely it's just a matter of basic fact checking to see what political ideology the station espouses. I listen to Air America, and, as far as I can tell, it basically represents the left wing of the Democratic Party (with perhaps some minor sympathy for the Green position). I have never heard ANY socialist or anarchist positions being discussed on this station. I mean, is <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> (an anarchist) ever interviewed on Air America? No! Is <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tariq_Ali_9b97.html" title="Tariq Ali">Tariq Ali</a> (a Trotskyist) ever interviewed on Air America? No! And as far as the hosts and on-air personalities go: does anyone doubt that Al Franken is a shill for the Democrats, same with Randi Rhodes, Ed Shultz, ect, ect.. I would be interested in seeing what evidence (such as a guest list or transcripts) could be provided to demonstrate that Air America is so left-wing. Oh, don't get me wrong. Air America is "left-wing", but its leftness stays well within the bounds of mainstream capitalist ideology.

I'm not sure what "mainstream capitalist ideology is"!

<dd>Well, I was the one who removed the O'Reilly bit, so I'll try to explain myself. We need to try and remain <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> here at Wikipedia. So we can't really take shots at people. Adding the thing about O'Reilly is nothing more than a cheap shot at the dude, and as Wikipedia is not a <i>mouthpiece for the Democratic Party's slime attacks</i>, it was removed. Secondly, this article is not about O'Reilly. If you think he is a hypocrite, you should probably take it to his article to discuss there. I hope I have explained myself. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask.

<dd>Uh, no, actually, you haven't explained yourself in the slightest bit. You mention Bill O'Reilly in this piece criticizing Air America and questioning whether it is profitable because the network offers premiums to its visitors. And yet you remove my edit that correctly points out that O'Reilly ALSO heavily promotes paid premiums to his own site's visitors. In others words, by your standards of "NPOV," it's OK to slime Air America and question its profitability---but it's not OK to mention the opposing POV (that when Air America offers premiums, it's simply doing what all the right-wing sites do, from O'Reilly to Limbaugh). The fact is, despite what you say, I'm NOT taking a "cheap shot" at O'Reilly---the fact is O'Reilly himself is taking a cheap--and hypocritical---shot at Air America. I'm disappointed that my attempt to balance this issue was censored by Wikipedia. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 68.187.35.134 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.187.35.134.html" title="User talk:68.187.35.134">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.187.35.134_ea63.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.187.35.134">contribs</a>) .</small>

<dd>Okay, let me try and explain better then. The question at hand is AAR's profitability. The article does not say that it isn't profitable because it offers paid membership to premium features. The question of AAR's profitability has nothing to do with O'Reilly's website. It isn't germane to the article. Calling O'Reilly a hypocrite has nothing to do with the article. If you want to do that, go to <i>his</i> article. And your comment isn't being "censored by Wikipedia". It was removed by <i>one</i> editor, namely me. If you have an issue with me, that's fine, but I am just trying to do what I think Wikipedia should do: write an article about Air America Radio. Not Bill O'Reilly. Not taking shots at either side. I am sorry if you don't want to do that, but you can find many other places to go to criticise O'Reilly. Sorry. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 02:41, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I don't understand why the O'Reilly comment questioning AAR's profitability is in this article to begin with. The article never points out that O'Reilly is, in fact, a bitter personal enemy of Air America's Al Franken. O'Reilly, in fact, threatened to shoot and kill Franken (at the 2003 BookExpo America conference in Los Angeles). Somehow, I get the feeling that if someone threatened to kill Rush Limbaugh and then later questioned the profitability of Limbaugh's program, that this fact would be emphasized on Limbaugh's Wiki article. All I was trying to do was bring some balance to this article. I've noticed repeatedly how Wikipedia's articles are taking on more and more of a right-wing slant these days. You may have no problem with this, but the fact is, Wikipedia's credibility is going to continue to plummet if this continues. At one time, Wikipedia was a decent reference resource; it's a shame that the site has become about as "fair and balanced" as Fox News.

<dd>Lord Voldemort made a reasonable and logical explanation as to why the statement was removed. The inclusion does come off as an attack on O'Reilly purely as a partisan act. I don't think any of us would have a problem with you mentioning the hypocrisy on O'Reilly's page. By the way, I'm no fan of Bill O'Reilly, but anyone who thinks Wikipedia is right-leaning needs a serious reality check. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatGatsby_4c96.html" title="User:GreatGatsby">GreatGatsby</a> 03:44, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree—unless it's also an ad to report how much, say, a <a href="../../../t/i/v/TiVo_95d2.html#Subscription_Service" title="TiVo">TiVo</a> subscription costs. The approximate price point is an especially relevant piece of data for a subscription service in a unique or relatively unfamiliar field, as readers might otherwise have difficulty guessing it even to the correct order of magnitude (is it $10 a year? $100 a year? $1000?). The two-tier subscription structure is also worth a mention, if not as important as the overall price point—and if you're going to mention price at all you have to decide <i>which</i> tier to report the price of, or just give cursory treatment to both, the latter of which is what I've done. Same thing with the day pass: you have to either explain what it is and how it differs from the other options, or you have to omit mention of it entirely, and I don't think there's any justification for omitting it entirely. —<a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">phh</a> 19:14, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cume</span></h2>
<p>"Cume" is the <i>total</i> number of <i>unique</i> people who tune into a radio station during a particular daypart for at least five minutes at any point during the average week. If I listen to station WIKI-FM for ten minutes in the car on Tuesday morning, and you're glued to the station solidly between 9 and noon every day, we each only add one listener to the station's cume for the 9-to-noon daypart. A syndicated host's cume, then, is the total number of unique people who tuned in to that host's program (technically, to a station that carries the program during the daypart in which that station broadcasts it) in a particular week. If Rush Limbaugh's cume is 13.75 million, all that tells us is that 13.75 million different people tune into his program for at least 5 minutes in an average week.</p>
<p>Our friend 66.42.13.90 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.42.13.90_c033.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.42.13.90">contribs</a>) says that the top three wingnut hosts (Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Weiner_ba3a.html" title="Michael Weiner">Michael Weiner</a>) "have some 35 million listeners," a figure that he (she? could this be a woman? seems unlikely) apparently arrived at by simply adding the cumes of all three hosts together: 13.75 million for Limbaugh + 12.5 million for Hannity + 8 million for <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Weiner_ba3a.html" title="Michael Weiner">Weiner</a> = 34.25 million, rounded up using Republican fuzzy math = 35 million <i>OMFG!!!1!</i>, vs. a cume of 3.1 for the entire Air American network. But this comparison is only valid if <i>none</i> of the top three wingnuts had <i>any</i> listeners in common--remember, "cume" means "total <i>unique</i> listeners." Someone who listens to all three hosts should only be counted once when reporting the total cumulative audience for all three hosts, yet Mr. 66 counts this person 3 times. Using Mr. 66's math, we'd have to obtain the cume for each of the 18 shows on the Air America network and add them together, regardless of whether any of the shows have any listeners in common. That figure probably wouldn't be 35 million, but it'd be a lot closer to 35 million than to 3 million. --<span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif"><a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPHenry_37f2.html" title="User:PHenry">phh</a>&#160;(<sup><a href="../../../p/h/e/User_talk%7EPHenry_3f2a.html" title="User talk:PHenry">t</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PHenry_1efd.html" title="Special:Contributions/PHenry">c</a></sub>)</span> 17:02, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mr. Henry, I do most definitely understand how "cume" is figured; I worked in radio for 13 years (seven in major markets) and indeed am doing a bit of it now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While simply adding the three cumes together is a tad misleading, comparing the cumes of, say, Limbaugh and Franken would be a valid comparison; they're on at the same time (at least in those markets that don't tape-delay Franken).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, this might be the answer; compare the cumes of, say, Limbaugh, O'Reilly and Savage with Franken, Rhodes and Garofalo; they're in head-to-head competition (IIRC; I don't listen to any of the six very much) (and for that matter Prager and Hewitt); they're in head to head competition (to the extent that it is a competition).</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Then you of all people should know it isn't kosher to simply add up a bunch of cume numbers from different shows that air at different times and represent it as some kind of "super-cume." AAR is a small, developing network with about a fifth as many stations as Rush Limbaugh has; no one disputes that they receive a small fraction of his ratings.

<dd>"...Liberal bias in the old media. That's what birthed talk radio in the first place. People turn to it to help right the imbalance. Political scientist William Mayer, writing in the Public Interest, recently observed that liberals don't need talk radio because they've got the big three networks, most national and local daily newspapers and NPR."
<dl>
<dd>That William Mayer quote is only an opinion, and recent studies show that there is actually a right-wing bias in most of the media; and some of us are rather tired of hearing this rubbish year after year. Can this irrelevant and quite probably WRONG quote be removed? I realize it's good to present two points of view but only if both have some merit. Likewise the two arguments could be summarized instead of presented as fact, e.g. "conservatives countered that they believed all networks other than theirs have a liberal bias."

<dd>Well, the first isn't bad. Now that you mention it, you could probably find all kinds of similar quotes in Anderson's book, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_Conservatives_5f29.html" title="South Park Conservatives">South Park Conservatives</a>. I believe he's got a couple of chapters on this. But if this was going to be added, you should say something like, "According to _____, Air America has stuggled while conservative talk-radio has done well because ______." Maybe not that simple, but the point is that we cannot make it seem like Wikipedia is saying this is happening. We have to state that perhaps a specific critic has said this. And I'm not too sure Leno's quote would really fly, as he's a comedian, but you'd have to see. But go ahead and make some edits. <b><a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">Be Bold</a>!</b> --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 14:01, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The ratings discussion comes from the fact that there are two camps regarding the ratings, and each side has their own opinion on how to interpret the numbers. AAR is hell-bent on claiming the ratings are great, AAR opponents hell bent on pointing out how poor they are.

<dd>Considering AAR's financial instability, and the problems its having with holding onto full affiliates, it's the most objective thing we have to measure their success. As there's no real right-wing "Air America," in the sense that there's no slate of programming in the way Air America operates, it's rather unique in its situation. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The discussion <i>does</i> exist for all radio operations. But Air America is different for two reasons: it has claimed since the beginning that it was going to be a successful alternative <i>in the market</i> to Limbaugh et. al., and they continue to insist that they are not only financially viable but in fact a good investment. Radio shows come and go in syndication all the time. Most pass unlamented, even unnoticed. Most, also, do not troll the nation's moneyed elite looking for financial support. Because of those issues, AAR's ratings are of special interest. And BadlyDrawnJeff is right (although there are conservative nets, like Salem, that offer slates of programs. Big difference: Salem's hosts (Michael Medved, Dennis Prager, Hugh Hewitt et al) turn a profit; Hewitt and his entire support staff are paid less than Al Franken's producer, and yet are heard in more markets...</dd>

<dd>Good points. It seems that the issue of viability (ratings &amp; profitability) are taboo in this article. That points to the bias of some rearing its ugly head. I listen to Air America at least 30 minutes a day. I'm not a huge supporter of theirs, but I'm certainly no enemy. But if they're having trouble, we have to be objective here, as we are supposedly writing an encyclopedia.

<p>I made a few changes in order to improve the flow of the article. It seems like this page is a war between people who love AAR and people who want to dwell on ridiculous petty information in order to trash it. As a result, it's not very readable. I admit, my politics lean toward the left, but I'd like to see a well-written, non-biased article here that is worthy of being one of the best on Wikipedia. I know I'm asking a lot here, but I think it can at least become a <i>readable</i> article. Seems all it has become is a feces-flinging fest. I did some minor shifting of information to help improve the flow. And to be fair to both sides of the political arguement, I added a blog article that, while bashing AAR (it's from a conservative-leaning source), has some pretty useful information. Let's find a middle ground here, okay? --<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightingirish_6a71.html" title="User:Fightingirish">Fightingirish</a> 16:26, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I tend to agree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My problem-aside from the unproductive edit warring-is the attempt to minimize the negative side of AAR.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is no tangilbe metric by which someone who is an intellectually honest leftist could consider Air America Radio to be a success, at least at this point in time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you choose to measure success in terms of financial viability, or sustainability, AAR has been a failure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you want to judge it according to the 2004 election results-and there are numerous articles, talk shows, etc., which explored the intentions of Drubnoy and other initial funders to only keep this network viable through the 2004 presidential election, from which they believed they would emerge victorious-it has been a failure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, if you want to measure success by collective listenership, successful radio franchises in large radio markets-which is how most people measure the success or failure of a radio network or talk show-it has been, by and large, a complete failure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, they have been successful in a few select, isolated, mid-level, very liberal cities, such as Portland and Seattle, but I don't see how you can shy away from the lack of success they've found almost everywhere else if you want this article to reflect reality.</dd>

<dd>First of all, your little rant has nothing to do with what I asked of the participants here. I would just like to see a well-written article. I don't care if there's positive or negative stuff in there (for the record, I think there should be). I just think it should flow nice.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But since you want to get all political and hyperventilate about AAR because 'dem durn libruls are mekkin fun uv th' prez'dint', I will indulge your little tantrum. You want to know why I think its a success? They're still on the air! Gee, what a concept!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Or the fact that roughly 80-100 stations airing their program is pretty damn impressive for a two year old startup syndicator. I'm not even sure if Limbaugh had that many affiliates after two years, and mind you, in his case we're talking only one show.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as listeners go, keep in mind many AAR affiliates are on some small stations with rather weak signals. That's the nature of AM radio. The 50,000 watters, like WABC and WLS, are often successful enough that they aren't going to drop everything and switch to the format. But there's many, many less successful smaller signals that were willing to make the flip, and many of them started showing up in the ratings for the first time in years.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitron.html" title="Arbitron">Arbitron</a> ratings system is the accepted measure of how a radio station is doing. But there are flaws, as many in the industry will admit. Believe me, I've worked in radio. First off, the ratings results released to the public are the overall ones, ages 12+. Of course, advertisers don't really buy based on overall shares. They like to appeal to a <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographic.html" title="Demographic">demographic</a>. Perhaps they want males 25-54. Or women 18-24. Or 55+ (which is rare to find these days). Of course, Arbitron is in business to make money, and they hold back the really juicy stuff, like demograhic breakdowns. Often, niche formats like this, and especially other ones like all-sports, do pretty well in narrow demographics. Second, there are often wild fluctuations from book to book. For instance, one can tell Arbitron receives more diaries from Spanish-speaking people in a particular book when foreign languages start shooting up the chart. Arbitron is a somewhat flawed system, but it's the best we've got at this time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For a startup fully-syndicated network, AAR has done fairly well. Keep in mind that startup enterprises take years to show a profit. Even startups from established companies, like <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a> for <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gannett.html" title="Gannett">Gannett</a>, <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> for <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Turner_f6c6.html" title="Ted Turner">Turner</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/x/FOX_Network_debb.html" title="FOX Network">FOX Network</a> for <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_Corporation_d115.html" title="News Corporation">News Corp.</a> take many years to get in the red. And you know what? Those three ventures were ridiculed upon launch. Granted, I'm not putting AAR in the same basket as those three (those three ventures had lots more financial backing), but I do see many similarities.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Above all, I don't understand what you and other detractors consider to be "success". Do you expect <a href="../../../w/l/i/WLIB_3f17.html" title="WLIB">WLIB</a> in New York, for example, to be getting ratings higher or equal to <a href="../../../w/a/b/WABC_3b83.html" title="WABC">WABC</a>, a station that is about as established as any station out there (and with a monster signal to boot)? Do you expect them to be profitable out of the gate? If so, then you don't seem to grasp the concept of business. Seeing as they are a privately held company (no stockholders), there is really not a lot of financial information out there to judge them upon. Do you know something that the rest of us don't? Are you privvy to their ledgers? I assume you aren't, so I don't see how you are qualified to make these assumptions. Are they losing money? I'm sure they are. Then again, most two year-old startups are. It's the nature of business.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wanna know another possible measure of success? The fact that AAR's detractors are so wound up about them. I swear, if they really weren't doing well, you think they would even be talking about them? Obviously in making so many thin-skinned enemies, they must be doing something right. After all, if these same people are so worked up about the level of success a company has, why aren't they wound-up about an obvious money-hemmhoraging venture like say, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Cuban_eda1.html" title="Mark Cuban">Mark Cuban</a>'s folly, <a href="../../../h/d/n/HDNet_f7c2.html" title="HDNet">HDNet</a>?--<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightingirish_6a71.html" title="User:Fightingirish">Fightingirish</a> 16:03, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I changed this, to eliminate lots of the 'weasel words' and to introduce some NPOV. I wouldn't consider WLIB in New York to be a ratings failure. Considering that English-language talk in New York seems to do well only on high-powered AM stations (50,000 watts) that reach the suburbs, WLIB isn't doing too bad. Keep in mind, demographics in the urban areas targeted by many AM stations do not lend themselves to being ideal for these kinds of formats. Same with WHAT in Philly - that signal is better suited for urban talk. That's why there are no country music stations in New York and L.A. The markets that were listed as failures are ones where signal issues are a concern. WWRC in Washington does not get outside the city well. In Boston, WKOX and WXKS have their own limitations (soon to be resolved). And if I'm not mistaken, the Atlanta affiliate was a rimshot for awhile, and started to show in the ratings when they moved into the city.--<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightingirish_6a71.html" title="User:Fightingirish">Fightingirish</a> 17:58, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's almost apologetic in tone to attempt to make the ratings out to be a signal issue rather than a listener issue. AAR has poor ratings nationwide, and there's nothing to indicate that the ratings are because of the strength of signal, nor have you provided any reliable evidence to account for it. It's not our place to make value judgements. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:10, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Signal issues are a factor. If a station can't reach much of its market, then people can't listen. "Poor" and "good" are subjective terms. Besides, a 1.0 rating in a market that has a hundred stations is much different than a 1.0 in a market with 20. And the results of ratings surveys can be spun and interpreted in many ways. Stations don't even use overall ratings for sales purposes. They use demographic breakdowns. For example, a sports station might do terrible overall, but do very well with males of a certain age range. Unfortunately, Arbitron doesn't release this information to the public. Perhaps there's a middle ground here in rewriting this. --<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFightingirish_6a71.html" title="User:Fightingirish">Fightingirish</a> 21:10, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A 1.0 is still a 1.0 regardless. If you can verifiably cite something that says that AAR's ratings are due to the weak signals the radio station broadcasts from, then I have no protest. Until then, we're best simply putting what's out there - what their ratings are and what they are in comparison to similar formats. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:43, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
