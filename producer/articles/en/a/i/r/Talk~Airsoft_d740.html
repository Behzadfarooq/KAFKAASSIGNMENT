<dd>It seems like this page mainly focuses on MilSim and dedicated players.

<dl>
<dd>The article for "<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsplat.html" title="Airsplat">Airsplat</a>" (which I personally have never heard of) seems like it should be merged into the Airsoft article; it seems to be little more than people playing airsoft, occasionally using 6mm paintballs, which are bad for your gun.</dd>

<dd>I can understand where you are coming from for combingin the 2 articles. But isn't milsim and airsplat 2 opposite ways of playing. I would alsot tend to say that MilSim shoudl be combined with airsoft. Because MilSim is almost a regular or standard playing method. Where as, AirSplat (paintsoft) seems to be a sub-culture or different movement of playing airsoft.[[[User:Ganninia|Ganninia]] 07:00, 18 March 2007 (UTC)]</dd>

<dd>I would usually describe airsoft as "playing a game with airsoft guns." MilSim is an aspect of airsoft, usually played by more dedicated players. Most people who buy cheap guns tend to play backyard games. I have never heard the terms "paintsoft" or "airsplat" (except the online store Airsplat.com) outside of Wikipedia. Even if they a source is found for them, the most mention they should get on Wikipedia is a section of this page. 65.197.192.130 23:17, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not really sure about all that "trust is the most important aspect" crap, but there is no need for a separate page about airsplat, especially since its unsourced, repeats a lot of stuff (safety, etc.), and promotes bad airsoft gun care (using paintballs in an airsoft gun). 65.197.192.130 11:06, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Good points, actually someone added in the paintball usage at a later point in time. I went back and removed that part becuase I didn't know it. But I'm surprised to see some of you have not heard of airsplat or paintsoft. Do a search on google for paintsoft. AirSplat doesn't come up with as much right now becuase of the website airsplat. Until someone starts a website called paintsoft, those results are still obtainable. You'll there is standard nomenclature within the players. Milsim and paintsoft are actualy opposite ends of the playing spectrum. One is highly strategic simulating military tactics while one is a shoot them up, metal to the pedal playing method (similar to paint ball competitions, hence the "paint").

<dd>Of course, those types of games are played in airsoft. However, in my six years of playing, I have *never* heard those game types being referred to as "airsplat" or "paintsoft". To be honest, all I think is needed here is a revision of airsoft game types to include the more "balls to the walls" types so indicated in the airsplat article. Other than that, the airsplat article is not cited, promotes bad gun care and repeats what's said on THIS article (as has been said). The best thing for it is deletion, imo. -Madbrood 12:28, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this shoudl be seriously considered. Especially given how brief MilSim is. But what if someone does a search for MilSim, should they be directed to airsoft? But MilSim is not only related to airsoft. Believe it or not, MilSim is actually trademarked terminology by Tom Clancey for his games. Those games are considered Mil Sim as well.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps a better option is to delevop the MilSim article to include all the definitions and uses of it as well as mention it's applications in airsoft. Any thoughts? [[[User:Ganninia|Ganninia]] 07:03, 18 March 2007 (UTC)]</dd>

<p>The airsoft article describes legal related info at the "Sample airsoft laws from around the world" about several countries regarding the practice of airsoft. After reading it I've questioned what is the criteria being used to extract information from article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_in_airsoft" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_in_airsoft" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_in_airsoft</a>&#160;? In my opinion only good examples should be stated at the main article. A good example should be the one(s) that best defend airsoft sport practice and not the one(s) that best avoid/limit airsoft.

<p>Almost everyone knows that 8 mmm airsoft is minority in global airsoft comunity. Based on energy tables we can see that energy levels resulting from 8 mm pellet usage makes almost impossible airsoft practice in a secure way. For this reason I would like to know what others think about a possible removal of all 8 mm information from the article. Another option would be to create a 8 mm airsoft article. -anonymous</p>

<dd>8mm might be a minority, but it exists, and it's a not-insignificant minority. Additionally, with the release of the 8mm Marushin M-1 Garand, 8mm is gaining traction in the WWII Airsoft segment. Further, Marushin has started producing (Summer 2006) a .28 gram 8mm BB, which puts the 8mm in the same delivered-energy ballpark as modestly upgraded 6mm airsoft replicas. 8mm should stay as a reference. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathonbarton_3508.html" title="User:Jonathonbarton">Jonathonbarton</a> 16:55, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just a note a 8mm BB has 33% more surface than a 6mm, it desaccelerate faster that 6 mm pellet due to higher drag. It is true that you can put 8mm in the same delivered-energy but that is only true if same weight and velocity were used. For example firing a 300fps 6mm .28g pellet and a 300fps 8mm .28g, 6mm will always have a better range because it has less surface =&gt; less drag. So at the end 8mm would only make sense if higher energy would used, but that way you will seriously passing 2 Joules. -anon</dd>

<dd>I'll post some of the ballistic info (charts) I have when I get home and can access it. Surprisingly (and somewhat counter-intuitively), when you talk about "range" in airsoft, you're talking a matter of 10-20', whether it's the difference between a 6mm BB at 400FPS vs. a 6mm BB at 550FPS (2.82 joules), or a 6mm BB .28g BB at 350 FPS and an 8mm .28g BB at 350 FPS. The higher the velocity, the drag goes up *exponentially*, not *linearly*. A 6mm BB .2g bb shot at 550FPS is down to a fairly mild 350 FPS within 60'. So, "range" is literally a matter of 4-5 steps difference in most cases. If you can't reach him, rush him - THEN reach him. But that's a discussion that's not relevant to an encyclopedic entry. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathonbarton_3508.html" title="User:Jonathonbarton">Jonathonbarton</a> 21:58, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with your point-of-view, but you must understand that the example you state of "550 fps down to 350 fps within 60'" can be also understood by many people that its safe to use such energy parameters. It is important as encyclopedic entry and also educational to refer that until it reaches 60', such fps using 6mm or 8mm are not safe. -anon</dd>

<dd>I think you're confusing the Talk Page (talk about the *content* of the article) with the Article itself. The OP in this discussion asserted that 8mm should be removed because:
<ul>
<li>8mm is a minority.</li>
<li>8mm is simultaneously impossible and impractical to safely skirmish with. (If you shoot 8mm fast enough to not be outranged by 6mm, it's got too much energy to be safe, and if you shoot with safe energy, you'll be outranged by 6mm.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>To which, I am merely rebutting:
<ul>
<li>This is an ENCYCLOPEDIC article, and should make at least some small attempt to be both inclusive and comprehensive. Just because there aren't *many* 8mm replicas out there does not mean that they should be excluded from mention altogether.</li>
<li>There <b>are</b> extremely skirmishable 8mm replicas out there for those that want to use them. They suffer from neither an abundance of energy when used with a .28g BB, nor to they suffer from lack of range compared to 6mm.</li>
<li>Whether you can use a replica for Skirmishing is not the be-all-end-all litmus test of discussing airsoft replicas in an encyclopedic article about the replicas and the games both. An example would be Asahi "Blade Bullets". Had they been more widespread in the history of airsoft, Asahi "Blade bullets" would have a place in the article, despite being something you would not *ever* want to be shot with.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>My discussion above regarding loss of FPS over distance is just a footnote to the rebuttal of the statement "6mm will always have a better range because it has less surface =&gt; less drag." - specifically, I rebut with "Well, yeah, the 6mm will have about&#160;::10 feet:: more range...the difference is small enough to be irrelevant in most situations."</dd>

<dd>at close range I've seen it happen (strictly speaking it was a violation of the 'no live fire within 5 metres', but it was an accident, not intentional), the 'victim' had a pretty big bloody dent in his cheek, bled like you wouldn't believe too. So yes, it can happen, at close range, with a gun rigged to fire at exactly 350 fps.

<p>I started airsoft this year and i've had my fair share of bruises. I was wondering, how much FPS does it take to punch through human skin? Is it true that people can be come crippled if they took a direct hit in the knee? Once upon on a time I was going airsoft with forty other players. Of course the ground rules are that everyone must wear of eye protection and assault rifles should not shoot over 400FPS. This is in Thailand. Well, i was wearing a face mask because i'm rather concerned about getting shot in the face. Unfortunately the face mask didnt work too well. I was shot in the face ten meters away and i got bruised. Strangely, my face mask wasn't penetrated but my face was bruised. How could this happen? -Philip</p>
<dl>
<dd>It depends - UK Home office ballistics put the figure at 1.38 joules - Around 350-360 fps, while RoI Studies put it at 2 Joules 400+ . As for the crippling, Unless you are firing an INSANELY upgraded gun (and I mean past all conventional and custom upgrades) there would be the slightest chance this might happen . But this is almost nigh on impossible. you might jump around and clutch your knee from the hit of a stock gun, but it's very unlikely it'll leave more than a welt. As for the face mask, you'd have to show us the make/model. Was a paintball mask, or an Airsoft mask? -Alex (Bobthelumherjack[at]gmail.com)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>like Alex said, it would require a realy powerfull gun, and at really close range too. I've seen it happen only once (see under IronMan on this page) and that was at a range of 2 metres or so. Range is mostly your friend in such matters, because BB's are so light, and have so little mass, they tend to lose velocity and kinetic energy really fast through friction with air. The guy I know who did got hurt recovered very nicely in no time at all. It was just a miniscule tear in his skin, right above a bloodvessel, which looks bad, but the bruising and wound have completely disapeared in days. (just make sure you have some form of iodine ready to clean the wound). He was only wearing protective glasses by the way, not a full-face mask. <a href="../../../k/l/u/User%7EKluner.net_6fb3.html" title="User:Kluner.net">Kluner.net</a> 07:21, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Omit the Airsoft vs. Paintball part of this article...the controversy serves no useful purpose within the article. Alternately, taking a lead from user -b, add a discussion of "Airsoft vs. Real Airguns," i.e. the kind that shoot metallic ammo (my opinion). Seriously, I'm sick to death of people muddling up 6mm airsoft rounds with diablo pellets and genuine BBs--which only come in 4.5mm, otherwise they'd be BBBs or Bs, see? Even Amazon.com is confused on this score. Can't there be a better term for 6mm plastic rounds?</p>

<dd>I have replaced nearly all references to "Pellet" with the term "BB" to reflect my airsoft experiences over the last 5 years. I've *never* heard them routinely called pellets by any group in the US or UK, or any english-speaking (typing?) forum user from another country. I also clarified in the opening paragraphs of the article that "airsoft guns shoot 6 or 8mm spherical plastic pellets (called BBs)" - hopefully making it clear to all that they are *not* the same as traditional wasp-waisted metal pellets. Currently the AvP discussion is pretty straightforwad with no Non-neutral POV, thanks to Doncommie!<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathonbarton_3508.html" title="User:Jonathonbarton">Jonathonbarton</a> 19:43, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section Airsoft projectiles was conflicting with this by constantly refering to them as pellets. "often called "BBs" is hardly accurate, they are always called BBs, on all packaging, weapon manuals and by the players themselves. If pellet is used in this article it should only be in a sentence that clarifies they are actually called BBs. It has been suggested and generally agreed that BB should stand for "Ball Bullet", which is a fairly good idea although everyone will only use this if anyone asks what the acronym means.

<dd>Airsoft is not illegal in most parts of China and are widely sold/used on the streets. In fact, there is alot of Chinese airsoft guns, made by manufacturers such as CYMA and WELL. These airsoft guns are similar to Japanese AEG's and called "LPEG's", or "Low Price/Power Electric Guns".</dd>

<p><b>Officially illegal</b> in China mainland. It is essentially an underground sport, and local authorities turn a blind eye to it. This enables the sport to flourish within the country, and market stalls and shops to openly sell airsoft, despite the official legality situation. It is legal, or at least referred to as a 'grey area', in China's SAR's (Special Administrative Region's of China, such as Macau and Hong Kong), where it is a very openly popular sport.

<p>Full size replica weapons in Malaysia are illegal. Pretty much goes along similar guidelines as in neighbouring Singapore. What are legal, and openly sold however, are Mini-AEG's, the half size, obviously plastic, toy versions of Automatic Electric Guns (mini MP5's, AK-47's, etc). Presumably this is because they do not look like the real thing and are then not considered replicas. Special bob 22:22, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A pattern seems to be emerging in South East Asia - That is, regardless of its legal status, locals pretty much find any they can to buy, import, sell and use airsoft products. What also follows is that local authorities are either unaware or turn a blind eye to these practices. What I come up against alot is "It is not illegal - I can buy it in a shop, or I can buy it at a market stall. Ergo it is legal". Which is simply not the case, and if you are caught, you are faced with fines, imprisonment and obviously confiscation of your airsoft toys. -Anon</p>

<p><b>Private usage, importation and ownership of airsoft in Singapore is illegal.</b> Legal usage is through a recognised gun club (Airsoft guns are treated in the same way as real firearms - Listed under Controlled Items, paperwork, licence, required etc), such as Airsoft Asia, and the only available discipline for airsoft (in this instance) is IPSC. Prior to this there was one skirmish field and one airsoft shooting Range, in Marina Bay (Under Universal Archery). Both have since disappeared. AFAIK, Airsoft Asia are the only club licenced to import airsoft products into Singapore.

<p>Given the political and legal situation, it would be best to treat Taiwan as a separate case, for clarity with regards to airsoft (to clarify - this should be kept away from any political discussions regarding soveriegnty/independence/etc issues).<br />
Taiwan (ROC) treats airsoft, and the (booming) airsoft industry as completely legal.<br />
By comparison, China (PRC), regards airsoft as illegal. IIRC, the airsoft factories in China are within the SAR's and so do not fall foul of the PRC's law in this regard.<br />
Representatives from airsoft manufacturers in Taiwan were in Europe last year for distribution talks, and its legality in Taiwan was under no doubt.<br />
I feel its better to treat these regions (China PRC, Taiwan ROC, SAR's: Macau and Hong Kong) as separate entities to help clarify for everyone else unaware of (or unable to understand) the differences between these places.</p>

<p>Airsoft in Taiwan is legal. I went to a airsoft shop in Taiwan and i saw people firing guns over 350FPS. I think there is a law that all airsoft players gotta be over 18 in Taiwan cuz i'm like the only teenager in that shop. Taiwan is just beginning to become more open to airsoft. My cousin lived in Taiwan ,said that the 1st airsoft guns that were available were Vietnam era M16s and they were spring rifles not AEGs.</p>

<p>I edited the section on US law slightly as it stated that it was a violation of federal law to remove the blaze orange tip. From US Code title 15, chapter 76, section 5001, subsection A: "It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm unless such firearm contains, or has affixed to it, a marking approved by the Secretary of Commerce, as provided in subsection (b) of this section." (See source 5 for the link.) To translate, it says that it's illegal to sell airsoft guns in the United States without the orange tip, however it says nothing about the end user removing the tip. This is how the law is explained in the "Legal issues in airsoft" article linked on this page. Additionally, for whatever it's worth, I've been playing airsoft for a while now, and one of the first things I did on my rifle was remove the blaze-orange flash hider and replace it with an all-black one, and I've never had a problem with law enforcement. - Kant Lavar 2303 MST, 16 December 2006</p>

<li>Addition of DAB note for te <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft_guns.html" title="Airsoft guns">Airsoft guns</a> page to the top (according to standard WP practice, see <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a>)</li>
<li>Cleaned up intro to refer to the sport only instead of trying to do a disambig of the topic</li>
<li>Moved "gun" related sections to the Airsoft gun page where it is supposed to go</li>
<li>Moved section describing the sport to the top, because that is what the article should cover</li>
<li>Merged the leftovers from Airsoft equipment (which should now be removed) into this page, because it describes equipment used in the sport with links to expanded pages for <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft_pellets.html" title="Airsoft pellets">Airsoft pellets</a>, Airsoft guns etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it is much better and clearer now. <a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeon_Steyn_e30c.html" title="User:Deon Steyn">Deon Steyn</a> 10:07, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recently I've been trying to get this article's quality up, and one of the ways it could really benefit is from appropriate citations. There are almost none here, and for an article of this size and scope, that's really not excusable. Anybody who can verify and add references to any part of this article is strongly encouraged to include them. It would help a lot and would be much appreciated. <span style="background-color:#000000"><font color="white">(|--</font></span> <span style="background-color:#CCCCCC"><font color="red"><b>UlT</b><font color="green">i</font><font color="blue">MuS</font></font> <font color="black"><sup>( <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltimus_e530.html" title="User:Ultimus">U</a> • <a href="../../../u/l/t/User_talk%7EUltimus_c12a.html" title="User talk:Ultimus">T</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ultimus_2ae7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ultimus">C</a> | <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltimus_Templates_Message_6fcb.html" title="User:Ultimus/Templates/Message">M</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Ultimus_8e4d.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Ultimus">E</a> )</sup></font></span> 03:58, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No point to keep these two seperate. The main article already covers much of the content in the other one. There's a lot of redundancy here, and the main article could certainly use a more in-depth treatment of equipment. If there are no timely objections, I will do the merge myself. <span style="background-color:#000000"><font color="white">(|--</font></span> <span style="background-color:#CCCCCC"><font color="red"><b>UlT</b><font color="green">i</font><font color="blue">MuS</font></font> <font color="black"><sup>( <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltimus_e530.html" title="User:Ultimus">U</a> • <a href="../../../u/l/t/User_talk%7EUltimus_c12a.html" title="User talk:Ultimus">T</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ultimus_2ae7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ultimus">C</a> | <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltimus_Templates_Message_6fcb.html" title="User:Ultimus/Templates/Message">M</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Ultimus_8e4d.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Ultimus">E</a> )</sup></font></span> 06:43, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am a new member, I joined yesterday. I am sorry if I merged the airsoft sport page and the airsoft guns page, I myself am an avid airsoft enthusisist(I own 6 airsoft guns and play aisoft reguarly with my friends).

<dd>Bud, I don't think anyone's contested the content you've added. There's no problem with having a small section here and the main article elsewhere. If <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft_guns.html" title="Airsoft guns">Airsoft guns</a> is merged here, then we can just replace the section. I've also cleaned up everything you've written; your grammar's not so great&#160;:). You'll get better, don't worry. <i><b><a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomsDay349_6323.html" title="User:DoomsDay349"><font color="darkblue">Dooms</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoomsDay349_7ac1.html" title="User talk:DoomsDay349"><font color="lightblue">Day349</font></a></b></i> 22:56, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
