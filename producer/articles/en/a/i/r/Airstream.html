<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airstream.html" title="Edit section: Early history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early history</span></h2>
<p>The company was founded by <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wally_Byam_bfe4.html" title="Wally Byam">Wally Byam</a>, who began building Masonite trailers in his backyard in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> during the late <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>. Byam, a lawyer by training, published a magazine selling "how-to" kits to customers wishing to build their own trailers. He then acquired the struggling Bowlus Company. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a> Byam introduced the "Airstream Clipper", which was essentially a rebadged 1935 Bowlus, with the door relocated. The design cut down on wind resistance and thus improved gas mileage. It was the first of the now familiar sausage-shaped, silver aluminum Airstream trailer. Byam moved his operation to <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_Center%2C_Ohio_ce8c.html" title="Jackson Center, Ohio">Jackson Center, Ohio</a>, in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>, where Airstream's (and parent company <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thor_Industries_7977.html" title="Thor Industries">Thor Industries</a>) headquarters still reside.</p>

1977 Airstream travel trailer ad</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><br />
Of more than 300 trailer builders operating in 1936, Airstream was the only one to survive the Depression years. However, during World War II, leisure travel became a luxury most could not afford and non-military industries faced an acute aluminum shortage. Airstream Trailer Co. closed its doors. Byam decided that the best way to help the war effort was to use his experience with aluminum fabrication in the aircraft industry, taking jobs at Lockheed and Curtis Wright for the rest of the war. When World War II ended, the economy boomed, and people's attention once again turned towards leisure travel. Byam's company went back into production in 1948.</p>
<p>By that time, the demand for Airstream trailers increased tremendously, with a wide range of models eventually being offered. In July 1952 a new facility in <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_Center%2C_Ohio_ce8c.html" title="Jackson Center, Ohio">Jackson Center, Ohio</a>, was established. By August of that year, the first Ohio-made Airstream rolled off the line, and the California factory was also moved to larger facilities in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Fe_Springs%2C_California_cefa.html" title="Santa Fe Springs, California">Santa Fe Springs</a> and later Cerritos. 1979 saw the last Airstreams to be manufactured in California.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1974 Airstream began manufacturing a Class A motorhome, badged "Argosy". These began as painted aluminum 20- and 24-foot models, and were followed in 1979 by the first of their Classic model motorhomes, with an unpainted aluminum body, much like the trailers they are known for. In actuality, these were modified trailers, mounted on a step van chassis also modified for the motorhome.</p>

<p>The Class A motorhomes began as 28-foot models, and in the '80s and '90s, models ranging up to 37 feet were marketed. These classic motorhomes were followed by the production of more traditional-looking fiberglass models in the '90s. Airstream discontinued manufacture of Class A motorhomes in 2006. A recent model, the Skydeck, featured bus-like construction and interior stairs leading to a fully appointed deck on the roof.</p>
<p>Starting in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, Airstream also built Class B motorhomes based on the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Econoline_3d39.html" title="Ford Econoline">Ford Econoline</a> chassis and the <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodge_B-series_van_031c.html" title="Dodge B-series van">Dodge B-series van</a> chassis. Named "B190" after their class and 19-foot length, production ceased after the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> model year. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Airstream introduced the Westfalia, Interstate and Parkway models all based on the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercedes-Benz_Sprinter_7f39.html" title="Mercedes-Benz Sprinter">Mercedes-Benz Sprinter</a> chassis. The Westfalia was discontinued in 2006.</p>
<p>Airstream, based in Jackson Center, Ohio, is owned by Thor, Inc. Thor was created in 1980 when Wade F.B.Thompson and Peter Orthwein bought Airstream from Beatrice Foods, who had bought the company from Byam's estate in 1967. The company presently manufactures approximately 2,000 trailers and motorhomes per year. Currently, Airstream produces four models: Safari, Safari Special Edition, International (CCD Signature &amp; Ocean Breeze) and Classic Limited. Lengths range from 16 to 34 foot and they manufacture two models with slide-outs (30 and 34 Classic). Their most popular models are the 25 and 27 foot "front bedroom" models. Safari SE and International are the most preferred trim levels.</p>

<p>Airstreamers are a group of RVers who share a community spirit because of their mutual love of the trailers. In the early 1950s, Airstream company founder Wally Byam began leading groups of owners on travels to many portions of the world, where the towed trailers were quite remarkable. Photos taken of the trailers in front of many famous tourist sites were common. This promoted a mystique which surrounded Airstreams and persists to this day.</p>
<p>The Wally Byam Caravan Club was formed during the 1955 rally in Kentville, Nova Scotia, Canada. Later, the word "International" was added to the club name, resulting in the acronym "WBCCI". On August 17, 2005, a commemorative plaque was dedicated on the site. Club members join together for one large International Rally each summer (which by club rules always includes the dates of July 1 and July 4), and hundreds of smaller local rallies are held coast-to-coast by "units" (chapters). Airstreams are more popular than ever, and restoration of older models is a passion shared by many.</p>
