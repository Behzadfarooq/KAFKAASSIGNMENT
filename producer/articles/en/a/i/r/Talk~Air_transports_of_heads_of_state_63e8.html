<p>I believe the UK entry should be split to a new article (following the deletion of Blair Force One and merger into this article). <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_transport_of_the_Royal_Family_and_executive_of_the_United_Kingdom_08db.html" title="Air transport of the Royal Family and executive of the United Kingdom">Air transport of the Royal Family and executive of the United Kingdom</a> is a clumsby title, but I can't think of anything better.</p>
<p>My reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This article can never hold all the information. The new article should have a full discussion of early executive/royal air transports, the Queen's Flight, it's merger into 32 Squadron, the current fleet and the proposed new aircraft.</li>
<li>The UK entry should be similar to the USA entry, a short summary and a {{main|}} link.
<ul>
<li>Example summary:<br />
Air transport for the Royal Family and executive of the United Kingdom is currently provided by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a>'s <a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._32_Squadron_RAF_4d98.html" title="No. 32 Squadron RAF">No. 32 Squadron</a>, chartered civilan aircraft and occasionally scheduled commerical flights. No. 32 Squadron's executive transport role is secondary to its principal function of providing communications and logistical support for military operations. Given that, the fact that the aircraft are increasingly unsuitable to an executive transport role and the security concerns of chartering commerical aircraft, the government plans to acquire two dedicated executive transports for the use of the Royal Family and executive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The current aircraft (and the proposed aircraft) are used by both the Head of State (the Queen), the executive and the military. Therefore the aircraft are more than "Air transports of Heads of State". I'm going off on a tangent but in fact they're bought and run by the taxpayer, so while technically they're the Queen's aircraft (part of "her" airforce), the executive has more right to call them "their" aircraft. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 21:40, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Reading the <a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._32_Squadron_RAF_4d98.html" title="No. 32 Squadron RAF">No. 32 Squadron RAF</a> article, it sounds like that squadron is dedicated only to executive/royal transport. Why not expand the article and use that? I would assume that any new aircraft that are acquired or leased would be operated by them, wouldn't it? Just an opinion from a yank. --<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerd_6b4d.html" title="User:Rogerd">rogerd</a> 22:21, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My understanding of some of the comments in the recent debate about the "Blair Force One" article was that the squadron's rôle is changing and in fact it will become less "dedicated" soon. So I'd be against merging with the squadron's article. I'm actually fairly happy with the current position. But if the UK section gets any longer, it will unbalance this present page, and I'd be in favour of the move to <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_transport_of_the_Royal_Family_and_executive_of_the_United_Kingdom_08db.html" title="Air transport of the Royal Family and executive of the United Kingdom">Air transport of the Royal Family and executive of the United Kingdom</a> – a title which is indeed long and I apologise for because I came up with it in the AfD debate! Just a word of pause, though: all this stuff about Blair and Brown will be irrelevant and boring in a couple of years, at which point the section on the UK could be shrunk down to the actual facts about air transport. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 22:40, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I'm with <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> on this one. It needs its own article, it always has done, and quite honestly I think the consensus taken by the admin who closed the Blair Force One AFD was simply not present. I'm tempted to go to Deletion Review with the whole ordeal but if we can just shuffle it over to a dedicated UK dignatory air transport article that'll do in my book. Dignatorial air transport of the United Kingdom perhaps? Is dignatorial even a word? <a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErath_3567.html" title="User:Erath">Erath</a> 23:51, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As an aside, there was a consensus for "merge and redirect", but there was no consensus for the target. The options listed on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Blair_Force_One_78ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Blair Force One">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Blair Force One</a> included this article, a new article, the squadron article, and editors not suggesting a suitable targt for the merge. My decision to put it here was that approximately 80% of the material in the old "Blair Force One" article was here already, and the names suggested seemed artificial and overly cumbersome. That said, if y'all come to a consensus here to split the article off, by all means do so. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 05:38, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's not, but <i>dignitaries</i> is, and it certainly forms a shorter suggestion; Dignitaries' air transport of the United Kingdom? However, we should be careful that the quest for a shorter title doesn't make the title hopelessly uninformative nor just plain inaccurate. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 23:59, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>As noted above, I think the new title is long and cumbersome, and as long as this section remains approximately this size, I would feel it belongs here. However, as I said above, part of the reason for the merge here was the significant overlap (in my opinion). If the history and current events are fleshed out sufficiently that it would overbalance the article, then I would agree that at that point it would need to be split—hideous titles notwithstanding. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 05:38, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But I intend to add the full history of UK executive/Royal air transport and as a few people have said above, this article will become totally overbalanced. I'm not sure about "dignitaries" – that's a very broad term which could include senior church figures etc. Regarding adding it all to the No. 32 Squadron article, that squadron's history is much more than just its current role. Also as I said in my initial comments, its primary function is support of the military with VIP duties a secondary function. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 10:25, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Based on Mark83's intention to add more info, we've hit the "unbalancing the main article" stage. And since he's quite right that dignitaries is a very broad term... it really does look like we have to go with the long title. At the end of the day, why not? It's not as though people have to type it in anywhere; they'll be clicking on it either on another page, or in search results. If a title has to be long in order to be accurate, then that's the right thing to do. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 11:14, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looks like you're having to defend yourself, however after reviewing the dicussion I don't think you did anything wrong. The article had to go and you moved it to a suitable place pending further discussion (and in absence of a consensus for a new name). You dealt with what was in front of you very well. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 12:19, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am the one who started this article. It was originally a very large section of the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_One_a4f1.html" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a> article called "Analogs in other countries" or something like that. Some sections are quite small, consisting of a sentence or two and others are quite large. Perhaps we should have an standard about what information each country's entry should have and a suggested format. As a starting point, which country's entry do you think is the most well-written? --<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerd_6b4d.html" title="User:Rogerd">rogerd</a> 21:16, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Slovakia - short and direct&#160;! If a section had more than a few lines it probably should have an article of its own. We should have - who uses the aircraft, who operates the aircraft, what are the aircraft.
