<p>There were 74 passengers (including three infants) and five crew members on board. All but five of the occupants of the plane died.

<p>During the second week of January 1982, one of the worst periods of exceptionally cold weather in history had struck the east coast of the United States. Atlanta, Georgia recorded freezing temperatures, and the citrus crop in Florida was considered to be at risk. Around the nation's capital, for several days, freezing temperatures had brought vehicles to a standstill and interfered with daily activities.</p>
<p>On January 13, at <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport_b7c3.html" title="Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport">Washington National Airport</a> (DCA), which is located in <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington%2C_Virginia_fc7c.html" title="Arlington, Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a>, immediately across the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potomac_River_3eff.html" title="Potomac River">Potomac River</a> from Washington, D.C., the airport had opened at noon under marginal conditions. The crew of Air Florida Flight 90 had left <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami%2C_Florida_f9df.html" title="Miami, Florida">Miami</a> at 11:00 a.m. EST, and arrived at about 1:45 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>That afternoon, they were to return south to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Lauderdale-Hollywood_International_Airport_0d0a.html" title="Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport">Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport</a> (FLL), <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Lauderdale%2C_Florida_a9f5.html" title="Fort Lauderdale, Florida">Fort Lauderdale, Florida</a>, with an intermediate stop at <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampa_International_Airport_bb3e.html" title="Tampa International Airport">Tampa International Airport</a> (TPA), <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampa%2C_Florida_a617.html" title="Tampa, Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>. The scheduled departure time was delayed about 1 hour 45 minutes due to a moderate to heavy snowfall, which necessitated the temporary closing of the airport.</p>

<p>The aircraft was de-iced, by spraying the wings with an antifreeze-type chemical mixture, but the plane had trouble leaving the gate when the ground services tow motor couldn't get traction on the ice. For a period of close to five minutes, the crew elected to use the reverse thrust of the 737's JT8D engines, ingesting ice and failing to move the aircraft. Cooler heads prevailed, and a tug properly equipped with snow chains was used to push the aircraft back from the gate. After finally leaving the departure gate, the Boeing 737-222 aircraft waited on a taxiway for 49 minutes in line with other aircraft for clearance to use the congested airport's only instrument-rated runway, which requires a treacherous flight path north following the river, and winding between restricted airspace and obstacles such as the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Monument_ef56.html" title="Washington Monument">Washington Monument</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pentagon_612d.html" title="The Pentagon">The Pentagon</a>.</p>

<p>The pilot apparently decided not to return to the gate for reapplication of de-icing, fearing the flight's departure would be even further delayed, and chose to continue waiting to takeoff. Then, with snow and ice on the airfoil surfaces of the aircraft, the aircraft attempted to take off on the main (and only open) runway in heavy snow at 3:59 p.m. EST. Even though it was freezing and snowing, the crew did not activate the anti-ice systems. Analysis (confirmed by the FBI) of the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockpit_voice_recorder.html" title="Cockpit voice recorder">cockpit voice recorder</a> determined that during the departure checklist, the copilot announced, and the pilot confirmed, that the plane's own anti-icing system was turned off. This system uses heat from the engines to prevent sensors from freezing and providing inaccurate readings.</p>
<p>During the plane's taxiing, the cockpit voice recorder picked up this conversation between the captain and first officer, in which they discussed the icing situation.</p>

<p>Adding to the plane's troubles was the pilots' decision to maneuver closely behind a DC-9 that was taxiing just ahead of the Air Florida aircraft prior to takeoff due to their mistaken belief that the warmth from the DC-9's engines would melt snow and ice accumulated on Flight 90's wings. This action — which went specifically against flight manual recommendations for an icing situation — actually contributed to additional icing on the accident aircraft.</p>
<p>Neither the captain nor the first officer had much experience flying in snowy, cold weather. And the captain, Larry Wheaton, had failed a flight simulator test the previous year, with one of his instructors citing Wheaton's unfamiliarity with flight rules and regulations. He took a repeat test soon after and passed.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the failure to operate the plane's anti-icing system caused exactly what could be expected to happen: the Engine Pressure Ratio (<a href="../../../e/p/r/EPR_4a87.html" title="EPR">EPR</a>) thrust indicators provided false high readings — when the pilots thought they had throttled up to the correct take-off EPR of 2.04, the actual EPR was only 1.70. The aircraft traveled almost ½ mile (800 m) further down the runway than is customary before liftoff was accomplished. Survivors of the crash indicated the trip over the runway was extremely rough, one of whom admitted he feared that they would not get airborne and would "fall off the end of the runway."</p>
<p>As the plane began its takeoff roll, the first officer noted several times to the captain that the readings he was seeing on the instrument panel didn't seem to reflect reality (he was referring to the fact that the plane didn't seem to have developed as much power as it needed for takeoff, despite the controls saying otherwise.) The captain dismissed the first officer's concerns, and let the takeoff proceed. Investigators later determined that there was plenty of time and space on the runway for the captain to have aborted the takeoff, and criticized his refusal to listen to his first officer, who was correct that the instrument panel readings were wrong. The captain likely felt pressure to depart quickly because he knew another aircraft was on final approach using the same runway. Indeed, that aircraft landed just as the Air Florida plane took off, and had Flight 90 aborted its takeoff, the two planes might have been in danger of a collision on the runway.</p>
<p>Below is a transcript of Flight 90's cockpit voice recorder during the plane's acceleration down the runway. It's evident that the first officer saw a problem with the instrumentation and that the captain shrugged off his concerns. (CAM-1 is the captain, CAM-2 is the first officer)</p>
<p>15:59:32 CAM-1 Okay, your throttles.</p>
<p>15:59:35 [SOUND OF ENGINE SPOOLUP]</p>
<p>15:59:49 CAM-1 Holler if you need the wipers.</p>
<p>15:59:51 CAM-1 It's spooled. Real cold, real cold.</p>
<p>15:59:58 CAM-2 God, look at that thing. That don't seem right, does it? Uh, that's not right.</p>
<p>16:00:09 CAM-1 Yes it is, there's eighty.</p>
<p>16:00:10 CAM-2 Naw, I don't think that's right. Ah, maybe it is.</p>
<p>16:00:21 CAM-1 Hundred and twenty.</p>
<p>16:00:23 CAM-2 I don't know</p>
<p>16:00:31 CAM-1 Vee-one. Easy, vee-two.</p>
<p>As the plane became briefly airborne, the flight-recorder picked up these words from the cockpit, with the sound of the stick-shaker (an instrument that warns that the plane is in danger of stalling) in the background:</p>
<p>16:00:39 [SOUND OF STICKSHAKER STARTS AND CONTINUES UNTIL IMPACT]</p>
<p>16:00:41 TWR Palm 90 contact departure control.</p>
<p>16:00:45 CAM-1 Forward, forward, easy. We only want five hundred.</p>
<p>16:00:48 CAM-1 Come on forward....forward, just barely climb.</p>
<p>16:00:59 CAM-1 Stalling, we're falling!</p>
<p>16:01:00 CAM-2 Larry, we're going down, Larry....</p>
<p>16:01:01 CAM-1 I know it!</p>
<p>16:01:01 [SOUND OF IMPACT]</p>
<p>Although the aircraft did manage to become airborne, it attained a maximum altitude of just 337 feet before it began losing altitude. Recorders later indicated that the aircraft was airborne for just 30 seconds. At 4:01 p.m. EST it crashed into the <a href="../../../1/4/t/14th_Street_Bridge_0c7a.html" title="14th Street Bridge">14th Street Bridge</a> across the Potomac River, 0.75 nautical miles (1400 m) from the end of the runway.</p>
<p>It hit six cars and a truck on the bridge, and tore away 20 feet of guard rail. The wrecked aircraft then plunged into the freezing <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potomac_River_3eff.html" title="Potomac River">Potomac River</a>. All but the tail section quickly became submerged. Remarkably, it crashed in between two bridges, the second bridge being the high occupancy vehicle (HOV) only bridge that was full of buses and people waiting to go toward DC.</p>
<p>As a result of injuries received during the crash, four of the five crew members including both pilots, and 69 of the 74 passengers perished, leaving only six survivors in the freezing water out of the 79 who had been aboard the aircraft. There were also four fatalities among the motorists on the bridge, with four others on the bridge injured. All but one of the passengers were killed by the forces involved in the impact, not by drowning.</p>
<p>Clinging to the tail section of the broken airliner with five passengers in the ice-choked Potomac River, flight attendant <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Duncan_eb6b.html" title="Kelly Duncan">Kelly Duncan</a> inflated the only flotation device they could find, and passed it to one of the more-injured passengers, Nikki Felch. Joe Stiley assisted fellow survivor, Priscilla Tirado, and tried to tow her to shore, when the Park Police helicopter returned to try to pull them to safety.</p>

<p>The blizzard conditions had happened fairly suddenly on this day, and many Federal Government offices in downtown Washington had just been closed early. Thus, there was a massive backup of traffic on almost all of the city's roads, making it almost impossible for ambulances to reach the crash site.

Ambulances attempting to reach the scene were even driven down the sidewalk in front of the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a>. Rescuers who did reach the site stood and watched in horror, as they had no adequate equipment to reach the survivors, and the below-freezing waters and heavy ice made swimming out to them all but impossible. Multiple attempts to try to throw a makeshift lifeline - made out of belts and any other things available that could be tied together - out to the survivors proved ineffectual.</p>
<p>One man, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Olian_7fad.html" title="Roger Olian">Roger Olian</a>, a sheet-metal foreman at <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Elizabeths_Hospital_8fef.html" title="St. Elizabeths Hospital">St Elizabeth's</a>, a Washington hospital for the mentally ill, was on his way home across the 14th Street bridge in his truck when he heard a man yelling that there was an aircraft in the water. He was the first to jump into the water to attempt to contact the survivors. At the same time, several military personnel from the Pentagon, Steve Raines, Aldo De La Cruz, and Steve Bell, ran down to the water's edge to help Roger.</p>

Someone grabbed some short rope and battery cables and he went out again, maybe only going 30 feet. We pulled him back. Someone had backed up their jeep and we picked him up and put him in there. All anyone could do was tell the survivors was to hold on not to give up hope. There were a few pieces of the plane on shore that were smoldering and you could hear the screams of the survivors. More people arrived near the shore from the bridge but nobody could do anything. The ice was broken up and there was no way to walk out there. It was so eerie, an entire plane vanished except for a tail section, the survivors, and a few pieces of plane debris. The smell of jet fuel was everywhere and you could smell it on your clothes. The snow on the banks was easily two feet high and your legs and feet would fall deep into it every time you moved from the water.</td>

<p>News cameramen watched helplessly from the bridge, being only able to record the disaster for the rest of the world to see. Suddenly hope arrived in the form of a park police helicopter, trailing a lifeline reaching to the outstretched arms of the victims in the water below. The pilot apparently had to navigate by following the freeway out to the Potomac River from the small windows on the bottom of the copter as air visibility was zero at the time. Further compounding the problem was that the disaster location - or exactly what was the disaster - was unknown, as flight controllers were only aware that the plane had disappeared from the runway and did not respond to radio calls, but had no idea what had happened or where the plane was.</p>
<p>At approximately 4:20 p.m. EST, <i>Eagle 1</i>, a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Park_Police_72dc.html" title="United States Park Police">United States Park Police</a> <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_206L-1_5b46.html" title="Bell 206L-1">Bell 206L-1</a> Long Ranger <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopter</a>, N2PP, based at the "Eagles Nest" at <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anacostia_Park_e3cd.html" title="Anacostia Park">Anacostia Park</a> in Washington, D.C. and manned by <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviator.html" title="Aviator">pilot</a> <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_W._Usher_a9cf.html" title="Donald W.

(Gene) Windsor</a> arrived and began attempting to assist the survivors to shore. At great risk to themselves, the crew worked close to the river surface, at one time coming so close to the ice-clogged river that the helicopter's skids went beneath the surface of the water.</p>
<p>The helicopter crew lowered a line to survivors to tow them to shore. First to receive the line, Bert Hamilton, who was treading water about ten feet from the floating tail, took the single lifeline dangling beneath the chopper and passed it under his arms. The others watched while the helicopter carried him a hundred yards to the Virginia shore and returned. The helicopter pilot had to gently move the survivor across the ice, while avoiding the sides of the bridge and keeping an eye on the crowd. By now, some fire rescue had arrived but military personnel and civilians were the key in pulling the survivors from the shore up to the waiting ambulances. The survivors was nearly frozen with ice on their clothes, making them feel like they were 3 times their body weight. It would take 6 people to get each survivor from the shore up to the waiting ambulances. The helicopter returned to the location of the aircraft's tail, and this time a survivor sometimes referred to as "the sixth passenger" (later identified as <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arland_D._Williams_Jr._9904.html" title="Arland D. Williams Jr.">Arland D. Williams Jr.</a>) caught the line. Instead of wrapping it around himself, however, he passed it to flight attendant Kelly Duncan. On its third trip back to the wreckage, the helicopter trailed two lifelines, for its crew knew that survival in the river was now only a matter of minutes. One of the lines was aimed at "the sixth passenger." He caught it again, and again passed it on, this time to Joe Stiley, the most severely injured survivor. Stiley slipped the line around his waist and grabbed Priscilla Tirado, who, having lost her husband and baby, was in complete hysteria. Patricia Felch took the second line, and the helicopter pulled away. Before it reached the shore, however, both Priscilla Tirado and Patricia Felch lost their grip and fell back into the water.</p>

<p>By then one of these passengers, Priscilla Tirado, was too weak to grab the line. A watching bystander, Congressional Budget office assistant <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenny_Skutnik_bb75.html" title="Lenny Skutnik">Lenny Skutnik</a>, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the icy water, and swam out to assist her. The helicopter then proceeded to where Patricia Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor dropped from the safety of the helicopter into the water to attach a line to her. By the time the helicopter crew could return for the sixth passenger, the last survivor, both he and the plane's tail section had disappeared beneath the icy surface. He had been in the paralyzing cold for twenty-nine minutes. His body and those of the other occupants were later recovered. According to the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coroner.html" title="Coroner">coroner</a>, this man, who had passed the lifeline to others, was the only plane passenger to die by drowning.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Transportation_Safety_Board_ed3c.html" title="National Transportation Safety Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> determined that the probable cause of this accident was <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot_error.html" title="Pilot error">pilot error</a> stating that "the flight crew’s failure to use engine anti-ice during ground operation and takeoff, their decision to take off with snow/ice on the airfoil surfaces of the aircraft, and the captain’s failure to reject the takeoff during the early stage when his attention was called to anomalous engine instrument readings.</p>
<p>"Contributing to the accident were the prolonged ground delay between de-icing and the receipt of ATC takeoff clearance during which the aircraft was exposed to continual precipitation, the known inherent pitchup characteristics of the B-737 aircraft when the leading edge is contaminated with even small amounts of snow or ice, and the limited experience of the flight crew in jet transport winter operations."</p>
