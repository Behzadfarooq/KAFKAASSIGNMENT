<p>I've noticed two or three instances where some contributor has inserted comments about the safety of certain types of aircraft. Some of these are certainly justified. For example, the DC-10 had a major problem with the cargo door seal and some hundreds of people were killed. This is relevant, factual information and should be included in the Wikipedia entry on the type. However, the great majority of passenger aircraft types are widely known to have a good record.</p>
<p>Someone with a particular weirdo POV inserted comments in some of the Airbus entries, suggesting that they were unsafe (an assertion that is clearly without evidence or merit). That's fine: I removed the POV comments some time ago and there is no controversy about that.</p>
<p>But now I get to the curly one. Look at the links from <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus_A300_46d5.html" title="Airbus A300">Airbus A300</a>. The last two links contrive to suggest that it is an unsafe aircraft (which it is not) <i>without the contributor actually having to say anything</i>. Now the first link (to a CNN page) is easy: it's an ill-informed tabloid article and the link should be deleted. (I'll leave it for a day or two longer so interested people can have a look first. If you don't understand why it's BS, sing out and I'll provide appropriate details.) But the second link is (a) perfectly valid information from a respectable source, and (b) highly misleading, insofar as the link is made from <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus_A300_46d5.html" title="Airbus A300">Airbus A300</a>, but similar links are <i>not</i> made from (for example) <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_747.html" title="Boeing 747">Boeing 747</a>, or <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_L-1011_3190.html" title="Lockheed L-1011">Lockheed L-1011</a> (two other aircraft types which also have perfectly respectable safety records). I don't like to delete good information, but the placing of this particular link in this particular context <i>without</i> similar links in all the other entries is highly POV and possibly slanderous.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Tannin, I do not see why the first link should be deleted. Any airplane article should have links to relevant press coverage of past accidents. As for the second link, the answer is simple: Add similar links to other airplane articles. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 15:07 Feb 15, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's what I'm afraid someone would say! Three reasons: (a) <i>lots</i> of work to do that, (b) we end up with a whole stack of redundant links to different pages of the same site, (c) we make the aircraft pages look like a roadmap to a graveyard (when in fact the modern passenger aircraft is one of the safest transport technologies ever invented). The first link though is - forgive my technical term here - crap. It's disinformation, not "relevant press coverage". <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></dd>

<dd>Sure, it's not the best solution, that would be to have a detailed article about aircraft safety, with a discussion of different types of aircraft and their safety record, and so on, linked from every aircraft page. But as a temporary solution, it's completely acceptable. Regarding the CNN link, if it's crap, point to a publication that shows why, or explain that in the article. Just removing the link without explanation is not OK. In generally, make statements (and links are a form of statement) NPOV by providing balancing statements, not by removing them. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 15:32 Feb 15, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>as they are grossly misleading. The first link is to an ill-informed tabloid-style CNN story that fails to grasp the key facts. The second one is in itself perfectly reasonable. As I wrote some time ago in the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Talk%7EAirbus_d8d5.html" title="Talk:Airbus">Talk:Airbus</a> page, where someone (presumably the same person) had made an ill-informed and silly POV comment: "The information is valid ... but the positioning of it, sans context, at the very end of the article makes it stand out like the dog's proverbials, and turns a simple statement of fact into a highly POV accusation. The clear implication is that Airbus aircraft are unsafe and kill people - which is entirely unjustified by the facts." Indeed, the A300 has as good a safety record as most airliners and better than quite a few - the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_747.html" title="Boeing 747">Boeing 747</a>, for example, has roughly double the number of passengers killed per passenger mile flown - and no-one with any knowledge of the aircraft industry says that 747s are an unsafe type. (Or A300s, I hasten to add.)</p>
<p>In any case, gross pax killed per kilometre can be a grossly misleading figure. For example, the events of September 11th 2001 - which had nothing whatever to do with the aircraft type - seriously worsened the 767's figures. Roughly 80% of airline accidents have nothing to do with the aircraft itself, but are the result of human error. (The quick and more-or-less accurate summary of airline safety is "choose your airline crew and ATC people, don't worry about the aircraft".) I'll try to find the time to do an entry on air safety sometime soon, and there discuss the matter (air safety in general, I mean, not any particular aircraft type) in appropriate detail. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 13:56 Feb 19, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>It’s not vandalism; I don’t feel that it is appropriate for this article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I feel that particular article speaks only to the assumption of “pilot error” for the crash of Flight 587, not to rudder problems on the A300-600. If you want to discuss rudder problems for that aircraft (and I believe that would be appropriate) then you need to point to more than just Flight 587. To not do so is misleading and irresponsible. - 69.64.214.50 (moved here from my talk page - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Reasonable, and I somewhat agree. We'll see if there's any other support for leaving it in. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 17:42, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm the one that's been reverting it, and after reading the article further, I feel that it addresses, at least in part, the issue earlier in the article for which there was a {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tag, so I've reformatted the link and put it in as a ref there, instead of an EL. The last section of the BBC article, in particular, addresses the combination of pilot action with possible rudder design issues, and since it's a well recognized source, I do not think it is misleading nor irresponsible. And, I agree fully with Bill's comments about good/bad faith. When someone chooses to hide behind an IP address and removes a valid news story that discusses accident blame, and doesn't provide really compelling justification for the removal, it's awfully hard to assume good faith. Frankly, I could care less if an IP editor "doesn't believe" that a story from a major news source is not appropriate. It meets Wikipedia's verifiability standards, directly discusses the issue and is not an editorial, and so therefore is entirely appropriate <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 19:06, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good solution moving it to the text. It's entirely appropriate there, esp as it needed a source anyway. I hope this solve's the user's objections. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 19:19, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you are going to discuss possible problems with the rudder control system on this series of aircraft (and I think it is something that should be examined) you should cite more than one incident or reference (it is misleading, biased and irresponsible) – that is my primary objection with the previous link. The BBC as well as Wikipedia have been cited repeatedly and recently for their inaccuracies as well as other “major news sources”, the responsible thing to do is present multiple reliable, relevant sources of information. I am not hiding behind an IP address – I am using a public computer and my choice to be an unregistered contributor is my choice and I need not explain my reasons, and will do no further. Additionally, I will not engage in Akradecki’s attack on my integrity that is his problem not mine, my intentions are in good faith, period. Bill I appreciate your forum discussion and am satisfied with the reclassification of the information. 69.64.214.50</p>

<dd>Sorry if you think I'm attacking your integrity...you need to be aware that we are swamped with vandalism that originates from IP address and is not accompanied by edit summaries nor by any talk page justifications. You are entitled to your option to remain anon, but be cognizant of how it makes you appear. It's not "my problem", it's a very real problem for those of us who do vandal patrol. If you think the article needs more sources, then add them. This whole project is a result of everyone chipping in to do their part and make the improvement where they see the need. Don't expect others to do your work for you, and don't remove existing refs just to make a point that more are needed. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 20:14, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm questioning the notability of the incidents just added by an IP editor. One of them, occurring on an A310, really doesn't belong in this article, and the others, unless there's a compelling reason to include them, are really minor incidents, and wouldn't merit inclusion in other <a href="../../../a/i/r/WP%7EAIR_f7cf.html" title="WP:AIR">WP:AIR</a> lists either. If we include every minor, non-fatal incident, the list would overwhelm the article. If the incident is really that noteworthy, I suggest the adding editor be asked to create a wikiarticle about it, and then just summarize here. Comments? <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 20:27, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added 3 incidents to this page for the following reasons:</p>
<p>12 May 1997: this incident was cited in the investigation by the pilots association for Flight 587 in contrast to the NTSB’s claim of the excessive use of the rudder – during this incident the rudder inputs were significantly larger and there was no separation of the tail.</p>
<p>27 November 1998: this incident is significant because it was an alternate theory for the crash of Flight 587 that was dismissed by the NTSB and the FAA – both have stated that this phenomenon cannot occur in-flight.</p>
<p>6 March 2005: this incident is very significant because it points to the structural failure of the rudder without adverse pilot inputs.</p>
<p>My desire is to comprehensively discuss the rudder problems of the Airbus 300 series of aircraft, and this is just the beginning. I believe they are all relevant to the Flight 587 incident and thereby equally relevant to the Airbus 300 aircraft. 69.64.214.50</p>

<dd>If that's you're desire, then I would suggest a new article on the subject. It looks like there's ample material and sources. A detailed discussion of the problem really isn't appropriate in an article that's supposed to be an overview of the aircraft type, but I think you'd find broad support in the Aircraft Project for an article of this nature (especially since there was talk at one point about a Task Force to address aviation accidents and safety issues). If you need sandbox space to work in, let me know and I'll make some available to you. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 22:25, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree. Also, the 1997 incidnet is FAR too long, esp for something that landed without further incident. It needs to be cut back drastically, but the info could go in the suggested article. The IP editor seems to be trying to prove a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">POINT</a> about the 2001 incident by adding these non-notable incidents, but this is not the way to do it. Please read <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> carefully.</dd>

<dd>In addition, none of those incidents are sourced. In truth, there are only 4 incidences listed that have Wiki articles, and while all have at least one source, only one has significant sources. None of the other incidents have any sources at all. I will be adding fact tags to those that seem notable (hard to tell without sources), and removing the rest. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 22:41, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have just added the NTSB identification numbers as sources for each incident (I do not know how to provide links to the NTSB reports directly or I would). I strongly feel that if the BBC article is a notable addition to this article than the mention of each of these incidents are as well. They all have an impact on the investigation in to Flight 587. I will continue to collect information to further validate this point for you. 69.64.214.50</dd>

<dd>If you feel the 1997 incident is too long then please parse it, but to omit it I think would be remiss. As far as trying to make a point – I am trying to provide information on the other side of the argument regarding that particular incident. I feel the BBC link is biased. There is a great deal of controversy building regarding the NTSB’s decision on Flight 587 and I merely want to provide balanced information. 69.64.214.50 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.118.193.124_dfdb.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.118.193.124">69.118.193.124</a> (talk) 23:05, 4 April 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>I've made some space at <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_Sandbox2_83fc.html" title="User:Akradecki/Sandbox2">this sandbox</a> for Bill's prunings and for M. IP to work, should he decide to build an article. By the above comment, sounds like POV is becoming an issue here. Wikipedia is not a place to debate issues. However, a factual overview of what others have written on the subject is certainly appropriate. Our use of the BBC article is not an endorsement, but rather a citation of it as a source of information only.
