<p>Is the lack of mention of the controversy surrounding early A320 crashes deliberate? I recall this causing a lot of media attention at the time, in particular the Mulhouse-Habsheim air show crash. --<a href="../../../o/r/o/User%7EOrourkek_c3ba.html" title="User:Orourkek">Orourkek</a> 16:45, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fly-by-wire was new then, the pilot took liberties, attempting dangerous movements at landing altitude; in a conventional airliner the nose will pitch up leading up to a fatal crash, fly-by-wire prevented that, and the aircraft crashed wings level, minimising casualties.

<dd>Not so; the pilot pushed his power controller foward but the computer did not respond (remember there is no direct link between pilot and throttle with fly-by-wire). The pilot cycled his controller which did then result in the throttle opening, but too late. It was most probably due to a fault in the flight control software, but Airbus could never admit that - commercial suicide. With the data recorders having been switched, the accident inquiry could never know that. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> 23:34, Dec 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With flaps fully extended, undercarriage retracted, aircraft below decision height, the pilot is asking for trouble. At least it crashed landed on belly rather than tail first, not forgetting the spool up time for modern fans which is slow. Below decision height, go-around should only be tried after touchdown, turbofans are certificated for that i.e. given enough runaway for acceleration during the time when lift of wings is minimal.

<dd>do you have any sources for the data recorders being switched? (that in itself sounds scandolous)</dd>
<dd>Without the flight recorder data it seems it surely comes down to the pilots word against airbuses. To me it honestly sounds like both were in error but i doubt we will ever know for certain.

<dd>Nope, not not so. The A320 has a fly-by-wire-system (which overrides pilot stupidity) but not power-by-wire (the A380 is the first civilian airliner with that) - it's just plain old hydraulics, which the pilot can control any time. You're just propagating one of the typical incorrect explanations to the crash. If you read the transcript you can even check that the pilot turns off autothrottle (which would've automatically spun up the engines at such an angle of attack but for the demonstration that was obviously not what he wanted to do).</dd>

<dd>I think you may be confused about what "power by wire" means. PBW refers to the flight controls being powered by electrical wires, powering hydraulic pumps at on the controls themselves. This is indeed new on the A380. However, "fly-by-wire engine control" is usually referred to as <a href="../../../f/a/d/FADEC_58a9.html" title="FADEC">FADEC</a>, which has been around for longer than FBW on airliners, and I am almost certain that the A380 as flown in the incident in question had FADEC engines. I know the all current turbofans are FADEC.</dd>

Under ICAO agreement, the final say of any crashes lies with the aviation authority of place of accident. The final verdict therefore lies with the French DGAC. Any objection of other foreign authority is equivalent to the UK aviation authority or anyone else questioning the FAA of any of its conclusion with regards to crashes in the US soil...</p>

<p>[Page break] [Different author now expressing an opinion] The consensus I've heard is that the ill-fated Habsheim airshow A-320's altimeter was faulty. The pilot had planned to perform a straight and level flyby at 100ft AGL but the true altitude from the bottom of the landing gear to the ground was closer to 30ft. At this point the autopilot spooled down the engines. The pilot saw this and frantically fought with the autopilot to throttle up but ran out of time and luck. Then Airbus, fearing a potential commercial disaster on its hands, switched the data box and CVR to blame the pilot.</p>
<p>There's definitely no such consensus. You don't seem to know the difference between the autopilot (which was nothing new or different in the A320) and the fly-by-wire system. The pilot can disengage and override the autopilot at any time and the autopilot only does what the pilot tells it to do (ascend/descend at a certain speed, maintain altitude, maintain heading, land with ILS etc.). The fly-by-wire system, however, controls movements of the control surfaces when the pilot is flying manually and then prevents certain disasterous maneuvers (and also such maneuvers by the autopilot if it - hypothetically - attempted something like that) but it doesn't control the throttle (the autopilot does, when engaged, and then only if the pilot enables it in order to e.g. maintain speed/descent/ascent/etc.). There aren't very many certain disasterous maneuvers and thus the fly-by-wire system rarely overrides the pilot but what it does do is prevent an angle of attack that would cause the aircraft to stall (and that is the only possible override that might have happened in this case) and maneuvers which would result in g-forces in excess of what the aircraft can withstand. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say "refuses to obey the pilot" instead of "overrides". Furthermore it is worth noting that if the pilot (contrary to the CVR) did rely on the autopilot or the altimeter in such a situation it was definitely his fault (the autopilot isn't intended for such purposes and you cannot expect the altimeter to be precise enough).</p>

<p>Does anyone know why the A320's I have flown on all have engines that buzz like a chainsaw -- even at cruise it sounds like you're in an automobile, or diesel bus? 737's don't buzz, md80's don't... I believe it is N1 fan noise. I dont know if it's a rolls royce thing, or the specific type of CFM56-5 thing. it is a curiosity though. --<a href="../../../k/v/u/User%7EKvuo_b2dd.html" title="User:Kvuo">Kvuo</a> 00:52, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Never actually flow on one, but in videos and dvd's and even sim games, it is sort of present</p>
<p>It must be the engines, is there any difference between the CFM56's and the V2500's??</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReedy_Boy_3c7f.html" title="User:Reedy Boy">Reedy Boy</a> 11:56, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The V2500 has a wide chord ratio fan blade much the same as the Rolls-Royce RB211 - both of these engines exhibit a buzz type noise at higher power settings. The CFM 56-3 as fitted to the 737 classic is fitted with narrow chord ratio fan blade with mid span shrouds. This does not create a buzzing noise. Incidently The CFM56-5 is also fitted to many A320's. The buzzing ones are those fitted with the V2500 which has always been considered 'a bit agricultural'. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 194.128.170.12 (<a href="../../../1/9/4/User_talk%7E194.128.170.12.html" title="User talk:194.128.170.12">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_194.128.170.12_3188.html" title="Special:Contributions/194.128.170.12">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Shouldn't the title of this article really by A320 Family?</p>
<p>AS the A319, 321, 318 etc all lead to this page.</p>
<p>I have created a redirect fromt the a320 family page (which i created) to this one, however, i still think this info should be moved there, and this page turned into a redirect?</p>
<p><br />
What does anyone else think</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned they're all derivatives of one single aircraft; the Airbus A320. We don't have a 757 family page just because the 752 and 753 are mentioned in the same article and I don't see why the Airbus A320 should be any different to this. I think it maybe an idea (if not already implemented) to have Airbus A319 and A321 pages linking to the Airbus A320 article however. --81.7.1.201 01:03, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This seems like a strange kind of list for Wikipedia since it is so dynamic, growing as orders are added and subtracting as orders are fulfilled and in the long run the list will be left empty. Wouldn't it make more sense for a list of orders <b>and</b> deliveries, so that as the airplanes are delivered they just move from the order column to the delivered column? --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffW_9f12.html" title="User:JeffW">JeffW</a> 18:41, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think it is best kept the way it is, because if the format you suggested is used then it would be necessary to list orders that have already been fulfilled, e.g. you would have ordered: 10, delivered: 10. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECallumm_bf96.html" title="User:Callumm">Callumm</a> 16:59, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They are in chronological development order. I think this is appropriate as it tells the story of the A320, the initial model, first, and goes in sequence. IMHO this is most apparent with the A318, which heavily draws upon the information provided for the earlier models. It shouldn't be compared with the 737 variants, because numerical order is also development order in that case. —<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph/N328KF</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 13:47, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>"the first fully digital fly-by-wire flight control system in a civil airliner, hence the first with relaxed stability"</p>
<p>you might be jumping the gun in saying the A320 has fbw there for has relaxed stability, something military aircraft had only just been playing footsy with at the time, in fact i think you might find that there is still a debate out, as to wether relaxed stability can be used on civl aircraft, in the event of complete power failure, systems control failure the craft will flip imeadiatly the high g probably tareing the wings off leaving the cabin to plumit to its doom!</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The A320 does NOT have relaxed stability, as in the event of serious computer failure the aircraft can revert to a "direct law" mode where the sidestick directly commands control surface deflections, rather than g loads or roll rates. --81.7.1.201 01:09, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Would it be possible to display the specifications for the IAE V2500-A5 A320-200? The reason I ask is the IAE engine has the majority market share on the A32x and it seems silly to state solely the specifications of the lesser seeling engine.

<p>According to the maximum range, the A320 has a range of 5700km or 3000nm while the A321 has a range of 5600km or 3050nm. It does not make sense that the A320 has a higher km range than the A321 but at the same time a lower nm range. Please check-up on this. --58.69.21.166 14:26, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The A321 can't fly as far as the A320, I know that to be a fact at any particular TOW. A321-200 has a lot more range than the A321-100, enough to allow give it US transcontinental range. I don't have the figures to hand for the A321 or A320 ranges though, sorry. --81.7.1.201 01:07, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The AN-124 is a Fly-by-Wire aircraft which first flew before the A-320. However, the first models were military transports and were only certified as civilian aircraft later, after the first flight of the A-320.

<dd>Service in Aeroflot colors during the Cold War doesn't really count. It was 100% military at the time. Aeroflot had their civil and military sides.

<p>I agree that in 1986 The AN-124 was a military strategic aircraft. However, that same aircraft was later certified (in 1991 I think) as a commercial cargo aircraft. Some of the civilian AN-124-100s flying today are ex-Soviet Air Force Machines. And it is a fly-by-wire aircraft. And it did do its first flight before the A-320 even if at the time, it was not yet a commercial aircraft. Hudicourt 04:35, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it all depends on your point of view. Fly by wire has been around for years; Concorde had full fly-by-wire controls and it flew in 1969 (before the Ruslan was even thought of). The difference is that here we are talking about <i>Digital FBW</i>, rather than the analogue system. To my knowledge the An-124 has only analogue FBW (though my knowledge on Russian types is very limited). Even if the Ruslan has digital FBW, I should think other military types had it before then (in fact I know for a fact the <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avro_Vulcan_142b.html" title="Avro Vulcan">Avro Vulcan</a> did). Even still, the A320 is generally accepted as the first civilian production aircraft to have digital FBW. --81.7.1.201 00:59, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the technology section of the page there is an unreferenced quote to the aircraft being based around an Intel 8086. I have an Airbus manual to hand so I can provide a little more information (what you guys do with it is up to you).</p>
<p>What is being referred to are most likely the SEC (Spoiler and Elevator Computers) which use INTEL 80186 processors (there are 3 SECs on every A320). Wherever this is the "heart of the aircraft" is somewhat debatable, there are many other computers with important functions on the A320, such as the ELACs (Elevator and Aileron Computers) which utilise Motorola 68000 and like the SECs are an integral part of the fly-by-wire system (just two of these).</p>
<p>Data for instrumentation is provided by totally different computers and the graphics for the instruments themselves are generated by another computer. Infact, the number of the computers on the A320 is staggering, with individual computers such as the (cue big list) Braking and Steering Control Unit (BSCU), Flight Management Guidence Computer (FMGC), Flight Augmentation Computers (FAC), Bleed Monitoring Computers (BMC), Display Management Computer (DMC), Flight Warning Computers (FWC), Slats Flaps Control Computer (SFCC) and of course the Full-authority digital engine management computer (FADEC).</p>
