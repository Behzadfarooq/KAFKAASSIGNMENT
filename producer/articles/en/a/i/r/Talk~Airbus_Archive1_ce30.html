<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bias?</span></h2>
<p>What a negative story about Airbus! Suspicions of corruptions and bribery galore. Wouldn't it be better to mention the manufacturer's successful development of the A330 and A340 and also the exciting prospect of the A380 more? Or the fact that in 2003 for the first time Airbus is producing more aircraft than Boeing? Bribery - I'm sure - is also a well-known mechanism in the US (the Dutch royal family came into serious trouble once when they seemed to have accepted bribes from Lockheed in the 1970's), so it's not really exciting to mention that in the Airbus article. <a href="../../../h/w/e/User%7EHwebers_2c9a.html" title="User:Hwebers">hwebers</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">To be verified</span></h2>
<p>I have moved the following text here pending verification:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Questions have been raised about the propriety of the conduct of Airbus. Syrian courts convicted three individuals including two Ministers for ten years for taking over $100 million in illegal commissions from Airbus over the purchase of six passenger jets for Syrian airlines. A former Syrian Prime Minister <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Zuabi_31a2.html" title="Mahmoud Zuabi">Mahmoud Zuabi</a> committed suicide rather than face charges over the Airbus scandal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, Airbus was alleged by Canadian investigative journalist Harvey Cashmore to have paid secret commissions to influence the decision of Air Canadia to purchase $1.9 billion worth of Airbus jets. Cashmore alleged that some $20 million in secret commissions was paid by Airbus to a prominent Canadian lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber. Allegations were made - including by Canada's own Justice Department - that former Canadian Prime Minister <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Mulroney_5ffd.html" title="Brian Mulroney">Brian Mulroney</a> had shared in these commissions. Mulroney later successfully sued the Justice Department saying that he was defamed by the allegations. The judge who mediated the suit said that Mulroney was the victim of a "grievous wrong."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again last year, Airbus was the centre of another investigation involving allegations of bribery. Belgian investigators are inquiring into whether the doubling of the now collapsed Belgian airline Sabena's order from 17 jets to 34 was influenced by any improper motives.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Other scandals involving purchases of Airbus aircraft from Kuwait, India, Saudi Arabia, Mexico have all had the effect of besmirching the good name of Airbus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Politics clearly plays a part in aircraft procurement. For example when Air Mauritius agreed to purchase aircraft from Airbus rather than rival <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a> it suddenly found that it was upgraded from the Orly airport to the main Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris.</dd>

<p>I will plan on adding categories and moving the information around.</p>
<p>I think it needs more information on technology improvements and design differences that set it apart from Boeing; eg. fly by wire, and it's philosophy on making all models similar enough to reduce pilot training.</p>

<dd>I agree. Just as there is a <b>Competition with Boeing</b> segment in the Airbus article, there should at least be a similar segment in the Boeing article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reason for removing the paragraph below</span></h2>
<p>"In October <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Boeing filed a complaint with the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Organization_3f67.html" title="World Trade Organization">World Trade Organization</a>, claiming that Airbus had violated the 1992 bilateral accord when it received what Boeing deems as "unfair" subsidies from the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>. Airbus retaliated by filing another complaint, contesting that Boeing had also violated the accord when it received tax breaks from the U.S. Government. If the <a href="../../../w/t/o/WTO_1c1a.html" title="WTO">WTO</a> arbitrates in this case (once the 60-day period of consultations set by the WTO ends), both companies could face cut-downs in financial aid from their Governments."

<dd>The fact that the two parties have suspended their complaints does not negate the filing of the complaints - it still happened!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reason for removing the paragraph</span></h2>
<p>"Boeing counters that Airbus benefits <b>even more than itself</b> on this charge, since the owners of Airbus, and its affiliated companies are Europe's largest military suppliers."</p>
<p>This does not follow. Boeing's WTO complaint against Airbus is that government launch aid (subisdy) is unfair. Airbus' WTO complaint was that Boeing receives tax breaks and pork barrel military contracts that are in effect subsidy. The line above suggests that Airbus benefits in the same way. THAT IS REDICULOUS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Boeing is the 2nd largest contractor in a country where the government spends $417bn - Airbus partner countries spend $109.3 bn (UK $37.1bn, France $35.0bn, Germany $27.2bn, Spain (estimate) $10bn)</li>
<li>The largest European defence market (the UK) is an open, competitive system (unlike continental Europe or America). Significant portions of the UK procurement budget go to Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Thales (all non-Airbus companies). i.e. the UK partner in Airbus has to compete for its national defence budget far harder than Boeing does for its slice of $400bn!</li>
<li>EADS does have the lion's share of German defence expenditure but this is modest compared to other military budgets around the world.</li>
<li>EADS does have significant sales in France but competes with other companies (principally Thales).</li>
<li>European procurement does not suffer in the same way from the USA's "pork barrel" phenomenon. Congress consistently adds aircraft and projects to the procurement budget that neither the forces or the White House requests with the sole aim of boosting the defence contractors in their local areas.
<ul>
<li>The KC-767 is a prime example of this. The USAF put the replacement of their tanker fleet at the bottom of their list of priorities. Then, after the downturn in civil avation caused by the 9/11/01 attacks, CONGRESS launched the KC-767 to support Boeing. This was also against the backdrop of Boeing losing the largest contract in U.S. aviation history - the JSF.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Airbus' direct military contracts are modest and won in fair competitions.
<ul>
<li>The A330 MRTT has won the UK and Australian competitions in direct compeitions with the KC-767. The A330 was not considered for the USAF contract.</li>
<li>The A400M is a project launched to fufill a genuine requirement and likely to win significant sales around the world. It is not a pork barrel contract in the KC-767 mould.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Government launch aid, justified when Airbus was finding its feet, is unfair given Airbus' success. However I see no reason to deny Airbus such subsidy until Boeing likewise does not benefit from subsidy (tax breaks and pork barrel fodder). That is why the WTO complaints have been aborted - AIRBUS AND BOEING BOTH KNOW THEY WILL BE RULED AGAINST. <a href="../../../h/1/5/User%7EH1523702_6705.html" title="User:H1523702">Mark</a> 01:19, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I believe that it true that one of Boeing's primary complaints about the launch aid is that repayment is contingent - if Airbus doesn't sell enough units, they don't have to repay the loans. If that's true, that is significantly different from the description in the text, which only discusses the low rate. --38.112.11.10 15:30, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This section was hopelessly PoV and unsubstantiated. I removed:</p>
<p>Industry analysts widely attribute this to Airbus’s more efficient product line, compared to many of Boeing's older designs; the 737 for example still uses components designed in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>.The 747 was designed in the late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, and the 757 and 767 were conceived in the late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>.</p>
<p>- as it unsourced and beside the point. Both the 747 and 737 have been extensively redesigned over the years; Airbus's 300 and 310 series are as old as the 757 and 767 lines. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDan100_803a.html" title="User talk:Dan100">Talk)</a> 13:02, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The 737 may be old, but it is wildly popular still and is literally carrying the whole company. The 747 is still attractive, at least till the A380. Its the new designs from Boeings that are less popular&#160;: 757, 767 and also 777. There are persistent stories of air flow problems in the cabin compartments, and it scares passengers and airlines whether they are substantiated or not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The 787 also looks like it may be a miss. But the 747 replacement/A380 competitor should be interesting, as is any supersonic jet in the pipeline.</dd>

<p>Hi, I buy Airliner World, and am therefore able to get Airliner Delivery amounts for each month.</p>
<p>Would someone with some more wiki experience than me be able to do me a table? And then i can add the data for the last few months/last year.</p>

Also, on the airbus analyst pages, there are a list of deliveries and orders for each aircraft/aircraft family. I will also add this to the airliner deliveries section, and rename it to a more appropriate title. Suggestions for this would be good.</p>

Hi, i just changed the total deliveries per month bit for 2005 to reflect that 2005 is not over yet, it was being divided by 12, not 7 (there are data for 7 months shown). Dunno if this is ok or not, it just makes more sense to me to give a more accurate figure.</p>

<dd>Cumulative still doesnt tally. Perhaps if the breakdown by aircraft family is added, it may be possible to reconcile the numbers.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Table formatting</span></h2>
<p>I was looking at the tables, and we currently have 2 types of table formatting.</p>
<p>Would anyone have an problems if i changed them all to the blue topped type?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>This is the old formattning code (minus the ((())) ) I have posted it here, so it can be put back in if needs be</p>
<pre>
border="2" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;" 
</pre>
<p>Will update the tables later</p>

<p><br />
Just a note to say the table 'Product list and details (date information from Airbus)' has been updated with other formating</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The sacred SI banner</span></h2>
<p>Should Airbus defeat Boeing and become the largest aircraft maker with a wide margin, would it mean the aviation industry is finally metricated (as in SI)? Airplanes have no feet or knots so it is time to finally get rid of customary.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would be happy to see SI become the natural system for aircraft specs. However I can't see Airbus ever becoming dramatically bigger than Boeing; I can't remember who, but an Airbus exec said Airbus expects Airbus and Boeing to continue to share the large aircraft market for the forseeable future, with each regaining and losing the no. 1 slot from time to time. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 12:07, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
