<p>Since <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, the federal <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Aeronautics_Board_e136.html" title="Civil Aeronautics Board">Civil Aeronautics Board</a> (CAB) had regulated all domestic <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_transport.html" title="Air transport">air transport</a> as a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_utility.html" title="Public utility">public utility</a>, setting fares, routes, and schedules. The CAB promoted air travel, for instance by generally attempting to hold fares down in the short-haul market, to be subsidized by higher fares in the long-haul market. The CAB was also obliged to ensure that the airlines had a reasonable <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profit.html" title="Profit">rate of return</a>.</p>
<p>It also earned a reputation for bureaucratic complacency; airlines were subject to lengthy delays when applying for new routes or fare changes, which were not often approved. <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Airways_7815.html" title="World Airways">World Airways</a> applied to begin a low-fare <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> route in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>; the CAB studied the request for over six years only to dismiss it because the record was "stale." <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Airlines_a2f8.html" title="Continental Airlines">Continental Airlines</a> began service between <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver%2C_Colorado_0409.html" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_36a0.html" title="San Diego">San Diego</a> after eight years only because a <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Court_of_Appeals_0c1c.html" title="U.S. Court of Appeals">U.S. Court of Appeals</a> ordered the CAB to approve the application.</p>
<p>This rigid system encountered tremendous pressure in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>. The <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973_energy_crisis.html" title="1973 energy crisis">1973 energy crisis</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stagflation.html" title="Stagflation">stagflation</a> radically changed the economic environment, as did technological advances such as the <a href="../../../w/i/d/Wide-body_aircraft.html" title="Wide-body aircraft">jumbo jet</a>. Most of the major airlines, whose profits were virtually guaranteed, favored the system. But passengers forced to pay escalating fares did not, nor communities which subsidized air service at ever-dearer rates. Congress became concerned that air transport in the long run might follow the nation's railroads into trouble; in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penn_Central_9184.html" title="Penn Central">Penn Central</a> railroad had collapsed in what was then the largest <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> in history, resulting in a huge taxpayer bailout in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>.</p>

<p>The stated goals of the Act included</p>
<ul>
<li>the maintenance of safety as the highest priority in air commerce;</li>
<li>placing maximum reliance on competition in providing air transportation services;</li>
<li>the encouragement of air service at major urban areas through secondary or satellite airports;</li>
<li>the avoidance of unreasonable industry concentration which would tend to allow one or more air carriers to unreasonably increase prices, reduce services, or exclude competition; and</li>
<li>the encouragement of entry into air transportation markets by new air carriers, the encouragement of entry into additional markets by existing air carriers, and the continued strengthening of small air carriers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Act intended for various restrictions on airline operations to be removed over four years, with complete elimination of restrictions on domestic routes and new services by <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, and the end of all domestic fare regulation by <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. In practice, changes came rather more rapidly.</p>
<p>Among its many terms, the Act:</p>
<ul>
<li>gradually eliminated the CAB's authority to set fares;</li>
<li>required the CAB to expedite processing of various requests;</li>
<li>liberalized standards for the establishment of new airlines;</li>
<li>allowed airlines to take over service on routes underutilized by competitors or on which the competitor received a local service subsidy;</li>
<li>authorized international carriers to offer domestic service;</li>
<li>placed the evidentiary burden on the CAB for blocking a route as inconsistent with "public convenience";</li>
<li>prohibited the CAB from introducing new regulation of charter trips;</li>
<li>terminated certain subsidies for carrying mail effective <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> and <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essential_Air_Service_f6cf.html" title="Essential Air Service">Essential Air Service</a> subsidies effective ten years from enactment;</li>
<li>terminated existing mutual aid agreements between air carriers;</li>
<li>authorized the CAB to grant <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitrust.html" title="Antitrust">antitrust</a> immunity to carriers;</li>
<li>directed the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Aviation_Administration_0ef7.html" title="Federal Aviation Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> to develop safety standards for commuter airlines;</li>
<li>authorized intrastate carriers to enter into through service and joint fare agreements with interstate air carriers;</li>
<li>required air carriers, in hiring employees, to give preference to terminated or furloughed employees of another carrier for ten years after enactment;</li>
<li>gradually transferred remaining regulatory authority to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Transportation_42db.html" title="United States Department of Transportation">U.S. Department of Transportation</a> (DOT), and dissolved the CAB itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Safety inspections and air traffic control remained in the hands of the FAA, and the act also required the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation_07cc.html" title="United States Secretary of Transportation">Secretary of Transportation</a> to report to Congress concerning <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_safety.html" title="Air safety">air safety</a> and any implications deregulation would have in that matter.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline_Deregulation_Act_3e4d.html" title="Edit section: Effects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Effects</span></h2>
<p>A 1996 Government Accounting Office report found that the average fare per passenger mile was about 9% lower in 1994 than in 1979. Between 1976 and 1990 the paid fare had declined approximately 30% in <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inflation.html" title="Inflation">inflation</a>-adjusted terms. Passenger loads have risen, partly because airlines can now transfer larger aircraft to busier routes and replace them with smaller ones on shorter, low-traffic routes.</p>
<p>However, these benefits of deregulation have not been evenly distributed through the national air transportation network. Costs have fallen more dramatically on heavily trafficked, longer-distance routes than on shorter, lighter ones.</p>
<p>Exposure to competition led to heavy losses and conflicts with <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">labor unions</a> at a number of carriers. Between 1978 and mid-2001 nine major carriers (including <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Air_Lines_a709.html" title="Eastern Air Lines">Eastern</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midway_Airlines_e7cb.html" title="Midway Airlines">Midway</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braniff_International_Airways_21fe.html" title="Braniff International Airways">Braniff</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_American_World_Airways_c80c.html" title="Pan American World Airways">Pan Am</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Airlines_a2f8.html" title="Continental Airlines">Continental</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_West_Airlines_ad51.html" title="America West Airlines">America West Airlines</a>, and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trans_World_Airlines_aa92.html" title="Trans World Airlines">TWA</a>) and over 100 smaller airlines had gone bankrupt or been liquidated—including most of the dozens of new airlines founded in deregulation's aftermath. Mergers and acquisitions among the survivors have created a "Big Six" club of "mega-carriers" and <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oligopoly.html" title="Oligopoly">oligopolistic</a> conditions in many markets.</p>
<p>For the most part, smaller markets did not suffer the loss of service predicted beyond losses projected during regulation. However, until the advent of low-cost carriers, point-to-point transit declined in favor of a more pronounced <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoke-hub_distribution_paradigm.html" title="Spoke-hub distribution paradigm">hub-and-spoke system</a>, meaning they were served with smaller aircraft. While more efficient for serving smaller markets, this system has also allowed some airlines to drive out competition from their "fortress hubs."</p>
<p>The popularity of no-frills airlines such as <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_Express_7cd3.html" title="People Express">People Express</a> and the success of <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low-cost_carrier.html" title="Low-cost carrier">low-cost carriers</a> such as <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Airlines_2156.html" title="Southwest Airlines">Southwest Airlines</a> which do not offer many traditional amenities indicates that a substantial proportion of passengers are more swayed by price than comfort.</p>
<p>Increases in the average level of safety are sometimes attributed to the Act. Since safety regulations remained enforced throughout, and based on the technological improvement of aircraft and <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_traffic_control.html" title="Air traffic control">air traffic control</a>, over time such claims are probably specious.</p>
