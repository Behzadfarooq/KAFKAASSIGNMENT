	    <p><b>Air safety</b> is a broad term encompassing the theory, investigation and categorization of <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents.html" title="Aviation accidents and incidents">flight failures</a>, and the prevention of such failures through appropriate regulation, as well as through education and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel. No matter the speed and economy of any mode of transportation, if it is not perceived and demonstrated as safe, it will find few customers and, with few customers, unless it can still be priced to make a profit, the transportation mode will fail and fade from the scene. The <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airship.html" title="Airship">dirigibles</a> of the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> and '30s provide a good example of this principle.</p>
<p>Balanced against the speed of travel and the convenience of schedule, transportation by air must overcome various phobias of much of the traveling public: fear of heights, enclosed spaces, surrender of control. Human phobias are not a factor with cargo shipments, but if the shipment doesn't arrive safely, the air carrier will find few customers seeking its service.</p>
<p>Air accidents tend to make national, even international, news. In major airliner accidents, hundreds of passengers may be affected. Add to this the number of family members who will be available at the airports at either end of the flight, ready for interviews, providing pictures of anguish on television news and the task before the industry becomes plain.</p>
<p>Therefore, the entire industry and the government bodies who regulate and support it put a great deal of effort into making air transportation not only appear safe, but demonstrating that it is the safest mode of transportation available.</p>

<p>In most countries, civil <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aircraft" class="extiw" title="wikt:aircraft">aircraft</a> have to be certified by the civil aviation authority (CAA) to be allowed to fly. The major aviation authorities worldwide are the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">US</a> <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Aviation_Administration_0ef7.html" title="Federal Aviation Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) the <a href="http://www.easa.eu.int" class="external text" title="http://www.easa.eu.int" rel="nofollow">European Aviation Safety Agency</a> (EASA) (which provides regulatory advice to the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> and to a degree supplanted the regulatory bodies of member countries) and the <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint_Aviation_Authorities_1659.html" title="Joint Aviation Authorities">Joint Aviation Authorities</a> (JAA) which advises the CAAs that are members of the European Civil Aviation Conference). FAA, EASA and JAA collaborate on many issues, especially in order to provide streamlined procedure and avoid conflicting or duplicate requirements. FAA and EASA are, in particular, primarily responsible for the certification of the airliners from the two major manufacturers Boeing and Airbus.</p>
<p>Aircraft are certified against standards set out in the code for each CAA. Those codes are very similar and differ primarily in equipment and environmental standards. Regulations on maintenance, repair and operation provide further direction to the owners of the aircraft so that the aircraft continues to meet design standards.</p>

<p>During the 1920s, the first laws were passed in the USA to regulate civil aviation. Of particular significance was the Air Commerce Act 1926, which required pilots and aircraft to be examined and licensed, for accidents to be properly investigated, and for the establishment of safety rules and navigation aids, under the Aeronautics Branch of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Commerce_1c40.html" title="United States Department of Commerce">Department of Commerce</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this, in 1926 and 1927 there were a total of 24 fatal commercial airline crashes, a further 16 in 1928, and 51 in 1929 (killing 61 people), which remains the worst year on record at an accident rate of about 1 for every 1,000,000 miles flown. Based on the current numbers flying, this would equate to 7,000 fatal incidents per year.</p>
<p>The fatal incident rate has declined steadily ever since, and, since 1997 the number of fatal air accidents has been no more than 1 for every 2,000,000,000 person-miles flown (e.g., 100 people flying a plane for 1000 miles counts as 100,000 person-miles, making it comparable with methods of transportation with different numbers of passengers, such as one person driving a car for 100,000 miles, which is also 100,000 person-miles), making it one of the safest modes of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport.html" title="Transport">transport</a>.</p>
<p>Another aspect of safety is protection from attack (discussed below). The <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_Attacks_53dd.html" title="September 11, 2001 Attacks">terrorist attacks</a> of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> are not counted as accidents. However, even if they were counted as accidents they would have added only about 2 deaths per 2,000,000,000 person-miles. Unfortunately, only 2 months later, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_Flight_587_261e.html" title="American Airlines Flight 587">American Airlines Flight 587</a> crashed in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queens.html" title="Queens">Queens</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">NY</a>, killing 256 people, including 5 on the ground, causing <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> to have a very high fatality rate. Even so, the rate that year including the attacks (estimated here to be about 4 deaths per 1,000,000,000 person-miles), may be relatively safe compared to some other forms of transport.</p>
<p>Safety improvements have resulted from a wide variety of factors, including improved aircraft design, engineering and maintenance, the evolution of navigation aids, and safety protocols and procedures.</p>
<p>It is often reported that air travel is the safest in terms of deaths per passenger mile. The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Transportation_Safety_Board_ed3c.html" title="National Transportation Safety Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> (2006) reports 1.3 deaths per hundred million vehicle miles for travel by car, and 1.7 deaths per hundred million vehicle miles for travel by air <a href="http://hazmat.dot.gov/riskmgmt/riskcompare.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://hazmat.dot.gov/riskmgmt/riskcompare.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. These are not passenger miles. If an airplane has 100 passengers, then the passenger miles are 100 times higher, making the risk 100 times lower. The number of deaths per passenger mile on commercial airlines between 1995 and 2000 is about 3 deaths per 10 billion passenger miles <a href="http://www.iii.org/media/facts/statsbyissue/aviation/?table_sort_735941=9" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iii.org/media/facts/statsbyissue/aviation/?table_sort_735941=9" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_safety.html" title="Edit section: Navigation aids">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Navigation aids</span></h2>
<p>One of the first <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_navigation.html#Navigation_Aids" title="Air navigation">navigation aids</a> to be introduced (in the USA in the late 1920s) was airfield lighting to assist pilots to make landings in poor weather or after dark. The <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precision_Approach_Path_Indicator_8864.html" title="Precision Approach Path Indicator">Precision Approach Path Indicator</a> was developed from this in the 1930s, indicating to the pilot the angle of descent to the airfield. This later became adopted internationally through the standards of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization_93f3.html" title="International Civil Aviation Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO).</p>
<p>With the spread of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> technology, several experimental radio based navigation aids were developed from the late 1920s onwards. These were most successfully used in conjunction with instruments in the cockpit in the form of <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instrument_Landing_System_3ef2.html" title="Instrument Landing System">Instrument Landing Systems</a> (ILS), first used by a scheduled flight to make a landing in a snowstorm at <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_b3a2.html" title="Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a> in 1938. A form of ILS was adopted by the ICAO for international use in 1949.</p>
<p>Following the development of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radar.html" title="Radar">radar</a> in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, it was deployed as a landing aid for civil aviation in the form of <a href="../../../a/p/p/Approach_Control_8311.html" title="Approach Control">Ground Control Approach</a> (GCA) systems, joined in 1948 by <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distance_Measuring_Equipment_83a7.html" title="Distance Measuring Equipment">Distance Measuring Equipment</a> (DME), and in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> by airport surveillance radar as an aid to <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_traffic_control.html" title="Air traffic control">air traffic control</a>. <a href="../../../v/h/f/VHF_omnidirectional_range_753c.html" title="VHF omnidirectional range">VHF omnidirectional range</a> (VOR) became the predominate means of route navigation during the 1960s. The ground based VOR stations were often combined with DME at the same site, so that pilots could know both their radials in degrees w.r.t. north to, and their slant range distance to, that beacon <a href="http://www.campbells.org/Airplanes/VOR/vor.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.campbells.org/Airplanes/VOR/vor.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>All of the ground-based navigation aids are rapidly being supplemented by satellite-based aids like <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Positioning_System_428c.html" title="Global Positioning System">GPS</a>, which make it possible for aircrews to know their position with great precision anywhere in the world. With the arrival of <a href="../../../w/i/d/Wide_Area_Augmentation_System_6861.html" title="Wide Area Augmentation System">Wide Area Augmentation System</a> (WAAS), GPS navigation has become accurate enough for vertical (altitude) as well as horizontal use, and is being used increasingly for instrument approaches as well as en-route navigation. However, since the GPS constellation is a single-point of failure that can be switched off by the U.S. military in time of crisis, ground-based navigation aids are still required for backup.</p>

<p><a name="Lightning" id="Lightning"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_safety.html" title="Edit section: Lightning">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lightning</span></h3>
<p>Boeing studies have shown that airliners are struck by lightning on average of twice per year. While the "flash and bang" can be dramatic and startling to the passengers and crew, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft.html" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> are able to withstand normal lightning strikes.</p>
<p>The dangers of more powerful <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightning.html#Positive_lightning" title="Lightning">positive lightning</a> were not understood until the destruction of a glider in 1999 <a href="http://www.aaib.gov.uk/publications/bulletins/december_1999/schleicher_500699.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aaib.gov.uk/publications/bulletins/december_1999/schleicher_500699.cfm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. It has since been suggested that positive lightning may have caused the crash of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_American_World_Airways_c80c.html" title="Pan American World Airways">Pan Am</a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_Am_Flight_214_0c31.html" title="Pan Am Flight 214">Flight 214</a> in 1963. At that time aircraft were not designed to withstand such strikes, since their existence was unknown at the time standards were set.</p>
<p>The effects of normal lightning on traditional metal-covered aircraft are well understood and serious damage from a lightning strike on an airplane is rare. However, as more and more aircraft, like the upcoming <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_787.html" title="Boeing 787">Boeing 787</a>, whose whole exterior is made of non-conducting composite materials take to the skies, additional design effort and testing must be made before certification authorities will permit these aircraft in commercial service.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_safety.html" title="Edit section: Ice and snow">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ice and snow</span></h3>
<p>Snowy and icy conditions are frequent contributors to airline accidents. The <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_8.html" title="December 8">December 8</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> accident where <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Airlines_Flight_1248_8bb0.html" title="Southwest Airlines Flight 1248">Southwest Airlines Flight 1248</a> slid off the end of the runway in heavy snow conditions is just one of many examples. Just as on a <a href="../../../r/o/a/Road.html" title="Road">road</a>, ice and snow buildup can make braking and steering difficult or impossible if severe enough.</p>
<p>The icing of wings is another common problem that is well known and measures have been developed to combat it. The greatest concern regarding icing is that even a small amount of ice or coarse frost can greatly decrease the ability of a wing to develop lift. This could prevent an otherwise capable aircraft from safely taking off. If ice builds up during flight the result can be catastrophic as evidenced by the crash of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Eagle_Airlines_c4b3.html" title="American Eagle Airlines">American Eagle</a> <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Eagle_Flight_4184_3c7e.html" title="American Eagle Flight 4184">Flight 4184</a> (an <a href="../../../a/t/r/ATR-72_ad66.html" title="ATR-72">ATR-72</a> aircraft) near <a href="../../../r/o/s/Roselawn%2C_Indiana_7b8a.html" title="Roselawn, Indiana">Roselawn, Indiana</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_31.html" title="October 31">October 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, killing 68. <a href="http://www.airlinesafety.com/letters/atr.htm/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.airlinesafety.com/letters/atr.htm/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Airlines and airports expend considerable effort to ensure that aircraft are properly de-iced before takeoff whenever the weather threatens to create icing conditions. Modern airliners are designed to prevent ice buildup on wings, engines, and tails by either routing heated air from jet engines through the leading edges of the wing, tail, and inlets, or on slower aircraft, by use of inflatable rubber "boots" that expand and break off any accumulated ice.</p>
<p>Finally, airline dispatch offices keep close watch on weather along the routes of their flights, helping the pilots avoid the worst of possible inflight icing conditions. Pilots can also be equipped with an <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_detector.html" title="Ice detector">ice detector</a> in order to leave icy areas they have inadvertently flown into.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_safety.html" title="Edit section: Engine failure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Engine failure</span></h3>
<p>Although aircraft are now designed to fly even after the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flameout.html" title="Flameout">failure</a> of one or more <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_engine.html" title="Aircraft engine">aircraft engines</a>, the failure of the second <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engine.html" title="Engine">engine</a> on one side for example is obviously serious. Losing all engine power is even more serious, as illustrated by the 1970 <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominicana_DC-9_air_disaster_a94e.html" title="Dominicana DC-9 air disaster">Dominicana DC-9 air disaster</a>, when <a href="../../../f/u/e/Fuel.html" title="Fuel">fuel</a> contamination caused the failure of both engines. To have an <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_landing.html" title="Emergency landing">emergency landing</a> place is then very important.</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/o/m/Composite_material.html" title="Composite material">Composite materials</a> consist of layers of fibers embedded in a resin matrix. In some cases, especially when subjected to cyclic stress, the fibers may tear off the matrix, the layers of the material then separate from each other - a process called <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delamination.html" title="Delamination">delamination</a>, and form a <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mica.html" title="Mica">mica</a>-like structure which then falls apart. As the failure develops inside the material, nothing is shown on the surface; instrument methods (often <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultrasound.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a>-based) have to be used.</p>
<p>Numerous modern aircraft have developed delamination problems, but most were discovered before they caused a catastrophic failure. Delamination risk is as old as composite material. Even in the 1940s, several <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yak-9.html" title="Yak-9">Yak-9s</a> experienced delamination of <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plywood.html" title="Plywood">plywood</a> in their construction.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_safety.html" title="Edit section: Fire">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fire</span></h3>
<p>Safety regulations control aircraft materials and the requirements for automated fire safety systems. Usually these requirements take the form of required tests. The tests measure flammability and the toxicity of smoke. When the tests fail, they fail on a prototype in an engineering laboratory, rather than in an aircraft.</p>
<p>Fire on board the aircraft, and more especially the toxic <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoke.html" title="Smoke">smoke</a> generated, have been the cause of several incidents. An electrical fire on <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Canada_Flight_797_04d6.html" title="Air Canada Flight 797">Air Canada Flight 797</a> in 1983 caused the deaths of 23 of the 46 passengers, resulting in the introduction of floor level lighting to assist people to evacuate a smoke-filled aircraft. Two years later a fire on the runway caused the loss of 53 lives, 48 from the effects of smoke, in the 1985 <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_air_disaster.html" title="Manchester air disaster">Manchester air disaster</a>. This incident raised serious concerns over the standard aircraft emergency evacuation time of ninety seconds, and calls for the introduction of <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoke_hood.html" title="Smoke hood">smoke hoods</a> or misting systems although both were rejected. It did result in the introduction of revised overwing emergency exit doors on certain new aircraft, and a small increase in the spacing between seats next to the emergency exit.</p>
<p>The cargo holds of most airliners are equipped with "fire bottles" (essentially remote-controlled fire extinguishers) to combat a fire that might occur in with the baggage and freight below the passenger cabin. This was due to a terrible accident in 1996. In May of that year a <a href="../../../v/a/l/ValuJet_d288.html" title="ValuJet">ValuJet</a> <a href="../../../d/c/-/DC-9_3680.html" title="DC-9">DC-9</a> crashed into the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everglades.html" title="Everglades">Everglades</a> a few minutes after takeoff after a fire broke out in the forward cargo hold. All 110 aboard were killed.</p>
<p>The investigation determined that improperly packaged <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_oxygen_generator.html" title="Chemical oxygen generator">chemical oxygen generators</a> (used for the drop-down oxygen masks in the aircraft cabin) had been loaded into the cargo hold. Oxygen generators produce oxygen through a chemical reaction that also generates hundreds of degrees of heat. When installed for use in the ceiling above the passenger seats they are surrounded by heat-resistant shielding and present no fire hazard. On this flight they had been put loosely into a cardboard box for shipment from a maintenance facility. It is likely that one or more of the generators ignited, during or immediately after takeoff, producing an oxygen-rich environment. The cardboard box containing the generators would have quickly caught fire from the heat of the ignited generator. The fire spread to an aircraft tire that was also carried in the hold. Ordinarily the fire would have smothered itself, because of the airtight design of that cargo compartment. But the oxygen generators kept feeding oxygen to the fire, defeating the smothering design of the DC-9 cargo hold. The fire rapidly burned through the passenger cabin floor, incapacitating all aboard with smoke and poisonous gases very quickly. The pilots, although having smoke masks and separate oxygen supplies, had no hope of maintaining control as control cables and electrical wiring burned through.</p>
<p>The maintenance facility (SabreTech) was subjected to large fines and ValuJet, due to this accident and other irregularities, was grounded. The airline reemerged as a smaller airline and eventually merged with <a href="../../../a/i/r/AirTran_c1dc.html" title="AirTran">AirTran</a>, a smaller carrier. Adopting the acquired airline's name, the airline has since provided safe service. For the airline industry, rules for the shipment of oxygen generators was severely restricted and cargo holds on larger airliners were required to have "fire bottles" installed.</p>
<p>At one time <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefighting.html" title="Firefighting">firefighting</a> <a href="../../../f/o/a/Foam_path.html" title="Foam path">foam paths</a> were laid down before an emergency landing, but the practice was considered only marginally effective, and concerns about the depletion of firefighting capability due to pre-foaming led the United States FAA to withdraw its recommendation in 1987.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_safety.html" title="Edit section: Bird strike">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bird strike</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird_strike.html" title="Bird strike">Bird strike</a> is an aviation term for a collision between a bird and an aircraft. It is a common threat to aircraft safety and has caused a number of fatal accidents. In 1988 an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopian_Airlines_59f7.html" title="Ethiopian Airlines">Ethiopian Airlines</a> <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_737.html" title="Boeing 737">Boeing 737</a> sucked pigeons into both engines during take-off and then crashed in an attempt to return to the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahir_Dar_c075.html" title="Bahir Dar">Bahir Dar</a> airport; of the 104 people aboard, 35 died and 21 were injured. In another incident in 1995, a <a href="../../../d/a/s/Dassault_Falcon_5556.html" title="Dassault Falcon">Dassault Falcon 20</a> crashed at a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> airport during an emergency landing attempt after sucking <a href="../../../l/a/p/Lapwings.html" title="Lapwings">lapwings</a> into an engine, which caused an engine failure and a fire in the airplane fuselage; all 10 people on board were killed. <a href="http://www.icao.int/icao/en/jr/5308_ar1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icao.int/icao/en/jr/5308_ar1.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>Modern jet engines have the capability of surviving an ingestion of a bird. Small fast planes, such as military jet fighters, are at higher risk than big heavy multi-engine ones.</p>
<p>The highest risk of the bird strike is during the takeoff and landing, in low altitudes, which is in the vicinity of the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airport.html" title="Airport">airports</a>. Some airports use active countermeasures, ranging from a person with a shotgun through recorded sounds of predators to employing <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falconry.html" title="Falconry">falconers</a>. Poisonous grass can be planted that is not palatable to birds, nor to insects that attract insectivorous birds. Passive countermeasures involve sensible land-use management, avoiding conditions attracting flocks of birds to the area (eg. <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landfill.html" title="Landfill">landfills</a>).</p>
<p><a name="Ground_damage" id="Ground_damage"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_safety.html" title="Edit section: Ground damage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ground damage</span></h3>
<p>Aircraft are often victims of damage caused by ground equipment at the airport. In the act of servicing the aircraft between flights a great deal of ground equipment must operate in close proximity to the fuselage and wings. Occasionally the aircraft gets bumped or worse.</p>
<p>Damage may be in the form of simple scratches in the paint or small dents in the skin. However, because aircraft structures (including the outer skin) play such a critical role in the safe operation of a flight, all damage is inspected, measured and possibly tested to ensure that any damage is within safe tolerances. A dent that may look no worse than common "parking lot damage" to an automobile can be serious enough to ground an airplane until a repair can be made.</p>
<p>An example of the seriousness of this problem was the <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_26.html" title="December 26">December 26</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> depressurization incident on an <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Airlines_ba09.html" title="Alaska Airlines">Alaska Airlines</a> <a href="../../../m/d/-/MD-83_d55d.html" title="MD-83">MD-83</a> aircraft. During ground services a ramp worker hit the side of the aircraft with a piece of ground equipment. This created a crease in the metal skin. This damage was not reported and the plane departed. Climbing through 26,000 feet the crease in the metal gave way due to the growing difference in pressure between the inside of the aircraft and the outside air. The cabin depressurized with a bang, frightening all aboard and necessitating a rapid descent back to denser (breathable) air and an emergency landing.</p>
<p>The three pieces of ground equipment that most frequently damage aircraft are the passenger boarding bridge, catering trucks, and cargo "beltloaders'. However, any other equipment found on an airport ramp can damage an aircraft through careless use, high winds, mechanical failure, and so on.</p>
<p>The generic industry colloquial term for this damage is "ramp rash."</p>
<p><a name="Volcanic_ash" id="Volcanic_ash"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_safety.html" title="Edit section: Volcanic ash">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Volcanic ash</span></h3>
<p>Plumes of <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volcanic_ash.html" title="Volcanic ash">volcanic ash</a> near active volcanoes present a risk especially for night flights. The ash is hard and abrasive and can quickly cause significant wear on the propellers and turbocompressor blades, and scratch the cabin windows, impairing visibility. It contaminates fuel and water systems, can jam gears, and can cause a flameout of the <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_engine.html" title="Jet engine">engines</a>. Its particles have low melting point, so they melt in the combustion chamber and the ceramic mass then sticks on the turbine blades, fuel nozzles, and the combustors, which can lead to a total engine failure. It can get inside the cabin and contaminate everything there, and can damage the airplane electronics. <a href="http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/Effects/Ash+Aircraft.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/Effects/Ash+Aircraft.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>There are many instances of damage to jet aircraft from ash encounters. In one of them in 1982, a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Airways_Flight_9_8f17.html" title="British Airways Flight 9">British Airways Boeing 747</a> flew through an ash cloud, lost all four engines, and descended from 36,000 feet to only 12,000 feet before the <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_crew.html" title="Flight crew">flight crew</a> managed to restart the engines.</p>
<p>With the growing density of air traffic, encounters like this are becoming more common. In 1991 the aviation industry decided to set up Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs), one for each of 9 regions of the world, acting as liaisons between <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meteorologist.html" title="Meteorologist">meteorologists</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volcanologist.html" title="Volcanologist">volcanologists</a>, and the aviation industry. <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs030-97/" class="external autonumber" title="http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs030-97/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>

<p><a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_factors.html" title="Human factors">Human factors</a> including pilot <a href="../../../e/r/r/Error.html" title="Error">error</a> are another potential danger, and currently the most common factor of aviation crashes.

However, there has been progress in safety throughout the history of aviation, such as the development of the pilot's <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checklist.html" title="Checklist">checklist</a> in 1937 <a href="http://www.ama500.jccbi.gov/afss/History/checklst.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ama500.jccbi.gov/afss/History/checklst.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Pilot error and improper communication are often factors in the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collision.html" title="Collision">collision</a> of aircraft. This can take place in the air (1978 <a href="../../../p/s/a/PSA_Flight_182_f48e.html" title="PSA Flight 182">PSA Flight 182</a>) or on the ground (1977 <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenerife_disaster.html" title="Tenerife disaster">Tenerife disaster</a>). The ability of the flight crew to maintain <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situation_awareness.html" title="Situation awareness">situation awareness</a> is a critical human factor in air safety.</p>
<p>Failure of the pilots to properly monitor the flight instruments resulted in the crash of <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_401_5f80.html" title="Eastern Air Lines Flight 401">Eastern Air Lines Flight 401</a> in 1972, and error during take-off and landing can have catastrophic consequences, for example cause the crash of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prinair_Flight_191_4a9d.html" title="Prinair Flight 191">Prinair Flight 191</a> on landing, which also in 1972.</p>
<p>Rarely, flight crew members are arrested or subject to disciplinary action for being intoxicated on the job. In 1990, three <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_Airlines_ad36.html" title="Northwest Airlines">Northwest Airlines</a> crew members were sentenced to jail for flying from <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fargo%2C_North_Dakota_bb73.html" title="Fargo, North Dakota">Fargo, North Dakota</a> to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis-St._Paul_International_Airport_ef05.html" title="Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport">Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport</a> while drunk. In 2001, Northwest fired a pilot who failed a breathalyzer test after flying from <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio%2C_Texas_74ae.html" title="San Antonio, Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a> to Minneapolis-St. Paul. In July 2002, two America West pilots were arrested just before they were scheduled to fly from <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami%2C_Florida_f9df.html" title="Miami, Florida">Miami, Florida</a> to <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix%2C_Arizona_97f7.html" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a> because they had been drinking alcohol.

The incident created a public relations problem and America West has become the object of many jokes about drunk pilots. While these drunk-flying incidents did not result in crashes, they underscore the role that poor human choices can play in air accidents.</p>
<p>Human factors incidents are not limited to errors by the pilots. The failure to close a cargo door properly on <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Airlines_Flight_981_c59e.html" title="Turkish Airlines Flight 981">Turkish Airlines Flight 981</a> in 1974 resulted in the loss of the aircraft - however the design of the cargo door latch was also a major factor in the incident. In the case of <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan_Airlines_Flight_123_04df.html" title="Japan Airlines Flight 123">Japan Airlines Flight 123</a>, improper maintenance resulted in the loss of the vertical stabilizer.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_flight_into_terrain.html" title="Controlled flight into terrain">Controlled flight into terrain</a> (CFIT) is a class of accident in which an undamaged aircraft is flown, under control, into terrain. CFIT accidents typically are a result of pilot error or of navigational system error. Some pilots, convinced that advanced electronic navigation systems such as <a href="../../../g/p/s/GPS_8c57.html" title="GPS">GPS</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/s/INS_77dd.html" title="INS">INS</a> coupled with <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_management_system.html" title="Flight management system">Flight Management System</a> computers , or over-relianced on them, are partially responsible for these accidents, have called CFIT accidents "computerized flight into terrain". Failure to protect Instrument Landing System <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critical_areas.html" title="Critical areas">critical areas</a> can also cause controlled flight into terrain. Crew awareness and monitoring of navigational systems can prevent or eliminate CFIT accidents. <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crew_Resource_Management_d63c.html" title="Crew Resource Management">Crew Resource Management</a> is a modern method now widely used to improve the human factors of air safety. The <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviation_Safety_Reporting_System_914a.html" title="Aviation Safety Reporting System">Aviation Safety Reporting System</a>, or ASRS is another.</p>
<p>Other technical aids can be used to help pilots maintain situational awareness. A <a href="../../../g/r/o/Ground-collision_warning_system.html" title="Ground-collision warning system">ground-collision warning system</a> is an on-board system that will alert a pilot if the aircraft is about to fly into the ground. Also, air traffic controllers constantly monitor flights from the ground and at airports.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a> can also be considered a human factor. Crews are normally trained to handle hijack situations. Prior to the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, hijackings involved hostage negotiations. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, stricter measures are in place to prevent terrorism using passenger screening technology, air marshals, and precautionary policies. In addition, counter-terrorist organizations monitor potential terrorist activity.</p>
<p>Although most air crews are screened for psychological fitness, some may take suicidal actions. In the case of <a href="../../../e/g/y/EgyptAir_Flight_990_d51d.html" title="EgyptAir Flight 990">EgyptAir Flight 990</a>, it appears that the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_officer.html" title="First officer">first officer</a> (co-pilot) deliberately dove his aircraft into the Atlantic Ocean while the captain was away from his station, in 1999 off Nantucket, MA, USA. Motivations are unclear, but recorded inputs from the black boxes showed no mechanical problem, no other aircraft in the area, and was corroborated by the voice cockpit recorder.</p>
<p>The use of certain electronic equipment is partially or entirely prohibited as it may interfere with aircraft operation, such as causing <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass.html" title="Compass">compass</a> deviations. Use of personal electronic devices and <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculator.html" title="Calculator">calculators</a> may be prohibited when an aircraft is taking off or landing. The American FCC prohibits the use of a <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_phone.html" title="Cell phone">cell phone</a> on most flights, because in-flight usage creates problems with ground-based cells. There is also concern about possible interference with aircraft navigation systems, although that has never been proven to be a serious risk on airliners. A few flights now allow use of cell phones, where the aircraft have been specially wired and certified to meet both FAA and FCC regulations.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_safety.html" title="Edit section: Airport design">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Airport design</span></h3>
<p>Airport design and location can have a big impact on air safety, especially since some airports such as <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Midway_International_Airport_d392.html" title="Chicago Midway International Airport">Chicago Midway International Airport</a> were originally built for propeller planes and many airports are in congested areas where it is difficult to meet newer safety standards. For instance, the FAA issued rules in 1999 calling for a Runway Safety Area, usually extending 500 feet to each side and 1000 feet beyond the end of a runway. This is intended to cover ninety percent of the cases of an aircraft leaving the runway by providing a buffer space free of obstacles. Since this is a recent rule, many airports do not meet it. One method of substituting for the 1000 feet at the end of a runway for airports in congested areas is to install an <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineered_Materials_Arrestor_System_65c8.html" title="Engineered Materials Arrestor System">Engineered Materials Arrestor System</a>, or EMAS. These systems are usually made of a lightweight, crushable concrete that absorbs the energy of the aircraft to bring it to a rapid stop.
