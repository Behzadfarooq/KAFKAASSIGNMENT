<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airspace_class.html" title="Edit section: ICAO definitions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">ICAO definitions</span></h2>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_12.html" title="March 12">March 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, ICAO adopted the current airspace classification scheme. The classes are fundamentally defined in terms of flight rules and interactions between <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft.html" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_traffic_control.html" title="Air traffic control">Air Traffic Control</a> (ATC). Some key concepts are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/p/Separation_%28air_traffic_control%29.html" title="Separation (air traffic control)">Separation</a>: Maintaining a specific minimum distance between an aircraft and another aircraft or terrain to avoid collisions, normally by requiring aircraft to fly at set levels or level bands, on set routes or in certain directions, or by controlling an aircraft's speed.</li>
<li>Clearance: Permission given by ATC for an aircraft to proceed under certain conditions contained within the clearance.</li>
<li>Traffic Information: Information given by ATC on the position and, if known, intentions of other aircraft likely to pose a hazard to flight.</li>
</ul>
<p>The classifications adopted by ICAO are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_A_airport_ddd3.html" title="Class A airport">Class A</a>: All operations must be conducted under <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instrument_flight_rules.html" title="Instrument flight rules">Instrument Flight Rules</a> (IFR) or <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_visual_flight_rules.html" title="Special visual flight rules">Special visual flight rules</a> (SVFR) and are subject to ATC clearance. All flights are separated from each other by ATC.</li>
<li>Class B: Operations may be conducted under IFR, SVFR, or <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_flight_rules.html" title="Visual flight rules">Visual flight rules</a> (VFR). All aircraft are subject to ATC clearance. All flights are separated from each other by ATC.</li>
<li>Class C: Operations may be conducted under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. All aircraft are subject to ATC clearance. Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated from each other and from flights operating under VFR. Flights operating under VFR are given traffic information in respect of other VFR flights.</li>
<li>Class D: Operations may be conducted under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. All aircraft are subject to ATC clearance. Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated from each other, and are given traffic information in respect of VFR flights. Flights operating under VFR are given traffic information in respect of other VFR flights.</li>
<li>Class E: Operations may be conducted under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated from each other, and are subject to ATC clearance. Flights under VFR are not subject to ATC clearance. As far as is practical, traffic information is given to all flights in respect of VFR flights.</li>
<li>Class F: Operations may be conducted under IFR or VFR. ATC separation will be provided, so far as practical, to aircraft operating under IFR. Traffic Information may be given as far as is practical in respect of other flights.</li>
<li>Class G: Operations may be conducted under IFR or VFR. ATC separation is not provided. Traffic Information may be given as far as is practical in respect of other flights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Classes A-E are referred to as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_airspace.html" title="Controlled airspace">controlled airspace</a>. Classes F and G are <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncontrolled_airspace.html" title="Uncontrolled airspace">uncontrolled airspace</a>.</p>
<p>As of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, ICAO is considering a proposal to reduce the number of airspace classifications to three, which roughly correspond to the current classes C, E and G.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airspace_class.html" title="Edit section: Use of airspace classes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Use of airspace classes</span></h2>
<p>Each national aviation authority determines how it uses the ICAO classifications in its airspace design. In some countries, the rules are modified slightly to fit the airspace rules and air traffic services that existed before the ICAO standardisation.</p>
<p><a name="United_States" id="United_States"></a></p>

<div class="noprint"><i>Main article: <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airspace_class_%28United_States%29_f5d0.html" title="Airspace class (United States)">Airspace class (United States)</a></i></div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> adopted a slightly modified version of the ICAO system on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_16.html" title="September 16">September 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, when regions of airspace designated according to older classifications were converted wholesale. The exceptions are some Terminal Radar Service Areas (TRSA), which have special rules and still exist in a few places.</p>
<p>With some exceptions, Class A airspace is applied to all airspace between 18,000 feet and <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_level.html" title="Flight level">Flight Level</a> 600 (approximately 60,000 feet). Above FL600, the airspace reverts to Class G not Class E (Reference Order 7400.9P). The transition altitude (see <i><a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_level.html" title="Flight level">Flight level</a></i>) is also consistently 18,000 feet. All operations in US Class A airspace must be conducted under IFR. SVFR flight in Class A airspace is prohibited.</p>
<p>Class B airspace is used around major <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airport.html" title="Airport">airports</a>, in a funnel shape that is designed to contain arriving and departing commercial air traffic operating under IFR, up to 10,000 feet above <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_level.html" title="Sea level">MSL</a> (12,000 feet above <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver%2C_Colorado_0409.html" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a>). Class C airspace is used around airports and military air bases with a moderate traffic level. Class D is used for smaller airports that have a control tower. The U.S. uses a modified version of the ICAO class C and D airspace, where only radio contact with ATC rather than an ATC clearance is required for VFR operations.</p>
<p>Other controlled airspace is designated as Class E - this includes a large part of the lower airspace.</p>
<p>The U.S. does not use ICAO Class F.</p>
<p>Class G airspace (Uncontrolled) is mostly used for a small layer of airspace near the ground, but there are larger areas of Class G airspace in remote regions.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airspace_class.html" title="Edit section: Canada">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Canada</span></h3>
<p>Canada generally follows the United States in application of airspace with some differences. For example, Canadian class "C" airspace is procedurally equivalent to United States class "B" airspace. Additionally, the term "Class F" is used for Special Use Airspace, which occasionally causes confusion in discussions.</p>

<p>All remaining airspace, comprising by far the largest part of the airspace below FL 195. The UK is unusual in that IFR flight in Class G airspace is relatively common and ATC units may provide an "as far as is practical" form of separation between some such flights.</p>
<p>In addition the UK has a couple of special classes of airspace that do not fall within the ICAO classes:</p>
<p><b>Aerodrome Traffic Zones</b> (ATZ) are zones of between 1.5nm and 2.5nm from the surface to 2,000ft AAL set up around an airport, where aircraft must obey the instructions of the tower controller (if present), must make radio contact with the Information Officer or Air/Ground radio unit on the airport before entering the zone (in the case of an uncontrolled airfield), or must obey ground signals if non-radio.</p>
<p><b>Military Air Traffic Zones</b> (MATZ) are zones from the surface to 3,000ft AAL set up around military air bases in class G airspace. Military aircraft treat these as if they are controlled airspace; civilian traffic is advised but not obliged to do the same.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airspace_class.html" title="Edit section: Australia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Australia</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> has adopted a civil airspace system based on the United States National Airspace System (NAS):</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Class A</i> is used above FL180 along the populated coastal areas, and above FL245 elsewhere.</li>
<li><i>Class B</i> is not used.</li>
<li><i>Class C</i> is used in a 360° funnel shape in the Terminal Control Zones of the major international airports, extending up to the base of the Class A, generally at FL180 over these airports. It also overlies Class D airspace at smaller airports.</li>
<li><i>Class D</i> is used for the Terminal Control Zones of medium sized airports, extending from the surface up to 4500 feet. Above this, Class C airspace is used, although generally only in an a sector, and not 360° around the airport.</li>
<li><i>Class E</i> is used along the populated coastal areas, from 8500 feet to the base of the overlying Class A or Class C airspace.</li>
<li><i>Class F</i> is not used.</li>
<li><i>Class G</i> is used wherever other classes are not - almost always from the surface to the base of the overlying Class A, C, D or E airspace.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Australia has a non-standard class of airspace for use at the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_capital_cities_ac5a.html" title="List of Australian capital cities">capital city</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_aviation.html" title="General aviation">general aviation</a> airports, called a General Aviation Airport Procedures Zone (GAAP Zone). A control tower provides procedural clearances for all aircraft inside the zone. Additionally, any aircraft operating within 5nm of the zone must obtain a clearance. VFR aircraft arrive and depart using standard arrival and departure routes, while instrument arrival and departure procedures are published for IFR operations. During VMC, IFR aircraft are not provided with full IFR services. During IMC, or marginal VMC, VFR operations are restricted in order to facilitate full IFR service for IFR aircraft.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airspace_class.html" title="Edit section: Airspace classes and VFR">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Airspace classes and VFR</span></h2>
<p>Authorities use the ICAO definitions to derive additional rules for VFR cloud clearance, visibility, and equipment requirements.</p>
<p>For example, consider Class E airspace. An aircraft operating under VFR may not be in communication with ATC, so it is imperative that its pilot be able to see and avoid other aircraft (and vice versa). That includes IFR flights emerging from a cloud, so the VFR flight must keep a designated distance from the edges of clouds above, below, and laterally, and must maintain at least a designated visibility, to give the two aircraft time to observe and avoid each other. The low-level speed limit of 250 <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knot_%28speed%29.html" title="Knot (speed)">knots</a> does not apply above 10,000 feet, so the visibility requirements are higher.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in Class B airspace, separation is provided by ATC to all flights. Now the VFR flight only needs to see where it is going, so visibility requirements are reduced and there is no designated minimum distance from clouds.</p>
<p>Similar considerations determine whether a VFR flight must use a two-way <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> and/or a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transponder.html" title="Transponder">transponder</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airspace_class.html" title="Edit section: Special-use Airspace">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Special-use Airspace</span></h2>
<p>Each national authority designates areas of special use airspace (SUA), primarily for reasons of national security. This is not a separate classification from the ATC-based classes; each piece of SUA is contained in one or more zones of letter-classed airspace.</p>
<p>SUAs range in restrictiveness, from areas where flight is always prohibited except to authorized aircraft, to areas that are not charted but are used by military for potentially hazardous operations (in this case, the onus is on the military personnel to avoid conflict).
