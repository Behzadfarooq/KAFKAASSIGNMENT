<p>The arrival of British forces to Greece in September 1944 brought with it the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a>. The airfield at <a href="../../../a/r/a/Araxos.html" title="Araxos">Araxos</a> became the first foothold, being captured on 23 September 1944 and many airfields around it were secured within a month, including <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megara.html" title="Megara">Megara</a> taken by parachute landings of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Parachute_Regiment_8bc1.html" title="The Parachute Regiment">4 Para</a>. Near <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalamaki.html" title="Kalamaki">Kalamaki</a> ultimately became the center of RAF activity, renamed Hassani on 1 December 1944, as home for No. 337 Wing RAF, under which operated a number of squadrons:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._32_Squadron_RAF_4d98.html" title="No. 32 Squadron RAF">No. 32 Squadron RAF</a> with the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Spitfire_30cc.html" title="Supermarine Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> V</li>
<li>No. 94 Squadron RAF with the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Spitfire_30cc.html" title="Supermarine Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> V</li>
<li>No. 108 Squadron RAF with the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Beaufighter_df50.html" title="Bristol Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a> VI</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._216_Squadron_RAF_778c.html" title="No. 216 Squadron RAF">No. 216 Squadron RAF</a> with the <a href="../../../c/-/4/C-47_Skytrain_ba01.html" title="C-47 Skytrain">Douglas Dakota</a> IV</li>
<li>No. 221 Squadron RAF with the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vickers_Wellington_ecbd.html" title="Vickers Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a> XIII</li>
</ul>
<p>These were bolstered by the arrival in November 1944 of No. 335 Squadron RHAF and No. 336 Squadron RHAF. Both of these were Greek manned units within the RAF and would become the first operational units of the Royal <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenic_Air_Force_ddee.html" title="Hellenic Air Force">Hellenic Air Force</a>. Both flew the Spitfire VB fighter.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedes.html" title="Sedes">Sedes</a> was opened with the liberation of northern Greece and became the new home for No. 32 Sqn.</p>
<p>On 2 December 1944, tensions over the role of the EAM and ELAS parties in post-war government resulted in demonstration during which British forces opened fire, killing ten civilians. The response was attacks on police stations and thus RAF units began operations against ELAS and EAM targets, mostly around Athens. No. 73 Sqn, along with the newly arrived No. 94 Squadron RAF, used their Spitfires on strafing runs and light bombing was undertaken by No. 108 Sqn. Additional options were gained when a flight of Beaufighters of <a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._39_Squadron_RAF_7151.html" title="No. 39 Squadron RAF">No. 39 Squadron RAF</a> were attached to No. 108 Sqn., armed with <a href="../../../r/p/-/RP-3_5c4c.html" title="RP-3">RP-3</a> rockets. These were considered very effective and over the span of two weeks 105 targets (55 buildings, 19 command posts, 10 supply dumps, 2 radio stations, 12 transportation, and 7 artillery) were struck by these aircraft. The regular aircraft of No. 108 flew 265 sorties during December. The heavy bombers of No. 221 Sqn were primarily used in supply flights to the Sedes facility as well as various leaflet and illumination missions. Two actual bombing raids were carried out (both at night). The Greek Spitfire squadrons did not participate in the attacks, although the newly formed No. 13 Squadron RHAF did assist in leaflet operations.</p>
<p>The RAF suffered a major blow with the attack by ELAS troops on their facility at <a href="../../../k/i/f/Kifisia.html" title="Kifisia">Kifisia</a>, which was home to Allied Headquarters Greece, on 19 December 1944. The No. 2933 Squadron RAF Regiment defended strongly but was ultimately overrun with the capture of many British prisoners. No. 221 Sqn. conducted supply drops to these personnel during their march north. By 7 January 1945, Athens was secured, and a ceasefire negotiated on 11 January. While some fighting continued, British fighter squadrons were withdrawn by summer 1945. Hassani continued to be a hub of RAF operations however the arrival of No. 252 Wing RAF with three <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Boston_4b1b.html" title="Douglas Boston">Douglas Boston</a> V equipped units, <a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._13_Squadron_RAF_249e.html" title="No. 13 Squadron RAF">No. 13 Squadron RAF</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._18_Squadron_RAF_37a6.html" title="No. 18 Squadron RAF">No. 18 Squadron RAF</a>, and No. 55 Squadron RAF.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_operations_during_the_Greek_Civil_War_ee58.html" title="Edit section: Formation of the Royal Hellenic Air Force">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Formation of the Royal Hellenic Air Force</span></h2>
<p>1946 saw the official transfer of Greek manned RAF squadrons into the Royal Hellenic Air Force. In addition to the aforementioned Nos. 13, 335, and 336 Sqns., these also included the No. 355 Squadron RHAF with a variety of transport types, including the C-47, <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avro_Anson_d582.html" title="Avro Anson">Avro Anson</a>, and Wellington and the 345, 346, and 347 Flights using the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Auster_AOP_f586.html" title="Auster AOP">Auster AOP</a> and other utility aircraft for liaison.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, government opposition was on the rise and the formation of the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Army_of_Greece_a4bc.html" title="Democratic Army of Greece">Democratic Army of Greece</a> led to the loss of control of much of rural Greece. The Greek National Army responded with Operation Terminus, but this was a failure. March 1948 saw the RHAF enter the action with attacks on landing strips set up by Communist forces to receive aid from <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a> and <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. Involvement by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> led to the launch of Operation Dawn in April 1948, and this was supported by RHAF units with a total of 641 sorties with the loss of one Spitfire plus damage to ten more. Dakotas were utilized for leaflet and supply operations. The operation was successful but the withdrawal to northern border regions limited RHAF effectiveness due to a five mile stop line to avoid an international incident.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_operations_during_the_Greek_Civil_War_ee58.html" title="Edit section: Offensive support by the RHAF">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Offensive support by the RHAF</span></h2>
<p>Operation Coronis was launched in July 1948 against enemy forces in the Grammos Mountains with the support of Nos. 335 and 336 Sqns. operating from <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yannina.html" title="Yannina">Yannina</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/z/Kozani.html" title="Kozani">Kozani</a>. Additional aircraft included <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-6_Texan_77eb.html" title="AT-6 Texan">AT-6 Texan</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Auster.html" title="Auster">Auster</a> aircraft. Ultimate results were a draw as anti-government forces withdrew across the border to Albania. No. 337 Squadron RHAF had been formed with Spitfire IX aircraft, giving the RHAF three Spitfire units. For heavier bombing, Dakotas were jury-rigged with racks for bombs up to 500 lb each. RAF <a href="../../../d/e/h/DeHavilland_Mosquito_fd02.html" title="DeHavilland Mosquito">deHavilland Mosquito</a> photo reconnaissance aircraft were reportedly used in the affair. RHAF flew 3,474 sorties during the operation, suffering one lost Spitfire plus a further 22 damaged.</p>
<p>Operations in September 1948 centered on the Vitsi Mountains area, and were supported again by the RHAF. They were marked by better cooperation with GNA units and the first use of napalm, although this was not used heavily. These operations lasted through the end of the year, bringing the grand total of sorties for 1948 to 8,907 combat and 9,891 transport, with the loss of twelve airmen. A major attack at <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florina.html" title="Florina">Florina</a> by guerrilla forces was defeated with significant air support by the RHAF.</p>
<p>August 1949 marked the final series of operations against the guerrilla forces, and again the RHAF played a large role in supporting government forces. In particular, during the final portion of the month, No. 336 Sqn. began employing its newly acquired <a href="../../../s/b/2/SB2C_Helldiver_4b7e.html" title="SB2C Helldiver">SB2C Helldiver</a> aircraft, of which 40 had been acquired from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a>. This operation resulted in the final destruction of opposition military resistance and resulted in a final ceasefire being signed. During August 826 sorties had been flown dropping 288 tons of bombs and firing 1935 rockets. Napalm was used again, with 114 such strikes being made.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../a/i/r/Airspeed_Oxford_797c.html" title="Airspeed Oxford">Airspeed Oxford</a></b>: A small number of these utility aircraft were used by the RHAF for liaison and transport.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../a/u/s/Auster.html" title="Auster">Auster</a></b>: A ubiquitous light plane of the period, the RHAF used the Auster as an observation and liaison aircraft and for numerous light duties. Most were A.O.P. 6 models.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../a/v/r/Avro_Anson_d582.html" title="Avro Anson">Avro Anson</a></b>: Some of these utility aircraft were employed by the RHAF from the force's formation through the end of the civil war.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Beaufighter_df50.html" title="Bristol Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a></b>: A heavier ground-attack aircraft, the Beaufighter Mark VIF (and some Mark VIII) was used by No. 108 Sqn. during the early RAF involvement in Greece. These were replaced by later model Mark X Beaufighters of No. 252 Sqn. later, although they were not heavily used by that point. The Beaufighters armed with rockets were particularly effective as an early support aircraft in operations during 1945. The Beaufighter ended its role with the withdrawal of No. 252 Sqn. in 1946.</li>
<li><b>Curtis <a href="../../../s/b/2/SB2C_Helldiver_4b7e.html" title="SB2C Helldiver">SB2C Helldiver</a></b>: Forty of these dive bombers were acquired by the RHAF in late 1948 from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a>. They proved to be the best strike aircraft of the RHAF and played an important role in the final operations to end the civil war.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../d/e/h/DeHavilland_Mosquito_fd02.html" title="DeHavilland Mosquito">deHavilland Mosquito</a></b>: Only a few of these aircraft were utilized by RAF units in Greece, with a small number of Mark XXVI aircraft employed by No. 55 Sqn. After the withdrawal of RAF units, however, it was reported that Mosquitoes of No. 13 Sqn. conducted reconnaissance during 1948 on behalf of the Greek government.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Boston_4b1b.html" title="Douglas Boston">Douglas Boston</a></b>: This light bomber was the backbone of the RAF units which maintained a presence in Greece from the end of active operations in 1945 to the withdrawal of the RAF in 1946.</li>
<li><b>Douglas <a href="../../../c/-/4/C-47_Skytrain_ba01.html" title="C-47 Skytrain">C-47 Skytrain</a> and Dakota</b>: Primary transport of the Allies in the later half of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the Dakota accompanied the RAF to Greece and was heavily used to supply British forces there. Dakotas comprised the only <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_Air_Force_4603.html" title="South African Air Force">South African Air Force</a> aircraft to be operated there. Many were transferred to the RHAF, as were a number of C-47s from US stocks. Some were outfitted with crude bomb racks for use on heavier raids.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawker_Hurricane_7bea.html" title="Hawker Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a></b>: A single unit of Hurricane Mark IV aircraft, No. 6 Sqn., deployed with the first RAF units, but was withdrawn before taking a role in the conflict.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Baltimore_3928.html" title="Martin Baltimore">Martin Baltimore</a></b>: A small number of these light bombers were acquired by the RHAF from the RAF and employed by No. 13 Sqn. in general support duties.</li>
<li><b>North American <a href="../../../t/-/6/T-6_Texan_da5a.html" title="T-6 Texan">T-6 Texan</a> and Harvard</b>: Large numbers of these useful aircraft were operated by the RHAF during the civil war. Most were AT-6 versions from the United States, although a number of the Harvard model from the RAF were acquired as well. They were useful as liaison, observation, and light strike aircraft and were a critical part of the effectiveness of other Greek strike aircraft during the operations in 1948.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Spitfire_30cc.html" title="Supermarine Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a></b>: Backbone of both the RAF and RHAF during their operations in the war, the Spitfire was operated in both Mark V and Mark IX versions for most of the conflict. The RHAF did begin receiving some Mark XIV models later in the conflict, while the RAF had operated a number of the Mark XI for photo-reconnaissance. Heavily used for strafing and later for napalm strikes, the Spitfire lacked range and ammunition in the strike role. Additionally, it proved more vulnerable to ground fire than the other types operated by the RHAF.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Walrus_0101.html" title="Supermarine Walrus">Supermarine Walrus</a></b>: A single unit of these amphibian aircraft was deployed for mine-spotting duties in the <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriatic.html" title="Adriatic">Adriatic</a>.</li>
