<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airfix.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Airfix was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> by a <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungarian</a> businessman called Nicholas Kove, initially manufacturing rubber inflatable toys. The brand name Airfix was selected to be the first alphabetically in any toy catalogue. In 1947, Airfix introduced <a href="../../../i/n/j/Injection_moulding.html" title="Injection moulding">injection moulding</a>, initially producing pocket combs. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>, it was commissioned to create a promotional model of a <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferguson_Company_9baf.html" title="Ferguson Company">Ferguson</a> tractor. The model was initially moulded in <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cellulose_acetate.html" title="Cellulose acetate">cellulose acetate</a> plastic and hand assembled for distribution to Ferguson sales representatives. To increase sales and lower productions costs, the model was sold in kit form by <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woolworths.html" title="Woolworths">F. W. Woolworth's retail stores</a>.</p>
<p>A few years later in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>, Woolworth buyer Jim Russon suggested to Airfix that they produce a model kit of <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Francis_Drake_4c9b.html" title="Sir Francis Drake">Sir Francis Drake</a>'s <i><a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Hind_e803.html" title="Golden Hind">Golden Hind</a></i>, then being sold in North America as a '<a href="../../../s/h/i/Ship-in-a-bottle.html" title="Ship-in-a-bottle">ship-in-a-bottle</a>'. The kit would be made in the more stable polystyrene plastic. In order to meet Woolworth's retail price of 2/-, Airfix changed the packaging from a cardboard box to a plastic bag with a paper header which also included the instructions. It was a huge success and led the company to produce new kit designs. The first aircraft kit was released in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, a model of the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Spitfire_30cc.html" title="Supermarine Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>, in 1/72 scale. This was a scaled down copy of the Aurora 1/48 Supermarine Spitfire kit. Kove initially refused to believe the product would sell and threatened to charge the cost of the tooling to the designers.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airfix.html" title="Edit section: Expansion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expansion</span></h3>
<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, the company expanded greatly as the kit modelling hobby grew enormously. The Airfix range expanded to include vintage and modern cars, motorcycles, figures, trains, trackside accessories, military vehicles, large classic ships, warships, liners, engines, rockets and spaceships, as well as an ever-increasing range of aircraft. Most kits were created at the "standard" scale of 1/72 for small and military aircraft, and 1/144 scale for airliners. However Airfix's range of military vehicles though packaged as 1/72 are generally accepted as actually being OO or 1/76 scale.</p>
<p>In the mid 1970s, larger scales were introduced, including the dramatic 1/24 scale models of the Spitfire and <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawker_Hurricane_7bea.html" title="Hawker Hurricane">Hurricane</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawker_Siddeley_Harrier_02d5.html" title="Hawker Siddeley Harrier">Harrier</a> "jump-jet", which featured unusually extensive detailing at this scale. All the kits were manufactured using <a href="../../../i/n/j/Injection_moulding.html" title="Injection moulding">injection moulding</a> of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polystyrene.html" title="Polystyrene">polystyrene</a>. The growth of the hobby launched a number of competitors in the field, such as <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matchbox.html" title="Matchbox">Matchbox</a>, as well as introducing new manufacturers from <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">US</a> to the UK. During this period the company Humbrol also grew, supplying the paints, brushes, glue and other accessories for the finishing of the kits.</p>
<p>In this period, apart from model kits, Airfix also produced a wide range of toys, games, dolls and art &amp; craft products. Airfix Industries acquired the <a href="../../../m/e/c/Meccano.html" title="Meccano">Meccano</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinky_Toy_2bba.html" title="Dinky Toy">Dinky Toy</a> businesses in 1971.</p>
<p>Airfix also launched a monthly modelling magazine, <i>Airfix Magazine</i>, which was produced by a variety of publishers from June 1960 to October 1993. During the 1970s, an <i>Airfix Magazine Annual</i> was also produced.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airfix.html" title="Edit section: Decline, purchase by Humbrol">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Decline, purchase by Humbrol</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, the plastic kit modelling hobby went into a rapid decline. Some think this was due to the rise of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_games.html" title="Computer games">computer games</a>, others that new manufacturing techniques such as precision <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diecasting.html" title="Diecasting">diecasting</a> took away the market for <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toy.html" title="Toy">toys</a>, where a person was less interested in the construction and finishing of a model, but simply wanted to play with the finished product, others the declining birth rates leading into smaller generations and declining numbers of potential enthusiasts. However, the decline may simply be a side effect of large increases in the sticker price of plastic models following the oil crisis of the late '70's which led to high inflation as well as an increase in the price of plastics. This also may explain why the emphasis of the modelmaking hobby is today on adults rather than children.</p>
<p>Due to large losses in Airfix's other toy businesses, even though the model business was still profitable, Airfix was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1981. The company was bought by <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Mills_8995.html" title="General Mills">General Mills</a> (owner of rival US kit-maker MPC) through its UK Palitoy subsidiary, with the kit moulds being quickly shipped to its factory in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calais.html" title="Calais">Calais</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>.</p>
<p>Four years later, General Mills withdrew from the toy market to refocus its efforts on its core food manufacturing business. At one point it looked as if the Airfix range might die out, but eventually, in 1986, it was bought by the Hobby Products Group of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borden_Milk_Products_6eb0.html" title="Borden Milk Products">Borden</a>, who had tried to buy the range in 1981. Borden were also the owners of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> model company <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humbrol.html" title="Humbrol">Humbrol</a>. The moulds remained in France but were relocated to the Group's existing kit manufacturer, Trun-based <a href="../../../h/e/l/Heller_SA_ed67.html" title="Heller SA">Heller SA</a>. This was a logical acquisition, since Humbrol's paints and adhesives could be used to complete Airfix kits and the Heller factory was under-utilised.</p>
<p>The Hobby Products Group was sold to an <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> investment company, Allen &amp; McGuire, in 1994 and continued under the Humbrol name.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airfix.html" title="Edit section: 50th anniversary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">50th anniversary</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Airfix celebrated the "50th" anniversary of its first aircraft kit, the Supermarine Spitfire. The celebration was two years early due to an incorrect 1953 date commonly accepted at the time. As the moulds for the original kit were long gone, Airfix reissued its 1/72 Supermarine Spitfire Mk.Ia kit in blue plastic. The kit also included a large Series 5 stand (the moulds for the smaller Series 1 stand having been lost) and a copy of the original plastic bag packaging with paper header.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_31.html" title="August 31">31 August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, parent company Humbrol went into <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administration.html#Administration_of_an_insolvent_business" title="Administration">administration</a>, with 31 of 41 employees being made <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redundancy_%28law%29.html" title="Redundancy (law)">redundant</a>. This was largely due to the collapse of Heller SA, who still manufactured most of Airfix's kits. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_10.html" title="November 10">10 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hornby_Railways_84d0.html" title="Hornby Railways">Hornby Railways</a> announced it was to acquire Airfix and other assets of Humbrol for £2.6 million.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airfix.html" title="Edit section: Model railways">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Model railways</span></h2>
<p>From <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, Airfix also manufactured a line of ready-to-run (i.e. non-kit) model railway stock in <a href="../../../o/o/_/OO_gauge_3f6f.html" title="OO gauge">OO gauge</a> (1/76.2 scale). These models were based on British prototypes and at the time of introduction, they represented a significant improvement in detailing and prototype accuracy compared to British outline model railway stock from other British ready-to-run manufacturers such as <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hornby_Railways_84d0.html" title="Hornby Railways">Hornby</a>. The product range expanded fairly rapidly in the first few years. A model of a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Western_Railway_acda.html" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a> (GWR) 0-4-2 autotank steam locomotive and GWR autocoach are amongst some of the many memorable and important product releases. Airfix also offered an analogue electronics-based multiple train control system (MTC) allowing independent control of multiple locomotives on the same track. Airfix produced a large number of plastic kits for both railway stock and scenic items. Some of these such as the footbridge and engine shed became instantly recognizable to almost every railway modeller in the UK.</p>
<p>The brand label was changed to Great Model Railways (GMR) in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, although the Airfix name was still included. However, Airfix left the model railway business in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>. The models were sold to one of its main competitors, Palitoy who produced the Mainline range of products. The former Airfix moulds together with the Palitoy designed 2P 4-4-0 and Class 56 diesel were later re-sold to <a href="../../../d/a/p/Dapol.html" title="Dapol">Dapol</a> Ltd and then subsequently to Hornby. Dapol provided new chassis for the 14xx and Castle. The remainder of the Mainline Railways had been produced for Palitoy by Kader Industries and ownership of those tools remained with Kader, being later used to form the basis of the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachmann_Branchline_c5e3.html" title="Bachmann Branchline">Bachmann Branchline</a> models. Dapol continues to produce (but not promote) most of the kits but as the moulds (some now over forty years old) wear out the kits are being discontinued. Hornby continues to make 4mm/ft scale models from the Airfix mouldings.</p>
<p>A monthly magazine, <i>Model Trains</i>, was published by Airfix from January <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. The magazine included especially good articles aimed at newcomers to the hobby and also included many articles about modelling US and Continental European railways, as well British prototype railways. The publication of <i>Model Trains</i> continued for some years after Airfix ceased ownership in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>. A change in the editorial team saw the original <i>Model Trains</i> editorial staff launch a new title as <i>Scale Trains</i>, in April <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>. A slight name change followed in April <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, as <i>Scale Model Trains</i> following the final issue of <i>Model Trains</i> in December <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. <i>Scale Model Trains</i> ran till June <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, when a new publisher was found and the magazine was relaunched in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> as <i>Model Trains International</i>, the November/December issue being issue number 1. As of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, it continues to be published <a href="../../../b/i/-/Bi-monthly.html" title="Bi-monthly">bi-monthly</a>. The magazine also has a <a href="http://www.modeltrainsinternational.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.modeltrainsinternational.co.uk" rel="nofollow">website</a>.</p>

<p>In 1963, the Airfix Motor Racing <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slot_car_racing.html" title="Slot car racing">slot car racing</a> system was introduced. While they produced specially made racing cars, with front-wheel <a href="../../../a/c/k/Ackermann_steering_geometry.html" title="Ackermann steering geometry">Ackermann</a> steering, they also later made conversion kits so that normal Airfix 1/32 kit cars such as the Ford Zodiac and the Sunbeam Rapier could be made to race. The first set had Ferrari and Cooper cars, an 11 foot figure-of-eight track, and cost 4 pounds 19 shillings and 11 pence.</p>
<p>Always in the shadow of the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scalextric.html" title="Scalextric">Scalextric</a> range, the Airfix version attempted progress with the Model Road Racing Company (MRRC) higher-end range of cars and accessories, but eventually the venture was abandoned.</p>
