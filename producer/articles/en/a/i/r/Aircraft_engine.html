<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_engine.html" title="Edit section: Engine design">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Engine design</span></h2>
<p>Engines must be:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>lightweight</i>, as a heavy engine decreases the amount of excess power available.</li>
<li><i>small</i> and <i>easily streamlined</i>; large engines with substantial surface area, when installed, create too much drag, wasting fuel and reducing power output.</li>
<li><i>powerful</i>, to overcome the weight and drag of the aircraft.</li>
<li><i>reliable</i>, as losing power in an airplane is a substantially greater problem than an automobile engine seizing. Aircraft engines operate at temperature, pressure, and speed extremes, and therefore need to operate reliably and safely under all these conditions.</li>
<li><i>repairable</i>, to keep the cost of replacement down. Minor repairs are relatively inexpensive.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Power" id="Power"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_engine.html" title="Edit section: Power">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Power</span></h3>
<p>Unlike <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">automobile</a> engines, aircraft engines run at high <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_%28physics%29.html" title="Power (physics)">power</a> settings for extended periods of time. In general, the engine runs at maximum power for a few minutes during taking off, then power is slightly reduced for climb, and then spends the majority of its time at a cruise setting—typically 65% to 75% of full power. In contrast, a car engine might spend 20% of its time at 65% power accelerating, followed by 80% of its time at 20% power while cruising.</p>
<p>Performance of a propeller motor is measured in units of power (typically horsepower), whereas for a jet engine performance is measured in terms of thrust (typically pounds). In both cases, the performance is relatively constant across the operating envelope. Power is equal to thrust times speed, which means as a propeller-driven aircraft flies faster, it actually develops less and less thrust.</p>
<p><a name="Reliability" id="Reliability"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_engine.html" title="Edit section: Reliability">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reliability</span></h3>
<p>The design of aircraft engines tends to favor reliability over performance. It took many years before the reliability was established to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lindbergh_87dc.html" title="Charles Lindbergh">fly over the Atlantic</a> or the Pacific Ocean. Engine failure at all stages in flight is a part of flight lessons for student pilots.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Forced landings without power are practiced extensively over rural areas until the new pilot is proficient enough to handle such situation during a solo flight.</p>
<p>Long engine operation times and high power settings, combined with the requirement for high-reliability means that engines must be constructed to support this type of operation with ease. The engine, as well as the aircraft, needs to be lifted into the air, meaning it has to overcome lots of weight. The thrust to weight ratio is one of the most important characteristics for an aircraft engine. A typical 250 hp engine weighs just 15% of the total aircraft weight when installed into a 3000 lb (1,400 kg) aircraft.</p>
<p>Aircraft engines also tend to use the simplest parts and include two sets of anything needed for reliability, including <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignition_system.html" title="Ignition system">ignition system</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/a/Spark_plug.html" title="Spark plug">spark plugs</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto_%28electrical%29.html" title="Magneto (electrical)">magnetos</a>) and <a href="../../../f/u/e/Fuel_pump.html" title="Fuel pump">fuel pumps</a>. Independence of function lessens the likelihood of a single malfunction causing an entire engine to fail. Thus <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto_%28electrical%29.html" title="Magneto (electrical)">magnetos</a> are used because they do not rely on a battery. Two magnetos were originally installed so a pilot can switch off a faulty magneto and continue the flight on the other—but, later, dual ignition was found to offer some <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detonation.html" title="Detonation">detonation</a> protection too. Similarly, a mechanical engine-driven fuel pump is often backed-up by an electric one.</p>
<p>Another difference between cars and aircraft is that the aircraft spend the vast majority of their time travelling at high speed. This allows aircraft engines to be air cooled, as opposed to requiring a <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiator.html" title="Radiator">radiator</a>. In the absence of a radiator aircraft engines can boast lower weight and less complexity. The amount of air flow an engine receives is usually carefully designed according to expected speed and altitude of the aircraft in order to maintain the engine at the optimal temperature. Just like overheating, too much cooling can be a bad thing for an engine as well. Some aircraft employ controls that allow a pilot to manually adjust the airflow into the engine compartment.</p>
<p>Aircraft operate at higher altitudes where the air is less dense than at ground level. As engines need oxygen to burn fuel, a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forced_induction.html" title="Forced induction">forced induction</a> system such as <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbocharger.html" title="Turbocharger">turbocharger</a> or <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercharger.html" title="Supercharger">supercharger</a> is especially appropriate for aircraft use. This does bring along the usual drawbacks of additional cost, weight and complexity.</p>
<p><a name="Multi-engine_debate" id="Multi-engine_debate"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_engine.html" title="Edit section: Multi-engine debate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Multi-engine debate</span></h4>
<p>While some countries require twin-engined airplanes for commercial passenger transport, many, such as Canada, Australia, and the United States, allow the use of single-engine aircraft for some commercial services, including charter and sometimes scheduled commuter airline flights (the latter typically use turbine- rather than piston-powered singles).</p>
<p>A second engine adds redundancy so that the aircraft can stay in the air (or at least, descend more slowly) if one engine fails, providing an important safety margin during cruise flight over water or mountainous terrain; however, an engine failure on a twin-engine piston aircraft can also cause serious handling difficulties, especially right after takeoff, due to asymmetrical thrust.</p>
<p>A study of accidents in Australian air charter operations from 1986 to 1996 found that the overall fatal accident rate per hour for multi-engine aircraft was more than triple that for single-engine aircraft, though it did not isolate the accidents specifically caused by engine failure and the multi-engine aircraft did not fly under identical conditions.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> According to the U.S. Air Safety Foundation, when an engine failure leads to an incident (e.g. some damage or injuries), it has a 10% chance of causing fatalities in a single-engine aircraft, but a 50% chance in a twin.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Size" id="Size"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_engine.html" title="Edit section: Size">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Size</span></h3>
<p>At one time all engine designs were new and there was no particular difference in design between aircraft and <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">automobile</a> engines. This changed by the start of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, however, when a particular class of air-cooled <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotary_engine.html" title="Rotary engine">rotary engines</a> became popular. These had a short lifespan, but by the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> a large number of engine designs were moving to the similar <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radial_engine.html" title="Radial engine">radial engine</a> design. This combined air-cooled simplicity with large displacements and they were among the most powerful small engines in the world.</p>
<p>Both the rotary and radial engine have the drawback of a very large frontal area (see <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drag_equation.html" title="Drag equation">drag equation</a>). As aircraft increased in speed and demanded better <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streamliner.html" title="Streamliner">streamlining</a>, designers turned to water-cooled <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_engine.html" title="Straight engine">inline</a> engines. Throughout <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">WWII</a> the two designs were generally similar in terms of power and overall performance but some mature-design radials tended to be more reliable. After the war, in the USA, the water-cooled designs rapidly disappeared.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_engine.html" title="Edit section: Repairability">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Repairability</span></h3>
<p>For the smaller application, notably in <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_aviation.html" title="General aviation">general aviation</a>, a hybrid design in the form an air-cooled <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_engine.html" title="Straight engine">inline</a>, almost always 4 or 6 cylinders <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_engine.html" title="Flat engine">horizontally opposed</a>, is most common. These combine small frontal area with air-cooled simplicity, although they required careful installation in order to be effectively cooled, notably the rearmost cylinders. To make repairs practical, each cylinder is individually replaceable, as are each of the accessories (pumps, generator and magnetos).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_engine.html" title="Edit section: Fuel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fuel</span></h2>
<p>Aircraft piston engines are typically designed to run on <a href="../../../a/v/g/Avgas.html" title="Avgas">avgas</a>. As well as being produced to higher quality standards (to avoid fuel-related engine failures), avgas has a higher <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octane_rating.html" title="Octane rating">octane rating</a>, allowing a higher <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compression_ratio.html" title="Compression ratio">compression ratio</a> and thus more power out of the engine with the same engine design. Avgas uses <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetraethyl_lead.html" title="Tetraethyl lead">Tetraethyl lead</a> (TEL) to achieve these high octane ratings, a practice banned in automobile fuel. The shrinking supply of TEL, and the possibility of environmental legislation banning its use, has made a search for replacement fuels for GA planes a priority for pilot's organizations.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_engine.html" title="Edit section: Economics of new designs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Economics of new designs</span></h3>
<p>Throughout most of the history of aircraft engine design, they tended to be more advanced than their automobile counterparts. High-strength <a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminum.html" title="Aluminum">aluminum</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alloy.html" title="Alloy">alloys</a> were used in these engines decades before they became common in cars. Likewise, those engines adopted <a href="../../../f/u/e/Fuel_injection.html" title="Fuel injection">fuel injection</a> instead of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carburetor.html" title="Carburetor">carburetion</a> quite early. Similarly, <a href="../../../o/h/c/OHC_ede6.html" title="OHC">overhead cams</a> were introduced, while automobile engines continued to use <a href="../../../p/u/s/Pushrods.html" title="Pushrods">pushrods</a>.</p>
<p>Today the piston-engine aviation market is so small that there is essentially no commercial money for new design work. Most aviation engines flying are based on a design from the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, or before, using original materials, tooling and parts. Meanwhile the financial power of the automobile industry has continued improvement. A new car design is likely to use an engine designed no more than a few years ago, built with the latest alloys and advanced electronic engine controls. Modern car engines require no maintenance at all (other than adding <a href="../../../f/u/e/Fuel.html" title="Fuel">fuel</a> and oil) for over 100,000 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilometre.html" title="Kilometre">km</a>, aircraft engines are now, in comparison and paradoxically, rather heavy, dirty and unreliable.</p>
<p>Much of the innovation (and most newly constructed planes flying) in the past two decades in private aviation has been in <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultralight_aircraft.html" title="Ultralight aircraft">ultralights</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homebuilt_aircraft.html" title="Homebuilt aircraft">homebuilt aircraft</a>, and so has innovation in powerplants. <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotax.html" title="Rotax">Rotax</a>, amongst others, has introduced a number of new small production engine designs for this type of craft. The smallest of these mostly use two-stroke designs, but the larger models are four-strokes. For the reasons discussed above, some hobbyists and experimenters prefer to adapt automotive engines for their home-built aircraft, instead of using certified aircraft engines.</p>
<p>Over the history of the development of aircraft engines, the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_cycle.html" title="Otto cycle">Otto cycle</a>, that is, conventional <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasoline.html" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a> powered, reciprocating-piston engines have been by far the most common type. That is not because they are the best but simply because they were there first and type-certification of new designs is an expensive, time-consuming process.</p>

<p>Another promising design for aircraft use was the <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wankel.html" title="Wankel">Wankel</a> rotary engine. The <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wankel_engine.html" title="Wankel engine">Wankel engine</a> is about one half the weight and size of a traditional <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_stroke_cycle.html" title="Four stroke cycle">four stroke cycle</a> <a href="../../../p/i/s/Piston_engine.html" title="Piston engine">piston engine</a> of equal power output, and much lower in complexity. In an aircraft application, the power to weight ratio is very important, making the Wankel engine a good choice. Because the engine is typically constructed with an aluminium housing and a steel rotor, and aluminium expands more than steel when heated, unlike a piston engine, a Wankel engine will not seize when overheated. This is an important safety factor for aeronautical use. Considerable development of these designs started after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, but at the time the aircraft industry favored the use of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbine.html" title="Turbine">turbine</a> engines. It was believed that <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbojet.html" title="Turbojet">turbojet</a> or <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turboprop.html" title="Turboprop">turboprop</a> engines, could power all aircraft, from the largest to smallest designs. The Wankel engine did not find many applications in aircraft, but was used by <a href="../../../m/a/z/Mazda.html" title="Mazda">Mazda</a> in a popular line of <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_cars.html" title="Sports cars">sports cars</a>. Recently, the Wankel engine has been developed for use in <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motor_glider.html" title="Motor glider">motor gliders</a> where the small size, light weight, and low vibration are especially important.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wankel engines are becoming increasingly popular in homebuilt <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experimental_aircraft.html" title="Experimental aircraft">experimental aircraft</a>, due to a number of factors. Most are Mazda 12A and 13B engines, removed from automobiles and converted to aviation use. This is a very cost-effective alternative to certified aircraft engines, providing engines ranging from 100 to 300 horsepower at a fraction of the cost of traditional engines. These conversions first took place in the early 1970s, and with hundreds or even thousands of these engines mounted on aircraft, as of 10 December 2006 the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Transportation_Safety_Board_ed3c.html" title="National Transportation Safety Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> has only 7 reports of incidents involving aircraft with Mazda engines, and none of these is of a failure due to design or manufacturing flaws. During the same time frame, they have reports of several thousand reports of broken crankshafts and connecting rods, failed pistons and incidents caused by other components which are not found in the Wankel engines. Rotary engine enthusiasts refer to piston aircraft engines as "Reciprosaurs," and point out that their designs are essentially unchanged since the 1930s, with only minor differences in manufacturing processes and variation in engine displacement.</p>
<p>Peter Garrison, contributing editor for <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_%28magazine%29.html" title="Flying (magazine)">Flying magazine</a>, has said that "the most promising engine for aviation use is the Mazda rotary." Garrison lost an airplane which he had designed and built (and missed death literally by inches), when a piston-powered plane had engine failure and crashed into Garrison's plane, which was waiting to take off.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diesel_engine.html" title="Diesel engine">diesel engine</a> is another engine design that has been examined for aviation use. In general diesel engines are more reliable and much better suited to running for long periods of time at medium power settings—this is why they are widely used in trucks for instance. Several attempts to produce diesel aircraft engines were made in the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> but, at the time, the alloys were not up to the task of handling the much higher <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compression_ratio.html" title="Compression ratio">compression ratios</a> used in these designs. They generally had poor power-to-weight ratios and were uncommon for that reason. Improvements in diesel technology in automobiles (leading to much better power-weight ratios), the diesel's much better fuel efficiency (particularly compared to the old designs currently being used in light aircraft) and the high relative taxation of gasoline compared to diesel in Europe have all seen a revival of interest in the concept. As of May 2004 one manufacturer, Thielert Aircraft Engines, is already selling certified diesel aircraft engines for light aircraft, and other companies have alternative designs under development. It remains to be seen whether these new designs will succeed in the marketplace but they potentially represent the biggest change in light aircraft engines in decades.</p>
