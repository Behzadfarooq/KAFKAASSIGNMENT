HMAS <i>Albatross</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The navy's experience with aircraft at sea actually began prior to the Second World War, with the commissioning of the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seaplane_carrier.html" title="Seaplane carrier">seaplane carrier</a>, <a href="../../../h/m/a/HMAS_Albatross_%28Seaplane_Carrier%29_a67d.html" title="HMAS Albatross (Seaplane Carrier)">HMAS <i>Albatross</i></a>. <i>Albatross</i> was commissioned in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a> and served for four years in the RAN before being paid off into the reserve in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>. During her time in service she followed the normal uneventful pattern of the peacetime naval vessel of the thirties on the Australia Station – winter cruises to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Guinea_eecc.html" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Britain_d036.html" title="New Britain">New Britain</a> and surrounding islands, spring cruises to the southern states, exercises, training and long periods in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Harbour_7b21.html" title="Sydney Harbour">Sydney Harbour</a>. Her complement of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine.html" title="Supermarine">Supermarine</a> amphibians were crewed and maintained by personnel of the <a href="../../../r/a/a/RAAF_f18f.html" title="RAAF">RAAF</a>.

Walrus aircraft embarked on an Australian light cruiser</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>While the Royal Australian Navy did not operate any aircraft carriers during World War II, each of the RAN's heavy and light cruisers was equipped with a single seaplane operated by <a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._9_Squadron_RAAF_a3e5.html" title="No. 9 Squadron RAAF">No. 9 Squadron RAAF</a>. Due to the Allied air dominance of the areas in which the cruisers operated, the surviving Australian cruisers had their seaplane catapults removed in 1944 and No. 9 Squadron was disbanded at the end of the year.</p>
<p>During late 1944 and 1945 the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Pacific_Fleet_a119.html" title="British Pacific Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a> was based in Australia. In order to support the Fleet's aircraft carriers, the Australian government constructed a number of airfields and other facilities to support naval aviation. Many of these facilities (including <a href="../../../h/m/a/HMAS_Albatross_%28air_station%29_f12d.html" title="HMAS Albatross (air station)">HMAS <i>Albatross</i></a>, the RAN's main air station) were later used to support Australia's post-war carriers.</p>

HMAS <i>Vengeance</i> in 1953</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>World War II saw a number of squadrons of the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Air_Arm_8044.html" title="Fleet Air Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> being crewed exclusively by Australians. Their experience led the Australian government to make the decision to form an <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Air_Arm_%28RAN%29_46db.html" title="Fleet Air Arm (RAN)">air arm</a> for the RAN. In tandem with this was the decision to purchase two conventional aircraft carriers from the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>. At the time, a large class of small <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_aircraft_carrier.html" title="Light aircraft carrier">light fleet carriers</a>, the <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majestic_class_aircraft_carrier.html" title="Majestic class aircraft carrier"><i>Majestic</i> class</a> was under construction. Two of these, <i>Majestic</i> and <i>Terrible</i>, were selected for purchase. <i>Terrible</i> was in a more advanced state of construction, and was commissioned into the RAN as <a href="../../../h/m/a/HMAS_Sydney_%281944%29_4248.html" title="HMAS Sydney (1944)">HMAS <i>Sydney</i></a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>. <i>Sydney</i>, with an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_wing.html" title="Air wing">air wing</a> of <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawker_Sea_Fury_c897.html" title="Hawker Sea Fury">Hawker Sea Fury</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairey_Firefly_f46a.html" title="Fairey Firefly">Fairey Firefly</a> aircraft, served as the flagship of the fleet for seven years, serving during the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a>. Her sister <i>Majestic</i> meanwhile had been taken in hand for a major conversion which would see all of the latest developments in carrier technology (angled flight deck, mirror landing sight, steam catapult) incorporated, enabling her to operate the latest jet aircraft. Because of the amount of work needed to complete <i>Majestic</i>, the RAN took another light fleet carrier, the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colossus_class_aircraft_carrier.html" title="Colossus class aircraft carrier"><i>Colossus</i> class</a> HMS <i>Vengeance</i>, on loan from the RN. She commissioned as in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a> as <a href="../../../h/m/a/HMAS_Vengeance_e62a.html" title="HMAS Vengeance">HMAS <i>Vengeance</i></a> and served for three years before she was returned to the Royal Navy.</p>

HMAS <i>Sydney</i> leading HMAS <i>Melbourne</i> in 1965</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, work on <i>Majestic</i> was completed, and she was commissioned into the RAN as <a href="../../../h/m/a/HMAS_Melbourne_%281945%29_4433.html" title="HMAS Melbourne (1945)">HMAS <i>Melbourne</i></a>. At that time, <i>Sydney</i>, which remained unmodified and thus incapable of supporting jet operations, was re-roled as a training ship, leaving <i>Melbourne</i> as the only operational carrier. On her commissioning, her air wing included <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Sea_Venom_1d9f.html" title="De Havilland Sea Venom">Sea Venoms</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairey_Gannet_0f0a.html" title="Fairey Gannet">Gannets</a>. As time went on, <i>Melbourne</i> received newer and more powerful aircraft to operate from her deck, culminating in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> with the <a href="../../../a/-/4/A-4_Skyhawk_6839.html" title="A-4 Skyhawk">A-4 Skyhawk</a> and <a href="../../../s/-/2/S-2_Tracker_d017.html" title="S-2 Tracker">S-2 Tracker</a>, as well as helicopters. <i>Melbourne</i> saw service during the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, when she served as part of the escort for <i>Sydney</i>, which was operated in the fast troop transport role.</p>
<p><i>Sydney</i> was decommissioned in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> and sold for scrapping, while <i>Melbourne</i> continued in her operational role. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, she was scheduled for a long refit. However, a decision was taken by the government to replace her with a new carrier. Contact was made with the British government, and an agreement was reached for the sale of the brand new light aircraft carrier <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Invincible_%28R05%29_f2a7.html" title="HMS Invincible (R05)">HMS <i>Invincible</i></a>, to be renamed HMAS <i>Australia</i> and handed over to the RAN in late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>. However, the invasion of the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falkland_Islands_2644.html" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a> by <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, and the subsequent deployment of <i>Invincible</i> as part of the task force led to a rethink of British policy. The sale of <i>Invincible</i> was subsequently cancelled, with the older and larger <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Hermes_%28R12%29_be3c.html" title="HMS Hermes (R12)">HMS <i>Hermes</i></a> offered instead. The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_legislative_election%2C_1983.html" title="Australian legislative election, 1983">1983 election</a> in Australia, which saw a change of government, eventually led to the decision being taken that <i>Melbourne</i> would not be replaced. <i>Melbourne</i> was sold to China for scrap in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. There is evidence to suggest that the ship was studied by the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Navy_c6f0.html" title="People's Liberation Army Navy">Chinese Navy</a> to help understand aircraft carrier concepts prior to the Chinese building their own aircraft carrier.</p>

<p>Following the decommissioning of <i>Melbourne</i>, the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Air_Arm_%28RAN%29_46db.html" title="Fleet Air Arm (RAN)">Fleet Air Arm</a> was restricted to helicopters operating from frigates and support ships. The RAN's aviation capabilities were boosted in the late 1990s with the commissioning of the two <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanimbla_class_landing_platform_amphibious.html" title="Kanimbla class landing platform amphibious"><i>Kanimbla</i> class LPAs</a>, each of which are capable of operating 4 <a href="../../../u/h/-/UH-60_Blackhawk_1fcc.html" title="UH-60 Blackhawk">S-70 Blackhawk</a> or 3 <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westland_Sea_King_e2d9.html" title="Westland Sea King">Sea King</a> helicopters. The ships will also be able to operate the new <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurocopter_Tiger_1798.html" title="Eurocopter Tiger">Tiger</a> helicopter gunships. While the LPAs are primarily amphibious transports, their large helicopter capacity means that they could be used as anti-submarine helicopter cruisers, along similar lines to the French helicopter cruiser <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_cruiser_Jeanne_d%27Arc_%28R97%29_a7de.html" title="French cruiser Jeanne d'Arc (R97)"><i>Jeanne d'Arc</i></a>.

Buque de Proyección Estratégica</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Up to the present, the RAN has not made any attempt to become an aircraft carrier force. However, a major new project to re-equip the navy will see a pair of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra_class_large_amphibious_ship.html" title="Canberra class large amphibious ship">Canberra class large amphibious ships</a> constructed. These ships will be utilised in the amphibious assault, command, transport and air support roles. Two designs have been chosen to compete for this - the French <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mistral_class_landing_platform_dock.html" title="Mistral class landing platform dock"><i>Mistral</i> class</a> and the Spanish <a href="../../../b/u/q/Buque_de_Proyecci%C3%B3n_Estrat%C3%A9gica_2277.html" title="Buque de Proyección Estratégica">Buque de Proyección Estratégica</a>. Both of these are fitted with a full length flight deck and island superstructure, giving them the appearance of small aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>While it is not currently planned that the multi-purpose vessels operate fixed wing aircraft, the ships are potentially capable of operating <a href="../../../s/t/o/STOVL_4552.html" title="STOVL">STOVL</a> aircraft. If it is decided to operate such aircraft the only real option would be the <a href="../../../s/t/o/STOVL_4552.html" title="STOVL">STOVL</a> <a href="../../../f/-/3/F-35_Lightning_II_386f.html" title="F-35 Lightning II">F-35B</a> version of the Joint Strike Fighter. Australia has made a preliminary commitment to purchase 100 of the <a href="../../../c/t/o/CTOL_f892.html" title="CTOL">CTOL</a> F-35A for the RAAF; were it required, the option would be there to add a small number of F-35Bs to that order. The two ships, to be named <a href="../../../h/m/a/HMAS_Adelaide_e3cf.html" title="HMAS Adelaide"><i>Adelaide</i></a> and <a href="../../../h/m/a/HMAS_Canberra_15c7.html" title="HMAS Canberra"><i>Canberra</i></a>, are due to enter service in approximately <a href="../../../2/0/1/2012.html" title="2012">2012</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/1/2015.html" title="2015">2015</a>.</p>
