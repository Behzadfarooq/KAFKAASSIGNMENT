<p>I'm not going to actually review the article since I've worked on it, but I felt I should make a few minor points:</p>
<ul>
<li>We seriously need to find somewhere to get real reviews for visual novels. <i>A</i> review on gamefaqs is really pushing it. hentai.co.uk I'm on the fence about. I bet <i>Famitsu</i> has a review, but it's damn hard to search for it when you're working with such a simple title.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><a href="http://www.getchu.com" class="external text" title="http://www.getchu.com" rel="nofollow">Getchu.com</a> is regarded as the most reliable VN review site, I believe. It has reviews of most games as well as sales information (very helpful). <span style="plainlinks"><a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoogy_5100.html" title="User:Moogy"><font color="black"><b>Moogy</b></font></a> <font size="-3"><sup><a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoogy_ec12.html" title="User talk:Moogy"><b><font color="red">(</font><font color="black">talk</font><font color="red">)</font></b></a></sup></font></span> 14:30, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

The main trouble here is how old <i>Air</i> is and that none of the more recent <i>Air</i> games have made it on any of their lists, or any that I could find...Thanks for reminding me about getchu though; I'll check again later to see if I can find anything.---- <font color="#FF66CC"><b>(</b><a href="../../../j/u/h/User%7EJuhachi_79a5.html" title="User:Juhachi"><b><font color="#0066CC">十</font></b></a><a href="../../../j/u/h/User_talk%7EJuhachi_fae6.html" title="User talk:Juhachi"><b><font color="#0066CC">八</font></b></a><b>)</b></font> 22:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>The quote in the plot section needs soucing. <i>I</i> know that it's basically the tagline for the series, but the casual reader won't. I'm not quite sure if it needs to be included anyways; taglines have been phased out of most articles.</li>
<li>Can we get a better picture of the <i>Air</i> girls? That one is kinda unclear. I think there's a cloud or something that's distorting the lower half. It also seems a little too dark when small.</li>
<li>Mention how there is a "Best" version of the PS2 port. I'm not quite sure what that means exactly, but I think it's like the Player's Choice or Greatest Hits of Japan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing too major, everything looks 'good'. I hope it makes it.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 07:50, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>As you have stated before, reviews are hard to come by so I made do with what I could find. As you said, having the title be a very simple English word doesn't make things any easier.</li>

<li>Source the quote? Eh, easy enough to do, and I would rather not take it out since it's a definative quote for the series and warrents inclusion.</li>
<li>That was the best picture I could find. I slaved over those search engines for hours and hours trying to find not only the Air girls all in a single picture, but also a screenshot from the game featuring some dialogue, of which I came up with zero on both counts. That pic is actually one I already had and when push came to shove, I ended up using it for the time being until a suitable picture can be found. It serves its purpose, and while it's not the best picture possible, there really is not much else I could find to replace it.</li>
<li>The "Best" version is actually the re-release of the PS2 version. I'm not sure why some places has it labeled as "Best", though there's no real difference between the two PS2 releases save price.&#160;:/</li>

<dd>If you think trying to search for <i>Air</i> is hard, try making a search for "Best" in relation to PlayStation 2 games. I just can't word my search to turn up what I want.

<dd>Oh, well yeah I knew it was used for other games too, I could have told you that.

<p>"The first versions of the visual novel are criticized for its inclusion of these scenes, which are thought to be out of place and detract from the actual plot of the visual novel. For this reason, Key released subsequent editions of Air without the erotic content."</p>
<p>I believe there is a lack of foundation in this statement, and would require citation. If one considers the primary audience of visual novels, it is hard to believe that the inclusion of H-scenes called for significant criticism. In fact, I believe one of the greater criticisms of Clannad, was the lack of H-scenes.</p>
<p>I believe the correct explanation of why subsequent releases of Air removed the scenes was because they were released on consoles, which are much more restricted as far as pornographic content goes. In fact, the DVD re-release of Air included the H-scenes. I understand that such scenes do draw some criticism, but as it is stated now, i believe that it is a misrepresentation of the true state of affairs. I believe this may have been brought up before, so I am merely asking for a citation or better proof. <a href="../../../p/i/f/User%7EPifactor_9b0b.html" title="User:Pifactor">Pifactor</a> 10:12, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I understand I might have waited too long to bring this up, but why is the title <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_%28series%29.html" title="Air (series)">Air (series)</a> when Air is not a series? (ie. there is no succession, no prequels and sequels, etc). At best, it is a franchise. I propose to move this page to Air (visual novel) or similar, since the TV anime and the movie have their own articles, and all adaptations originated from the game anyways.

<dd>While I do agree on the point that the article should have been renamed a long time, I disagree on what should be the designation. At WikiProject Anime and manga, it is listed <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EAnime_a66c.html#Article_name" title="WP:Anime">here</a> which states that for a game related article, the designation should be as follows: <i>Game related - title (game)</i>. I do realize why you chose to use the visual novel designation for <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_%28visual_novel%29.html" title="One (visual novel)">One (visual novel)</a> though I believe due to this convention, it should go back to simply (game). As such, I also would like to see this article renamed to <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_%28game%29.html" title="Air (game)">Air (game)</a> like it was so many months before.--<font color="#FF66CC"><b>(</b><a href="../../../j/u/h/User%7EJuhachi_79a5.html" title="User:Juhachi"><b><font color="#0066CC">十</font></b></a><a href="../../../j/u/h/User_talk%7EJuhachi_fae6.html" title="User talk:Juhachi"><b><font color="#0066CC">八</font></b></a><b>)</b></font> 21:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

Anyways, there are a number of other possible namespaces we could move it to if where I moved it to troubles anyone: Air (2000 video game) or Air (Key) to name two. However, considering how visual novels are only barely even considered "games" in the first place, I rather prefer to use (visual novel).--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 07:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>New suggestion: All right, we can start using (visual novel) to denote visual novel related articles that conflict with common names, like Air. To do this then, shouldn't the convention at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EAnime_a66c.html#Article_name" title="WP:Anime">WP:Anime#Article name</a> be renamed, or at the very least have a link to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Visual_novels_fdb9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Visual novels">Wikipedia:WikiProject Visual novels</a> where we can write in the convention ourselves?--<a href="../../../j/u/h/User%7EJuhachi_79a5.html" title="User:Juhachi"><b><font color="#0066CC">十</font></b></a><a href="../../../j/u/h/User_talk%7EJuhachi_fae6.html" title="User talk:Juhachi"><b><font color="#FF66CC">八</font></b></a> 07:56, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've moved it back to <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_%28game%29.html" title="Air (game)">Air (game)</a> for now, since it was less work to do that than moving talk archives, updating their double redirects, and fixing the left-over double redirects from the main move itself.

<dd>Yes, (game) is being phased out, usually to (video game) or (computer game) (e.g. <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_%28video_game%29.html" title="Black (video game)">Black (video game)</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_%26_White_%28computer_game%29_1f77.html" title="Black &amp; White (computer game)">Black &amp; White (computer game)</a>) but that doesn't work here anymore since it conflicts with <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_%281977_computer_game%29.html" title="Air (1977 computer game)">the other computer game named <i>Air</i></a>. I don't really care if it's (visual novel) or something else, but (game) is just horribly unspecific for <i>any</i> video game article, I think it's especially bad here since visual novels are only "games" in the loosest sense. The standard for multiple games of the same title is a little less consistant, so we don't really have anything to follow there. <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghostbusters_%28video_game%29.html" title="Ghostbusters (video game)">Ghostbusters (video game)</a> goes by company, but the other <i>Air</i> game wasn't even made by a company, so that might not be the best choice. So basically, it's either (visual novel) or (2000 video game), but not (2000 computer game) since it got ports and also not Air (video game) because a computer game is still a video game (and would thus conflict with the other article. The year format goes along with how films are handled, but I simply prefer the (visual novel) since that is how the lead identifies it.

<p>Err, the conversation seemed to die down without any sort of conclusion, but by the way it seems now I guess we're sticking with <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_%28game%29.html" title="Air (game)">Air (game)</a>? <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">_dk</a> 05:42, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I'm now pushing for Air (2000 video game). Film articles handle themselves by year, so I guess video game articles should be as well. The '(game)' most certainly should be switched to '(video game)' in some way though, as the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Video_games_abca.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Video games">Wikipedia:WikiProject Video games</a> has stopped using that for quite a while now.

<p>The theme section seems to be discussing motifs rather than the themes of the game itself. Keep in mind that a motif is a recurring symbol, and that a theme is what the symbols represent. The discussion of "air, skies, and wings" for example merely gives examples of how those particular symbols appear throughout the game/anime; therefore, they should be called "motifs," not themes. If one was to say, for example, the air represents the characters' desires for freedom, then "desire for freedom" would be a theme. Keep in mind that wikipedia is not for original research, so making any such conclusions would require a citation. Also, I haven't seen this anime/played this game so I have no idea what themes it could really be trying to get accross; I just used the "freedom" thing as an example. Anyway, someone who knows what they're doing should fix this. Maybe rename the section to Motifs and/or find citations for possible themes. 75.60.182.129 06:51, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
