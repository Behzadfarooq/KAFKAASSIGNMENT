<p>The Bell 222 has two <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turboshaft.html" title="Turboshaft">turboshaft engines</a>, a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streamliner.html" title="Streamliner">streamlined</a> shape, and is available with either retractable <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undercarriage.html" title="Undercarriage">undercarriage</a> or fixed skids. It is usually flown single-pilot (optional dual controls are available), and can be configured for corporate/executive, EMS or utility transport missions. The aircraft can be configured for accommodations of up to 10, including pilot.</p>
<p>The flying <i>Airwolf</i> helicopter was actually a <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_222.html" title="Bell 222">Bell 222</a> (serial number 47085, making it the fifth-to-last built before the 222B was released), registration number N3176S.</p>
<p>After the show was cancelled the modifications were removed from the actual helicopter. It was repainted and eventually sold to the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> helicopter charter company, Hubschrauber-Sonder-Dienst (aka HSD Luftrettung and Blue Helicopter Alliance), and given the registration number D-HHSD.<a href="http://www.helionline1.de/cgi-bin/ImageFolio31/imageFolio.cgi?search=D-HHSD&amp;img=0&amp;cat=&amp;bool=and" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.helionline1.de/cgi-bin/ImageFolio31/imageFolio.cgi?search=D-HHSD&amp;img=0&amp;cat=&amp;bool=and" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Airwolf, as a plain Bell 222 <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_ambulance.html" title="Air ambulance">air ambulance</a>, crashed in a thunderstorm on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_9.html" title="June 9">June 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, killing its three passengers</p>

<p><i>Airwolf</i> was painted <i>Phantom Gray Metallic</i> (DuPont Imron 5031X) on top, and a custom pearl-gray (almost white) on the bottom, in a <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orca.html" title="Orca">killer whale</a>-like pattern. The craft was also fitted with various prop modifications, such as "turbo jet" engines and intakes, an in-air refueling nozzle and blister cowling on the nose, retractable <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain_gun.html" title="Chain gun">chain guns</a> at the wingtips, and a retractable <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_rocket_launcher.html" title="Multiple rocket launcher">rocket launcher</a>, known as the "ADF Pod" (ADF standing for All Directional Firing, as the pod could rotate 180 degrees to fire at targets at the sides and rear of the copter) on its belly.</p>
<p>The look of the modifications was designed by Andrew Probert, who has <a href="http://www.probertdesigns.com/Folder_DESIGN/A-WOLF_Designs1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.probertdesigns.com/Folder_DESIGN/A-WOLF_Designs1.html" rel="nofollow">pictures of the construction</a> on his website, and they were first applied to the non-flying mock-up. (built from the body of the very first Bell 222, serial number 47001) From this mock-up molds were made so that parts could be made to <a href="../../../f/a/a/FAA_42fa.html" title="FAA">FAA</a> specifications before they were added to the flying helicopter.</p>
<p>After the first season, the producers were advised that "chain guns" is a registered trademark of <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonnell_Douglas_144e.html" title="McDonnell Douglas">McDonnell Douglas</a>, and they were not referred to as such again. Other modifications were implied with <a href="../../../f/o/l/Foley_artist.html" title="Foley artist">Foley</a> and sets; the interior sets were of a fantastical high-tech nature, and there were implied "<a href="../../../s/t/e/Stealth_technology.html" title="Stealth technology">stealth</a>" noise-reducing capabilities with creative use of <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_effects.html" title="Sound effects">sound effects</a>. <i>Airwolf</i> is sometimes referred to in-show as "The Lady" by Santini and Hawke.</p>
<p>The concept behind Airwolf was a super fast and armed helicopter that could "blend in" by appearing to be civilian and non-military in origin- A "wolf in sheep's clothing." Airwolf's insignia patch (also designed by Probert) as worn by the flight-crew was a snarling wolf's head with gossamer wings that appears to be wearing a sheepskin complete with the head of lamb over the wolf's forehead.</p>
<p>In the show, <i>Airwolf</i> was an armored, stealth aircraft, invisible to conventional radar. It could perform impossible manoeuvres and stunts, including traveling at mach speeds (the theoretical maximum speed of a helicopter is significantly below Mach 0.5, or half the speed of sound), flying upside down, and flying into the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratosphere.html" title="Stratosphere">stratosphere</a>. Some of these impossible capabilities are explained in the show by such features as auxiliary <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbojet.html" title="Turbojet">turbojet</a> engines like those of a jet fighter (visible at the roots of the landing gear <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sponson.html" title="Sponson">sponsons</a>), rotor blades that can be disengaged for <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supersonic.html" title="Supersonic">supersonic</a> flight and a lifting body fuselage (a seemingly-plausible claim given the shape of the Bell 222).</p>
<p>Sound effects were also associated with many of the aircraft's abilities. When <i>Airwolf</i> bolted across the sky in "turbo boost" mode, one would hear it "howl like a wolf" as it made a glass-shattering sound effect. When sitting idle, the aircraft made a mechanical trilling sound, and while hovering the rotor blades made a ghostly wind drone.</p>
<p>The weapons were state-of-the-art, with machine guns that could rip apart tanks and bunkers. The belly missile pod could fire a variety of rockets, including Air-to-Surface <a href="../../../a/g/m/AGM-65_Maverick_2718.html" title="AGM-65 Maverick">Mavericks</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/m/AGM-114_Hellfire_7674.html" title="AGM-114 Hellfire">Hellfire</a> and heat-seeking <a href="../../../a/i/m/AIM-9_Sidewinder_d1a5.html" title="AIM-9 Sidewinder">Sidewinders</a>. When fired, these rockets usually glowed like a laser bolt or "<a href="../../../p/h/o/Photon_torpedo.html" title="Photon torpedo">photon torpedo</a>" in <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i>. <i>Airwolf</i> was also equipped with an advanced computer system which could identify and track aircraft and ground vehicles. It could display 3D wireframe models and schematics of its targets. The communications system could eavesdrop on radio and telephone conversations, tap into and foul up computer systems, jam enemy transmission frequencies and disrupt ground-based electrical systems. The weapons system could be tied in with the communications system to lock the missiles onto any monitored electronic system. Though never used in the show, Airwolf was also equipped with “<a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapons.html" title="Nuclear weapons">nuclear</a>-tipped Shrike missiles”. The button that fires these missiles is near the button that turns on the signal decoder (used to communicate with Archangel).</p>
<p>In one episode ("Airwolf II"), <i>Airwolf</i> had an <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil_twin.html" title="Evil twin">evil twin</a>, the <i>Airwolf II</i>, also known as <i>Redwolf</i>. The Redwolf was built by The Firm to replace <i>Airwolf</i>, but was stolen and flown by an egotistical test-pilot rival of Stringfellow Hawke’s called Harlan Jenkins. <i>Redwolf</i> differed from <i>Airwolf</i> in that its underbelly was painted red (where <i>Airwolf'</i> was painted pearl-grey). It was also equipped with a powerful laser weapon. By the end of the episode, <i>Redwolf</i> was destroyed by <i>Airwolf</i>. In later episodes and throughout the 4th season, <i>Airwolf</i> had a similar laser, suggesting that it was salvaged from the wreckage of the <i>Redwolf</i>. Season 4 also featured a similar copter to the <i>Redwolf</i>, known as the <i>Scorpion</i>. This copter was also destroyed by <i>Airwolf</i> (though the footage of the dogfighting was recycled from the "Airwolf II" episode).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airwolf_%28helicopter%29.html" title="Edit section: Trivia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>A perfect new replica of the full-size <i>Airwolf</i> helicopter was created for display in a new helicopter museum that opened in August 2006. The build can be viewed at <a href="http://projects.airwolf.tv/ssmockup/index.html" class="external text" title="http://projects.airwolf.tv/ssmockup/index.html" rel="nofollow">Airwolf.tv</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In reality, the <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerospatiale_Gazelle_4c87.html" title="Aerospatiale Gazelle">Aerospatiale Gazelle</a> helicopter (<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Thunder_ce32.html" title="Blue Thunder">Blue Thunder</a>) was more maneuverable and faster, with a 3-bladed main rotor and <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenestron.html" title="Fenestron">fenestron</a> tail rotor, plus a top speed of 310 kmh (193 mph), while <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_222.html" title="Bell 222">Bell 222</a> helicopter (Airwolf) had a 2-bladed main and 2-bladed tail rotor (the same system as the Vietnam era <a href="../../../u/h/-/UH-1_Huey_a71f.html" title="UH-1 Huey">UH-1 Huey</a> and <a href="../../../a/h/-/AH-1_Cobra_b920.html" title="AH-1 Cobra">AH-1 Cobra</a>), and a top speed of 250 kmh (155 mph).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The ADF pod's missile tubes were only large enough to carry the <a href="../../../f/i/m/FIM-43_Redeye_c8f3.html" title="FIM-43 Redeye">Redeye</a> missiles (<a href="../../../f/i/m/FIM-92_Stinger_28b2.html" title="FIM-92 Stinger">FIM-92 Stinger</a> is the modern equivalent). For example, Airwolf is about 13 meters long (42 feet), and a typical <a href="../../../m/a/v/Maverick.html" title="Maverick">Maverick</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrike.html" title="Shrike">Shrike</a> or <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidewinder.html" title="Sidewinder">Sidewinder</a> missile is about 3 meters long (10 feet), about 1/4th the length of Airwolf. Actual 40 mm cannon would be about the same size, which is why aircraft, especially helicopters, do not carry them, except for small, short range 40 mm <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenade_launchers.html" title="Grenade launchers">grenade launchers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In pre-development sketches Airwolf was depicted as having the capability to carry larger missiles in internal compartments on either side of the ADF pod, to include AIM-4/26(nuclear) Falcon Missiles. These capabilities were never displayed in the series, but could explain the scripting of larger missile capability. However footage in the pilot clearly shows a "large missile" (i.e. greater length than the practical limit of the ADF pod) being fired from the ADF pod (the Bullpup missile fired at the US Destroyer). A possible but also highly unlikely explanation would be that Airwolf uses tailor made versions of these missiles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Although Airwolf carries 30-mm Chain Guns and 40-mm Cannons, in the beginning of the Pilot, Airwolf's "wingtip" pod is described as carrying "30mm Cannons." The Universal construction blueprints, shots of which we see in Airwolf's opening credits, describes the "Chain Guns" as 2x .50 caliber and a <i>30mm cannon</i>; these specifications are also listed in the 'File A56-7W' briefings in the first season. These are the sizes of Airwolf's original guns; however, the prop guns mounted on the helicopter were too small to be seen properly and were enlarged at the request of Don Bellisario. The term 'Chain Guns' was used until it was determined to be a trademarked term, after which it was simply replaced by String calling for 'combat mode'.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>With a fuselage height of about 2 meters (6 feet),it is dubious that Airwolf could carry the larger fin missiles such as the <a href="../../../a/g/m/AGM-45_Shrike_e4c5.html" title="AGM-45 Shrike">AGM-45 Shrike</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/m/AGM-12_Bullpup_8c6e.html" title="AGM-12 Bullpup">AGM-12 Bullpup</a>, and the proposed <a href="../../../a/i/m/AIM-26_Falcon_eb21.html" title="AIM-26 Falcon">AIM-26 Falcon</a>, which had wingspans of about 0.6 to 0.9 meters (2 to 3 feet). Storing these internally, let alone 12 large AIM or AGM missiles, instead of the smaller Redeyes, would mean no crew areas, and would exceed the practical limit of the fuselage, let alone the ADF pod. Ammunition feed from the fuselage, through the turbojet engines, then through the landing gear, to the guns in wing stubs, no matter what size caliber, was equally dubious.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Probert_bf7e.html" title="Andrew Probert">Andrew Probert</a>'s original concept sketches, the <a href="../../../a/i/m/AIM-26_Falcon_eb21.html" title="AIM-26 Falcon">AIM-26 Falcon</a> (about 6 feet long with a 2 feet wingspan), which were proposed to be mounted in hatches on either side of the ADF pod, were rejected by the studio. Waist guns, just aft of the camera section, were also rejected, due to practical reasons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In some episodes, it is suggested that <i>Airwolf</i> is more than just a machine. The clearest of these is “Mind of the Machine”, in which <i>Airwolf</i> is directly described as having been called “very much a living thing” by Moffet, according to one of the former test pilots (played by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Carradine_42d1.html" title="David Carradine">David Carradine</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The second season episode HX-1, featured a modified <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikorsky_S-76_8bae.html" title="Sikorsky S-76">Sikorsky S-76</a> as an adversary that can nearly out-fly &amp; out-gun Airwolf. It carried 20 missiles in port and starboard side box-shaped pods, and in the nose it carried a pair of multi-barreled cannon (caliber unknown) and a pair of much larger cannon, maybe 60 to 70 mm, capable of blasting through concrete.</li>
