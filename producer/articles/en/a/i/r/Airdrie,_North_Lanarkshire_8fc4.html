<p>The history of a settlement near modern-day Airdrie may be dated back to AD 577, which was the year of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle.html" title="Battle">Battle</a> of Arderyth<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>(Airdrie).

The history of Airdrie between the Battle of Arderyth and AD 1162 is unclear, due to the scarcity of written historical records.</p>

<p>Airdrie owes its existence to its location on the "Hogs Back" - the ridge of land running from east to west. One very important aspect of the town’s history were the "monks", hence the name of the area; Monklands. The monks were farmers and most of the land they used is known today as “Four Isles” (a housing estate named after four Scottish islands; <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Mull_e88d.html" title="Isle of Mull">Mull</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islay.html" title="Islay">Islay</a>, <a href="../../../i/o/n/Iona.html" title="Iona">Iona</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luing.html" title="Luing">Luing</a> in the Petersburn area of modern Airdrie). The <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monks.html" title="Monks">Monks</a> of Newbattle had numerous establishments throughout the area including a <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farm.html" title="Farm">farm</a> grange at Drumpellier, Coatbridge, a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court.html" title="Court">Court</a> House at <a href="../../../k/i/p/Kipps.html" title="Kipps">Kipps</a>, a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chapel.html" title="Chapel">Chapel</a> in the area of Chapelhall and a number of <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maize.html" title="Maize">corn</a> <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mill_%28grinding%29.html" title="Mill (grinding)">mills</a> - one being the original Airdrie Meal mill. The Monks were also expert in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Construction.html" title="Construction">construction</a> of <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roads.html" title="Roads">roads</a>. In the <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_century.html" title="12th century">12th century</a> they established the original Glasgow to <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> road via Airdrie and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathgate.html" title="Bathgate">Bathgate</a>, to link up with their lands in Newbattle in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Lothian_1b87.html" title="East Lothian">East Lothian</a>.</p>
<p>In those days travelling was lonely and dangerous. Horses were still very rare and could only be afforded by the rich. Low lying ground was usually extremely difficult to navigate because of the numerous <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogs.html" title="Bogs">bogs</a>, forests and <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burns.html" title="Burns">burns</a> - not to mention the possibility of <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambush.html" title="Ambush">ambush</a> by a <a href="../../../f/o/o/Footpad.html" title="Footpad">footpad</a> or robber. Hence, it became much more practical to travel on the high ground (the "High Way") where one could avoid the mud and the robbers. These roads (tracks) became known as the King's Highway.</p>

<p>Definitive evidence of the existence of Airdrie as a tenantry was only made clear in 1503. The old Monks road was via Cliftonhill (an area now in neighbouring <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coatbridge.html" title="Coatbridge">Coatbridge</a>), Airdrie House (now the site of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monklands_Hospital_410b.html" title="Monklands Hospital">Monklands Hospital</a>), Aitchison Street, High Street, Hallcraig, Flowerhill and Colliertree. It was along this road that the first houses in Airdrie were built. Development was slow and it was only around 1650 that evidence of the number of <a href="../../../p/o/p/Population.html" title="Population">inhabitants</a> was known at around 500 for the Airdrie area.</p>
<p>Airdrie first came to prominence for its <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weaving.html" title="Weaving">weaving</a> industry. Airdrie Weavers Society was founded in 1781 and <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flax.html" title="Flax">flax</a> was being grown in sixteen farms in and around the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgh.html" title="Burgh">burgh</a>. In the last decade of the eighteenth century, <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalmining.html" title="Coalmining">coalmining</a> was in progress and around thirty <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collier.html" title="Collier">colliers</a> were employed. Weaving continued to flourish making up a substantial part of the population of over 2,500 around the turn of the 19th century. The rapid pace of population growth continued and by 1821 there were 4,862 inhabitants. At this time the number of houses being built increased dramatically and 1821 by a private <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Parliament_f749.html" title="Act of Parliament">Act of Parliament</a>, Airdrie became a free and independent Burgh of Barony. Due to the fact it was "independent", as it had all the powers of a <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Burgh_c66b.html" title="Royal Burgh">Royal Burgh</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../../../v/o/t/Voting.html" title="Voting">Voting</a> in the early part of the nineteenth century was rather hit or miss as not only locals but residents outside the burgh were allowed to vote. In general it was not popular at any rate with only thirty eight attending the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election.html" title="Election">election</a> meeting. In 1821 the first election of a town council took place and by August had appointed an assessor, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procurator_fiscal.html" title="Procurator fiscal">procurator fiscal</a>, master of police and a <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_crier.html" title="Town crier">town crier</a>.</p>
<p>In 1824 it was decided to build the Town House, which is now a local landmark known as the “town clock.” In 1832 the Town House was used as a hospital due to the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Cholera.html" title="Cholera">cholera</a> outbreak of this year. It was originally designed by Alexander Baird.</p>
<p>By 1850, the population had grown to 12,418.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airdrie%2C_North_Lanarkshire_8fc4.html" title="Edit section: 1850 to 1920">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1850 to 1920</span></h3>
<p>The enormous growth in population was not due to high birthrate, but instead due to an influx of residents from the <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highlands.html" title="Highlands">Highlands</a> and predominantly <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. This followed the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potato_famine.html" title="Potato famine">potato famine</a> of the mid 1840s and also reflected the change from cottage industry to <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_industry.html" title="Heavy industry">heavy industry</a> in the area. Most of the <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> immigrant population were involved with <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mining.html" title="Mining">mining</a> and labouring. This led to an increase in ironwork <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundries.html" title="Foundries">foundries</a> around the area. Because of this explosion in industry, <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway.html" title="Railway">railway</a> links were soon established (circa 1830) and by 1862, the Airdrie and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathgate.html" title="Bathgate">Bathgate</a> Junction Railway provided a direct link to Edinburgh with Airdrie South Station providing the starting point for trains to Glasgow.</p>
<p>An evolution of the rise in population and industry prompted for more accessible water supplies. Until mid 1800s, various wells were put in place feeding from surrounding streams in the area. These served to provide many houses with private wells. By 1846 Airdrie and Coatbridge Water Company was founded to construct (along with Forth and Clyde Canal Company) the reservoir at Roughrigg.</p>
<p>Around the mid 1800s, several local <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspapers.html" title="Newspapers">newspapers</a> began appearing and notably the Airdrie &amp; Coatbridge Advertiser, which is still the most popular local paper today. Also at this time, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> began to emerge as popular sports. Owing to the formation of the Football under Association rules and through this beginning, <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excelsior.html" title="Excelsior">Excelsior</a> (the local football team until then) became <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airdrieonians_FC_ca54.html" title="Airdrieonians FC">Airdrieonians FC</a> in 1878. Race meetings were also held in the town (1851 - 1870) but this land became the golf course for the newly formed Airdrie Golf Club in 1877 (which later moved site to and Glenmavis in 1884).</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/d/u/Education.html" title="Education">Education</a> posed a major problem with severe overcrowding in the few schools available, therefore three new school boards were established. Fees were routinely charged within the schools with the belief they should be self-supporting until the Act of 1889 when some of the infant classes in schools were relieved of this burden. <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airdrie_Academy_9a59.html" title="Airdrie Academy">Airdrie Academy</a> was built in 1895 and by 1919 all school boards were dissolved and Lanarkshire Education Authority took over responsibility for education throughout <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanarkshire.html" title="Lanarkshire">Lanarkshire</a>.</p>
<p>By the turn of the century and certainly by 1910, <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_shows.html" title="Variety shows">variety shows</a> were becoming popular in the area and by 1911 the Pavillion in Graham Street was built which after initially being used as a music hall started showing cinematographic pictures. Unfortunately it was destroyed by fire in 1917 but was rebuilt in 1919 (closed in 1970 for re-development). The New Cinema was opened in 1920 in Broomknoll Street but has since closed. The town had no suitable venue for larger functions so in 1912 the Sir John Wilson Town Hall was opened (following a generous offer from Sir John Wilson covering the total cost of 13,500 GBP). This still stands and is used for major events in the town.</p>

<p>At the end of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>, Airdrie was hard hit with many casualties from the war and also many inhabitants emigrated. The population only rose by 3% to around 26,000 by 1931. The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">depression</a> years had made a great impact on the town and several well known manufacturers ceased to exist and few replaced them. It was reported that 50% of the registered population were <a href="../../../u/n/e/Unemployed.html" title="Unemployed">unemployed</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_0df1.html" title="The Church">The Church</a> groups tried to provide some comfort for the poor folk in the area and set up educational and work experience projects to help and by 1936 the Airdrie Churches Council had attracted national interest through their work culminating in a building in Graham Street being provided for them (Mutual Service Club). This is now Airdrie Community Centre.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/i/r/Airdrie_Public_Library_e4ab.html" title="Airdrie Public Library">Airdrie Public Library</a>, the first public library in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, was eventually built on its present site in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a> after years of moving from one site to another.</p>
<p>Conditions in the town did not really improve until well after the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> but in 1949 a major <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharmaceutical_company.html" title="Pharmaceutical company">pharmaceutical company</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Boots.html" title="Boots">Boots</a> Pure Drug Co. Ltd) and Banner Textiles Ltd were attracted to the town (between them employing 1200). With this impetus, new companies began to consider Airdrie as a viable option for business and in 1958 Pye Scottish Communications Ltd opened employing over 1000 people. The emergence of industrial estates was also prevalent around this time. (Newhouse; Chapelhall; Brownsburn) A well known building in the town is Airdrie Arts Centre - opened in 1967, it is still a popular venue for concerts and plays.</p>

<p>Airdrie town centre has changed much in the last 10 years with a new road scheme and a shift in emphasis with the type of shopping it offers. Graham Street, the main <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedestrianised.html" title="Pedestrianised">pedestrianised</a> street, has recently been refurbished and has had the pedestrian precinct area upgraded. New housing complexes are being built around this suitably situated commuter town and notably in Chapelhall, Rochsoles and Glenmavis and the former Boots factory site in Rawyards.</p>
<p>The local football team, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airdrieonians_F.C._ff72.html" title="Airdrieonians F.C.">Airdrieonians F.C.</a>, whose history included winning the Scottish Cup in 1924 and reaching the final in 1975, 1992 and 1995, faced financial troubles resultant from the Taylor Report instructing clubs to have all seated stadia. The team sold their stadium at Broomfield to a supermarket chain but had various planning applications rejected in their bid to build a new stadium. Their period of homelessness meant fans travelled to Cumbernauld, to Clyde F.C.'s stadium for home matches. Attendances decreased and shortly after moving to their new stadium the club found themselves in administration and later were announced to be insolvent. Airdrie was without a football league club until the formation of Airdrie United who bought over Clydebank football club and regained their status in the football league under the new name. Airdrie United F.C.'s a new stadium is officially called Excelsior Stadium (but known as New Broomfield), formerly Shyberry Excelsior on land adjacent to Carlisle Road and the Petersburn area of the town.</p>
<p>In Chapelhall, the EuroCentral link for Europe allows direct links with Europe by <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_transport.html" title="Rail transport">rail</a> and road connecting to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and onto <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. Albert Bartlett &amp; Sons have expanded their fresh produce operations to a new site on the Stirling Road towards Cumbernauld which vastly increases their presence in the town. The headquarters of beCogent Group, a major leader in <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telesales.html" title="Telesales">telesales</a> and virtual help-desking is within the Cairnhill area of the town.</p>
