<p>The statistics shown prove absolutely nothing. The fact that less ships were sunk near the US coast is presented as a direct consequence of US airships patrolling. The fact that there were remarkable advances in other areas (convoying, fixed wing aircraft, escort numbers, radar and HFDF technology) is completely left out. Furthermore the "fact" that a blimp was responsible for the last u-boat sinking is wrong. First of all, it makes it sound as if this was the "last uboat" left to the Germans, which is untrue. Furthermore, according to www.uboat.net U-881 was sunk my the USS Farquhar, an escort destroyer, not by the vessels mentioned.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know about the "last uboat sinking". But on the other topic, there were many reports from u-boat captains that they would submerge and leave the area whenever a blimp was spotted. Were blimps responsible for all of the improvement, probably not. There should be some strong mention of the other technologies that contributed. If you are knowledgable, please add something appropriate. But remember NPOV and don't dismiss the blimps' contribution completely. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlimpguy_3410.html" title="User:Blimpguy">Blimpguy</a> 00:03, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi # 24.91.229.111. I saw you did that earlier. Are they exact synonyms? If so, you're right, we should merge.

<p>No, they are not exact synonyms. On the contrary, there are several types of airship that are not dirigibles - notably blimps and balloons. This doesn't have to mean that the airship page should not go, however. There used to be a page on airplane/aeroplane (which was frequently renamed back and forth as US English and International English speakers argued the term) and this was reduced to a redirect and the content incorporated in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft.html" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a>. Even though a simple redirect to dirigible is inappropriate, I think there is a case for treating this in the same way as we treated airplane/aeroplane. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 22:23 Jan 22, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>-- Hmm. I believe that I merged the content before reducing the "airship" page. That said, I have never heard anyone in the business use the term "airship" to include balloons. The distinction between the propelled and non-propelled craft is pretty standard. Do you have a reference?</p>
<p>-- Ah, I see the confusion now. Tannin is confusing dirigible with rigid airship. In fact, blimps and rigid airships are types of airships. See the <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirigible.html" title="Dirigible">dirigible</a> page for details.</p>

<dd>I don't know enough about this subject to be sure what's what. However, having a large "tree" of links at the top of several articles is a bad idea.

<p>-- I'm pretty sure of the classifications. So, unless I hear otherwise, I'll consolidate under "airship" since it is the common terms. The term 'dirigible' is a technical term based on a french word. So I'll leave a pointer from "dirigible" to "airship" with an explanation of "dirigible's" french origin.</p>
<p>The "See also" list was there when I first started working on this page. I'll try to make the "airship" page more conforming. Blimpguy Thu Jan 23 21:08:25 GMT 2003</p>

<p>There is one thing to consider, though most users will search for the term airship, dirigible should be a page unto itself because all dirigibles are steerable boyant craft (balloons), where-as airships also include heavier-than-air craft though that isn't common knowledge these days. The 747 is an actual airship and we should maybe note that difference in the two pages. Dirigible is the more acurate term for what we consider airship and though people say it is based on French it actually comes from a Latin term. The Italian, French, English, and Spanish terms are almost the same and derive from the origional term. I should look it up but not tonight (I think it was dirage). Anyway, I feel there should be slightly different pages for both airship and dirigible.</p>
<dl>
<dd>How one comes down on this issue depends upon whether one wishes to use the terms in their technical meaning or informally. Within the aviation field, the terms are (in modern times) always used as described in the article. There is a brief discussion in the article of the informal use of "airship" to mean all aircraft. There is also a discussion of "dirigible". Rather than making an entire "dirigible" article, perhaps you might want to flesh out the existing discussion(s). As for French vs Latin -- sure, the original root was Latin. However, France was the center of work in the field during the 1800's when the term was first applied. Thus, the English usage is usually described as being derived from the French rather than Latin.</dd>

<p>Does anyone know how airships control thier altitude? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_bellman_55cf.html" title="User:The bellman">The bellman</a> 01:26, 2005 Jun 14 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Quick answer: They control their buoyancy. To go up, they might heat the lifting gas or allow it to expand. To go down, they might release some lifting gas or compress it. Finally, some airships use engines and a wing shaped body to generate lift, which requires that these airships have engines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Blimps use large bags of lifting gas to stay up, and by compressing these bags they reduce their lifting power. Doesn't the article cover this? -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User%7EEc5618_0777.html" title="User:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 10:13, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The "quick answer" above is wrong. It is a common misconception, but Helium-based airships do not change altitude by controlling bouyancy. Typically they fly a bit "heavy" and actually drive around using aerodynamic lift created by pitching the nose of the aircraft upward. When they want to come down, they just reduce power. The ballonettes inside the envelope are used only to compensate for changes in ambient pressure as well as internal temperature in order to maintain the Helium pressure within a very small range. Compressing Helium to change bouyancy is an very power hungry process (15 hp-minutes for 1 lb change in bouyancy) -- so nobody does it. The total lack of bouyancy control is what makes piloting an airship so difficult. In particular, if the ship takes off on a cool morning with full fuel and lands in the sunlight (heating the gas inside the envelope) and little fuel, the ship will often be "light". In this case the pilot needs to drive the ship at the ground and the ground crew needs to quickly attach sandbags or other ballast in order to keep the ship from floating away. An exciting event indeed. It is true that airships do carry some ballast and (particularly the "big rigids" of the last century) would adjust their bouyancy at the time of landing to reduce the excitement level. In fact, today the FAA requires that all airships carry suffient ballast so as to allow for "free ballooning" the ship to a safe landing should there be a total loss of enging power. However I believe that no operational airship ever adjusted altitude by means of ballast either (except Solomon Andrews and his Aereon back in the 1800's) Thermal airships (i.e. those using hot air rather than Helium) do control altitude by controlling bouyancy in the same way that a hot air balloon does. I guess I should add this stuff to the article at some point. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlimpguy_3410.html" title="User:Blimpguy">Blimpguy</a> 12:07, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You should definitely add your excellent explanation. It makes total sense. The gas only provides part of the lift, the engines and wings have to provide the balance of it along with the control (such as it is). Being almost-lighter-than-air sometimes, and actually-lighter-than-air at other times makes for inherent instability. That's probably why most of the famous airships ultimately crashed. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:26, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My sense is that the early airships crashed for basically the same reason that many early airplanes crashed. They were experimental craft in an era when there was much less known about aviation. Unfortunately, airships were so large that every accident made the papers. Early airplane crashes usually killed only one or two people and were thus less newsworthy. By WWII airships had evolved into robust, reliable machines. But it was too late. The early mishaps were deeply ingrained in the public perception and the technology was essentially abandoned after the war. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlimpguy_3410.html" title="User:Blimpguy">Blimpguy</a> 15:02, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a good point. Even one of the Wright Brothers eventually died from a plane crash, as I recall. But planes, at least the big ones, almost never crash nowadays, whereas the lasting image in the public mind, whenever the term "airship", "dirigible" or "zeppelin" is used, is of the <i>Hindenburg</i> disaster. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 17:12, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, Wilbur worried himself to death over patent suits trying to stop everybody else (particularly Glen Curtis) from building aircraft and Orville died of natural causes as an old man. Orville did manage to kill one of his first passengers, an army captain he was training, in 1908. Lots and lots of pilots of early Wright flyers, as well as other early airplanes, also died largely because the aircraft were aerodynamically unstable. But again, the deaths were 1 and 2 at a time and so were never charactarized in the press as "catastrophes" the way that every early airship mishap seems to have been. The other issue at play is that it is easy to build a small airplane (anybody can make one out of a piece of paper or balsa wood) but hard to build a big airplane. The reverse is true with airships, big is easy -- small is hard. As a result, the first airships were hundreds of feet long and when something went wrong, the price was high in both gold and blood. Understandably, people quickly grew tired of paying that price and focused instead on airplanes that presented less dramatic risks. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlimpguy_3410.html" title="User:Blimpguy">Blimpguy</a> 15:46, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was a famous incident caught on newsreel film, sometime in the 1920s I think, when a group was trying to tether an airship (maybe the Akron or the Macon), a gust of wind caught it, and three guys held onto the ropes too long. Two of them fell to their deaths because the balloon was too high by then, the third managed to hang on long enough for the ship to land again. I saw that clip on TV when I was in single-digits, and it made a strong impression, as you can tell. &#160;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:26, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

Controlling altitude on an airship could also be done by carrying ballast, such as water. To go up you drop ballast out of the ship, and to go down you release lifting gas.--<b>Rob01</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Some very early airships did indeed use this method of altitude control. However dynamic lift (point the nose up or down and using engine power to drive the ship in the desired direction) has been adopted by all modern airships (except thermal ships) as the preferred means of altitude control. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlimpguy_3410.html" title="User:Blimpguy">Blimpguy</a> 20:00, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Airships using the Zeppelin construction method are sometimes referred to as zeppelins even if they had no connection to the Zeppelin business. Several airships of this kind were built in the USA, Britain, Italy, and the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s, mostly imitating original Zeppelin design derived from crashed or captured German World War I airships"</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I know... Italy never built rigid airships, only semi-rigids. They did take delivery of three zeppelins as war spoils. The first two were wrecked due to incompetant ground handling, the third "Esperia" (LZ120-Bodensee) operated sporadically until 1925. Russia never recieved or bult any zeppelins and built up to 12 semi-rigids based on the designs of Umberto Nobile in the 1930's and 1940's <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenvenuto_eab9.html" title="User:Benvenuto">Benvenuto</a> 09:29, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The US-rigids USS Akron and USS Macon werde build by the <i>Goodyear Zeppelin-Coorporation</i>. So they could be partially called "real Zeppelins".

<p>What be the thoughts?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The folks at Zeppelin, in particular Eckener, lobbied hard to get Helium for the Hindenburg. At the time, the US had a near monopoly on Helium (which was a biproduct of some natural gas wells in the Oklahoma/Texas area.) But the federal government, in particular Interior Secretary Harold Ickes, were concerned about the potential military use of airships and were thus reluctant to provide the Helium. Eckener, et al went ahead with the construction of a helium-based design even though the weren't sure that they would be able to get Helium in the end. As it happened, they didn't.

<p>Befire this turns into a revert war, I want to hear opinions from others.

<dd>I think you have good cause to be skeptical. And I appreciate you're starting a discussion before reverting. As for the topic at hand, while I agree that the Turtle airships site is a bit over the top, I don't believe that it can reasonably be characterized as fraudulent. I've met the prime mover behind this site, a chap named Darrell Campbell, once or twice at airship conferences. And, in my opinion, he's anything but a con man. He's a professional baker with a passion for airships. For many years he had a site at www.turtleairships.com. I don't know why he switched domains. (If you care, you can check out the old site at the WayBack machine at www.archive.org ) If the concern is that the site is commercial, then by that standard, we should remove the links to all of the manufacturers and operators as well as nearly all of the prototype designs. I think that would be a serious loss to the article. If the concern is that it is non-credible, then question becomes "credible to whom?" I could find you one airship "expert" or another who could make an strong argument that every single design listed in the article lacked credibility. I don't see any particular reason to pick on Turtle Airships just because their site is a bit more goofy than the others listed under "proposed designs". Like the other folks listed in that section, these folks have an idea and have given it some thought. Just because there is a link to his site doesn't mean that anybody is endorsing their work. But if there is a consensus to remove the link, of course I'll go along. No revert war from me. Lastly, to be clear, I have no connection with these folks other than as an observer of the field. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlimpguy_3410.html" title="User:Blimpguy">Blimpguy</a> 21:08, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

However I can find no connection between Turtle Airships and "Half Mile High Club", can you? I don't think this guy Campbell is behind that site. www.halfmilehighclub.com is not credible is because it:
<ul>
<li>Begs us for money.</li>
<li>Has no real Contact Info.</li>
<li>Has no verifyable facts.</li>

I agree it should be added to the noteworthy experiments section. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlimpguy_3410.html" title="User:Blimpguy">Blimpguy</a> 15:18, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this is a bad idea. If anything, the airship article is too larger already. Merging in information from the non-rigid article, such as the discussion of the origin of the term 'blimp' will only make the problem worse. However, the non-rigid article is fairly small. The better approach would be to move some of the non-rigid specific information that is currently in the airship article to the non-rigid article. The non-rigid article could also use some clean-up and fleshing out of its text. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlimpguy_3410.html" title="User:Blimpguy">Blimpguy</a> 21:31, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The mention of ground crew in the opening paragraph raises in my mind the topic of operation in general. There should probably be a section on operation including discussion of ballast, superheat, ground operations, etc. I've left the point about ground crew in the opening paragraph until such a section is created (I don't have time now - others are invited to take the lead.) at which point it should be moved. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlimpguy_3410.html" title="User:Blimpguy">Blimpguy</a> 17:48, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
