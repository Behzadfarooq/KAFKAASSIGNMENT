<p><b>Air Europe</b> was a wholly privately owned, Independent <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline.html" title="Airline">airline</a>, established in 1978 under the working title <b>Inter European Airways</b>.<sup id="_ref-friends_10_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_10" title="">[1]</a></sup> It adopted the <b>Air Europe</b> name the following year.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>It's main operational base was at <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Gatwick_Airport_25db.html" title="London Gatwick Airport">London Gatwick Airport</a>, where it commenced commercial airline operations in <a href="../../../m/a/y/May.html" title="May">May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> with three brand-new <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_737.html" title="Boeing 737">Boeing 737</a>-200 "Advanced" <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet.html" title="Jet">jet</a> aircraft.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Air Europe was the brainchild of Errol Cossey and Martin O'Regan, two former <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan-Air_c3ba.html" title="Dan-Air">Dan-Air</a> executives. Harry Goodman, who had founded <b>Intasun Leisure</b> during the early 1970s, became the airline's main financial backer as well as the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairman.html" title="Chairman">chairman</a> of the <b>International Leisure Group (ILG)</b>, the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parent_company.html" title="Parent company">parent company</a> of both Air Europe and Intasun Leisure.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Air Europe was the main supplier of charter seats to Intasun Leisure, which grew during the 1980s to become the UK's second-largest <a href="../../../p/a/c/Package_tour.html" title="Package tour">package tour</a> operator (after long-established market leader Thomson Holidays).</p>
<p>Air Europe aggressively expanded during the 1980s to become one of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>'s leading <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charter_airline.html" title="Charter airline">charter airlines</a> with a major scheduled presence on a number of short-haul <a href="../../../e/u/r/European.html" title="European">European</a> trunk routes out of Gatwick.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the 1980s Air Europe became the first airline to acquire a <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-European_a481.html" title="Pan-European">pan-European</a> presence by setting up several subsidiaries on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">Continent</a>. Air Europe also acquired two small regional airlines, forming the nucleus of a new <b>Air Europe Express</b> <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regional_airline.html" title="Regional airline">regional airline</a> subsidiary. These acquired <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airport_slots.html" title="Airport slots">slots</a> at Gatwick enabled it to increase frequencies as well as launch new scheduled routes. By the end of the decade Air Europe had become Gatwick's largest resident airline operator.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Air Europe's stellar success came to an end when growing financial problems at its parent company undermined the financial performance of the airline and its sister companies from late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> onwards.</p>
<p>ILG and all its UK-based subsidiaries - including Air Europe - went bankrupt on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_8.html" title="March 8">March 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Since its beginning in the 1950s, the UK <a href="../../../p/a/c/Package_tour.html" title="Package tour">package tour</a> industry has been characterised by its cyclicality. There were pronounced periods of growth and contraction.</p>
<p>The first two periods of major growth had occurred during the mid-1960s and early '70s, respectively. These were followed by a period of major contraction during the mid-'70s, mainly as a result of the 1973 <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_crisis.html" title="Oil crisis">oil crisis</a>. This, in turn, was followed by renewed expansion during the second half of the 1970s.</p>
<p>The industry's spurt of growth in the late '70s was accompanied by a growing shortage of whole-plane charter seats, which was further exacerbated by <a href="../../../l/a/k/Laker_Airways_76fe.html" title="Laker Airways">Laker Airways</a>' decision to drastically reduce its short- to medium-haul charter activities, as a result of that airline's increasing focus on its long-haul, transatlantic "Skytrain" scheduled "<a href="../../../n/o/_/No_frills.html" title="No frills">no frills</a>" services, as well as by <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Caledonian_c69f.html" title="British Caledonian">British Caledonian</a>'s decision to completely withdraw from the charter market.</p>
<p>Hence, the time to start a new charter airline seemed opportune.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="A_radical_departure_from_established_practices_in_the_charter_airline_industry" id="A_radical_departure_from_established_practices_in_the_charter_airline_industry"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Europe_6ecf.html" title="Edit section: A radical departure from established practices in the charter airline industry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A radical departure from established practices in the charter airline industry</span></h4>
<p>During his time as Dan-Air's associate director in charge of the airline's operations, Errol Cossy had overseen the successful introduction of several new <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet.html" title="Jet">jet</a> aircraft types into Dan-Air's fleet, beginning with the <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Comet_b1bf.html" title="De Havilland Comet">De Havilland Comet</a> series 4 in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> and continuing with the <a href="../../../b/a/c/BAC_1-11_b1ae.html" title="BAC 1-11">BAC 1-11</a> 400 series in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_707.html" title="Boeing 707">Boeing 707</a>-320 "Intercontinental" in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_727.html" title="Boeing 727">Boeing 727</a>-100 in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> as well as the BAC 1-11-500 in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup> He also had control over the entire charter fleet, which numbered 28 aircraft during the mid-1970s. At that time, Intasun used to contract a growing share of its business to Dan-Air. Intasun, like Dan-Air at that time, used to have a somewhat "downmarket" image. It was mainly competing on price with the other tour operators, notably market leader Thomson Holidays. The reason it was able to undercut the competition while continuing to expand profitably was that it first waited for all the other operators to place their business with Dan-Air and only then placed its contracts, fitting in with whenever aircraft and crews were available. This meant that a lot of Intasun's business involved mid-week and night flying. This, in turn, was a "win-win" for both operator and airline. It enabled Intasun to charter aircraft at substantially lower rates than its competitors, who had to pay a premium for chartering planes at week-end peak times, and it permitted Dan-Air to increase its fleet's utilisation, thereby boosting the company's overall profitability. However, the high fuel consumption of Dan-Air's "mix'n match" fleet - especially the Comets, which at that time made up the bulk of its charter fleet - against the backdrop of steeply rising <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_fuel.html" title="Jet fuel">jet fuel</a> prices in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis made it more and more difficult to offer Intasun the rates at which it was prepared to contract its business to Dan-Air.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Errol Cossey became convinced that he could offer Intasun these rates without difficulty, and do a lot more business with it, if Dan-Air had more modern aircraft with substantially lower fuel-burn and overall lower direct operating <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost.html" title="Cost">costs</a> in its fleet. He was also aware that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannia_Airways_1274.html" title="Britannia Airways">Britannia Airways</a>, Thomson Holidays' sister airline and Dan-Air's main rival in the charter market, had already begun building up a fleet of brand-new Boeing 737-200 jet planes, which had lower operating costs and a better operational performance than the older, second-hand jets operated by Dan-Air.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, Errol Cossey, Martin O'Regan, the group finance director of Dan-Air parent Davies and Newman, and Alan Snudden, Dan-Air's managing director, tried to convince Fred Newman, Davies and Newman's majority <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shareholder.html" title="Shareholder">shareholder</a> as well as Dan-Air's long-serving chairman, that operating a brand-new fleet of Boeing 737-200 "Advanced" series jet aircraft - at the time the very latest, state-of-the-art aircraft - was the only way to secure Dan-Air's long-term future as a major player in the charter airline industry. Their argument to Fred Newman was that operating the latest series 200 "Advanced" model of the <a href="../../../7/3/7/737.html" title="737">737</a> would not only give Dan-Air far better cost figures than any of its existing fleet but would also allow it to "leap-frog" Britannia, which initially operated only the "basic" 200 model of the 737. That model lacked important enhancements, such as short-field capability enabling operations at airfields too short for the "basic" 737-200 model.<sup id="_ref-friends9_10_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends9_10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite numerous failed attempts to convince Fred Newman of their plan's merits, Errol Cossey, Martin O'Regan and Alan Snudden decided to leave Dan-Air. <sup id="_ref-spirit_174_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spirit_174" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a first step, Errol Cossey approached Intasun founder and chairman Harry Goodman to elicit his response to the plan he had been working on with Martin O'Regan and Alan Snudden. It did not take long to convince Harry Goodman of the plan's merits. He agreed to support it as an <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equity.html" title="Equity">equity</a> player. This was the point at which Air Europe was conceived, with both Errol Cossey and Martin O'Regan on board backed up by Harry Goodman's financial participation. (Alan Snudden, who had initially agreed to join the new airline project, eventually decided to join <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch_Airlines_0a31.html" title="Monarch Airlines">Monarch Airlines</a>.<sup id="_ref-spirit_174_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spirit_174" title="">[12]</a></sup>)<sup id="_ref-friends9_10_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends9_10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The fact that the charter airline industry generally and Dan-Air in particular were perceived to be at the bottom end of the market led to a decision to make the new airline people's "first choice" from the outset, especially in terms of overall on-board service, including the in-flight <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catering.html" title="Catering">catering</a>. It was hoped that offering a service that was at least as good as that of the leading scheduled service airlines, with the ultimate aim of establishing a new <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benchmark.html" title="Benchmark">benchmark</a> for the entire airline industry and for charter airlines in particular, would enable the new airline to fly longer seasons as tour operators were expected to cancel their contracts with other, less popular rival airlines. The resulting increase in aircraft utilisation would translate into higher profitability.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the ways in which the new airline was planning to set a new standard for high-quality in-flight service in the charter airline industry was by completely revamping the traditional seat-back catering concept as practised by most contemporary charter airlines. At the time, this consisted of serving <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spam.html" title="Spam">spam</a> salad on all flights out of the UK and sandwiches back to the UK. Although this seemed to be a low-cost way of providing a minimal catering service on inclusive tour flights, it was actually labour-intensive and costly, especially when taking into account that these meals needed to be prepared freshly several hours before departure. This meant that <a href="../../../c/a/t/Caterer.html" title="Caterer">caterers</a> were charging a premium for meals that needed to be prepared during the night for early morning departures as well as for seasonal produce. Besides, the salad leaves tended to wilt and the sandwiches acquired a stale taste as soon as the wrapping was removed due to the dry atmosphere inside an aircraft cabin. As a result, from the passengers' point of view, the presentation of the meals most traditional charter airlines served them was unappetising, turning many of them off.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>To move away from the charter airline industry's image of "dreadful" seat-back catering, the new airline resolved to serve proper, "<a href="../../../r/e/s/Restaurant.html" title="Restaurant">restaurant</a>"-style meals including at least three courses - a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starter.html" title="Starter">starter</a>, a hot <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entree.html" title="Entree">entree</a> and a <a href="../../../d/e/s/Dessert.html" title="Dessert">dessert</a> - on all flights, time permitting. Instead of paying caterers premium rates for limp spam salads and stale sandwiches, the new airline would bulk-purchase deep-frozen ingredients only. This would enable it to take advantage of lower rates. And rather than relying on overseas caterers, who were often plying their trade only seasonally and over whose <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food_hygiene.html" title="Food hygiene">food hygiene</a> and quality standards the airline would have no control, it would also enable it to carry the in-bound catering in the aircraft's holds, which would generally not be filled to capacity.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to operating only brand-new aircraft from the very beginning, this new service concept marked the second major departure from the UK charter airline industry's established practices.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Improving the new airline's competitiveness, operational performance and profitability in a hyper-competitive market place characterised by low <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margin.html" title="Margin">margins</a> and excess capacity were not the only reasons for exclusively operating brand-new equipment from its inception.</p>
<p>Another important reason was that generous <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital.html" title="Capital">capital</a> allowances for new equipment reduced a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Company.html" title="Company">company</a>'s <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax.html" title="Tax">tax</a> liability, thereby increasing the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Enterprise_value.html" title="Enterprise value">enterprise value</a>.<sup id="_ref-friends_10_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_10" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, being affiliated to an "in-house" tour operator would give the new airline access to the tour operator's customers' deposits, which could be used as <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_capital.html" title="Working capital">working capital</a>. This was of particular importance to help a fledgling airline, whose first plane had not yet arrived and whose first flight was still in the planning stage, meet its up-front expenses.<sup id="_ref-friends_10_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_10" title="">[1]</a></sup> These deposits would also be an important source of working capital at a later stage when suppliers would have to be paid up-front in February, during the "dead" season, before the summer flying programme commenced in April.</p>
<p>To be able to attract a substantial amount of higher margin business from more "upmarket" tour operators that were Intasun's competitors as well as to avoid being overreliant on Intasun, the new airline would have to adopt a name not related to Intasun. Eventually, <b>Air Europe</b> was chosen from a shortlist of names that did not reveal the airline's link with Intasun.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>Errol Cossey's and Martin O'Regan's new airline venture not only marked a radical departure from traditional charter airline industry practices, such as operating old, second-hand aircraft and providing an uninspiring, very basic standard of on-board service. It also broke with the industry's long-standing tradition of defining its long-term strategies purely in terms of "opportunistic expansion", i.e. making use of whatever opportunities to grow the business were available, regardless of whether these opportunities actually presented a "good fit" with existing activities.</p>
<p>As business opportunities for Independent airlines were very limited during the early post-<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> period, i.e. from the late 1940s until the early 1960s, this approach was typical for the Independent airlines that had begun their existence during that period. Dan- Air, Errol Cossey's and Martin O'Regan's previous employer, which belonged to that era, was a very typical exponent of this "opportunistic" approach to doing business. Over time, that airline expanded into almost every area of the commercial airline business. The result was a very high degree of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Diversification.html" title="Diversification">diversification</a> into many unrelated activities, many of which never turned a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profit.html" title="Profit">profit</a> in their own right. The resulting lack of focus led to a great deal of valuable management time being expended on activities where the <a href="../../../r/e/t/Return_on_investment.html" title="Return on investment">return on investment</a> was negative. Dan-Air used to justify this diversification strategy by its low <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marginal_cost.html" title="Marginal cost">marginal costs</a> as aircraft and crews were already available. The airline also used to justify it by the resulting increased utilisation of the fleet, which in turn resulted in a positive contribution to overall profitability. (At the time, for Dan-Air each aircraft type in its fleet represented a so-called "<a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost_centre.html" title="Cost centre">cost centre</a> line" that was financially accountable for itself.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[18]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>A typical example of Dan-Air's "opportunistic" diversification into activities unrelated to its core charter business was the airline's long-term commitment to build from scratch a comprehensive network of regional scheduled services linking secondary airports across the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, many of which operated on a seasonal basis only.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[19]</a></sup> This took up massive <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resources.html" title="Resources">resources</a>, in terms of both <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finance.html" title="Finance">finance</a> and management time. Despite dedicating vast resources to its regional scheduled operation, it never became a financial success.<sup id="_ref-friends_76_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_76" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Having witnessed the drawbacks of Dan-Air's "opportunistically" driven diversification strategy first-hand, Errol Cossey and Martin O'Regan resolved that their new airline venture would only ever commit itself to commercial activities that had genuine prospects of becoming profitable in their own right, from the very beginning itself. Errol Cossey and Martin O'Reagan furthermore resolved that their airline venture needed to remain focused on a few core activities, rather than "grasping" every available opportunity to expand into areas far removed from its chosen core activities, to attain this goal.<sup id="_ref-friends_76_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_76" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a result, the long-term strategic plan Air Europe eventually developed narrowly focused on the following core areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short-/medium-haul charter flights.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Long-haul charter flights.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Scheduled services serving markets where half of the available capacity could be profitably filled with Intasun customers.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[21]</a></sup></li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Europe_6ecf.html" title="Edit section: The beginning">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The beginning</span></h3>
<p>Air Europe became the first British charter airline using brand-new equipment right from the very beginning as well as the first UK charter airline offering a standard of service that was comparable to the best service offered by the leading contemporary scheduled carriers.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[23]</a></sup> Air Europe also had the distinction of being the first new UK charter airline to become profitable during its first year of operation.</p>
<p>Due to the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Package_tour.html" title="Package tour">package tour</a> industry's seasonality, Air Europe needed to ensure that it was in a position to take full advantage of the entire June-September peak season to be profitable during the first year of operation itself. In order to be able to do this, the airline needed to have the finance in place to pay up-front for the deposits to take over the delivery slots of three brand-new Boeing 737-200 "Advanced" aircraft that had originally been booked by another airline, which had cancelled its order. Financing these aircraft, which were due to roll off <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a>'s production line during May 1979, was the biggest challenge Air Europe faced at that time.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s the traditional British financial institutions were not keen to provide start-up capital to newly constituted Independent "paper" airlines, unless these were part of or enjoyed the backing of other, well-established organisations. These institutions considered lending substantial amounts of money to fledgling Independent airlines too risky because of the high failure rate among those airlines in the UK.</p>
<p>Therefore, Air Europe's promoters were compelled to approach non-UK institutions and other potential lenders based overseas who could support the airline financially to help it get off the ground.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <a href="../../../i/p/o/Ipoh.html" title="Ipoh">Ipoh</a> and the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marubeni_Corporation_e308.html" title="Marubeni Corporation">Marubeni Corporation</a>, two <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conglomerates.html" title="Conglomerates">conglomerates</a>, whose commercial activities included purchasing brand-new aircraft from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">US</a> and leasing them on to non-US airlines as part of <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>'s effort to reduce the then huge trade imbalance with the US, were prepared to lend Air Europe the required amount, following complex and lengthy negotiations. The type of aircraft finance Air Europe procured from Ipoh and Marubeni was known as "<a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Samurai">Samurai</a>" <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leasing.html" title="Leasing">leasing</a>. It consisted of a combination of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortgage.html" title="Mortgage">mortgage</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hire_purchase.html" title="Hire purchase">hire purchase</a> finance spread over ten years for each aircraft.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Air Europe's first-ever commercial air service took to the air on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_4.html" title="May 4">May 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>. On that day a brand-new, 130-seat Boeing 737-2S3 "Advanced", named <i>Adam</i> and bearing the registration G-BMHG, departed London Gatwick for <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palma_de_Mallorca_46c4.html" title="Palma de Mallorca">Palma de Mallorca</a> with a full passenger load, operating the airline's inaugural flight KS 1004.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<p>This initial success provided the impetus and financial platform for Air Europe to continually expand its charter activities over the coming years.</p>
<p>Air Europe opened a second base at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> during its first year of operation itself. The Manchester base, which opened in the autumn of 1979, eventually became the airline's fastest growing UK departure point.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>A major reorganisation was completed in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> when Intasun became a unified company as a result of merging its constituent parts, leading to the <a href="../../../i/n/i/Initial_public_offering.html" title="Initial public offering">flotation</a> of <b>Intasun Leisure Group plc</b> on the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Stock_Exchange_0725.html" title="London Stock Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a>'s <a href="../../../u/n/l/Unlisted_Securities_Market_fa0c.html" title="Unlisted Securities Market">USM</a>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[29]</a></sup> (In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, the group, which by then had become the International Leisure Group [ILG], <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delist.html" title="Delist">delisted</a> from <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>'s <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_exchange.html" title="Stock exchange">stock exchange</a>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[30]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>Another new base opened at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>. By that time, Air Europe's core fleet consisted of seven Boeing 737-200 "Advanced" aircraft, all of which were brand-new at the time they joined the fleet. A further three 737-200s operated under a swap-lease arrangement with <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Florida_1c8b.html" title="Air Florida">Air Florida</a> complemented the core fleet between May and September, thus giving Air Europe an operational fleet of ten aircraft during the peak summer season.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[31]</a></sup> Air Europe expected to carry 1.2m passengers during 1982.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>1982 was also the year Air Europe signed the purchase agreement with <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Airways_c23d.html" title="British Airways">British Airways</a> for a pair of brand-new <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_757.html" title="Boeing 757">Boeing 757</a>-200 aircraft, for delivery in <a href="../../../m/a/r/March.html" title="March">March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/March.html" title="March">March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, respectively.

<p>1982 furthermore saw Air Europe placing its first order for five Boeing 737-300s with deliveries beginning in 1987.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Intasun Leisure Group plc's first set of annual results for the 1982/'83 financial year to the end of March 1983 was released in August of that year. These results showed that the group's pre-tax profit for that period was £6.8m (up 26% on the year-before period) and that the group carried 1.26 m passengers, mostly on Air Europe. This set of figures also showed that Air Europe accounted for half of the Intasun Leisure Group's profits.<sup id="_ref-friends_63_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_63" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Air Europe's first Boeing 757, named <i>Fiona</i> and bearing the registration G-BKRM, operated its maiden commercial flight on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_24.html" title="April 24">April 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> between London Gatwick and <a href="../../../f/a/r/Faro.html" title="Faro">Faro</a>.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[36]</a></sup> The airline's second <a href="../../../7/5/7/757.html" title="757">757</a> (G-BPGW) entered commercial service on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_29.html" title="March 29">March 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> between Gatwick and <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan.html" title="Milan">Milan</a>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>An order for an additional Boeing 757, the airline's third and the first directly ordered from Boeing, was placed during 1984 as well for delivery the following year.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[38]</a></sup> (Follow-on orders for further 757s were placed subsequently.)</p>
<p>During the early 1980s the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Aviation_Administration_0ef7.html" title="Federal Aviation Administration">FAA</a> began rethinking its policy on the minimum number of engines an aircraft needed to be permitted to fly long distances non-stop over water. The FAA's rethink had been prompted by the increasing reliability of <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_engine.html" title="Jet engine">jet engines</a> powering new widebodied airliners as well as other technological advances. This meant that mid-air engine shutdowns that necessitated an <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_landing.html" title="Emergency landing">emergency landing</a> at the nearest diversion airfield and which could potentially endanger the safety of aircraft and occupants had become a rare phenomenon. The result was <a href="../../../e/t/o/ETOPS_2248.html" title="ETOPS">ETOPS</a>, a set of rules permitting twin-engined aircraft to fly long over water routes, provided that there were usable diversion airfields within 120 minutes' non-stop flying distance plus a "15% margin" from the aircraft's route.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following the introduction of the new rules in the mid-1980s, Air Europe became one of the first airlines to have its 757s ETOPS-equipped to take advantage of the aircraft's design range, which was sufficient to permit non-stop flights to the East coast of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>, the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_America_93d9.html" title="Central America">Central America</a> as well as certain parts of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>This enabled Air Europe to become the first British charter airline to operate its 757s on transatlantic charter flights between various points in the UK and <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlando%2C_Florida_6d05.html" title="Orlando, Florida">Orlando</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> onwards.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first batch of three Boeing 737-200 "Advanced" aircraft delivered back in 1979 left the fleet in <a href="../../../a/p/r/April.html" title="April">April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> to enable Air Europe to take advantage of the aircraft's rising dollar-denominated residual values.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[42]</a></sup> (Air Europe's policy of taking a substantial interest in its aircraft's residual values also had a "secondary" effect of keeping the fleet young. This was achieved by continuously rolling over planes whose residual values exceeded the costs of procuring replacements, including capacity temporarily leased in from other operators.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[43]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>Eventually, Air Europe placed an initial order for five, larger 400 series Boeing 737s. These aircraft were delivered during 1989.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Europe_6ecf.html" title="Edit section: Aircraft leasing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aircraft leasing</span></h3>
<p>Leasing played a prominent role in ILG/Air Europe's corporate strategy from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Air Europe frequently used both <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operating_lease.html" title="Operating lease">operating leases</a> as well as finance leases.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>The former included both long-term swaps of surplus capacity with other airlines whose seasonality was opposite to Air Europe's as well as short-term leases to bridge temporary capacity shortfalls.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>The latter was a profit-enhancing method to finance newly acquired aircraft, whereby these aircraft were sold to in-house or external <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lessor.html" title="Lessor">lessors</a> from whom they were then leased back, with the airline retaining a substantial interest in the aircraft's residual values.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lease-swaps with other operators whose seasonality was opposite to Air Europe's own helped maintain a high aircraft utilisation during the lean winter season, thus permitting a year-round profitable operation.</p>
<p>The charter airline business was highly seasonal, with most of the annual commercial activity taking place over a relatively short period of barely four months between the end of May and the beginning of September. As Air Europe was operating a fleet of brand-new aircraft that incurred high financing charges unlike the older, second-hand <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet.html" title="Jet">jets</a> operated by Dan-Air and many other rival airlines at the time, it could not afford to significantly reduce its aircraft fleet's utilisation over the lean winter months, without taking a major hit on its financial performance. (Dan-Air, for example, took half of its operational Comet fleet out of service at the end of each summer season and put the aircraft into storage at sister company <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan-Air_Engineering_1a63.html" title="Dan-Air Engineering">Dan-Air Engineering</a>'s main base at <a href="../../../l/a/s/Lasham_Airfield_037e.html" title="Lasham Airfield">Lasham Airfield</a> for the duration of the winter season. Dan-Air also operated the other aircraft types in its fleet at a much lower utilisation during the winter. Dan-Air was able to do this without incurring huge losses because these predominantly older, second-hand aircraft had much lower acquisition costs and were already largely or fully depreciated at the time they entered its fleet.)</p>
<p>Air Europe therefore began to look for potential business partners whose seasonality was counter-cyclical to its own so that Air Europe's surplus aircraft capacity could be leased out to other operators in winter and those operators' surplus capacity could be leased in for the busy summer period.</p>
<p>Eventually, Air Europe concluded an aircraft swap-lease with Air Florida, which commenced at the start of the 1980/'81 winter season. Under this deal, Air Europe leased three of its aircraft to Air Florida to cover that airline's peak season, which occurred in winter. In return, Air Florida leased two of its aircraft to Air Europe to cover the UK airline's summer peak period. The number of aircraft Air Europe leased from Air Florida during the summer months subsequently increased to three.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although this arrangement initially worked to both airlines' satisfaction, Air Europe decided to terminate it at the end of the 1982/'83 winter season due to Air Florida's growing financial problems. (Air Florida had faced numerous difficulties to pay Air Europe for the leases on time. It also had difficulties to ensure the aircraft it had leased from Air Europe reached the UK along with the aircraft it was contractually obliged to supply to Air Europe from its own fleet in time at the start of the UK carrier's summer season.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[50]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>Air Europe replaced the defunct swap-lease with Air Florida with a similar arrangement with British Airways, which it had negotiated with the UK flag carrier in 1982. (This was part of a wider deal that had resulted in Air Europe purchasing two brand-new Boeing 757s that were part of an order for 19 of these aircraft <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Airways_c23d.html" title="British Airways">BA</a> had placed with Boeing in the late 1970s. The delivery slots taken over by Air Europe had become surplus to BA's requirements.<sup id="_ref-friends_61_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_61" title="">[33]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>The Air Europe-BA aircraft swap lease involved BA leasing back the two 757s Air Europe had acquired from the original BA order along with a number of Air Europe's 737s to cover the shortfall resulting from aircraft being taken out of service during the winter when BA's scheduled maintenance occurred. This deal lasted from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> until <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>An example for a short-term lease to bridge a temporary capacity shortfall was Air Europe's intended lease of a pair of <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_747.html" title="Boeing 747">Boeing 747s</a> to enable the launch of a new long-haul charter programme in 1989.</p>
<p>The launch of this programme in <a href="../../../m/a/y/May.html" title="May">May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> necessitated the temporary lease of suitable widebody aircraft capacity as Air Europe did not have any aircraft suited to this type of operation in its fleet. The original intention was to lease two 460-seat Boeing 747s.</p>
<p>In the event, Air Europe leased a single, 486-seat Boeing 747 from US supplemental carrier <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_Air_6aed.html" title="Tower Air">Tower Air</a> to operate its long-haul charter services to <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangkok.html" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbados.html" title="Barbados">Barbados</a>, Orlando and <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acapulco.html" title="Acapulco">Acapulco</a> on an <a href="../../../a/c/m/ACMI_7928.html" title="ACMI">ACMI</a> basis.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>

<p>It began with the creation of a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> subsidiary, <b>Air España S.A.</b>, based at Palma de Mallorca, in which ILG acquired a 25% stake, the maximum stake foreign entities or individuals could legally own in a Spanish airline at the time.<sup id="_ref-friends145_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends145" title="">[53]</a></sup> This was followed by the acquisition of a 49% stake in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> regional carrier <b>Nurnberger Flugdienst (NFD)</b>, the purchase of a 33% stake in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> charter carrier <b>Norway Airlines</b> and the creation of a new <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> carrier, <b><a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Europe_%28Italy%29_6e24.html" title="Air Europe (Italy)">Air Europe</a> SpA</b>, in which ILG held a 35% stake.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the exception of Air Espana, which traded as <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Europa_e412.html" title="Air Europa">Air Europa</a>,<sup id="_ref-friends145_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends145" title="">[53]</a></sup> all the other airlines traded as Air Europe. All of their aircraft - including those operated by Air Europa - adopted Air Europe's livery. The only way to tell the aircraft apart, other than by their respective national registrations, was to look at the national <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag.html" title="Flag">flag</a> following the Air Europe/Air Europa name on the upper, white part of the fuselage.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>

<p>ILG 's move to seek a <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-European_a481.html" title="Pan-European">pan-European</a> presence, including the Spanish market, the most important destination market for its charter operations from the UK, was not only driven by its desire to take advantage of new business opportunities resulting from the gradual liberalisation of Europe's air transport market. Another important factor leading to this decision was to ensure the widest possible UK coverage for its package tour operations, in terms of regional coverage, to enable Intasun to compete better with market leader Thomson. ILG wanted to be able to do this without incurring the additional <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expense.html" title="Expense">expense</a> of stationing aircraft and crews at regional UK airports to operate a small number of seasonal flights only or, alternatively, incurring the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost.html" title="Cost">cost</a> of operating empty legs with aircraft repositioned from its two main bases at Gatwick and Manchester.<sup id="_ref-friends145_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends145" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>This resulted in an arrangement whereby Air Europa's aircraft were flying German and <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavian.html" title="Scandinavian">Scandinavian</a> holidaymakers during daytime and Intasun's regional customers at night.<sup id="_ref-friends145_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends145" title="">[53]</a></sup> The resulting higher aircraft utilisation and lower direct operating costs for Air Europa compared with Thomson sister company Britannia Airways, the UK's leading charter airline and Air Europe's most formidable competitor in the European charter market, in turn enabled Intasun to undercut Thomson's prices.</p>

<p>Air Europe prepared to enter the scheduled service market as early as <a href="../../../a/p/r/April.html" title="April">April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> when it applied to the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Aviation_Authority_2c7b.html" title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</a> for a licence to begin a year-round scheduled operation between London Gatwick and <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami.html" title="Miami">Miami</a>, in direct competition with both Laker Airways and Air Florida as well as in indirect competition with British Airways' and <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_Am_792d.html" title="Pan Am">Pan Am</a>'s services from <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heathrow.html" title="Heathrow">Heathrow</a>. The service was due to commence in 1982, at a frequency of five weekly return flights in summer and four weekly round-trips in winter. Air Europe proposed operating the service either with a <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10_b672.html" title="McDonnell Douglas DC-10">McDonnell Douglas DC-10</a>-30 series widebodied <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trijet.html" title="Trijet">trijet</a> or a <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolls-Royce_RB211_3913.html" title="Rolls-Royce RB211">Rolls-Royce RB211</a>-powered Boeing 747-200B. Air Europe had already reserved delivery positions with both manufacturers. In support of its application, the airline stressed that any spare capacity would be filled with its tour operator affiliates' customers. It hoped that this would convince the CAA of the proposed operation's viability on a year-round basis, especially during off-peak periods.</p>
<p>In the event, the CAA rejected Air Europe's application. It argued that the airline was still in its infancy as this was only its second year of operation and, therefore, lacked the expertise to take on four established competitors on a major, intercontinental long-haul scheduled service route.<sup id="_ref-friends_46_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_46" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>

<p>Air Europe's first successful scheduled route launch occurred on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2.html" title="May 2">May 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.

<p>The gradual liberalisation of the regulatory framework governing the airline industry in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> from <a href="../../../d/e/c/December.html" title="December">December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> onwards provided the legal basis for Air Europe to become the first wholly privately owned, Independent airline to take advantage of the new relaxed policies regarding the operation of fully fledged scheduled services on major <a href="../../../e/u/r/European.html" title="European">European</a> trunk routes in direct competition with the established "flag" carriers.</p>
<p>Air Europe considered itself well-placed to take advantage of the new scheduled service opportunities that became available to Independent airlines as a result of the gradual liberalisation of the European air transport market. It enjoyed substantially lower operating costs than the established "flag" carriers because of its much higher aircraft <a href="../../../u/t/i/Utilisation.html" title="Utilisation">utilisation</a> and labour <a href="../../../p/r/o/Productivity.html" title="Productivity">productivity</a>. This meant that the airline could afford to undercut its rivals' <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_class.html" title="Business class">business class</a> fares by about 10-15% on each route where it competed with them.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>This, in turn, provided the impetus for the formulation of a new scheduled service strategy, which was internally known as the <i>New European Airline Project (NEAP)</i>. The new strategy centred on Air Europe providing competitively priced and timed scheduled services on the eleven busiest international European trunk routes from its Gatwick base. These services were to be operated with four brand-new Boeing 737-300s Air Europe had then on order, in a single-class, high-density configuration, at a frequency of two round-trips per day.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[63]</a></sup> All flights were to offer a full on-board service.</p>
<p>The early morning outbound service from Gatwick was to be the earliest flight of the day from any London airport to each of the destinations to be served. The late evening inbound service to Gatwick was to be the last flight of the day to any London airport. Air Europe hoped that offering the first flight out as well as the last flight back would strengthen its competitive position vis-a-vis its rivals by giving passengers a longer working day, thereby helping them to cut down on overseas accommodation costs.<sup id="_ref-friends_93_4_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_93_4" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other important reasons for choosing these departure and arrival times at Gatwick for Air Europe's proposed network of short-haul, international European scheduled services was the availability of slots at an increasingly congested Gatwick and the "in-built" bias in travel agents' <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_reservation_system.html" title="Computer reservation system">CRSs</a>.<sup id="_ref-friends_93_4_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_93_4" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>The former meant that the only competitively timed slots that were then available at Gatwick due to the airport's tight slot situation were early morning and late evening slots.<sup id="_ref-friends_93_4_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_93_4" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>The latter meant that operating the first flight of the day out of anywhere displayed that flight at the very top of the travel agent's <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_display_unit.html" title="Visual display unit">VDU</a> screen. This automatically accorded it the highest priority among all the flights listed on the agent's screen and, therefore, made it more likely to be booked in a typical travel agency's high-pressured work environment.<sup id="_ref-friends_93_4_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_93_4" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>

<p>In <a href="../../../j/u/n/June.html" title="June">June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> ILG took over <b>Connectair</b>, a small, Gatwick-based regional airline. Following that airline's acquisition by ILG, Connectair was re-branded <b>Air Europe Express</b> and adopted a new corporate identity as of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">February 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>.<sup id="_ref-friends123_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends123" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>ILG's decision to purchase Connectair was part of Air Europe's corporate strategy at the time to establish itself as a major short haul scheduled operator at its Gatwick base. Gatwick had become very busy during the late 1980s. This meant that the much-coveted early-morning peak time slots, which Air Europe needed to be able to operate at times that were attractive to business travellers as well as competitive with its rivals' departure and arrival times, were in increasingly short supply. Connectair held a fairly large number of conveniently timed slots at Gatwick. ILG's acquisition of Connectair therefore represented a "golden opportunity" to substantially increase the number of slots the group's airlines controlled at Gatwick, thereby strengthening Air Europe's competitive position at that airport.<sup id="_ref-friends123_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends123" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>Air Europe Express flew under the same <b>AE</b> airline designator as its bigger sister airline.</p>
<p>Its scheduled services initially linked Gatwick with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dusseldorf.html" title="Dusseldorf">Dusseldorf</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jersey.html" title="Jersey">Jersey</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotterdam.html" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>.<sup id="_ref-friends122_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends122" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition, ILG purchased <b>Guernsey Airlines</b> in <a href="../../../a/p/r/April.html" title="April">April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, another small, Independent regional airline, which operated scheduled services between <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guernsey.html" title="Guernsey">Guernsey</a> and Gatwick as well as between Guernsey and Manchester at the time. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_29.html" title="October 29">October 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> ILG fully integrated Guernsey Airlines into its existing Air Europe Express operation.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>These moves provided Air Europe with additional transfer traffic for its developing short haul European scheduled route network. They also enabled Air Europe to launch new routes where there was insufficient traffic to support its larger Boeing 737 and <a href="../../../f/o/k/Fokker_100.html" title="Fokker 100">Fokker 100</a> jet aircraft or where these aircraft were too big to provide a frequent schedule during the start-up phase, such as Gatwick-Dusseldorf and Gatwick-Jersey for instance.</p>
<p>Following the replacement of the Air Europe Express Shorts 360 turboprops with Air Europe's larger and faster Fokker 100 jets on the Gatwick-Dusseldorf and Gatwick-Jersey routes, Air Europe Express launched a new thrice-daily Gatwick-<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> schedule with its Shorts 360s.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the year ending <a href="../../../a/u/g/August.html" title="August">August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> the Air Europe Express operation carried more than a quarter of a million passengers across its route network for the first time.<sup id="_ref-friends123_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends123" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>Air Europe Express was forced to halt its operations on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_8.html" title="March 8">March 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> along with its sister airlines in the ILG-controlled Airlines of Europe group as a result of its parent company's decision to put all the group's companies into administrative receivership on that day, even though Air Europe Express itself had remained profitable throughout that period.</p>

<p>In early 1988 Air Europe began evaluating several aircraft types that had a lower seat capacity as well as lower direct operating costs per round-trip than the airline's Boeing 737-300/400s to enable it to penetrate the high-<a href="../../../y/i/e/Yield.html" title="Yield">yield</a> business travel market more effectively with a "tailor-made" product. Operating a fleet of dedicated, lower capacity "scheduled" aircraft with lower trip costs in a lower density configuration at higher frequencies on the main short-haul European trunk routes from Gatwick had the potential to attract a far greater share of the highly profitable business travel market, thereby transforming the financial performance of the scheduled routes.<sup id="_ref-friends_132_188_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_132_188" title="">[69]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, Air Europe decided that it would also need to launch a separate business class cabin on all scheduled routes that had the potential to attract a large number of business travellers to penetrate this market segment effectively and to maximise its profit potential. This led to the launch of a new business class on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_24.html" title="October 24">October 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, culminating in the refurbishment of seven aircraft and the kitting out of 800 staff with new uniforms.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the end of a detailed performance evaluation of an updated, re-engined, <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolls-Royce_Tay_0b16.html" title="Rolls-Royce Tay">Rolls-Royce Tay</a>-powered version of the original BAC 1-11-500 featuring a 1990s style "glass cockpit", the <a href="../../../b/a/e/BAe_146_b307.html" title="BAe 146">BAe 146</a>-300 and the <a href="../../../f/o/k/Fokker_F100_c495.html" title="Fokker F100">Fokker F100</a>, Air Europe decided to place an order for eleven <a href="../../../r/r/_/RR_cb95.html" title="RR">RR</a> Tay-powered <a href="../../../f/o/k/Fokker_F100_c495.html" title="Fokker F100">F100s</a>, including an option on a further eleven aircraft, in <a href="../../../m/a/r/March.html" title="March">March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. Deliveries of the aircraft on firm order were to begin in late 1990. Air Europe primarily chose the F100 as its main, dedicated "scheduled" aircraft to ply its business routes because it promised 25% lower trip costs than the 737-300/400. (It rejected both rival contenders because these had revealed serious range/payload shortcomings during the evaluation process.)<sup id="_ref-friends_132_188_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends_132_188" title="">[69]</a></sup></p>
<p>A subsequent change in <a href="../../../k/l/m/KLM_7464.html" title="KLM">KLM</a>'s short-haul fleet requirements unexpectedly released four F100s from an order that airline had originally placed with <a href="../../../f/o/k/Fokker.html" title="Fokker">Fokker</a>. This enabled Air Europe to lease these aircraft, thereby bringing forward the date of the F100's introduction into its fleet by a year.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p>Air Europe's inaugural commercial F100 service departed Gatwick for Brussels on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_4.html" title="December 4">December 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[72]</a></sup></p>
<p>The F100's introduction enabled Air Europe to increase frequencies to a minimum of three daily round-trips on most of the routes the aircraft served.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[73]</a></sup> (Higher frequencies were eventually offered on the Gatwick - <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Charles_de_Gaulle_01f2.html" title="Paris Charles de Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> and Gatwick-Brussels routes following British Airways' release of slots formerly held by British Caledonian, as part of a deal to permit it to take over its erstwhile competitor.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[74]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>The F100's introduction also enabled Air Europe to introduce "mainline" jet services between Gatwick and Jersey, following British Airways' withdrawal from what had always been one of British Caledonian's few, genuinely profitable short-haul routes, as well as to replace the Air Europe Express service between Gatwick and Dusseldorf.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[75]</a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, Air Europe's F100-operated scheduled services showed excellent load factors and enabled each new route launched with that aircraft to become profitable within three months.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>

<p>ILG launched its first takeover bid, which valued British Caledonian Group at £36m, in <a href="../../../m/a/y/May.html" title="May">May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[80]</a></sup> (That bid materialised after several rounds of inconclusive talks exploring ways of combining the short-haul businesses of Air Europe and BCal in a new joint venture, which had taken place between ILG and British Caledonian Group since the end of 1985.) At the time <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Caledonian_c69f.html" title="British Caledonian">BCal</a>'s senior management dismissed ILG's bid as "derisory" because it valued the entire British Caledonian Group's assets far below their minimum expectations.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>
<p>ILG decided to launch a new counter bid for the entire British Caledonian Group at the end of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July.html" title="July">July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, following British Airways' outright rejection of ILG chairman Harry Goodman's offer to purchase BCal's short-haul operation for a "fair" price and to merge that operation with the short-haul operations of ILG subsidiary Air Europe, in return for not having the proposed BA-BCal deal referred to the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopolies_and_Mergers_Commission_6caf.html" title="Monopolies and Mergers Commission">MMC</a>.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>
<p>Air Europe was concerned that a new entity combining BA and BCal had the power to destroy the UK's remaining Independent airlines, especially with regard to their ability to compete with such a behemoth.<sup id="_ref-risk544_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk544" title="">[83]</a></sup> At the time Air Europe had ambitions of its own to become a major short-haul scheduled operator.<sup id="_ref-risk544_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk544" title="">[83]</a></sup> It was planning to launch eleven new routes from Gatwick to Europe, thereby replacing and enhancing the services BCal had provided. Given a combined BA-BCal's superior financial strength, considerably lower borrowing costs and far greater <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economies_of_scale.html" title="Economies of scale">economies of scale</a>, Air Europe's management felt that it would be imprudent to launch these new routes if it had to compete with BA out of Heathrow and Gatwick as well. Therefore, its parent ILG had decided to make a counter bid, which it hoped would either kill off BA's proposal to take over BCal lock, stock and barrel or result in it being referred to the MMC.</p>
<p>To enhance its credibility as a serious contender despite the low price offered to win control of the whole of the British Caledonian Group, Air Europe's bid contained a detailed proposal to return BCal to profitability by way of a reorganisation. This proposal had been prepared by a retired BA head of route planning whom ILG had specifically hired for this purpose. The proposal itself entailed separating BCal into four discrete businesses, each of which would have had its own management who would have been accountable for the performance of their own business unit. The businesses into which BCal was to be split included a long-haul operation using the existing BCal brand, a short-haul operation to be merged into Air Europe's existing short-haul operation using the BCal brand to serve business routes and the Air Europe brand to serve leisure markets as well as an engineering and a ground handling unit.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p>BCal's senior management rejected ILG's renewed bid on the grounds that it still did not adequately reflect the value of the group's assets, in particular those of BCal. In addition, BCal's senior management felt that both airlines' nature of operations and their business strategies were incompatible and that therefore there were no <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synergy.html" title="Synergy">synergies</a> to be gained from combining BCal with what they regarded as "just a charter airline".</p>

<p>The presence of Dan-Air, a major scheduled and charter operator at Gatwick and Manchester, Air Europe's two largest bases, meant that Air Europe was facing a potential competitor for every additional scheduled service and charter contract that became available. Dan-Air's large-scale presence at Gatwick, the airport's increasing scarcity of early morning peak time slots, the fact that Dan-Air had already been licensed to operate scheduled services to some of the destinations Air Europe wanted to serve as well while only a quarter of London's and a third of the entire <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeast_England_2556.html" title="Southeast England">Southeast</a>'s population lived in Gatwick's catchment area also meant that attaining the "critical mass" to make its scheduled operation viable became an uphill struggle for Air Europe. This situation was made worse by the state of the British economy in the late 1980s, which was overheating and going to give way to a major <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recession.html" title="Recession">recession</a> during the early years of the following decade.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[85]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the CAA's decision to re-allocate the licences for several of British Caledonian's short-haul Gatwick feeder routes, which British Airways had agreed to return to the licensing process as a concession to have its takeover of that airline approved, to Air Europe, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_UK_9bf6.html" title="Air UK">Air UK</a> and Dan-Air weakened the overall performance of the airport's scheduled services.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[86]</a></sup> As a result of this decision, Air Europe was excluded from the two main London-<a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> trunk routes and it was forced to compete head-on with Dan-Air to Paris Charles de Gaulle and Jersey.</p>
<p>Dan-Air's growing financial problems at the time provided the impetus for ILG's high-profile publicity campaign not to miss an opportunity to run down its ailing competitor in the press, accusing it of operating old, "gas-guzzling" aircraft. As part of this 'anti-Dan-Air' campaign, ILG had already announced that Intasun was going to reduce the number of aircraft it chartered from Dan-Air from six to three for the 1989/'90 winter season. ILG made a further announcement in this regard, stating that Intasun was no longer going to charter any Dan-Air aircraft for the 1990 summer season and that Air Europe was going to cancel its maintenance contract with Dan-Air Engineering.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[87]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, ILG's campaign to deal a fatal blow to Air Europe's main rival suffered a major setback in <a href="../../../o/c/t/October.html" title="October">October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> when Dan-Air's beleaguered management appointed "company doctor" David James, who immediately set about <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refinancing.html" title="Refinancing">refinancing</a> Dan-Air's parent organisation Davies and Newman Holdings in order to save the airline.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[88]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[89]</a></sup></p>

<p>The main causes leading to the collapse of ILG and its UK-based subsidiaries, including Air Europe and Air Europe Express, the group's two UK airline subsidiaries, were:</p>
<ul>
<li>A major, unforeseen downturn in traffic as a result of the recessionary economic conditions in the UK and a looming war to liberate <a href="../../../k/u/w/Kuwait.html" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> from <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraqi</a> occupation.<sup id="_ref-friends169_70_192_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends169_70_192" title="">[92]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Undercapitalisation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An unsound financial structure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Being financially overextended.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lack of ownership of any significant assets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A high-risk strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Against the background of a looming war in the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Gulf_06b2.html" title="Persian Gulf">Gulf</a> as a result of <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>'s <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion.html" title="Invasion">invasion</a> of Kuwait during the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> and a major <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recession.html" title="Recession">recession</a> in the UK at that time, ILG began suffering heavy losses and mounting debts.<sup id="_ref-friends169_70_192_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends169_70_192" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>
<p>ILG/Air Europe's senior management was also aware that ILG was facing a cash crunch from as early as 1989 onwards, which had made it more and more difficult for the group to finance the aircraft it already had on order, notably the F100s and the MD-11s.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[93]</a></sup> It was also clear to them that ILG did not have sufficient funds to run a fully fledged, rapidly growing scheduled operation in addition to a major charter operation. This was a major contributory factor to the group's collapse, in addition to ILG's opaque financial structure and the fact that as a privately held company its ultimate owners, some of whom were residing abroad, were not subject to the same kind of strict financial discipline as the owners of publicly listed firms.</p>
<p>In addition to the group's undercapitalisation and its overstretched finances,<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[94]</a></sup> ILG generally and Air Europe in particular were not backed up by any significant assets.</p>
<p>For instance, Air Europe did not own any of the shiny, new aircraft in its fleet. (These were usually procured on highly favourable terms from the manufacturers and then sold upon delivery to ILG's in-house leasing subsidiaries, such as AE Finance or AE Norsk, or to third party lessors, such as Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA), from whom the airline subsequently leased them back. This enabled it to keep them off its <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balance_sheet.html" title="Balance sheet">balance sheet</a>, thereby being relieved of the financial burden resulting from the aircraft's <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depreciation.html" title="Depreciation">depreciation</a>, while keeping a substantial interest in the aircraft's residual values, which were booked as profits.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[95]</a></sup> This sale-and-lease-back activity was a central plank of ILG's <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporate_strategy.html" title="Corporate strategy">corporate strategy</a>. It also constituted a major part of ILG's business and accounted for a large slice of its profits.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[96]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>Neither did the group hold the titles to the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freehold.html" title="Freehold">freehold</a> of any of the properties that housed its offices and other facilities that formed an integral part of the business.</p>
<p>Air Europe's massive expansion into high-profile scheduled services plying trunk routes between major European cities towards the end of the 1980s, the airline's huge aircraft commitments lasting well into the 1990s and ILG's increasing reliance on profits arising from its interest in the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_dollar_3927.html" title="US dollar">US dollar</a>-denominated residual values of the aircraft operated by its airline subsidiaries for the group's overall profitability from 1989 onwards represented a high-risk strategy for an undercapitalised company. This marked a major shift from the original focus on establishing Air Europe and Intasun as a major force in the UK charter airline/package tour market as well as Air Europe's "excursion" into operating scheduled services on selected leisure routes only. Although ILG had justified this <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic.html" title="Strategic">strategic</a> shift by the new strategy's far greater rewards compared with the old one, some members among its senior management suspected that there was an "ulterior" motive to all this. It was well known among senior company insiders that several sets of exploratory talks had taken place at various times, involving ILG and British Airways, as well as ILG and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_cdc7.html" title="American Airlines">American Airlines</a>. ILG had also held similar talks with a number of other interested parties. These talks had centred on how to intensify those parties' co-operation with ILG/Air Europe, including proposals for a full-scale <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merger.html" title="Merger">merger</a>/takeover.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[97]</a></sup></p>
<p>This lack of being an asset-backed organisation with a high-risk strategy made lending money to ILG and its subsidiaries a far riskier proposition than lending to Davies and Newman Holdings, the parent company of Air Europe's ailing rival Dan-Air. Not only did Davies and Newman/Dan-Air actually own most of the aircraft in the ailing airline's fleet, which were mainly older, less efficient planes with a generally low re-sale value, but it also held the title to the freehold of a number of commercial properties, including prime <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_estate.html" title="Real estate">real estate</a> in the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_London_c553.html" title="City of London">City of London</a>. Moreover, Davies and Newman was the owner of Dan-Air Engineering, a sister company of the airline as well as the UK's second-biggest and one of the world's best-equipped aircraft engineering organisations at the time.</p>
<p>These were the main reasons ILG's lenders, notably <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyds_Bank_394f.html" title="Lloyds Bank">Lloyds Bank</a> plc, which also had a substantial financial exposure to Davies and Newman, ultimately decided to pull the plug on the former rather than the latter, despite Air Europe being perceived as operationally far superior and financially stronger than Dan-Air by many of those who had no intimate knowledge of the true state of ILG's finances.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[98]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[99]</a></sup> This included many well-reputed industry analysts as well as seasoned observers.</p>

<p>Unlike many of its contemporary charter airline rivals, as exemplified by Dan Air, one of its chief rivals, Air Europe had made a name for itself by becoming a pioneer in offering genuinely enjoyable as well as affordable jet travel for the average holidaymaker, which decisively broke with the charter airline industry's "cheap but cheerful" image.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[100]</a></sup></p>
<p>Air Europe was also typical of the trend which dominated the British holiday market in the 1980s, with tour companies operating their own in-house airlines, which, although accruing considerable capital expense in the first instance, enabled these companies to offer lower prices by effectively cutting out the "middle man".</p>
<p>Intasun and its associated ILG-owned tour companies, <b>Global</b> and <b>Lancaster</b>, became what many consumers saw as the "cheaper" alternative to the other main British tour operator of the time, Thomson Holidays.</p>
<p>The existence of these two major brands helped open up the foreign holiday market. The fierce competition between them provided families with affordable and competitive packages.</p>
<p>Air Europe and Intasun were used as a template for many aspiring British tour operators, such as Cardiff-based Aspro Holidays, which launched its own in-house airline, Inter European Airways in 1987 and Airtours (later rebranded as <a href="../../../m/y/t/MyTravel_82ab.html" title="MyTravel">MyTravel</a>), which merged with Aspro in 1993, to create the second largest tour operator in the UK and which was widely recognised as the direct successor to Intasun and Air Europe.</p>

<p>Air Europe had an unblemished safety record throughout its twelve-year existence.</p>
<p>During that time there never was a fatal accident involving an Air Europe aircraft as a result of good airmanship and an extremely high safety consciousness throughout the organisation. It was one of the company's greatest contributions to European commercial aviation.</p>
<p>However, there was one noteworthy non-fatal incident involving an Air Europe aircraft.</p>
