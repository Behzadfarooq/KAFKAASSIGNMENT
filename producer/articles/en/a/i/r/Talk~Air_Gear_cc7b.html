<p>sano was never king of the flame road, in the battle with Kogarasumaru it is said that he was in the running. being in the running doesn't make you the winner. also im moving the article (as is) to a separate page as it really clutters up the page and doesn't need to <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinigami_Josh_ece8.html" title="User:Shinigami Josh">Shinigami Josh</a> 09:37, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm also wondering if it is appropriate to use phrases like currently or in the latest chapter. As it is still an on-going series i do realize these phrases will be, at times, unavoidable. But Reduction in the frequency they are used could also reduce the frequency that the article has to change.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you. Overuse of 'currently', or 'in the lastest chapter' could lead to problems later (namely that they have to be rewritten), but I don't see any way of changing what people write...especially since no one discusses changes to the article in this discussion room much.

<p>Answer for question regarding the Wing Road and Sky King: The king of the Wing Road is the Wind King. The status of Wind King is a pre-requisite to becoming the Sky King. For reason(s) yet to be made clear, the unification of all eight Kings of the AT world seems to be essential in the creation of a new Sky King. It is currently assumed that no one has been crowned as the Sky King in the past. Takeuchi Sora was close, but failed due to the betrayal of Kilik. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDing%C3%A9_1783.html" title="User:Dingé">Dingé</a> 17:56, 16 June 2006</p>

<p><i>Comment by 69.224.18.193: "Im quite sure wind and sky are one in the same because of the fact that in the anime series you see Only 7 roads to the center i wondered my self but u see the sky king come down or maby the wind road wouldnt literaly have a road."</i><br />
Response: The Wind King and the Sky King are completely different as far as titles and attributes are concerned. Your perceptions about the anime's presentation of Roads and Kings are incorrect. Episode 13 of the anime specifically states "when the eight Roads and eight Kings gather, the fabled Sky King will descend." In this scene one clearly sees eight silhouettes radiating from a fixed focal point where a representation of the Sky Kings slowly appears. Moreover, the Trophaeum in both anime and manga show eight protrusions from its summit, symbolizing the eight roads and kings. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDing%C3%A9_1783.html" title="User:Dingé">Dingé</a> 01:23, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>there is also the status of who is the currant fang king as in the manga it is stated that Akito is the fang king not Agito, and that Agito has never possesed the regala of the bloody road <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinigami_Josh_ece8.html" title="User:Shinigami Josh">Shinigami Josh</a> 05:22, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Actually, according to the latest translations of the manga, agito is the fang king while akito is it's tuner. I do not know what the situation before the personality split would have been, and how it is possible that a person can be it's own tuner. But this is what is suggested in the manga at least (last 2 pages of Chapter 106). Also, the explanation on kings should be elaborated. You should add that a real king by your definition, is a king that is standing on top of the trophaeum. Because a real king by my understanding is any king, any stormrider who has the potential to use infinity max and has regalia, which is why I find the choice of words a bit confusing. As such, there are many more than 8 kings and 8 regalia, the only thing we know for sure right now is that any given time, there were only 8 sitting at the top of the trophaeum. Info from chapter 102,111,112 (all from the middle on, page 11). 81.240.168.91 18:42, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>Since Kazu created flames through friction when he attained the flame road in chapter 126, I do not believe that the illusion of flame is actually the effect of the regalia, but just a normal effect of the flame road. <a href="../../../m/u/n/User%7EMundaneman_3143.html" title="User:Mundaneman">Mundaneman</a> 20:54, 24 January 2007</p>
<p>Yes that should be changed, the flames created by the wheel are quite real. In fact Spitfire has used it to light a cigarette in Chapter 123. Also on the topic of the definition of kings. There are indeed more than 8 kings, however the difference between the Sleeping Forest Kings and the Trophaeum ones are that the 8 Trophaeum Kings are essential in the creation of a Sky King. 70.58.104.183 02:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that the illusions are from the road, and the real flames are from the regalia. <a href="../../../m/u/n/User%7EMundaneman_3143.html" title="User:Mundaneman">Mundaneman</a> 16:44, 25 January 2007</p>
<p>from what was said by Yoshitsune while kazu was doing the "flame dance" "the flame in the air creates an upward pressure" (volume 15 ch126 pg91) that implies that the flames are real and not an illusion; also if it looks like flames and generates heat, bets are that they are real flames<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinigami_Josh_ece8.html" title="User:Shinigami Josh">Shinigami Josh</a> 09:22, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is it possible that regalia makes the flames easier to make? I mean the fang regalia makes fangs easier to produce, but is not essential in their creation.</p>
<p>It is probable that that is true. However, the flames that Spitfire made when he was introduced were definitely illusions. The only flames that were certainly real were sent out in a sort of blast, not a trail left behind like the illusions were, or Kazu's were. Also, sole illusions would make the Flame regalia the only one that is useless except for show. <a href="../../../m/u/n/User%7EMundaneman_3143.html" title="User:Mundaneman">Mundaneman</a> 12:51, 29 January 2007</p>
<p><br />
<i>The answer is obvious, Spitfire can choose whether he wants to create real flames or just the illusion of it, I assume the wheels are made of a special material to make creating fire easier then if someone tried to normally do it, like Kazu for example. Dannydog3067 02:11, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>yes i would agree, those are just names i put in as soon as the chapter was released~ it would make more sense if ban was changed to burn and i initially put falco but thought falko looked better &gt;_&lt;. i will edit it on the main page, thanks for the correction~ [BlackCat]</dd>

<p>Identity of the current Gem King, Nike, has been revealed in chapter 157. He is Takeuchi Sora's twin brother, who is also named "Sora" (his first name is written in different kanji: 武內宙-Takeuchi Sora/Nike, 武內空-Takeuchi Sora/the one we know). Sora(空) has, apparently, been faking his leg injury. It would appear that Sora(空) has yet to give up his old ambitions. Also, Nike's Road is the Jade Road (緋翠の道-ジェド・ロード). Only Kilik's Road is the Gaia Road (大地の道-ガイア・ロード). Please make changes where appropriate. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDing%C3%A9_1783.html" title="User:Dingé">Dingé</a> 23:42, 9 March, 2007</p>
<dl>
<dd>Was going to make the changes sooner, but was busy, ive already made the corrosponding changes to the article. Note: Nike's road is named "Jade Road - 緋翠の道" and Kilik's "Gaia Road - 大地の道" it is unclear at the moment which of these is the current Gem king, in other words we havnt been shown who actually has the regalia, so for now i have assumed Nike's Jade road to be current and added it to the current 8 kings, and added Kilik's Gaia Road as the original 8 kings. Changes will be made as further information becomes available.

<p>If I understand it right, the TV anime is complete while the Manga is ongoing. Are there plans to produce a second season, or will the Manga simply continue with the anime over, like Inuyasha? Also, did the Anime close with an original plot or did it end without closure? <a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwilightxPrince_35a5.html" title="User:TwilightxPrince">TwilightxPrince</a> 22:10, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would also want to know the reception of the article thinking that would help a lot of people.</p>
<p>The anime follows the manga quite truthfully, except for the battles. They get shifted around a bit chronologically, and sometimes have substantially different 'content' (e.g. the fight with the skull saders occurs before the battle with buccha in the manga, and has ikki applying the air-gear-on-wall trick; it occurs after the buccha fight in the anime, with Ikki wallriding instead of doing any tricks to win), but the end result is always the same. Also, some critical information/subplots are missing from the anime, like the graveyard arc/potemkin battle being left out. The anime has a completely open ending, and didn't really feature plot details not mentioned in the anime (i do not consider changing battle details as part of the plot). I do not have the right credentials to add this thing to the article, so I hope someone else will 87.65.66.175 18:53, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Attention everyone, please stop constantly editing the wiki with bizarre information. We should discuss important changes on the talk/discussion page first. Things like saying Sano is the precursor of the Flame Road are not verified in fact, and should be discussed here first.</p>
<p>Please stop deleting links to other articles about the Teams in Air Gear.</p>
<p>Finally, please do not post your personal opinions or comments about characters in this wiki; that is not the purpose of this article. Everyone is not interested in your opinion of Ringo, or her characteristics. Please refrain from posting nonsensical things.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble editing the wiki, please read the internal articles on how to edit. Your contributions are appreciated, but if you make a mess someone else will have to clean it up.</p>
<p>I ask other wikipedia users to please cooperate with me to try to clean this article up. If continued vandalism and edit wars on this article continue, I will have to apply to the admins to have this article locked from edits. Please do not force me to do so.</p>
<p>Thank you, Daniengrey 07:28, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Woah! Wait a minute there Daniegrey! I mean this in the most respectful way, but, for someone who has been a Wikipedian <i>9 days</i> you sure are using some strong language there. Perhaps you need to review <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">the Five Pillars of Wikipedia</a> Especially the policy <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. Don't start going all willy-nilly over a few edits! Your language comes across quite strong, and frankly, makes me feel like you have claimed ownership over this article. I don't want to sound condescending, but chill out a little. Ksumoe 15:36, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The wording itself wasn't meant to be strong-minded. This account is still new, that's true, but I've been part of the wikipedia community for longer than that, and finally decided to create an account instead of leaving my IP address. I understand you do not wish to be condescending, but please do not attempt an ad hominem attack stating that daniengrey is "too new" to make contributions or point out silly remarks (wikipedia doesn't have tenure); this reinforces the condescending image. I make no 'claim' to this article, but I do take exception to people making that edits that call Ringo a 'Hentai pervert' etc. Entering data like that is not acceptable, and there is no possible way I can <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> with such entries. Following that line of logic, however, should you not also <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> with me writing inside this discussion page asking for us all to work together on the article? If I did not wish to help the article become better and clean it up, would I even participate in this discussion page? I digress though...</dd>
<dd>The primary point that I wished to bring to everyone's attention is we don't discuss changes enough on this article in the discussion section. Everyone just goes off and edits according to their own interpretation without working with the whole community to come to a consensus on issues. I am simply asking everyone who contributes to this article to being to work together so we can create a good article, and to clean this one up (because it's a mess). This was never meant to come across as strong-worded, but I don't like skirting around the issue, I get right to the point, business-like. I would appreciate it if everyone could understand my mentality. Daniengrey 15:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Emblems would definetely be good to have, if we cannot find any I could try to extract them out the manga itself. However, as I said earlier, we should be careful and verify emblems here first, without just adding them to the article all over the place. I'll start looking for emblems now.

<p>i was wondering as to what licence to put them under as i got the images from the manga but edited them before i put them up (cleaning, redrawing, fixing) there is also some i ripped from the covers but as there is no team asociated with them i didnt upload them.</p>

<p>i was re reading volume 15 and on page 70-71, fraying about all the roads and regalas, it seams he is weither saying that each road and its regala are from the same begining, or from what else he says (and the fact that we dont know if any one has EVER been crowned sky king) that the sky kings regalia/road are part of every other one? <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinigami_Josh_ece8.html" title="User:Shinigami Josh">Shinigami Josh</a> 13:50, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Sky Regalia is the regalia of all regalias, it was developed by scientists inside the 'tower', and is still locked inside the tower. Years ago when the research subjects (namely sora, kilik, simca, gabishi, om and others to be confirmed) escaped from the tower, the scientists, while holding the sky regalia fell from the tower and died. In present times his mummified body is still locked inside the tower, and the suitcase he is holding contains the sky regalia. This infomation is given in chapter 150 and 152. Kilik explained it to ikki. [BlackCat]</p>
