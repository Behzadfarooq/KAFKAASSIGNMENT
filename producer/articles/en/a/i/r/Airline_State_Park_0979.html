	    <p>The "Airline Route" was a high speed passenger rail line from <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, that had it's best days in the late 1800s when the famous "White Train" used the route. Passenger service ended before WW II. The line was used for freight traffic until 1955, when the bridge over the <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quinebaug_River_95f6.html" title="Quinebaug River">Quinebaug River</a> in Putnam was washed out by flooding. The section between North Windham and Putnam was abandoned in sections in the late 1950s. The section from Portland to Willimantic was abandoned in the late 1960s. The section from Mechanicsville Jct. in Thompson and into Massachusetts was abandoned in the early 1970s. Today the old railbed between East Hampton and the Massachusetts state line is part of the Connecticut State Park System. The section from Route 66 in Windham to US Route 44 in Pomfret was opened to the public in 1969 as a bridle trail. In 1976, the trail designation was extended north to Town Farm Road in Putnam. The southern section from East Hampton to Willimantic was opened as a trail in 1986. The Thompson section was opened in 1992.</p>
<p>It is divided into three sections: the South section (from the southern terminus in East Hampton to the Willimantic River), the North section (from Route 66 in Windham to Town Farm Road in Putnam), and the Thompson section (from Route 193 in Thompson to the MA state line).</p>
<p>The South and North sections are connected by the Veterans Greenway, a short town-owned rail trail on the northeast side of Willimantic. The connection is not complete, as the Willimantic River bridge at the end of the South section is impassable and no trail connection has yet to be made through downtown Willimantic from the bridge to the Veterans Greenway.</p>

<p>In 2002, the state DEP acquired an additional 1.5 miles of railbed in East Hampton, continuing the trail south from the current Smith Street terminus. A bridge has been constructed to carry the trail across a brook where the original rail bridge was missing. Other than that, no work has yet been done to improve this section.</p>
<p><a name="Current_Trail_Conditions_.28South_section.29" id="Current_Trail_Conditions_.28South_section.29"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline_State_Park_0979.html" title="Edit section: Current Trail Conditions (South section)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Current Trail Conditions (South section)</span></h2>
<p><b>Smith Street, East Hampton to Route 207, Hebron:</b> This section of the trail has been completed. It has a smooth, hard-packed stone dust surface, benches for resting at more scenic locations, and bike racks. Brand new bridges constructed by cadets from the US Coast Guard Academy carry the trail across the Blackledge and Jeremy Rivers and Judd Brook. This section crosses the Rapello and Lyman Viaducts, massive fills that carried the railroad and now trail across wide valleys. They provide spectacular views, especially in the fall. There is a short (less than 1/4 mile) on-road detour necessary where the Route 2 expressway blocks the railroad bed.</p>
<p><b>Route 207, Hebron to Kingsley Road, Lebanon:</b> The trail has been cleared and some drainage improvements made, but the surface on this section is still unfinished and is mostly dirt and gravel. It is suitable for mountain mikes, though hikers and equestrians will probably have an easier time on this stretch than a bike. Some open culverts are passable by foot, but not bike. The town of Lebanon and the state DEP are working hard to upgrade this section and finish the surface. Access from some cross streets is difficult and requires climbing some embankments.</p>
<p><b>Kingsley Road, Labanon to Willimantic River:</b> The section is open, but is a dead end, as the bridge across the Willimantic River to Windham is not passable. The girders from the old railroad bridge are still in place, but the bridge had no deck and is fenced off. The state plans to put a new deck on this bridge at some future point, which would extend the trail into downtown Willimantic and connect it to the <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hop_River_State_Park_Trail_74ea.html" title="Hop River State Park Trail">Hop River State Park Trail</a> and the northern section of the Airline State Park trail.</p>

<p>Though open to the public for its entire length, different segments of the trail are in different stages of development. Some sections are complete and have a finished, stone-dust surface and signage. Other sections have been cleared and had drainage work done, but still have a somewhat rough, unfinished surface that is not suitable for road bikes. Other parts are totally undeveloped and overgrown.</p>
<p>There are no major obstructions of the North section of the trail in the form of missing or unsafe bridges. Though some parts of the trail may be undeveloped, this area does not have the many river crossings of the southern section. The two bridge crossings there are (over Boulevard Road in Windham and across the Quinebaug River in Putnam) have all been repaired and rebuilt for trail use.</p>
<p>The trail continues west of Route 66 as the Veterans Greenway, a town-owned bikeway that leads to downtown Willimantic.</p>
<p>The following is a section by section description of the trail's current conditions, as of September 2006.</p>
<p><b>Route 66, Windham to Windham/Chaplin town line:</b> This section has seen many upgrades in recent years. The section's first 1/4 mile was paved as part of the US 6/Route 66 interchange reconstruction project. The state and the town of Windham cleared, graded, installed signage and put down a smooth stone-dust surface on the entire section of the trail in Windham. This included the construction of a trail bridge over Boulevard Road.</p>
<p><b>Windham/Chaplin town line to Wrights Crossing Road, Pomfret:</b> This section was cleared and graded by the National Guard in the mid-1990s. The surface was not finished and is still rough in sections and there are drainage issues in areas that sometimes flood the trail. There has not been much maintenance done on the trail in the last few years, so even the areas that were cleared have become somewhat grown in. Still, the trail is passable for hikers, equestrians and mountain bikers. The town of Chaplin has received a grant to grade, add signage and finish the surface of the trail with stone dust from the Windham town line to the Hampton town line. This should be completed within the next year.</p>
<p><b>Wrights Crossing Road, Pomfret to Town Farm Road, Putnam:</b> This section of trail is completely undeveloped. It has not been cleared and is overgrown, with a rough surface and several wet areas with drainage problems. It is necessary to climb embankments to cross some roads where former bridges have been filled in. It is not really passable, and must be done on foot if attempted.</p>
<p>North of Town Farm Road, the rail bed is privately owned, but the state DEP is in talks to purchase it. This would extend the public trail to Kennedy Drive in Putnam, where a footbridge has already been constructed to carry the trail over the Quinebaug River and connect to Putnam's River Trail.</p>

<p><b>Entire Section:</b> The trail is undeveloped, with no actual work having been done to convert the rail bed to a trail. The rails and ties have been removed, but the surface of the trail is mostly the original ballast, with some sections washboarded and other sections flooded. The trail is clear of any major obstructions and is followable on foot, but would be difficult even for a mountain bike. Many areas have been eroded by illegal ATV use, which is a problem on this section. Bridges are still in place to carry the trail safely across the Exit 98 ramps of I-395, and to carry some cross roads over the trail. Some smaller bridges over brooks and streams are not as safe, either missing decks, or just missing altogether. A high bridge over a brook about 3/4 mile south of the Route 200 underpass is missing and requires a detour on an ATV trail that can be wet. It is necessary to climb some embankments to cross some streets.</p>

<p>•Sunset Hill Road, Thompson</p>
<p>•Lowell Davis Road, Thomson</p>

The surface in MA is the same as in CT, but Mass has improved access at trailheads and road crossings. This trail continues all the way to Franklin, MA.</p>
