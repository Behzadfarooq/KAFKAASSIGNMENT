<p>Let's throw this one open for discussion. Do people feel that information about commercial exploitation of a TV brand (e.g. Airwolf) is a legitimate topic for inclusion in an article on that brand on Wikipedia? Rather than arbitrarily deleting someone else's work, I feel that it is perhaps best to establish some consensus on this issue. Over to you, folks. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_King_2e0a.html" title="User:Ben King">Ben King</a> 07:10, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia is a non-profit organization with a mission to be a database of human knowledge. It wasn't established as a commercial endeavor to sell things. Information on a particular subject is not ment to promote sales of it and commercial links are therefore inappropriate. However, simply listing things that were sold to promote Airwolf I see nothing wrong with, as long as links aren't provided in order to buy them from somewhere. Maybe instead of listing the exact things that were sold, you could just say, a CD soundtrack, as well as a few models and toys were produced for merchandise, and provide a link to a collector's website to see what thinsg were available for collector purposes. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberia23_c7e4.html" title="User:Cyberia23">Cyberia23</a> 21:27, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A simple list of show related items that are—or have been—sold is not contrary to the ideas behind wikipedia. Such information, is about the show, and as such is encyclopedic. Reasons Star Wars does not have a comprehensive list, are most likely due to both the size of such a list and its easy availability in many places else ware on the internet. In the case of Airwolf, neither of those is true It took me quite a bit of time to find the model details back when I was trying to complete my collection. In addition, this show was—at least in large part—about the helicopter, and I think that details of each model that has been available will be of interest to future readers. I know that I would have loved to have had said information a year ago. —<a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMJBurrage_fc1b.html" title="User:MJBurrage">MJBurrage</a> 23:02, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. Correct, nobody OWNS Wiki articles. I can understand how one may be somewhat protective of ones that they have created (I am), but this sort of a reaction is really out in left-field. Make your case for or against the move, but don't try to threaten or negotiate!</dd>
<dd>2. I don't see where the discussion for the Archangel merge even is located...that's a problem. I would have posted there, but I was directed here from the ARchangel page.</dd>
<dd>3. OPPOSE MERGE. The primary characters from this show should have their own articles. Just because the ARchangel page is sparse (as in, almost non-existent) doesn't in itself mean it shouldn't be there, just that it has not been written sufficiently yet. Give it time (or better yet, help it!).</dd>

<dd>The Stringfellow Hawke and Dominic Santini articles, at the very least, are both too long and extensive to be merged into the main Airwolf article. Any description of the characters in the main article should probably be limited to short (i.e. single paragraph) blurbs, while the individual character articles get the more extensive treatment.

<p>Now that I think about it, I realize that I was wrong to call it <i>my</i> article. The MCB article is the first one that I have ever written, so I was a little overprotective of it. Sorry for that. Just to let you know, I will expand the MCB article further when I have free time. Again, I am a newbie and am sorry for the out-in-left-field demands. The simple reason that that is the first article that I have written should be irrevelant to preventing it from being merged into Airwolf. As soon as I am finished working on it, I will merge it (if it is not too long.)</p>

<dd>That's not a bad idea! Be sure to do some reserach of Television project guidelines to see what the best name for the article would be, and to see if this article might need to be renamed instead, to Airwolf (TV series). Just keep in mind that the page has to reflect that Airwolf was fictional, as were her capabilities, though a real Bell 222 was used in filming. We can't write the article as if it were real, even tho that would be fun to do! We can list the capabilities it had for the show though, but we need to keep speculation on its abilities out of the article. Just remeber that Airwolf is a "character", while the Bell 222 used for the role is an "actor". - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 21:59, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One thing to keep in mind is that others may questions the subject's notability. I would recommend reading <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a> for more information on this. I would argue that as the star character of the show, Airwolf itself is notable, but others may disagree. Just be aware of this, and don't be offended if we are forced to merge the material back into this article. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 22:14, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

One could even argue that the helicopter is more notable than the human characters from the show.</dd>
<dd>As noted by <i>BillCJ</i>, one would need to source the details, for example I just noticed that someone has changed the wing gun calibers to a quote from a fan-produced tech manual instead of the calibers shown on screen. (It should be .50 and 30 mm) —<a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMJBurrage_fc1b.html" title="User:MJBurrage">MJBurrage</a> • <a href="../../../m/j/b/User_talk%7EMJBurrage_43c7.html" title="User talk:MJBurrage"><small>TALK</small></a> • 01:14, 3 March 2007 (U</dd>

<p>I have a couple of questions:</p>
<p>1. How do you rename a page?</p>
<p>2. Would it be alright if I put some of the information on the Airwolf page and this Talk page (armament info, etc) into my proposed article?</p>
<p>3. Do I have to get permission from anyone to use this info?</p>
<p>Crazeedriver2005 02:43, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we should leave this page where it is, and place the helicopter information on <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airwolf_%28helicopter%29.html" title="Airwolf (helicopter)">Airwolf (helicopter)</a>. As the info on the article page is already there, we just need to cut-and-paste it to the new article. I'd be careful about using the info on the talk page if it seems too speculative.</dd>

<dd>I am going to go ahead and set up new the aritlce in the next few days, using the basic format from the <a href="../../../a/i/r/WP%7EAIR_f7cf.html" title="WP:AIR">Aircraft Project</a>. I have created a number of aircraft (including helicopter) articles, so I think you'll like the overall look. Feel free to add in what you want, and I'll feel free to tweak it. I do want to stress what is part of the actual aircraft, and what is fictional. I think a lot of people aren't clear on that, so this new page can be the place to clear it up.

I asked a fellow editor to set up a comparison chart on the basic Bell 222 and Airwolf. He remebered the show from when he was younger also, and was happy to help out.</dd>
