<p><b>Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps</b> (<b>AF ROTC</b>) is one of the three <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commissioned_officer.html" title="Commissioned officer">commissioning</a> sources for officers in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a>, the other two being the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_Academy_ee12.html" title="United States Air Force Academy">Air Force Academy</a> and <a href="../../../o/f/f/Officer_Training_School_b716.html" title="Officer Training School">Officer Training School</a>. According to AFOATS HQ, in 2006, AFROTC commissioned 2,083 <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant.html#Second_Lieutenant" title="Lieutenant">Second Lieutenants</a> from 144 detachments, with AFROTC enrollment ranging from 23,605 in 1985 to 10,231 in 1993, and around 13,000 enrolled today.</p>
<p>AFROTC is taken as two (or three, depending on when the candidate joined the program) college courses a semester, Leadership Laboratory and Aerospace Studies classes. It is typically done in conjunction with a traditional four-year academic program.</p>
<p>AFROTC units are called "detachments." Within the detachments the students are organized into wings, groups, squadrons, and flights, along the lines of an active Air Force flying unit. The cadet wing is divided into GMC cadets and POC cadets.</p>

<p>General Military Course. Includes the first 4 semesters of instruction and taking it incurs no obligation to the Air Force by the student, unless awarded an Air Force scholarship. Cadets who are on scholarship are referred to as "Contracted cadets." GMC cadets are usually the subordinates of the cadet wing, and have a primary focus of preparing for Field Training. The freshman cadets are the AS100's. The 100 year is an introduction to the military. Many cadets come in to the program not knowing how to salute, wear their uniforms, or march- they learn this in their 100 year. The sophomores are AS200's. AS200's are getting ready for Field Training in the summer. Some detachments do a full year of "Field Training Preparation" for the 200's, while others do FTP training in the spring semester only.</p>
<p>Detachments that utilize the entire FTP year for FTM (Field Training Manual) study make it easier for the cadets to assimilate the entirety of the information required of them at Field Training. The first semester is dedicated to learning the entire FTM and recitation of the information on-command. Training in the FTP year is a form of training called inoculation, which is designed to accommodate cadets to performing tasks under duress. This is accomplished by perpetual yelling at the cadets and introduction into intentionally stressful situations, to also help simulate the Field Training environment.</p>
<p>There is also a program which allows students who only have three years left of college to complete the program by compressing the AS 100 and AS 200 year into a single year. These cadets are know as AS 250's. There is also the STAR program which allows students to take only two years of the program, one as a AS 250 the other as a mix of AS 300/AS 400. They attend a 6-Week Field Training session (first two weeks of purely Academics) rather than the normal 4-Week camp.</p>
<p>GMC cadets have set ranks. All AS 100's are C/4C (Cadet Fourth Class). All AS 200's are C/3C (Cadet Third Class). Some detachments assign leadership positions to GMC cadets that would normally be held by POC cadets. This will depend on the detachment's size and needs, the GMC cadet's ability, and the Commandant of Cadets' discretion.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Reserve_Officer_Training_Corps_4945.html" title="Edit section: POC (AS300 and AS400)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">POC (AS300 and AS400)</span></h2>
<p>Professional Officer Course. Includes the last 4 semesters of instruction and requires the completion of field training. POC cadets are contracted with the Air Force, whether on scholarship or not, as enlisted members of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individual_Ready_Reserve_9bed.html" title="Individual Ready Reserve">Individual Ready Reserve</a>, and receive a monthly stipend ($350 a month for AS300s and $400 a month for AS400s). By becoming contracted cadets, POC cadets are required to meet height and weight standards, pass a semi-annual physical fitness test, and meet a minimum Cumulative &amp; Term GPA requirement of 2.5. Failing to meet the standards multiple times may result in disenrollment from the program. All POC cadets also must hold at least one leadership position within the cadet wing.</p>
<p>In some cases, students with academic requirements that exceed four years (usually engineers and other technical majors) are in the program for an extra year. During the fifth year these cadets (AS700s) are only minimally required to participate in Lead Lab and maintain retention standards. Otherwise, these cadets have completed their AFROTC requirements.</p>
<p>POC cadets hold cadet officer ranks (i.e. C/2LT, C/1LT, C/CAPT, C/MAJ, C/LTCOL, C/COL). Typically, POC ranks are based on the job they hold in the cadet wing. For instance, the Wing Commander will be a C/Col. The more important the job, the higher than rank. Unlike the Academy, for juniors and seniors there is no rank of cadet second class or cadet first class.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Reserve_Officer_Training_Corps_4945.html" title="Edit section: Physical Training (PT)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Physical Training (PT)</span></h2>
<p>Cadets are required to take part in Physical Training (PT) at least two times per week during the year. PT is only authorized during normal academic sessions (not during breaks). Many detachments hold PT at 6:30AM to 7:30AM on Mondays and Wednesdays, with an optional 6:30AM Friday PT. Optional PTs differ greatly. At some detachments they may consist only of sports games, while others may delve into pre-Field Training sessions to help acclimate the cadets to what they will experience in Field Training. PT is conducted by the PFO (Physical Fitness Officer) and Deputy PFO, who are two POC cadets (generally Juniors). PT starts with formation of the wing (flights sequentially in formation) while stretches and calisthenics are performed. Following stretches/calisthenics, PT will be conducted through the discretion of the PFO and DPFO.</p>
<p>Physical Fitness Tests/Assessments (PFT/PFA) are conducted at least once per semester, with most detachments performing two or three per semester, with many practice/diagnostic PFTs administered throughout the semester. The PFT consists of a waist measurement and three exercises: push-ups, sit-ups, and a 1.5 mile run, all of which are scored on a sliding scale. Like Air Force officers, cadets have 1 minute to complete their push-ups and sit-ups, and must not exceed the maximum for the run or the waist measurement. There is a five-minute rest period between each event. For females to pass the assessment they must complete a minimum of 18 pushups, 35 situps, the 1.5 mile run under 14:30 minutes, and waist measurement under 38 inches. For males they must complete a minimum of 33 pushups, 40 situps, the 1.5 mile run under 12:30 minutes, and waist measurement under 43 inches. The maximum scores attainable for the PFT for females are 11:06 run, under 29.5 waist, 42 pushups, and 51 crunches. For males, the maximum scores are 9:36 run, under 32.5 waist, 62 pushups, and 55 situps.</p>

<p>Field Training is a training program that takes place each summer for GMC cadets. Completion of this <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boot_camp.html" title="Boot camp">boot camp</a>-style training is required to become an officer and is held at either <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellsworth_AFB_10ac.html" title="Ellsworth AFB">Ellsworth AFB</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxwell_AFB_5c24.html" title="Maxwell AFB">Maxwell AFB</a>. Beginning in 2008, Maxwell AFB will be the sole Field Training facility for ROTC since Ellsworth will be closing due the latest round of the Base Realignment and Closures (<a href="../../../b/r/a/BRAC_23d0.html" title="BRAC">BRAC</a>). The Field Training program is designed to evaluate military leadership and discipline, determine the cadet's potential for entry into the Professional Officer Course, and to stratify cadets amongst their peers. The length of standard Field Training is 4 weeks, but GMC cadets not completing two full years of ROTC prior to Field Training may attend a 6-week encampment, the first 2-weeks of which are purely academic. Field training is conducted by FTOs (Flight Training Officers), <a href="../../../a/c/t/Active_duty.html" title="Active duty">active duty</a> officers assigned to an AFROTC Detachment. FTOs are assisted by CTAs (Cadet Training Assistants). Requirements to be a CTA are completion of Field Training in the top third of the training class the previous year, a high degree of competency as a cadet, and an expressed desire to their commanders to be a CTA.</p>
<p>Cadets are organized into flights (usually 20-30 cadets each), with two flights per squadron, and up to six squadrons per group. There is one FTO and one Flight CTA assigned to each individual flight. One Squadron CTA is also assigned in a ratio of one per cadet squadron in order to assist FTOs and Flight CTAs. Traditional CTAs will also be present which include Drill &amp; Ceremonies, PT, Public Affairs, and Standardization CTAs (per AFOATS T-203, p3, 2007).</p>
<p>A typical schedule is as follows: <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reveille.html" title="Reveille">reveille</a>, morning physical training, breakfast, various morning activities, lunch, afternoon activities, retreat, dinner, call to quarters, and lights out. In each flight, cadets are ranked from first to last. The top 10% earn the distinction of "Distinguished Graduate", and the next 10% "Superior Performer". After that, the rankings are broken down into thirds (top/middle/bottom). The Top Gun award acknowledges the highest performing cadet in each flight and the top cadet in the encampment. The rankings depend on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>performance in leadership roles</li>
<li>dress and appearance</li>
<li>drill and ceremonies</li>
<li>physical fitness test score</li>
<li>leadership reaction course score</li>
<li>individual drill evaluation score</li>
<li>overall impression by CTA and FTO</li>
</ul>
<p>These rankings are ultimately used as part of a formula which determines a cadet's choice in career field during their AS300 year. The highest ranking cadets are typically invited back the following summer for CTA duty.</p>

<p>"AS" classes are the academic portion of AFROTC and are taken as electives for university credit-- generally one credit hour classes meeting one hour per week. There are eight semesters of AS instruction with each year grouped into two AS classes. They are numbered from 100 to 400 which corresponds with the year of instruction.</p>
<dl>
<dd>AS 100: Basic Air Force knowledge, such as the structure of the force, missions, ranks, etc.</dd>
<dd>AS 200: Air Force history, which covers both the earliest history of aviation up to events as recent as <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Allied_Force_bad1.html" title="Operation Allied Force">Operation Allied Force</a>.</dd>
<dd>AS 300: Leadership studies, which covers issues related to leadership, ethics, and being a military officer.</dd>

<p>Leadership Laboratory is a weekly, Pass/Fail, 1 hour and 45 minute class during which most military instruction occurs. Most detachments offer Leadership Lab only for zero credit, while some receive one credit-hour for the PT/LLAB combination. GMC cadets receive briefings, wear uniforms, practice drill and ceremonies, and execute Group Leadership Projects. On the weekends detachments usually offer "Flight Time," which is one hour of extra training pertaining to the upcoming Leadership Lab. POC cadets are tasked with planning and executing Lead Lab, as well as performing administration of the cadet wing.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Reserve_Officer_Training_Corps_4945.html" title="Edit section: Cadet Rank">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cadet Rank</span></h2>
<p>AFROTC cadet rank is derived from <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html#Rank_Structure" title="United States Navy">Naval rank</a> and insignia, which follows a similar ascension ordering. Cadet ranking is based solely on the position held within the wing. Freshmen/1st year cadets (AS 100s) hold C/4C rank. Sophomores/2nd year cadets (AS 200s) hold C/3C rank. These ranks are part of the GMC and are therefore not Cadet Officer (POC) positions and will not be saluted. C/2LT and above ranking is assigned to Junior level and above. Though, first semester Juniors cannot hold the rank of C/Maj or above. ECLs will wear their previous year's respective ranking. Cadets can also never be demoted in rank, regardless of the position held within the cadet wing. The only person to hold the rank of C/Colonel is the Wing commander (must be Senior/AS400) and previous Wing commanders still remaining in the cadet wing.</p>
