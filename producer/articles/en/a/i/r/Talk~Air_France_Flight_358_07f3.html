<dd>Traffic is congested around the 401 area as the 401 West has been closed. All the collectors to the 401 from connecting Hwy's have been closed. This has led to traffic on the 407ETR and 427 to be increased as well as a few surface roads; however other TO congestion is normal for the time of day.

<p>Is it possible to get some photos of the plane <i>after</i> it was extinguished and crews started working on it? Apparently the plane was barely recongnizable..

<dd>Yes, once again I took many captures on August 3 and I had uploaded and placed one picture of the aftermath in the article, but someone deleted it and I didn't bother to add it back.

<dd>I don't know if people will find it ugly, but I added your capture right under the CNN one. I really find that before and after type view shocking. ("Wow everyone survived?") Anyway, I still think it's more important than those smaller thumbnails midway in the article. By the way J2rome, I think someone accidently saved over your edit instead of merging them together (history shows your pic was removed a minute after you posted.) --<a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtea_ee58.html" title="User:Mrtea">Mrtea</a> 00:05, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I like to think of Wikipedia has being authorative, but judging by the opening paragraphs of this article that's wrong... Why can't we wait until we are <i>sure</i> of the facts before putting them in?

<dd>For this kind of an article I think it is fair to put in some unconfirmed information, as long as it is clear that it is in fact unconfirmed.

<dd>I don't mind some reasonable speculation that's clearly identified as such, but this paragraph goes too far IMO:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Discussion heard from Global news reports that since the visibility was so low, the pilot overshot the runway. It was the pilot's decision whether to re-power the engine and take off and do another land attempt or stop it. Of course, taking off again would be too late as the slow ground speed would stall the plane. The pilot decided to hit the brakes, thus causing the plane to skid.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I've heard nothing of the sort, and AFAIK (IAAP), there is no practical way that this detailed an explanation for the accident could be known at this point. It does seem like semi-realistic speculation on what happened, but there are lots of other possibilities. It also contains some minor misconceptions, and IMO, it should be removed promptly. -<a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELommer_bc78.html" title="User:Lommer">Lommer</a> | <a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELommer_07f8.html" title="User talk:Lommer"><sup>talk</sup></a> 02:45, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw an article that suggested investigation had concluded the plane intially landed at the start of the lane, but for some reason became airborne again until midway down the lane. Not authoratative info, but worth mentioning</p>

<p>The Metar for the airport was as follows: CYYZ 022020Z 34024G33KT 3SM +TSRA FEW015 OVC040TCU 23/ RMK SF2TCU6 CB ASOCTD Pearson, 2nd of the month at 2020UTC Wind from NNW at 24knots, Gusting 33KT Visablity 3 Miles, Strong Thunderstorms and Rain. Few clouds at 1500ft Overcast at 4000ft</p>
<p>I am alittle rusty on METARs, can anyone understand the Remarks at the end?</p>
<p><br />
cyyz- station identifier 022020z- August 02, 2020 hours (zulu) winds from 340 at 24 knots, gusting to 33 visibility 3 statute miles Heavy thunderstorms and rain Clouds- few at 1500 ft, overcast at 4000, towering cumulus Temp- 23 degrees celsius remark- surface visability 2 miles,towering cumulonimbus (thundercloud) 6 miles is associated with the weather <i>(unsigned comment by: 68.163.44.98)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>The above interpretation of the METAR is correct except for the remarks section. "RMK SF2TCU6 CB ASOCTD" means "Remark: Strato-fractus 2, Towering Cumulus 6, Cumulonimbus associated". The SF2TCU6 is related to the cloud heights given in the main METAR. Few clouds means that 1-2 eighths of the sky are filled, the remark is specifying that its exactly two eighths, and that its strato-fractus type clouds. Likewise, it's also specifying that the overcast (can be 6,7, or 8 eighths) is exactly 8 (6+2=8) and its composed of towering cumulus clouds. -<a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELommer_bc78.html" title="User:Lommer">Lommer</a> | <a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELommer_07f8.html" title="User talk:Lommer"><sup>talk</sup></a> 02:36, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I seem to think it was interesting but probably not significant there was hail at the time 12km directly west of the crash site of around 7-12mm on and off for 5 minutes that overlapped with the time the news stated the plane crashed.

<p>The page currently says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The A340 has eight emergency exits, with two at the extreme front and back, and the majority in the middle.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can this possibly be right? I've never been on an A340, but I have been on many other airliners, including several Airbus models, and the front emergency exits have always been in pairs, left and right. Rear exits also are almost always in pairs, though a few planes like the 727 have a central stairway. I would expect 2 exits at the front, 4 in the middle, 2 at the rear, same as on several other large planes.</p>

<dd>The lesson here is that we should never, EVER take flight attendants for granted. It takes a crew of skilled professionals to evacuate that many people in that short a time. I use the term 'professional' purposely. When everything is great, they're the folks who give you orange juice, but on those rare occasions when everything goes wrong, they're highly competent pros who know their business inside and out.

<p>The idea of using the flight number as the article title about an airplane accident is just stupid, it seems to me. Flight numbers are reused every day, yet the article is invariably about an incident on a particular day. This is far from being the only article thus titled, so I would prefer to make this comment in a talk page or other forum that isn't about one particular accident: can anyone suggest one?</p>

<li>Mwalcoff is right, airlines do retire the numbers of crashed flights. I'm sure the day will come when one doesn't, but until then this policy works.

<li>Ditto. August 2nd crash of Air France Flight 358 is a mouthful. The thing that I like about the current convention is that the article title matches how I remember the incident.

<dd>Umm, unless they re-drew the boundaries, Toronto is still larger than Mississauga in surface area, so that argument is not relevant.

<dl>
<dd>I meant 'massive' in population, not size, as there are few (if any) other suburbs in the world that have 700,000 people. Regardless, the airport is Toronto Pearson International Airport, people who fly to this airport are flying <i>into</i> Toronto, not Mississauga, and that in itself is enough to call it the <i>Miracle in Toronto</i>. Sorry Mississauga, but you just aren't important enough, and as far as the world is concerned, you are just a western extension of the Big Smoke. <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESnickerdo_538d.html" title="User:Snickerdo">Snickerdo</a> 21:38, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's a very poor choice of name. I only see one news report on Google News using that term, from Manitoba. I also haven't heard any news report use it, though I'm not watching the news all the time. I'm mainly hearing it be refered to as the Toronto Plane Crash or Air Disaster or such. I can't see any issue with the naming.
<dl>
<dd>Some folks are calling it "Miracle at Pearson"; however, I am perfecylu happy with leaving it as is. There is no need to change it, though whichever media-given nickname sticks may do well as a redirect to this article. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 18:05, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

Please pursue the subject there if interested. I will respond here on only one point made above: I think the practice of retiring flight numbers is a red herring, because not all airlines would do it; and in any case it doesn't address the issue of all the <i>previous</i> instances of the flight number, which are not what the article is about. -- 02:10 UTC, August 3</p>

<dd>The other A340 accidents seem so different from the present one that they may not deserve much space or any image representation in this article.

<p>The answer to your question is obvious, and has nothing to do with American bias: of the screencaps available, that is clearly the most dramatic. It is a closeup, and shows fire.

<p>I agree. The local ones were mostly being filmed from the traffic camera at the scene, and the captures people were able to get reflected the live coverage. <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> probably had that more dramatic shot repeating over and over during their recaps, so it was easier to get a capture of it.

<p>I understand where SD6-Agent is coming from and I hope they don't get me wrong, I am a proud Canadian too and I was actually the one who captured these photos from all of the different TV stations. As much as I would like to put one of the Canadian ones on top, the CNN one is the most dramatic as stated by Klanda and MelSkunk. CNN actually took the image from CBC, but I wasn't tuned to CBC at the time as I don't watch the channel much and forgot that it would have great coverage. I can look back at the caps saved on my computer and see if there's a better CBC one. <a href="../../../j/2/r/User%7EJ2rome_32e5.html" title="User:J2rome">J2rome</a> 23:04, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey all! I'm a Torontonian, and about this American-bias thing, I agree it IS bias, they took the images off our reporters work and overlap them w/ their title, that is unfair. Anyways, yesterday, I flipped on the TV, it was CBC and not some American channel (aka CNN). Cncxbox 21:33 (EDT)</p>
<p>The most amusing thing of all is that the CNN shot was actually from the CBC, and you can clearly see that CNN is 'overlaying' their own graphics on top of the CBC feed.

<p>If you're going to bother speculating as to the cause of the crash (even the early eyewitness reports suggest all kinds of widely varying things, from lightning strikes to power failure), you may as well add the theory that the aeroplane simply aquaplaned on the heavily flooded runway.</p>
<p>Certainly I doubt linking to other A340 incidents has much relevance, the only other incidents worth mentioning are similar runway overshoots (it certainly seems that, whatever the cause, this was the main reason for the plane crashing/burning - i.e. taxi-ing into a ravine).</p>
<p>Apparently mostly simple runway-overshoots can result in no casualties when there aren't other factors (like motorways *directly* after the runways).</p>
<p>The coverage here is very biased towards North American coverage. The above items were discussed on BBC World.</p>

<p>Help! The two images side-by-side makes for a difficult read of the intro that I don't know how to fix.

<dd>I've reintroduced the problem by adding in a crash template. The template allows an image, possibly one of the two could be inserted there. Great top photograph, BTW!</dd>

<dd>I've also tidied up some of the dates. Wikidates don't need an embedded comma because it is added according to the user's preferences. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 07:06, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do feel we have way too many images on this article. One may think that there is no problem since we aren't limited in space, but they can be a pain in a couple of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, wikipedia is humbled by image traffic. A more conservative use of picture would mitigate this issue.</li>
<li>Second, and very important. Some users are not lucky to be sitting behind a fat pipe. I mean, there are millions of people who still use dial up, and especially very noisy dial up. Linking this number of images almost garantee the article is not accessable to them. Try visiting Kenya sometime.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would say the first two pictures provide the same information and one has to be redundant. Please unlink some of the pictures</p>

<p>I appreciate that there were bruises and stuff. The template just says "injuries", and when there's only two categories, they being Deaths and Injuries, one presumes that the injuries were pretty serious but survivable. I don't know if there's any rule of thumb here, but I think it's pretty obvious that the injuries in the template won't be minor.</p>
<p>Otherwise we could pretty well list just about every airline flight where hot coffe is spilt down someone's cleavage, or the drinks trolley runs over a passenger's foot or some klutz cracks their head against an overhead locker and boy, didn't that one leave a bruise. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 04:57, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know how Canada's <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transportation_Safety_Board_of_Canada_180b.html" title="Transportation Safety Board of Canada">TSB</a> counts injuries (which would be the relevant agency here), but I assume they do it much like they do in the United States, where there are four categories of injury; uninjured, minor, serious, and fatal. I disagree with you; I think we should count every injury that is counted by the official report — minor injuries are still injuries. I also don't think it will cause your slippery slope, where we include little turbulence events where one person received a minor injury. This is a major incident that happened to also have some minor injuries, and no point in not counting them if the TSB does. —<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 12:41, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
