<p>Why do we have a "list of gags" in this article? It seems like they're just some funny ones that people can remember. At a rough guess I'd say a full list would contain about 500 jokes! (And then you run into problems of defining a joke/gag/parody etc.) It's like a list from a blog. Can we change it to just an example list or delete it altogether?

<dd>A specific "running gag" section might help, as I don't know where to include the running gag - the fact that whenever the 'plane is seen, the soundtrack carries the drone of a 4-engined piston WW2 bomber, not the drone of jet engines.

<dd>Well, it was already brought up before, but when suggesting that it be cleaned up, I was told it was fine the way it is. Clearly, it's a mess. If nobody objects, I'm going to trim some of the garbarge, (It IS supposed to be "notable" gags, people), and remove a lot of the POV crap (like "in one especially funny moment...") and the poorly written stuff (most likely by people who just popped in to add their favourite moment and left).<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 13:26, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I cleaned up the "Notable gags" list. Several non-notable gags listed. One entry was just an entire scene of dialogue transcribed from the movie. This movie is a fan favourite and a cult-classic, so it's going to get a lot of input, but it was just way to big. Sure they <i>are</i> funny moments, but the movie is <i>full</i> of funny moments, and we can't very well list all of them. Also, people seem to be confusing "gags" with trivia, so I moved some entries to the appropriate section. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 05:45, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not really related, but it is an apparent problem with a gag. Are we sure about the sentence "A man dressed like a service station attendant (Jimmie Walker) lifts the plane's hood to check the dipstick, but falls off the ladder while trying to leap onto the hood to get it shut. Another attendant continues the service station gag by handing a credit card slip to Oveur to sign."? It's been there since last October so there have been a lot of edits which haven't done anything about it. But I find it very unlikely that it should actually be "dipstick". I'm not sure what it should be though as the engine of the plane is not at the front. <a href="../../../r/a/o/User%7ERaoulharris_b0d8.html" title="User:Raoulharris">Raoul</a> 16:17, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you are familiar with the particulars of this scene, please edit it. I don't even remember this scene in the movie at all, but that's just me. Of course, it could be that it is just not memorable gag and the whole thing should be removed from the list (which is what I would do). <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 17:55, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do remember the joke, but the problem is that I'm not sure how it should be explained (and if I edit large sections of text my browser cuts off the bottom, I'm not sure if the gags section is long enough for that to happen or not, but I'd prefer to avoid the risk as the problem also makes it difficult to revert). It was quite funny, but remove it if you want because that section is way too long. <a href="../../../r/a/o/User%7ERaoulharris_b0d8.html" title="User:Raoulharris">Raoul</a> 08:34, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>FROM ARTICLE: "In some foreign releases (including Australia), Airplane! was entitled Flying High. The reason most often quoted for this is that in those countries the name 'airplane' is not used to refer to a powered flying machine, however this is somewhat unlikely. The vast majority of English-language films are made in the USA, and so the term "airplane" would be perfectly familiar to their English-speaking audiences. In any event, the pronunciation of British English variant "aeroplane" is very similar to the way many Americans say "airplane"."</p>
<p>Now, should this sort of speculation really appear in the article? If people know why it was changed, then say why. If no one knows why, then say nothing. It is true that outside the US the word "Aeroplane" is used in place of "Airplane" ("plane" is more common though) and yes the pronunciations are very close and, to us Australians, it is really not that apparent when someone says "airplane" in a US movie as it sounds really close to "aeroplane". However, the title of a film is frequently seen in print and read, often before the potential filmgoer hears the title spoken, it is read in reviews, on movie posters, newspaper adverts, etc. In all those contexts, seeing unfamiliar word "airplane" would look very jarring and confusing: NOT something studios want people to feel when contemplating which film to see. So it seems feasile that the reason refuted really <i>was</i> the reason. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 08:16, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my experience, in Australia the term <i>aeroplane</i> is mainly used for small propellor planes - like a little Cessna - not for big passenger jets. Passenger jets are usually called <i>planes</i>, <i>passenger jets</i>, <i>jets</i>, <i>jet aircraft</i>, <i>Jumbos</i>, or by their model name (<i>747</i>, <i>737</i>, <i>Airbus</i>, etc.) So by renaming the film <i>aeroplane</i> would suggest a small four-seater, single propellor job (to me, anyway.) <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 05:00, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An argument for a change of title based on usage within the British Commonwealth would make sense if the title were changed in all of the Commonwealth countries. However, as it seems that the title was only changed to Flying High in Australia, New Zealand, and the Phillipines, the argument doesn't seem to hold. Perhaps another film had been released regionally with a similar name? <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwanSZ_013e.html" title="User:SwanSZ">Cyg-nifier</a> 23:55, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When Oveur answered the wrong courtesy phone, the same voice that announced a call for him told him he had to pick up the other colour of phone. Instead, they should have had "Mrs. Culpepper" from "Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World" say it, then go back to, "Billy Sue?" and Captain Culpepper saying, "Billy Sue, listen to your mother!!!!" (Maybe even have Spencer Tracy at the airport police office holding two phones close together as Oveur walks by a moment later!) <a href="../../../g/c/a/User%7EGcapp1959_07ea.html" title="User:Gcapp1959">GBC</a> 18:14, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Obviously this has been discussed before, but the gags section is WAY too long. It's at least twice as long as the synopsis! I'm making cuts.

<dd>There is actually a lot this article needs, upon closer inspection. I've deleted the entire "notable characters" section - almost none of this section was actually about the movie, but rather about the actor's careers. The few relevant items I moved to different sections. I'm also going to rearrange the sections a bit.<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 02:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "Notable gags" section is blatantly unencyclopedic, and it has no place in this article. <i>This movie is based entirely on gags.</i> Should they all be there? Wouldn't that be putting the script there? If not, how do we choose which ones are notable and which ones aren't?</p>

<p>The section should be removed entirely. Cleaning it up would only be choosing which gags are notable and which ones aren't, and I'd argue that that's impossible to do. The way it's set up now is just begging for people to add any and every gag they see in the movie, as long as they think it's funny. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesuschex_d368.html" title="User:Jesuschex">Jesuschex</a> 04:42, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm inclined to agree, except for two specific things: "Don't call me Shirley", and Otto, the inflatable pilot. But those could easily be moved to some other section. The only other thing I'd worry about is that it would lead to fans putting gags into the paragraph section of the article, instead of a list (where they are easily deleted), but that potential problem can be solved if enough people keep an eye on it. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 05:05, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd suggest a third - "drinking problem", since it is used several times (and again in the sequel). I'd actually rank it above Otto in the importance scale, but that's just MHO. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambertman_d36c.html" title="User:Lambertman">Lambertman</a> 16:01, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess what I'm talking about is notability, as opposed to importance. Importance would be hard to assess, but "don't call me Shirley" at least has the 100 Movies, 100 Quotes citation, and Otto has an IMDb page. I know IMDb is basically a fan site, but having a page as an inflatable doll that hasn't been in any other movies is relatively notable. If there's some similar citation for drinking problem, than by all means it should stay. But if not, I think its inclusion will be another invitation for fans to add anything and everything. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 17:15, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's definitely a good point. The gags that are <i>verifiably</i> notable should be put in the article, while if there's nothing but a Wikipedian to say it's notable, it shouldn't be listed as such. Is that what you're saying? <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesuschex_d368.html" title="User:Jesuschex">Jesuschex</a> 00:40, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep, pretty much. As far as I know, there are only 2 things in the gags sections that meet <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">verifiability</a>, and that's "don't call me Shirley" and Otto. Other than that, it seems to just be things people think are funny. A while back I pruned it down significantly (the previous version essentially recapped the entire film), but - having nothing to go on - I left in the recurring gags. That was really a stop-gag solution, though. So, IMO, the best choice is to take the gags section out entirely, and add "don't call me Shirley" and Otto into some other section, like response. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 04:57, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since Arthur Hailey &amp; John Castle's novel was not published until 1958, it isn't possible for the 1955 and 1956 movies to be remakes of this novel. There also is no evidence cited to suggest that these mid-1950 stories are the first for this particular story line. More research would be needed to claim this. Thus I've just done a revision clarifying the relationships between the movies and novels that came before <i>Airplane!</i> Also, there is no evidence that Zucker, et al. were familiar with the 1955 movie or with Hailey &amp; Castle's novel. They include gags related to his novel "Airport," but that doesn't necessarily mean they had known of <i>Runway Zero-Eight</i>. More research would be needed here to. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwanSZ_013e.html" title="User:SwanSZ">Cyg-nifier</a> 00:04, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to the commentary on the DVD of Airplane! by the writers and directors and according to the Internet Media Data Base (IMDB), the official release of the film was 2 July rather than in June. Is there a citation that can be used to support this earlier date as the official release date? If not, I'll make the change to the 2 July date. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwanSZ_013e.html" title="User:SwanSZ">Cyg-nifier</a> 00:09, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
