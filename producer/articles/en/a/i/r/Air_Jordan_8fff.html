<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Jordan_8fff.html" title="Edit section: Air Jordan I">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Air Jordan I</span></h2>
<p>Designed by <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Moore_ab94.html" title="Peter Moore">Peter Moore</a> and released in 1985, the Air Jordan I is considered a watershed in basketball shoe design, although its design was improved upon later with the <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nike_Dunk_62b1.html" title="Nike Dunk">Nike Dunk</a>. The shoe gained much initial publicity and interest when the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Basketball_Association_2e33.html" title="National Basketball Association">National Basketball Association</a> banned it, saying that its vibrant black and red color violated the league's design rules. Michael Jordan is also said to have not cared much for the first Air Jordan, saying the red and black colorway looked like "devil shoes". None the less, other shoe companies scrambled to emulate the design, with some even introducing direct knock-offs.</p>
<p>In 1994, the white/black-red and black/red colorways were retroed and sold very poorly. Many went on sale for as low as $20 in stores. When the I's were retroed again in 2001, they sold out instantly.</p>
<table class="gallery" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"></table>
<p>In 2007 new re-retro I's will release, one of which will be a "Beginning Moments Package" or "New Love, Old Love" that will include a re-retro of the extremely rare white/black-red black-toe colorway.</p>
<p>The first sightings of the Air Jordan I occurred on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_17.html" title="November 17">November 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> in a game between the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bulls_cb53.html" title="Chicago Bulls">Chicago Bulls</a> and the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_76ers.html" title="Philadelphia 76ers">Philadelphia 76ers</a>. The first colors unveiled were the banned black/red design. It was announced later that <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nike%2C_Inc._7cbe.html" title="Nike, Inc.">Nike</a> would release them to the public the following spring.</p>

<p>Designed by Bruce Kilgore the Air Jordan II debuted in 1986 to limited popularity because of it's expensive 100 dollar price tag. But the shoe was still unique because it sported Italian leather and faux lizard skin on the side of the shoe. In a game against Golden State, Michael Jordan broke his ankle while wearing the Air Jordan II's, which led many to think the II's were the cause of the accident. In addition, the soft midsole would crack easily and the shoes would be thrown out. This was the last Air Jordan to feature the Wings logo on it. Intrestingly, this was the only Air Jordan not to be originally made in all black.</p>
<p>The II also had poor sales when retroed in 1994-1995,but when the white/black-red colorway was re-retroed in 2001 the demand was much greater. Since then more re-retros have released including a black suede colorway.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Jordan_8fff.html" title="Edit section: Air Jordan III">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Air Jordan III</span></h2>
<p>Designed by <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tinker_Hatfield_0fd6.html" title="Tinker Hatfield">Tinker Hatfield</a> the Air Jordan III was truly revolutionary. It was the first Air Jordan to feature a visible air unit on the heel, the new Jumpman logo, an elephant print trim, and tumble leather for a luxury look. The III's are also famous for the humorus ads depicting <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spike_Lee_91fb.html" title="Spike Lee">Spike Lee</a> as Mars Blackmon.</p>
<table class="gallery" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"></table>
<p>The III's had poor sales when first retroed in 1994. However when they were re-retroed they sold out instantly. A pair of these online can go for sale for prices over 300 dollars. In 2007 the long awaited "Fire Red" III's were released in March of 2007.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jordan_c952.html" title="Michael Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> has reportedly said the III's were and still are his favorite Air Jordans to date.</p>
<p>In 2007, Jordan brand will collaborate with director <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spike_Lee_91fb.html" title="Spike Lee">Spike Lee</a> to release a limited pair of III's in a special colorway to resemble the <a href="../../../d/o/_/Do_The_Right_Thing_6bbe.html" title="Do The Right Thing">Do The Right Thing</a> movie poster.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Jordan_8fff.html" title="Edit section: Air Jordan IV">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Air Jordan IV</span></h2>
<p>The Air Jordan IV shoe was first released in 1989, designed once again by <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tinker_Hatfield_0fd6.html" title="Tinker Hatfield">Tinker Hatfield</a>. It wasn't as revolutionary as the first three models, but it still became the first released Jordan shoe on the world market, with some exceptions. Its cushioning sole and design made it an international bestseller.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spike_Lee_91fb.html" title="Spike Lee">Spike Lee</a>, the director/actor who helped in the ad campaign for the Air Jordan III, created the famous Can/Can't TV commercial. He also gave them promotion in his movie <i><a href="../../../d/o/_/Do_The_Right_Thing_6bbe.html" title="Do The Right Thing">Do The Right Thing</a></i>. A classic scene in the movie for Jordan fans has a person who has his new AJ IVs scuffed by a bicycle rider and goes crazy about it. He places his shoe on a fire hydrant and cleans it with a toothbrush.</p>
<table class="gallery" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"></table>
<p>The shoe was retroed in 1999 in a white/black colorway and a black/cement colorway. Stores were sold out of IVs within hours of release. However, when Nike (or Jordan Brand) released the first Retro+ model of the IVs, many claimed that they "destroyed a classic" by removing the nets on the shoe, among some other subtle changes. The real Jordan IV has the "NIKE AIR" logo on the back. Nike replaced it with the Jumpman logo. Rapper Slick Rick has stated that he will purchase the entire retro line released this year.</p>
<p>In 2006 Nike released many Retro packages of the IV, including "Mars Blackmons" ("Laser Red" IV's with Spike Lee's alter ego on the heel), "Military Blues", and the $500 "Thunder and Lightning" package.</p>
<p>Also in 2006, the "retro'ed" version of the Jordan IV's came in the exclusive colorway in solid black and solid white.</p>
<p><a name="Air_Jordan_V" id="Air_Jordan_V"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Jordan_8fff.html" title="Edit section: Air Jordan V">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Air Jordan V</span></h2>
<p>The original Air Jordan V was released in February 1990. Again designed by Hatfield, and like his other designs, this was again truly revolutionary. Some elements were the same from the Air Jordan IV, but the V's most distinctive feature is arguably its reflective tongue. There was also another innovation: clear rubber soles. The soles gave the shoe a whole new and unique look, but it quickly turned yellow in reaction to water. Collectors' responses to this was storing the shoes in a cool, dry place with a <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desiccant.html" title="Desiccant">desiccant</a> at the soles, most commonly <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silica.html" title="Silica">silica</a> packs. The Jordan V also came with lacelocks, making strapping on easy.</p>
<table class="gallery" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"></table>
<p>Hatfield is rumored to have drawn inspiration for the AJV from the World War II <a href="../../../p/-/5/P-51_Mustang_6b8f.html" title="P-51 Mustang">Mustang</a> fighter plane; easily seen in the shark teeth shapes on the midsole. The V was retroed in 2000 to great demand, including a new colorway featuring Michael Jordan's high school (Laney High) colors. In 2006 several re-retro V's had released including the very popular "Grape" V's, and the "Fire-Red" V's. Along with the latter, a very limited laser design and the black/metallic/fire red colorways were released in early 2007.</p>
<p>The Air Jordan V's can also be seen in NBC's The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air, when Will Smith is spinning in the chair in the opening credits and he is also wearing the White/Fire Red V's during the Banks family's formal dinner invite in the very first episode of the hit sitcom.He is also seen wearing the Grape V's when his friend "Ice Tray" visits him from Philadelphia.</p>
<p>On another note, the Air Jordan 4's were a top seller. More 4's made than any other pairs of jordans.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Jordan_8fff.html" title="Edit section: Air Jordan VI">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Air Jordan VI</span></h2>
<p>The Air yannick Jordan VI was made in 1990 and later released in 1991 selling for $125. The Retro pair of the Air Jordan VI was released in 2000. If the Air Jordan V was inspired by the Mustang Fighter Airplane, the Air Jordan VI was inspired by the Stealth Fighter <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-117.html" title="F-117">F-117</a> used during <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert_Storm_ee3e.html" title="Desert Storm">Desert Storm</a>. This was the shoe MJ was wearing when he won his first of six championships. It featured a clear sole similar to the AJ V and also had the same yellowing attributes when exposed to water. Also of note was the pull-tab on the shoe tongue. This shoe was combined with the AJ 11 in a package called DMP (Defining Moments Package) which was released in 2006.</p>
<table class="gallery" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"></table>
<p>The VI's design is unique in the fact that it incorporates Michael's #23 into the design of the shoe itself. When viewed from the medial side, the back upper forms a two while the upper area of the shoe near the laces shows the three.</p>
<p><a name="Air_Jordan_VII" id="Air_Jordan_VII"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Jordan_8fff.html" title="Edit section: Air Jordan VII">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Air Jordan VII</span></h2>
<p>The Air Jordan VII was released in late 1991 early 1992.</p>
<p>Hatfield created a shoe with lots of similarities with the previous model. What was unique with the VII's was that they used some of the Nike Huarache technology to create a shoe that really stuck to your foot. The visible air sole, the Nike Air logo, and the yellowing soles all were gone.</p>
<p>When Jordan went to the Olympics with the Dream Team, Nike released a special Olympic color combo of the VII's. This model also featured Jordan's Olympic jersey number, 9 which made it very special since all of the previous models that featured his jersey number had always been either stitched or printed with the number 23. Shoe is also known as the "Bugs Bunny" due to the fact that Jordan first wore the shoe in the movie "<a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Jam_2006.html" title="Space Jam">Space Jam</a>".</p>
<table class="gallery" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"></table>
<p>Various retros of the Air Jordan VII were released in 2002, again in 2004, and again in different colors in 2006.</p>

<p>The Air Jordan VIII was released in 1992/93.</p>
<p>The eighth model of the Air Jordan was one heavy shoe. Its base was clearly close to its predecessor but it had a lot more details, and some collectors came to call this the flower-power Air Jordan. This shoe was only made in three different color combinations. The shoes were produced in less quantity than the VI. The Air Jordan VIII is to be re-retroed again in the fall of 2007 in its aqua color. .</p>

<p>Originally released in November 1993, the IX was the first Jordan release after his retirement. It was also made as a baseball cleat that MJ used during his post-Bulls baseball days.</p>
<p>The white/black version was worn by MJ for one scene in the 1995 movie <i><a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Jam_2006.html" title="Space Jam">Space Jam</a></i>.</p>
<p>Like the Air Jordan VIIs, and VIIIs, the IXs feature an inner sock sleeve and <a href="../../../n/u/b/Nubuck.html" title="Nubuck">nubuck</a> accents. The sole features different symbols and languages of different countries.</p>

<p>What Michael wore when he returned in 1995 before switching to the XI's in the playoffs, the Xs included a full grain leather upper, with a solid rubber outsole. They also sported a quick lacing system with Michael Jordan's previous accomplishments on the outsole. There were multiple colorways released for different large cities across the United States. The original colorway, white/steel grey/black featured an extra piece of leather on the toe for more durability. MJ however did not like this so Nike removed it on future colorways.This was the one sneaker that Michael did not fully approve of, this is probably Tinker designed it and had it made while Michael was still playing baseball.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Jordan_8fff.html" title="Edit section: Air Jordan XI">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Air Jordan XI</span></h2>
<p>The Air Jordan XI is one of the most popular Air Jordans of all time and one of the most sought after sneakers of all time. These were the shoes Jordan wore during his first return to basketball during the 1995-1996 season. They revolutionized all basketball shoes with the use of a carbon-fiber shank; no one had ever seen so much technology in a basketball shoe prior to the XI. In fall of 2000, Nike had re-released the retro version of the Air Jordan XI (officially dubbed Air Jordan XI Retro) but had made them slightly different from the previous release.</p>
<p>First, the retro's toe was far less likely to crease and was much stiffer. The patent leather was glossier and the arch on the shoe was more inclined and less flat. Many argue that the retro version is superior to the original. Additionally, the Retro had unique colors that were never released originally including the <i>Space Jam</i> version of the shoe which sold out in a matter of hours at most stores.</p>

<p>They are also the most illegally copied shoes in the market, with as much as 1/3 of all Air Jordan XI's sold on eBay being fakes, many of them coming from China. Fakes of the Air Jordan XI usually have a hard mid-sole (it is supposed to be soft or at least semi-firm), a low or barely visible arch on the mid-foot, and a disfigured checkered pattern on the bottom of the shoe. Many of these fakes lack cushioning and can be quite uncomfortable to walk in. A first sign to tell that the shoes are fake is to look for the box that it came in. The box should match the shoe exactly with the ID number on the box matching the ID number on the shoe. Often the box is not even a Jordan box or one that is too big or too small for the shoe with no barcode.</p>

<p>This sleek edition was issued in several colors: red and black, white and obsidian, black and white and in low top style, dark blue and cream white and one of the most sought after XII: the white/red color. These are the first Air Jordans not to feature the Nike logo anywhere on the shoe itself. The VII-XI still retained the nike air logo on the insole. It was also the first to use Zoom Air cushioning. The Air Jordan XII was the shoe that Jordan wore through the 1996-97 season including his renowned performance in the fifth game of the 1997 NBA Finals. With the flu, Jordan scored 38 points including a 3-pointer with 25 seconds left to put away the game, after which he was carried off the court by teammate Scottie Pippen.</p>

<p>The Air Jordan XIII's, from 1997/1998, are some of Michael Jordan's favorite shoes. They have very good cushioning along with breathability. This was the same time MJ announced his retirement from the NBA for the second time. They were designed again by Hatfield. Also they were re-released in 2005 at about the same time the XX came out.</p>
<table class="gallery" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"></table>
<p>The shoes were inspired by a black panther, which is known for its stealth and swiftness. The shoe itself somewhat resembles the paw of a panther with pods that represent the paws of a panther. This provided more coverage and support on the basketball court. A hologram is features on the outer heel of the shoe which changes color as the viewer moves around the shoe. The hologram is known to fog up after many years. This represents the eyes of the panther in the dark.</p>

<p>This shoe was a revolutionary part of his career blending in 1-13. The XIV was modeled after the Ferrari with its sleek design, and Jordan logo. It is still worn by his fans and people all over the world. There are over 9 colors of the XIV including his Bulls color white, and black.</p>
<p>According to solecollector.com's shoe expert Professor K, the Air Jordan XIV is the most comfortable Jordan ever, even as a retro shoe.</p>
<p>It is known for being the best Jordan in terms of performance, blowing away even the most modern of basketball sneakers.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<table class="gallery" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"></table>
<p>As an added extra, there are seven Jumpman logos on each shoe, 7 + 7= 14.</p>
<p>The black/varsity red - black version is sometimes referred to as the last shots because Jordan was wearing them during the last game he played with the Bulls which he finished with a game-winning shot over Bryon Russell. It was the first and only time in Jordan's professional career he wore the shoe.</p>

<p>As the first Air Jordans released after Jordan's second retirement, sharing a similarity to the Air Jordan IX in that Jordan never played professionally in the shoe. There was some skepticism as to their comfort. The tongue of the shoe stuck out to mimic Jordan's well known habit of sticking his tongue out while playing. The woven kevlar Jordan 15 was modeled after the fighter jet plane.</p>

<p>The first Air Jordan to have the removable shroud concept. The shroud, or gaiter, was said to be a pre/post game accessory to dress the shoe up. The shroud was not recommended to be worn during gameplay. It also featured a patent leather toe with the toe being more square that a traditional shoe toe. This concept has been reused in many of the later Air Jordans. This was the first shoe since the Air Jordan VI to feature visible Air. It also was the first to feature a clear rubber sole since the Air Jordan XI.</p>

<p>The last shoe Michael Jordan ever played a professional game in. The first release was Black/Royal followed by the White/Royal colorway and finished off with a White/Red colorway. All colorways released came with embroidered towels reading "Air Jordan" and the famous Jumpman logo, but the Black/Royal colorway was the only one that came with a suede brush for easy cleaning. The upper was suede and had a cover over the laces and was very nice. The XVIII featured full length Zoom Air and a double-stacked Zoom Air unit in the heel. It also had a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_fiber.html" title="Carbon fiber">carbon fiber</a> spring plate. The inspiration of this shoe was from the aggressive and elegant styling of European sports cars, which is reflected in this magnificent shoe.</p>
