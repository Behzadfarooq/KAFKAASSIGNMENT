<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_assault.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Air mobility has been a key concept since <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Initial approaches to air mobility focused on airborne units, which consisted of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paratrooper.html" title="Paratrooper">paratroopers</a> and sometimes <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glider.html" title="Glider">glider</a>-borne troops.</p>
<p>Paratroopers were dropped from the skies at <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Husky_ac7e.html" title="Operation Husky">Sicily</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">Normandy</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Market_Garden_d364.html" title="Operation Market Garden">Holland</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Crete_4bf7.html" title="Battle of Crete">Crete</a>. Meanwhile, the Germans were using the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autogyro.html" title="Autogyro">autogyro</a> to airlift downed <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> pilots back to friendly lines.</p>
<p>Airborne tactics in WWII differed between nationalities and theaters of war. In Europe, Allied airborne tactics often involved broad area landings in advance of conventional forces with limited reinforcement. The airborne forces then linked up with the conventional forces when they arrived.</p>
<p>The German tactic in Holland and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Crete_4bf7.html" title="Battle of Crete">Crete</a> was to establish an airhead at an airfield using parachute and glider infantry—similar to a beachhead in amphibious tactics—and rapidly reinforce the airhead with specially trained troops, such as the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_22nd_Air_Landing_Infantry_Division_d63a.html" title="German 22nd Air Landing Infantry Division">22.Luftlandeinfanteriedivision</a>, in transport aircraft. In the Pacific, Allied forces performed a similar operation at Nadzab in 1943, with American paratroopers of the <a href="../../../5/0/3/503d_Infantry_Regiment_7038.html" title="503d Infantry Regiment">503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment</a> taking the airhead and the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_7th_Division_79c8.html" title="Australian 7th Division">Australian 7th Division</a> providing the reinforcing infantry in conventional transports. This is closer to the air assault tactics of today.</p>
<p>Units like the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_Air_Commando_Group_0de7.html" title="1st Air Commando Group">1st Air Commando Group</a> performed extensive aerial resupply using gliders and conventional transports in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/China_Burma_India_Theater_of_World_War_II_e44d.html" title="China Burma India Theater of World War II">China-Burma-India theater</a> (CBI). The Germans fielded the first troop carrying helicopter, the FA-223 in WW2 and would have used it to rescue Italian dictator Mussolini after the glider assault had their machine not needed repairs. In its stead, a short take-off and landing (STOL) <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fieseler_Fi_156_5354.html" title="Fieseler Fi 156">Fieseler Storch</a> observation plane was used to fly him to safety. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Air_Forces_8bec.html" title="United States Army Air Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> flew <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikorsky_R-4_2c85.html" title="Sikorsky R-4">Sikorsky R-4</a> helicopters in the CBI theater, performing the first helicopter casualty evacuation. It could only carry one person other than the pilot. They also used the R-6 which could carry two casualties in pods on the side of the helicopter. All Allied helicopter pilots in WWII were trained by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Coast_Guard_52b9.html" title="United States Coast Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> at Brooklyn Air Station.</p>
<p>In 1946 <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Marine_Corps_e7db.html" title="United States Marine Corps">U.S. Marine</a> General <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Geiger_7653.html" title="Roy Geiger">Roy S. Geiger</a> observed the atomic bomb tests at <a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini_Atoll_54a5.html" title="Bikini Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a> and instantly recognized that atomic bombs could render amphibious landings difficult because of the dense concentrations of troops, ships and material at the beachhead. The <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commandant_of_the_Marine_Corps_3300.html" title="Commandant of the Marine Corps">Commandant of the Marine Corps</a> convened a special board, the Hogaboom Board, that recommended that the USMC develop transport helicopters in order to allow a more diffuse attack on enemy shores. It also recommended that the USMC stand up an experimental helicopter squadron and <a href="../../../h/m/x/HMX-1_271a.html" title="HMX-1">HMX-1</a> was commissioned in 1947 with <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikorsky_Aircraft_Corporation_a5f0.html" title="Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation">Sikorsky</a> <a href="../../../h/-/5/H-5_Dragonfly_c444.html" title="H-5 Dragonfly">HO3S-1s</a>. In 1948 the Marine Corps Schools came out with <i>Amphibious Operations—Employment of Helicopters (Tentative)</i>, or <i>Phib-31</i>, which was the first manual for airmobile operations. The Marines used the term vertical envelopment instead of air mobility or air assault. HMX-1 performed its first vertical envelopment from the deck of an aircraft carrier in an exercise in 1949.</p>
<p>After the start of the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a>, four <a href="../../../h/m/x/HMX-1_271a.html" title="HMX-1">HMX-1</a> helicopters were <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indochina.html" title="Indochina">attached</a> to VMO-6 and sent to the <a href="../../../p/u/s/Pusan_Perimeter_db49.html" title="Pusan Perimeter">Pusan Perimeter</a> in 1950. They were used for battlefield observation and control as well as medical evacuation and the rescue of fliers. During the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chosin_Reservoir_7c8d.html" title="Battle of Chosin Reservoir">Battle of Chosin Reservoir</a> they were used for liaison between the different Marine units strung along the western edge of the Chosin Reservoir. The Marines began commissioning transport helicopter squadrons flying Sikorsky <a href="../../../h/-/1/H-19_Chickasaw_d71d.html" title="H-19 Chickasaw">HRS-1s</a> in 1951. After moving to Korea, these units began performing aerial resupply and aerial assault. <a href="../../../h/m/m/HMM-161_882f.html" title="HMM-161">HMR-161</a> transported over 200 Marines and 18,000 pounds of cargo in the first combat helicopter air assault in history in Operation Summit in September 1951. The first battalion-sized combat helicopter air assault was that of the <a href="../../../3/r/d/3rd_Battalion_7th_Marines_2840.html" title="3rd Battalion 7th Marines">3rd Battalion 7th Marines</a> in October 1951 in Operation Bumblebee.</p>
<p>In addition, the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_6c52.html" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> had their first combat test of the <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piasecki_H-21_b005.html" title="Piasecki H-21">Piasecki H-21</a> helicopter in Korea. It was unofficially called the "Flying Banana" because of its banana-like appearance.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/a/m/James_M._Gavin_bd36.html" title="James M. Gavin">General James Gavin</a>, the famous U.S. Army airborne officer wrote "Cavalry, and I Don't Mean Horses" in <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harper%27s_Magazine_7616.html" title="Harper's Magazine">Harper's</a></i>, April 1954. This article was influential in getting the U.S. Army to start considering airmobile type operations, but the Army was held back by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">U.S. Air Force</a>, which thought that it should control all aircraft including helicopters that would be used to support the Army.</p>
<p>Helicopter use in <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Indochina_War_8f40.html" title="First Indochina War">Indochina</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Africa_6a9e.html" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, by the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Army_282d.html" title="French Army">French Army</a> was limited in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> by the limited availability and capability of the helicopters of the time. Most application was in medical evacuation. However the utility of the helicopter was obvious to forward looking military planners.</p>
<p>An early attempt to apply air mobility to warfare was the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dien_Bien_Phu_bdfe.html" title="Battle of Dien Bien Phu">Battle of Dien Bien Phu</a> in 1954. French military leaders believed that they could resupply the garrison there by air indefinitely. However, the air technology available, the means in which it was applied, and the terrain and geography led to failure.</p>
<p>The French Army subsequently gained a lot of valuable experience during the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algerian_War_7cbc.html" title="Algerian War">Algerian War</a> between 1954 and 1962. The French used American helicopters for what was termed "Aeromobilité". The first air assault operations were small, but quickly grew in size and scope to full battalion sized actions. <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Army_Light_Aviation_a98a.html" title="French Army Light Aviation">French Army Light Aviation</a> (<i>Aviation Legère Armee de Terre</i>, ALAT) helicopters were used as flying command posts, equipped with radios and to carry troops directly into battle. Helicopters were also used to supply units in the field and outposts.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_5.html" title="November 5">November 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Marines_5256.html" title="Royal Marines">Royal Marines</a>' <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_No._45_Commando_3e74.html" title="British No. 45 Commando">45 Commando</a> performed the first combat amphibious helicopter assault as part of <a href="../../../s/u/e/Suez_Crisis_2713.html" title="Suez Crisis">Operation Musketeer</a>, in <a href="../../../s/u/e/Suez.html" title="Suez">Suez</a>, <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>.

<p>In 1956 the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">U.S. Navy</a> modified and recommissioned the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Thetis_Bay_%28CVE-90%29_b37a.html" title="USS Thetis Bay (CVE-90)">USS <i>Thetis Bay</i></a>, a WWII <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escort_aircraft_carrier.html" title="Escort aircraft carrier">escort carrier</a>, as an Assault Helicopter Aircraft Carrier (CVHA-1). It was the first ship purposely modified for air assault operations. The Marines started receiving their much-used Sikorsky <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikorsky_H-34_875f.html" title="Sikorsky H-34">HUS</a> helicopters in 1957. They would be redesignated as <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikorsky_H-34_875f.html" title="Sikorsky H-34">UH-34s</a> in 1962.

<p>U.S. Army <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piasecki_H-21_b005.html" title="Piasecki H-21">CH-21</a> helicopter transports arrived in Vietnam on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_11.html" title="December 11">11 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>. Air assault operations using <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_the_Republic_of_Vietnam_d129.html" title="Army of the Republic of Vietnam">South Vietnamese</a> (ARVN) troops began 12 days later in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Chopper_cfa3.html" title="Operation Chopper">Operation Chopper</a>. These were very successful at first but the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viet_Cong_04da.html" title="Viet Cong">Viet Cong</a> (VC) began developing counter helicopter techniques and at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ap_Bac_aa65.html" title="Battle of Ap Bac">Ap Bac</a> on February 1962, 14 of 15 helicopters were hit and four shot down. The Army began adding machine guns and rockets to their smaller <a href="../../../u/h/-/UH-1_Iroquois_3dd5.html" title="UH-1 Iroquois">UH-1 Huey</a> helicopters and developed the first purpose built <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicopter_gunship.html" title="Helicopter gunship">gunship</a>, the UH-1B with the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Helicopter_Armament_Subsystems_f984.html" title="U.S. Helicopter Armament Subsystems">M-6E3 armament system</a>.</p>
<p>U.S. Marine helicopter squadrons began four month rotations through Vietnam as part of Operation SHUFLY on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_15.html" title="April 15">15 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>. Six days later, they performed the first helicopter assault using U.S. Marine helicopters and ARVN troops. After April 1963 as losses began to mount, U.S. Army UH-1 Huey gunships escorted the Marine transports. The VC again used effective counter landing techniques and in Operation Sure Wind 202 on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_27.html" title="April 27">27 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, 17 of 21 helicopters were hit and three shot down.</p>

VC losses were 614 killed, Marine losses were 45 KIA and 203 WIA.</p>
<p>The need for a new type of unit became apparent to the Tactical Mobility Requirements (Howze) Board of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">U.S. Army</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> when they saw a new kind of war heading their way. The Army saw that <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> was varied in <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrain.html" title="Terrain">terrain</a>, having jungles, mountains, and rivers, making ground movement very difficult. To circumvent this problem, they developed the idea to use helicopters to move troops in and out and around a battlefield area, carry out the wounded, and drop off supplies.</p>
<p>Initially a new experimental unit was formed, the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._11th_Air_Assault_Division_cd85.html" title="U.S. 11th Air Assault Division">11th Air Assault Division</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_11.html" title="February 11">11 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, combining light infantry with integral helicopter transport and air support. Following training and testing, the unit was activated for Vietnam service with the designation <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_Cavalry_Division_%28United_States%29_3d21.html" title="1st Cavalry Division (United States)">1st Air Cavalry Division</a>, continuing the tradition of the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_Cavalry_Division_%28United_States%29_3d21.html" title="1st Cavalry Division (United States)">1st Cavalry Division</a>.</p>
<p>The first unit of the new division to see action was the 1st Battalion/<a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._7th_Cavalry_Regiment_1035.html" title="U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment">U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment</a>, led by <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Colonel_7041.html" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_Moore_355d.html" title="Hal Moore">Harold G. Moore</a>, an old army paratrooper. The 7th Cavalry was the same regiment that Custer had commanded at the ill fated <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Little_Bighorn_ac5f.html" title="Battle of the Little Bighorn">Battle of the Little Bighorn</a>. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">November 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, he led his troops in the first large unit engagement of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> Vietnam War, which took place near the Chu Pong <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massif.html" title="Massif">massif</a> near the Vietnam-<a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambodia.html" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> border. It is known today as the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ia_Drang_Valley_df63.html" title="Battle of Ia Drang Valley">Battle of Ia Drang Valley</a>.</p>
<p>This unit gave common currency to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> term <b>Air Cavalry</b>. Units of this type may also be referred to as <b>Airmobile</b> or with other terms that describe the integration of air and ground combat forces within a single unit.</p>

<p>In the United States military, the air assault mission is now the primary role of the <a href="../../../1/0/1/101st_Airborne_Division_bd51.html" title="101st Airborne Division">101st Airborne Division</a>. This unit is the Army's only division-sized helicopter-borne fighting force. Many of its soldiers are graduates of the Air Assault course qualifying them to insert and extract using fast rope and rappel means from a hover in addition to the ordinary walk on and off from an airlanded helicopter.</p>
<p>All U.S. Marine Corps ground units are trained in only basic air assault tactics and capable of performing heliborne operations that only require them to walk off the airlanded helicopter.</p>
<p>Since 101st has relinquished its parachute capability, the <a href="../../../8/2/n/82nd_Airborne_Division_9932.html" title="82nd Airborne Division">82nd Airborne Division</a> is the United States Army's remaining parachute division.</p>
<p>There are other major "conventional" units in the United States Army that have parachute capabilities; the <a href="../../../1/7/3/173rd_Airborne_Brigade_dd50.html" title="173rd Airborne Brigade">173rd Airborne Brigade</a>, based in Italy and the 4th Brigade of the <a href="../../../2/5/t/25th_Infantry_Division_%28United_States%29_cd27.html" title="25th Infantry Division (United States)">25th Infantry Division</a> in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>. The former unit parachuted into Northern <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> during <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Iraqi_Freedom_da17.html" title="Operation Iraqi Freedom">Operation Iraqi Freedom</a> in 2003. These units are considered regional quick reaction parachute forces for the Pacific and Atlantic regions.</p>
