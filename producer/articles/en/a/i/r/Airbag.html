<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbag.html" title="Edit section: Invention">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Invention</span></h3>
<p>The airbag was invented by John W. Hetrick of Newport, PA, U.S. in 1952 and he patented the device the following year. Hetrick came up with the idea to help protect his own family using expertise from his naval engineering days. There have been devices similar to airbags for <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed-wing_aircraft.html" title="Fixed-wing aircraft">airplanes</a> as early as the 1940s, with the first patents filed in the 1950s. Early air bag system origins traces back to air filled bladders. These systems were large and bulky, and primarily consisted of compressed or heated air, compressed nitrogen gas (N2), freon, carbon dioxide (CO2), or a mixture of water and potasium (KH2O). <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The American inventor Allen Breed then developed a key component for automotive use - the ball-in-tube sensor for crash detection. He marketed this innovation first in 1967 to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrysler.html" title="Chrysler">Chrysler</a>.</p>

<p>The device was briefly available in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> in the mid-1970's.</p>
<p>During this era, Americans were infrequent users of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seat_belts.html" title="Seat belts">seat belts</a> and a means of offering seat belt-like levels of occupant protection to unbelted occupants in a head-on collision was felt to be a valuable innovation.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford</a> built an experimental fleet of cars with airbags in 1971. General Motors followed with a fleet of 1,000 experimental vehicles in 1973, and these Chevrolet cars equipped with dual airbags were sold to the public through GM dealers two years later. GM called this the Air Cushion Restraint System.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> In the seventies GM cars had two-stage deployment similar to newer air bags.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The design is conceptually simple—<a href="../../../a/c/c/Accelerometers.html" title="Accelerometers">accelerometers</a> trigger the ignition of a <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_generator.html" title="Gas generator">gas generator</a> propellant to very rapidly inflate a <a href="../../../n/y/l/Nylon.html" title="Nylon">nylon</a> fabric bag, which reduces the deceleration experienced by the passenger as they come to a stop in the crash situation. The bag has small vent holes to allow the propellant gas to be (relatively) slowly expelled from the bag as the occupant pushes against it.</p>
<p>Before these Chevrolets were sold, airbags were made available to the public in November 1973 when General Motors began offering dual airbags as an extra-cost option on several 1974 model full size cars made by the Buick, Cadillac and Oldsmobile divisions. This system was known as the Air Cushion Restraint System.</p>
<p>The market did not appear to reward this innovation. Airbags were first implemented by GM and Ford in low-volume production (in approximately 12,000 automobiles in the 1973-76 era), then abandoned by GM and Ford. The passenger side airbag on 1970s cars was located in the lower part of the dashpad and it also acted as a knee restraint.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> The lower part of the dash on the driver side was also different on cars with air bags as it was padded.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 1970s fleet of 10,000 airbag-equipped GM experienced seven fatalities. One is now suspected to have been caused by the airbag. The crash severity was only moderate and at the time a heart attack was suspected. The victim was cremated without autopsy.</p>
<p>About 12,000 vehicles with an Airbag were produced by GM and Ford from 1973 to 1976. In 1976, production stopped.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The standard shoulder belts were actually removed on these cars, as they were designed to replace seat belts.</p>
<p>Although they were marketed as a seat belt replacement, the airbag cannot actually perform this function - occupants can be hurt from any sudden body movement within the vehicle during a crash.</p>
<p>Front air bags are not designed to deploy in side impact, rear impact or rollover crashes. Since air bags deploy only once and deflate quickly after the initial impact, they will not be beneficial during a subsequent collision. Safety belts help reduce the risk of injury in many types of crashes. They help to properly position occupants to maximize the air bag's benefits and they help restrain occupants during the initial and any following collisions.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbag.html" title="Edit section: Rebirth: supplemental restraint">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rebirth: supplemental restraint</span></h3>
<p>Car designers have moved on from the initial view of the airbag as a <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seat_belt.html" title="Seat belt">seat belt</a> replacement. Automobile airbags are now designed and sold as <b>S</b>upplemental <b>R</b>estraint <b>S</b>ystems (<b>SRS</b>).</p>
<p>In 1980, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercedes-Benz_be95.html" title="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> re-introduced the airbag in Germany as an option on its high end <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercedes-Benz_W126_715b.html" title="Mercedes-Benz W126">S-Class (W126)</a>, which also offered such other exotic options as <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydropneumatic_suspension.html" title="Hydropneumatic suspension">hydropneumatic suspension</a>. In the Mercedes system, the sensors would tighten the seat belts and then deploy the airbag on impact. The airbag was thus no longer marketed as a means of avoiding seat belts, but as a way to obtain an extra margin of occupant safety.</p>
<p>In 1987 the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porsche.html" title="Porsche">Porsche</a> 944 turbo became the first car in the world to have driver and passenger airbags as standard equipment. The <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porsche_944.html" title="Porsche 944">Porsche 944</a> and 944S had this as an available option. This year also saw the first airbag in a Japanese car, the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honda_Legend_4156.html" title="Honda Legend">Honda Legend</a>.</p>
<p>Airbags became common in the 1980s, with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrysler.html" title="Chrysler">Chrysler</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford</a> introducing them in the mid-1980s; the former made them standard equipment across its entire line in 1990.</p>

Side Airbag</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As they gain experience, automakers have created new forms of airbags, like the <i>side curtain airbag</i> to protect occupants in side impact crashes.</p>
<p>The Swedish company Autoliv AB, today <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autoliv.html" title="Autoliv">Autoliv</a>, was granted a patent on side airbags, and torso side protection airbags were first offered as an option on the 1995 model year <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volvo_850.html" title="Volvo 850">Volvo 850</a>. Head protection system airbags were included as standard equipment in the 1998 <a href="../../../b/m/w/BMW_E38_8c91.html" title="BMW E38">BMW 7-series</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006, <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honda.html" title="Honda">Honda</a> introduced the first <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorcycle.html" title="Motorcycle">motorcycle</a> airbag safety system ever installed on a production motorcycle. The airbag was installed on its <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Wing_7ff7.html" title="Gold Wing">Gold Wing</a> motorcycle.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbag.html" title="Edit section: Benefits">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Benefits</span></h2>
<p>Air bags supplement the <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safety_belt.html" title="Safety belt">safety belt</a> by reducing the chance that the occupant's head and upper body will strike same part of the vehicle's interior. They also help reduce the risk of serious injury by distributing crash forces more evenly across the occupant's body.</p>
<p>"One recent study concluded that as many as 6,000 lives have been saved as a result of airbags."<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, the exact number of lives saved is almost impossible to calculate.</p>
<p><a name="Costs" id="Costs"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbag.html" title="Edit section: Costs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Costs</span></h2>
<p>Airbags cost about $500 (USD) per vehicle from <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_equipment_manufacturer.html" title="Original equipment manufacturer">OEMs</a>, who typically pay the supplier less than $100. If they are deployed in error or stolen, the registered vehicle owner is required to repurchase them. Since they are an integral part of the vehicle design, it is not possible to retrofit airbags to a vehicle that does not have them, with one exception. In the early 90's Breed Technologies of Lakeland Fl, offered a retro driver side system, the SRS-40. These were offered for seven of the top selling vehicles of the time.</p>
<p>The SRS-40 was a supplemental restraint system. It used a smaller bag, similar to the ones Breed sold in Europe to Fiat and Alfa. Smaller bags were used in Europe, because of the almost 100% usage of seat belts. The smaller bag protected the head and face only.</p>
<p>The SRS-40 system used the same sensor as the early 90's Jeep Cherokee. When the vehicle exceeded a preset negative acceleration threshold for a specific length of time, the sensor released two firing pins, initiating the deployment. This simple all mechanical system eliminated the need for any electrical connections. Sensor calibration was changed from vehicle to vehicle to allow for the structural differences. The kits supplied by Breed included a new <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steering_wheel.html" title="Steering wheel">steering wheel</a>.</p>
<p>Most manufacturers specify the replacement of undeployed airbags after, for example, 14 years (Volkswagen cars) to ensure their reliability in an accident. Or there may be a notice to inspect after 10 years (Honda cars). If the car is still on the road at this age, it would generally cost far more than the vehicle's market value to have the airbags replaced. However, in rare instances, spare airbags for older vehicles can be bought online from services like <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">eBay</a> for a reasonable price. Self-installation is a way to save hundreds of dollars in replacement.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbag.html" title="Edit section: Airbag injuries and fatalities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Airbag injuries and fatalities</span></h2>
<p>Airbags involve the extremely rapid deployment of a large cushion. While airbags can protect a person under the right circumstances, they can also injure or kill.</p>
<p>To protect occupants not wearing <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seat_belt.html" title="Seat belt">seat belts</a>, US airbag designs trigger much more quickly than airbags designed in other countries. As seat belt use in the US climbed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, US auto manufactures were able to adjust their designs. Today all airbag control units recognize if a belt is used and set the trigger time accordingly.</p>
<p>Newer airbags trigger at a lesser speed; nonetheless, passengers must remain at least 25 centimeters (10 in) from the bag to avoid injury from the bag in a crash.</p>
<p>Injuries such as abrasion of the skin, hearing damage (from the sound during deployment), head injuries, eye damage for spectacle wearers and breaking the nose, fingers, hands or arms can occur as the airbag deploys.</p>
<p>In 1990, the first automotive fatality attributed to an airbag was reported, with deaths peaking in 1997 at 53 in the United States. <a href="../../../t/r/w/TRW_765c.html" title="TRW">TRW</a> produced the first gas-inflated airbag in 1994, with sensors and low-inflation-force bags becoming common soon afterwards. Dual-depth airbags appeared on passenger cars in 2005. By that time, deaths related to airbags had declined, with no adults deaths and 2 child deaths attributed to airbags that year. Injuries remain fairly common in accidents with an airbag deployment.</p>
<p>Smoking a <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoking_pipe.html" title="Smoking pipe">pipe</a> should be avoided while driving. If the airbag inflates and hits the pipe, it is likely to be fatal, even if the crash is moderate.</p>
<p>The increasing use of airbags has actually made rescue work for <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefighter.html" title="Firefighter">Firefighters</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_medical_service.html" title="Emergency medical service">EMS</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">Police</a> Officers more dangerous. Airbags can detonate long after the initial crash, injuring or even killing rescue workers who are inside the car. The addition of side impact airbags to the frame of the car has reduced the number of places that rescue workers can use <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydraulic_spreader-cutter.html" title="Hydraulic spreader-cutter">hydraulic spreader-cutters</a> ("the jaws of life") or other similar cutting tools to remove the car roof, or doors safely. Every first responder should be properly trained on how to safely deactivate airbags or be aware of the potential hazards. Removing the car battery may be a good precaution.</p>

Airbag system</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Air bags are typically designed to deploy in frontal and near-frontal collisions, which are comparable to hitting a solid barrier at approximately 8 to 14 miles per hour (mph) (13 to 23 km/h). Roughly speaking, a 14 mph (23 km/h) barrier collision is equivalent to striking a parked car of similar size across the full front of each vehicle at about 28 mph (45 km/h). This is because the parked car absorbs some of the energy of the crash, and is pushed by the striking vehicle. Unlike <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crash_test.html" title="Crash test">crash tests</a> into barriers, real-world crashes typically occur at angles, and the crash forces usually are not evenly distributed across the front of the vehicle. Consequently, the relative speed between a striking and struck vehicle required to deploy the air bag in a real-world crash can be much higher than an equivalent barrier crash.</p>
<p>Because air bag sensors measure deceleration, vehicle speed and damage are not good indicators of whether an air bag should have deployed. Occasionally, air bags can deploy due to the vehicle's undercarriage violently striking a low object protruding above the roadway surface. Despite the lack of visible front-end damage, high deceleration forces may occur in this type of crash, resulting in the deployment of the air bag.</p>
<p>The airbag sensor is a <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microelectromechanical_systems.html" title="Microelectromechanical systems">MEMS</a> <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accelerometer.html" title="Accelerometer">accelerometer</a>, which is a small <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrated_circuit.html" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuit</a> chip with integrated micromechanical elements. The microscopic mechanical element moves in response to rapid deceleration, and this motion causes a change in capacitance, which is detected by the electronics on the chip, which then sends a signal to fire the airbag. The most common MEMS accelerometer in use is the ADXL-50 by <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_Devices_abd3.html" title="Analog Devices">Analog Devices</a>, but there are other MEMS manufacturers as well.</p>
<p>There was some work initially in mercury switches but they did not work very well. Before MEMS, the primary system used to deploy airbags was called a "<a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolamite.html" title="Rolamite">rolamite</a>". A rolamite is a mechanical device, consisting of a roller suspended within a tensioned band. As a result of the particular geometry and material properties used, the roller is free to translate with very little <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friction.html" title="Friction">friction</a> or <a href="../../../h/y/s/Hysteresis.html" title="Hysteresis">hysteresis</a>. This device was developed at Sandia National Laboratories. The rolamite and similar macro-mechanical devices were used in air bags until the mid-1990s when they were universally replaced with MEMS.</p>
<p>Most air bags are designed to automatically deploy in the event of a vehicle fire when temperatures reach 300 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (150 to 200 °C). This safety feature helps to ensure that such temperatures do not cause an explosion of the inflator unit within the air bag module.</p>
<p>Today, airbag triggering <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algorithms.html" title="Algorithms">algorithms</a> are becoming much more complex. They try to reduce useless deployments (for example, at low speed, no shocks should trigger the airbag to help reduce damage to the car interior in conditions where the seat belt would be an adequate safety device) and to adapt the deployment speed to the crash conditions. The algorithms are considered as very valuable <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellectual_property.html" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a>. Experimental algorithms may take into account such factors as the weight of the occupant, the seat location, seatbelt use, and even attempt to determine if a <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_seat.html" title="Baby seat">baby seat</a> is present.</p>
<p>When there is a moderate to severe frontal crash that requires the frontal air bag to deploy, a signal is sent to the <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_generator.html" title="Gas generator">inflator unit</a> within the air bag module. An igniter starts a rapid <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_reaction.html" title="Chemical reaction">chemical reaction</a> generating primarily <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrogen.html" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> gas (N<sub>2</sub>) to fill the air bag making it deploy through the module cover. Some air bag technologies use compressed <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrogen.html" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argon.html" title="Argon">argon</a> gas with a pyrotechnic operated valve ("hybrid gas generator"), while other technologies use various energetic <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propellant.html" title="Propellant">propellants</a>. Propellants containing <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodium_azide.html" title="Sodium azide">sodium azide</a> (NaN<sub>3</sub>) were very common in early inflator designs. However, propellants containing sodium azide were widely phased out during the 1990s in pursuit of more efficient, less expensive and less toxic alternatives.</p>
<p>The azide-containing pyrotechnic gas generators contain a substantial amount of the propellant. The driver-side airbag may contain a canister which is two inches in diameter, 1.5 inches long, and contains about 50 grams of sodium azide. The passenger side container is six inches long and contains 200 grams of sodium azide.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> The incomplete combustion of the charge due to rapid cooling leads to production of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_monoxide.html" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrogen%28II%29_oxide_1791.html" title="Nitrogen(II) oxide">nitrogen(II) oxide</a> as reaction byproducts.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The alternative propellants may incorporate eg. a combination of <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitroguanidine.html" title="Nitroguanidine">nitroguanidine</a>, phase-stabilized <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonium_nitrate.html" title="Ammonium nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a> or other nonmetallic oxidizer, and a nitrogen-rich fuel different than azide (eg. <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetrazole.html" title="Tetrazole">tetrazoles</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triazole.html" title="Triazole">triazoles</a>, and their salts). The burn rate modifiers in the mixture may be an alkaline metal <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrate.html" title="Nitrate">nitrate</a> or <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrite.html" title="Nitrite">nitrite</a>, dicyanamide or its salts, <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodium_borohydride.html" title="Sodium borohydride">sodium borohydride</a>, etc. The coolants and <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slag.html" title="Slag">slag</a> formers may be eg. <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay.html" title="Clay">clay</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silica.html" title="Silica">silica</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/u/Alumina.html" title="Alumina">alumina</a>, glass, etc.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> Other alternatives are eg. <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrocellulose.html" title="Nitrocellulose">nitrocellulose</a> based <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipropellant.html" title="Bipropellant">bipropellants</a> (which have high gas yield but bad storage stability, and their <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen_balance.html" title="Oxygen balance">oxygen balance</a> requires secondary oxidation of the reaction products to avoid buildup of carbon monoxide), or high-oxygen nitrogen-free organic compounds with inorganic oxidizers (eg. di or tri<a href="../../../c/a/r/Carboxylic_acid.html" title="Carboxylic acid">carboxylic acids</a> with <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chlorate.html" title="Chlorate">chlorates</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perchlorate.html" title="Perchlorate">perchlorates</a> and eventually metallic oxides; the nitrogen-free formulation avoids formation of toxic <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrogen_oxide.html" title="Nitrogen oxide">nitrogen oxides</a>).</p>
<p>From the onset of the crash, the entire deployment and inflation process is faster than the blink of an eye. Airbags deploy in 0.05 second. Because a vehicle changes speed so fast in a crash, air bags must inflate rapidly if they are to help reduce the risk of the occupant hitting the vehicle's interior.</p>
<p>Once an air bag deploys, deflation begins immediately as the gas escapes through vents in the fabric. Deployment is frequently accompanied by the release of dust-like particles in the vehicle's interior. Most of this dust consists of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornstarch.html" title="Cornstarch">cornstarch</a> or <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talcum_powder.html" title="Talcum powder">talcum powder</a>, which are used to lubricate the air bag during deployment. In older designs, small amounts of <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodium_hydroxide.html" title="Sodium hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a> may initially be present. This chemical can cause minor irritation to the eyes and/or open wounds; however, with exposure to air, it quickly turns into <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodium_bicarbonate.html" title="Sodium bicarbonate">sodium bicarbonate</a> (baking soda). Depending on the type of air bag system, <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potassium_chloride.html" title="Potassium chloride">potassium chloride</a> (a table salt substitute) may also be present.</p>
<p>For most people, the only effect the dust may produce is some minor irritation of the throat and eyes. Generally, minor irritations only occur when the occupant remains in the vehicle for many minutes with the windows closed and no ventilation. However, some people with <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthma</a> may develop an asthmatic attack from inhaling the dust. With the onset of symptoms, asthmatics should treat themselves as advised by their doctor, then immediately seek medical treatment.</p>
<p>Some airbags in certain car models deploy twice, for two crashes; it first deploys and deflates and may re-inflate.</p>
<p>Air bags must inflate very rapidly to be effective, and therefore come out of the steering wheel hub or instrument panel with considerable force, generally at a speed of about 220 mph. Because of this initial force, contact with a deploying air bag may cause injury. These air bag contact injuries, when they occur, are typically very minor abrasions or burns. The sound of air bag deployment is very loud, in the range of 165 to 175 <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decibel.html" title="Decibel">decibels</a> for 0.1 second. Hearing damage can result in some cases.</p>
<p>More serious injuries are rare; however, serious or even fatal injuries can occur when someone is very close to, or in direct contact with an air bag module when the air bag deploys. Such injuries may be sustained by unconscious drivers who are slumped over the steering wheel, unrestrained or improperly restrained occupants who slide forward in the seat during pre-crash braking, and even properly restrained drivers who sit very close to the steering wheel. Objects must never be attached to an air bag module or placed loose on or near an air bag module, since they can be propelled with great force by a deploying air bag, potentially causing serious injuries.</p>
<p>An unrestrained or improperly restrained occupant can be seriously injured or killed by a deploying air bag. The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration_d6fc.html" title="National Highway Traffic Safety Administration">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) recommends drivers sit with at least 10 inches (254 mm) between the center of their <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breastbone.html" title="Breastbone">breastbone</a> and the center of the steering wheel. Children under 12 should always be properly restrained in a rear seat. A rear-facing infant restraint must never be put in the front seat of a vehicle with a front passenger air bag. A rear-facing infant restraint places an infant's head close to the air bag module, which can cause severe <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_injury.html" title="Head injury">head injuries</a> or death if the air bag deploys. Modern cars include a switch to turn off the airbag system of the passenger seat, in which case a child-supporting seat must be installed.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbag.html" title="Edit section: Advanced airbag design">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Advanced airbag design</span></h2>
<p>Many advanced air bag technologies are being developed to tailor air bag deployment to the severity of the crash, the size and posture of the vehicle occupant, belt usage and how close that person is to the air bag module. Many of these systems will use multi-stage inflators that deploy less forcefully in stages in moderate crashes than in very severe crashes. Occupant sensing devices let the air bag diagnostic unit know if someone is occupying a seat in front of an air bag, whether the person is an adult or a child, whether a seat belt or child restraint is being used and whether the person is forward in the seat and close to the air bag module. Based on this information and crash severity information, the air bag is deployed at either a high force level, a less forceful level or not at all.</p>
<p>Many new vehicles are also equipped with side air bags. While there are several types of side air bags, all are designed to reduce the risk of injury in moderate to severe side impact crashes. These air bags are generally located in the outboard edge of the seat back, in the door or in the roof rail above the door.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citro%C3%ABn_C4_3035.html" title="Citroën C4">Citroën C4</a> provides the first "shaped" driver airbag - made possible by this car's innovative fixed hub steering wheel.</p>
<p>Seat and door-mounted air bags all provide upper body protection. Some also extend upwards to provide head protection. Two types of side air bags, known as inflatable tubular structures and inflatable curtains, are specifically designed to reduce the risk of head injury and/or help keep the head and upper body inside the vehicle. A few vehicles are now being equipped with a different type of inflatable curtain designed to help reduce injury and ejection from the vehicle in rollover crashes.</p>
