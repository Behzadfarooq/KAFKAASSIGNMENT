<p>Air Taxi and Air Charter, while seemingly similar today are about as different as a "limousine" vs. "a taxi".. while there is little cost differential there is a class / perception differential. I am one of the original authors of these pages and consequently thought of setting them up separately, but I am not totally against combining into one page if need be. The future (most likely) will see Air Taxi evolve into a real model for a real business, while air charter (for the most part) today is simply a management industry for the aircraft that belong to corporations / wealthy. <a href="../../../a/i/r/User%7EAirwebster_cf36.html" title="User:Airwebster">airwebster</a> 11:56, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The FAA sees no difference between Air Taxi and Air Charter (a term popularized by Fred Gevalt at the Air Charter Guide.) If this is a factual definition, not a marketing piece, my vote is to merge the two articles together <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrivate_Jet_Charter_0d22.html" title="User:Private Jet Charter">Private_Jet_Charter</a></p>
<p>It is my experience that Air Taxi services are akin to a small airline; a customer pays for a one-way or round-trip fare to his/her destination. Multiple customers with multiple destinations may occupy the aircraft during a single 'flight' with multiple drop-off/pick-up points along the way, much like sharing a cab ride. An Air Charter service rents an entire aircraft to a group of people who have a common destination and may have ongoing contracts with companies or individuals. It's much like the difference between taking the city-bus or taking a limousine. -Blaine</p>
<p>The comment above comparing Air Taxi and Air Charter to taxi's and limo's is spot on. For Air Charter one person/company charters a plane and decides where and when it goes, on the other hand Air Taxis are planned to run regular routes and may have several passengers on board who have no connection to each other. Air Taxi's are hardly a reality at the moment and are waiting for more VLJ's to come into service (due in 2007). I'd suggest keeping them separate for the moment until the reality of Air Taxi's becomes clear.Ncop 00:46, 12 December 2006 (UTC)ncop</p>

<b>Difference between Charter Flights and Air Charter.</b></p>
<p>The term charter flights generally refers to flights and seats on large jets such as those produced by Boeing or Airbus, and is usually a cheap way for individuals to fly on a set route at a set time. Usually the company owning the aircraft charters the plane to another company that then decides on the route and the flight time and sells tickets to the public - either as part of a package or as "seat-only". The aircraft are normally very cramped since it's in the charter companies interest to pack in as many customers as possible, and they are known as a cheap way to fly.</p>
<p>In contrast, air charter (or jet charter or aircraft charter) typically (but not necessariy) involves smaller planes, where one individual, or one group or company wants to use the whole plane for a very specific flight at a time of their choosing eg to fly executives to a meeting, or a professional sports team to a game. The aircraft are much more spacious, they can be ready at a few hours notice and this is a much more expensive way to fly.Ncop 02:56, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just to continue the discussion, <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrivate_Jet_Charter_0d22.html" title="User:Private Jet Charter">Private_Jet_Charter</a> brings up a valid point where air taxi and air charter are distinguished.. the FAA sees no difference, yet they may evolve differently. Also, it is critical to educate the public that the "private air charter" industry is not so much an industry, rather more a series of managed aircraft that don't earn their keep - they simply "lose less" money when they are put to work under air charter companies operating authority. All of this discussion should go on the "air charter" (as in "private air charter") page that was distinguished from the "public air charter" page. There is the common public confusion with charter meaning "cheap" when they think of a large charter airline, such as Air Transat, Sky Service or Pace Airlines (the folks that flew as "Hooters Air") - so there really are three elements (and pages) in my opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li>a) a page dedicated to <b>public air charter</b> and why it is so cheap (how it works economically)</li>
<li>b) a page about <b>air charter and the VIP / expensive world</b> that <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrivate_Jet_Charter_0d22.html" title="User:Private Jet Charter">Private_Jet_Charter</a> has agreed is not so much a business, rather really very good baby sitting for jets owned by private individuals or corporations</li>
<li>c) a page that discusses <b>air taxi and all the excitement</b> (real or imagined) about the new opportunity to make small airplanes affordable - this may have to be a business if only because it will have no wealthy patrons</li>
</ul>
<p>That really is what is most needed, in my opinion, as it would serve as the best / most objective viewpoint of the three major different types of transportation - with the fourth already handled probably very well at the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline.html" title="Airline">Airline</a> page.<a href="../../../a/i/r/User%7EAirwebster_cf36.html" title="User:Airwebster">airwebster</a></p>
