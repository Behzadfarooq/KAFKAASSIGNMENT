<p>A previous author had added a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_dispute" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_dispute" rel="nofollow">NPOV tag</a> but there was no previous discussion on NPOV here on the talk page.</p>
<p>"The above label is meant to indicate that a discussion is ongoing, and hence that the article contents are disputed and volatile. If you add the above code to an article which seems to be biased to you, but there is no prior discussion of the bias, you need to at least leave a note on the article's talk page describing what you consider unacceptable about the article."</p>
<p>So if there's something unnaceptable on this article let's bring it up and change the wording to something better, rather than just flagging a whole section without mentioning anything specific. As far as I can tell there are citations to back up any statements made in the "What the Canadian Government Knew" section.</p>
<p>Jan 27</p>
<p>The previous author had quoted the deaths of over 10,000 in the riots following Gandhi's death. I've moved the decimal place over one and included a link to the BBC article on the subject. If there is another reliable source for that figure than let's include a refrence.</p>
<p>In the suspects area of the page, an author had placed in another refrence to the riots following Gandhis death. However being as we have already elaborated on the situation in the Punjab previously in the article it doesn't seem to make sense to mention it yet again and more importantly seems to condone those statements he made.</p>
<p>Other than those two edits I've also added links to the BBC's articles on the golden temple raid and the riots.</p>
<p>I believe it's important that this article does not fall victim to the many other Sikh articles on Wikipedia that are flagged for clean-up and NPOV, being as how this is page is number 4 on google's results for "air india flight 182". So if anyone is making changes to the content, let's please either note exactly what the content change is in the talk page, or at the very least make some mention of it in the Edit Summary.</p>
<p>July 27</p>
<p>Yes, that looks much better. I have combined the last two paragraphs on the authors, capitalized the title of the book, italicized the publication names, corrected the spelling of the book in the external link section, and fixed some comma splices-- no doubt just the result of the removal of the plagiarised clauses. Thanks for your help. -ALC</p>
<p>July 25th</p>
<p>I agree 100% with Aconnelly, also parts of the Indian government theory were taken from <a href="http://www.formac.ca/main_book.php?tabpage=authors&amp;id=481" class="external free" title="http://www.formac.ca/main_book.php?tabpage=authors&amp;id=481" rel="nofollow">http://www.formac.ca/main_book.php?tabpage=authors&amp;id=481</a>, the plagirized parts have been removed, and the section edited to seem less like a promotion of the book, also the link to the book's website was added to the external links section.</p>
<p>If anyone disagrees please state the objections here.</p>
<p>If not can we remove the bias?</p>
<p><a name="Bias" id="Bias"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Talk%7EAir_India_Flight_182_8521.html" title="Edit section: Bias">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bias</span></h2>
<p>The section on the 'Government of India' theory seems to be self-promotion. I have no issue with it being included, and I suppose there could be some need to state the credentials of journalists who have proposed a conspiracy theory that is outside of the mainstream, but do we need to know that Mr. McAndrew is originally from Niagara Falls? If no one objects, I think it ought to be cleaned up a bit. -ALC</p>
<p>March 18th Added more information on what was known before and after the bombing. Changed "bomb brothers" to something a little more descriptive. Changed the beginning to get to the point and removed some repeated information throughout.</p>
<p><br />
This page says "The bomb caused a rapid decompression, followed by a rapid decompression". Could someone who knows about planes please fix this?</p>
<hr />
<p>1. I know about planes. 2. Its a typo, not an "error of knowledge". I meant to say that na inflight breakup came after the decompression. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 21:25, 26 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm having trouble making sense of this article. Mr. Singh wanted his suitcase put on an entirely different flight than the one he was on? The article says he only had one suitcase, which exploded when the baggage handlers were transferring it to Flight 301, then the article says that Flight 182 disappeared with "a cackling sound" (was a terrorist laughing over the radio?) and then the article says that the suitcase "wound up on" Flight 182... the chronology of the article is confusing. And it says the attack was "led by Sikh nationalists" - how was this known? Did they claim responsibility, and how was it proven? And some victims really survived a fall of 31,000 feet?! It would really help if the article were clarified. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian Kendig</a> 16:42, 17 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>1. The cackling sound was the explosion, of course. 2. Mr. Singh never came on any flight, and neither did L. Singh. Two different people had two different suitcases. 3. I got the "survived the fall" thing from the CBC special report. 4. The CBC report includes information on how the Canadian government bungled the case and the pruported motives of the men accused of the bombing.</p>

<dd>It does no good to tell me all that HERE! Please clarify the article! (By 'cackling sound' you probably meant 'crackling sound,' right?) - <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian Kendig</a> 12:09, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<dd>In many cases, it does all the good telling you here; you didn't read carefully enough in some of the cases (esp. in the Mr. Singh case - You misread "Mr. Singh" and "L. Singh" as being one person) - Also, some of the issues were resolved before I replied but after you voiced your complaint. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 19:17, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Changed "the trial was marred by pre-trial motions ..." to "the trial was delayed by pre-trial motions." Providing due process is not a bad thing. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">LeeHunter</a> 13:41, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Why is there no reference to the book Soft Target detailing an investigation into the background to this event? The findings in Soft Target were (paraphrasing) that the Hindustan Government had some involvement in what happened, in an attempt to slander Sikhs in Canada.</p>
<p><br />
Looks like investigation is open again <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4963978.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4963978.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
