<p>Okay...so having been proven wrong on the F-14 page, you have to move here to spread your misinformation?</p>
<ul>
<li>The term "air superiority" was not in common usage prior to the Vietnam War; in fact the article originally states that it was first used to refer to the F-15.</li>
<li>Prior to the Vietnam War, fighters took specialized roles; the term "air superiority" was never used in any official context. Fighters were "escort fighter", "heavy fighter", "day(light) fighter", etc. We have in depth articles on that terminology and they were in common industry usage at the time.</li>
<li>The term "air superiority" was coined to describe an aircraft equally adept at WVR and BVR. As the RAND study indicates ... ONLY the F-15 out of the teen series was designed as an "air superiority" fighter. It explicitly indicates that the Navy did NOT want an "air superiority" fighter in the VFX, later the F-14.</li>
<li>It's been argued on the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-14.html" title="F-14">F-14</a> talk page whether or not the F-14 was designed to be maneuverable. Reliable sources say otherwise.</li>
<li>The F/A-18E is not a "lighter aircraft" - it is 25% larger than the C model hornet and currently serves the "high" part of the high/low mix on our carriers. It's not an upgrade of the Hornet (despite the naming bondoggle), but a wholly new airframe. It's actually a bit worse than the C Hornet in a turning fight due to its larger weight; but has a newer AESA radar and other interesting "goodies" that make it more potent in BVR.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>When (if?) the JSF comes online, all C model Hornet squadrons will be replaced with the JSF; the Super Hornet and JSF will continue to operate in a hi-low mix - the JSF is the "low" part of the mix.</dd>

<p>How does inclusion of the F-14 intertwined with the F-15 in the search for a generation of air superiority fighters not make it an air superiority fighter? How does the Navy's tasking of the F-18, which replaces the F-14, as an air superiority fighter make the F-14 not an air superiority fighter? How does the increase of wing area for agility make agility not a design goal? What we have here is a POV problem, and there are other ways about it than simply reverting good quality factual information. An short open source paper that omits the term "air superiority" does not the conclusion make, "the F-14 is not an air superiority fighter".</p>
<p>Entries by Mmx1 appear to be the only claims in print or the web that the F-14 is not, nor was intended to be an air superiority fighter. They are not verifiable elsewhere, and thus must be considered to be POV. Any attempt to find a link between the F-14 and air superiority or deliberate maneuverability has been excised from the WP by one or more individuals, a matter of grave and serious concern given the importance and significance of the F-14.</p>

<p>Starting a separate section since your formatting is difficult to sort through. The term is clouded because "air superiority" is also used to describe a mission, and in general use as a general adjective, one which the F-14 did take for most of its service history. That's why I've shied away from improving this article because sorting the offical from the colloquial use is a mess. But in the context of industry design, it's clear the term was never applied to the F-14, nor the F-16 and 18 as you claimed in your earlier edits. And it is explicitly clear that it was not designed as such. From the <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR939/MR939.ch5.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR939/MR939.ch5.pdf" rel="nofollow">Rand paper</a> you repeatedly miscite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the Air Force struggled to hammer out a consensus on performance requirements for an all–Air Force F-X, the Navy tactical fighter community, allied with Grumman, increasingly sought to cancel the F-111B program and replace it with a new R&amp;D effort for an all-Navy fighter <b>optimized for fleet air defense and uncompromised by requirements for the Air Force strike-attack or air-superiority missions.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That same month, the Navy sent out RFPs to industry for a new VFX fighter, developed <b>solely under Navy auspices and optimized for the fleet airdefense mission</b>.</p>

<p>This paper, written by a PhD-wielding defense analyst, would trump any other colloquial usage of the term "air superiority". --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 19:53, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmmm. Every source on the web mentions F-14 and air superiority in the same sentence. You do not seem to be able to find another source that says "F-14" and "not air superiority" in the same sentence. You do the math. Are you the one responsible for the complete absence of any link between the F-14 and maneuverability throughout the WP space? That's a pretty significant ommision.--<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">Wiarthurhu</a> 19:56, 27 June 2006 (UTC) As the Air Force struggled to hammer out a consensus on performance requirements for an all–Air Force F-X, the Navy tactical fighter community, allied with Grumman, increasingly sought to cancel the F-111B program and replace it with a new R&amp;D effort for an all-Navy fighter optimized for fleet air defense and uncompromised by requirements for the Air Force strike-attack or air-superiority missions.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"optimized for the fleet airdefense mission" does not mean "not air superiority", and your interpretation is contradicted by hundreds of web articles which evidently you'll need to go out and fix as well. Why don't you just drop this mission of trying to tell people that the F-14 is not and was not supposed to be an agile fighter and leave it at that?

<dd>Whoopee, you did a google search that indicated colloquial usage of the term. One of the links called the F-14 a strike fighter, too. Popularity does not determine accuracy; especially in a fan commentary-loaded area such as this. I've provided you with an industry analyst from the RAND corporation, with a PhD in European diplomatic and military history (actually which you provided but can't seem to read), who says that the F-14 was NOT developed under such auspices. Technically accurate trumps popular usage. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 20:05, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me lay it out. The reason I've been reluctant to work on this and similar articles is that there is a distinction between a <b>Mission</b> and <b>Classification</b>. An aircraft can perform many missions; even ones it's not designed for. But what determines its classification are its design considerations - the missions that influenced its design tradeoffs.</p>
<p>For example, the F-16 has taken many roles - anti-shipping, reconnaissance, ferry, strike, interdiction, CAS, etc. But it was designed as a light strike fighter and is characterized as such. Sending it out on a recon mission doesn't make it a reconnaissance plane all of a sudden, no more than sending it to ferry a pilot out to a unit makes it a passenger plane.</p>
<p>The RAND source irrefutably shows that the Navy designed the F-14 for fleet defense, and NOT air superiority, something that at the time was an Air Force concept the Navy wanted no part of. It took the role of "air superiority" (actually the mission nowadays is OCA, offensive counter-air) because it was the best fighter available for the job for many years. But it wasn't designed for that mission, specifically a subsonic turning fight. And any attempt to rewrite that is revisionism from people who've watched <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Gun_ad49.html" title="Top Gun">Top Gun</a> too many times. The F-14 excelled in the recon role it took over from the RA-5 Vigilante, as well as the CAS role it took in the 1990's as it faced irrelevance with the death of the Soviet threat. But that doesn't make it a recce bird or CAS bird. It was just used in a different role.</p>
<p>This article is about classifications, just as <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_fighter.html" title="Heavy fighter">heavy fighter</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escort_fighter.html" title="Escort fighter">escort fighter</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_fighter.html" title="Night fighter">night fighter</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/y/Day_fighter.html" title="Day fighter">day fighter</a> discuss classifications of fighters, not just aircraft that were sent out at night. Discussing missions is too broad and really not of particular interest as a general subject. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 20:24, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also note that Mmx1 has since conceded that all of the above is essentially incorrect as a result of mediation. The F-14 was a) designed for the maeuvering air superiority mission and b) as 1969 Flight International proves was first post F-4 fighter called an A/S fighter.

<dd>The F-14 was designed as a dogfighter first (VFAX). Including the Phoenix AWG-9 did not compromise this capability in any meaningful way. Other approaches such as the F-15 would see things differently, but that in no way affects Grummans design decisions.

<p>An article has been created defining this term, and subsequently nominated for deletion by purists who have identified him/themselves there.
