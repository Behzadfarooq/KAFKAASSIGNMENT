	    <p>The '<b>Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN)'</b> provides support for the operation, control and maintenance of a variety of DoD and some non­ DoD satellites. This involves continual execution of the tasks involved in TT&amp;C. In addition, the AFSCN provides prelaunch simulation, launch support and early orbit support while satellites are in initial or transfer orbits and require maneuvering to their final orbit. The AFSCN provides tracking data to help maintain the catalog of space objects and distributes various data such as satellite ephemeris, almanacs, and other information.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Satellite_Control_Network_eea2.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>The AFSCN consists of satellite control centers, tracking stations and test facilities located around the world. Mission Control Centers are located at the Consolidated Space Operations Center (CSOC) at Schriever Air Force Base near Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Onizuka Air Force Base, Sunnyvale, California. These centers are manned around the clock and are responsible for the command and control of their assigned satellite systems. The control centers are linked to remote tracking stations (RTS) around the world. Space vehicle checkout facilities are used to test launch vehicles and satellite platforms to insure that the onboard systems operate within specifications. The remote tracking stations provide the link between the satellite being controlled and the control center. A similar relationship exists for dedicated networks. Remote tracking stations around the world are needed to maintain frequent communications with the satellite. Without RTSs, the control centers would only be able to contact a satellite when it came into the control center's view. Some satellites, especially those in geostationary orbit, never come within view of their control center. Each antenna at an RTS is referred to as a "side". Side A is normally a 60-­foot diameter antenna which is best for TT&amp;C of a geosynchronous satellite because of the distance to the satellite and the fact that the large antenna does not need to move quickly to maintain contact with the satellite. Side B is either a 46-­foot or 33-­foot diameter antenna. These are commonly used for TT&amp;C of low earth orbit satellites which can move more quickly across the sky. These smaller antennas are more responsive and require less energy to control.</p>

<p>The Remote Tracking Stations are being modernized with the addition of the Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS). ARTSs provide more responsive support and reduce manpower required at each site because the antennas and supporting systems can be controlled by the Mission Control Centers. There are four ARTS installed at the following locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colorado Tracking Station at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado. It is used for support of various DoD satellites. Additional equipment has been installed to support the Global Positioning System satellites.</li>
<li>Thule Tracking Station at Thule Air Force Base, Greenland. The third "side" at Thule is an ARTS.</li>

<ul>
<li>Indian Ocean Station (IOS), <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mah%C3%A9%2C_Seychelles_fab8.html" title="Mahé, Seychelles">Mahe Island</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/y/Seychelles.html" title="Seychelles">Seychelles</a>; callsign INDI (closed in August 1996, after the government of the Seychelles attempted to "raise the rent" to more than $10 million/year). The Indian Ocean Tracking Station was located on Mahe in the Seychelle Islands. It only had only one 60 ­foot antenna. Its location was ideal for communicating with geosynchronous satellites over the Indian Ocean. The station was also geographically suited for acquiring realtime or near-realtime data from passes over areas to the north. In 1980, due to political instabilities of the island, the main processing computers were removed and relocated to Sunnyvale. These computers communicated with the IOS downlink and tracking equipment via a wideband (DSCS) communications link. IOS has been supplanted by Diego Garcia RTS.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Kodiak Tracking Station (KTS), <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodiak_Island_c616.html" title="Kodiak Island">Kodiak Island</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>; callsign BEAR (closed in 1975)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sunnyvale Control Station, callsign CUBE. Not a true tracking station, in that it had no direct downlink antenna. Instead, CUBE supported operations at TCS/Oakhangar and IOS/Seychelles, where main processing computers could not be located. CUBE had two 'sides', and so could support two satellite passes simultaneously.</li>
