<p>The article says: <i>"The film makes no attempt to explain a gaping <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plot_hole.html" title="Plot hole">plot hole</a>. One key character is discovered to be a traitor, but no explanation is given for his betrayal."</i> I dunno, though. Wasn't he a bad guy the whole time? If so, I don't see why the movie needs to explain it. It doesn't need to explain why Harrison Ford's character wanted to become president, or how he met his wife -- they ("they" meaning those points) are out of the scope of the story... --<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPeng_1a4a.html" title="User:Peng">Peng</a> 28 June 2005 03:57 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, he was the bad guy the whole time, and we don't discover it until near the end of the movie. He was still a traitor, however. He was on the President's cabinet, but betrayed him. Since he's the "bad guy," we kind of should be told what his motivation was. As it is, they just have him as the bad guy without any explanation for his motivation. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot"></a>— <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> June 28, 2005 20:44 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Erm.. we discover it right at the start of the movie: if we're talking about Xander Berkeley's character, he's the Secret Service agent that shot the other agents, and he wasn't on the President's cabinet either. Saying that, there wasn't any development of the character, but I wouldn't say it's a plot hole (I'd imagine that his motivation would be a big wad of cash, and that would make for a dull scene). One plot hole, however, is that he thought he could escape instead of the president and not be discovered: the wreckage would almost certainly be recovered (the President's body, state secrets, etc.) and they'd discover William H. Macy's body with big holes in it. He'd be "debriefed" extensively too, and I doubt any future president would trust him (as he says in his last line). There are a whole bunch of other holes to go with that one. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGid_a11a.html" title="User:Gid">Gid</a> 19:18, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the time Berkley's character shot Macy's it was clear that the plane was going to crash into the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caspian_Sea_ba60.html" title="Caspian Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. Recovering bodies would be dfficult if not impossible, and they would likely be mangled by the force of impact and partially eaten by marine life before they could be recovered. Besides, the plane already contained the bodies of several people who had been shot. How would anyone know that Macy hadn't been killed by a terrorist? All the witnesses to the shooting would have been dead if Berkley's character had gotten away instead of the president. The president's wife and daughter might report that they saw Macy alive at the end, but Berkeley could easily have said a terrorist had survived and, after the wife and daughter left, had managed to shoot Macy, the president and the airman who was trying to rescue him. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.232.225.113_fb60.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.232.225.113">4.232.225.113</a> (talk) 22:23, 3 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

An (of course subsonic) airliner dodges two AA missiles fired in it`s tail without any chaffs or flares! Yeah! 10 stars for realisticism! Petersen seems to have been really busy falling deep since Das Boot.</p>
<p>-Removed Trivia about Plot Hole, the Secret Service member was clearly bad from the start of the movie (i am watching it now). Additionally, chaffs were fired to avoid the missile, don't believe me, then watch the movie for once. --Massrepublican</p>
<dl>
<dd>I saw that part of the movie, but saw no chaffs. The aircraft rolled slightly and the missiles passed over it`s wings. The missiles approached the plane too slowly anyway (the differance in speeds should be 2 machs or so). And i remember the president taking commands to maneauver the plane to dodge the missile (and warning his familly to prepare for that).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Besides <i>chaffs</i> would have hardly done any good as they are used to confuse radar-guided missiles. The aircraft should have fired <i>flares</i> to confuse the missiles as they obviously flew close enough for their infra-red close-aproach guidance to start (or they could have been IR guidance-only missiles anyway). And I definitely saw no flares being fired, as their fireball appearance would have been easy to see especially as all of this was happening during a night.</dd>
</dl>
<p>--If you rewatch the movie it is quite obvious that flares are fired.</p>

<p>The practice of having "trivia" that is far removed from the subject of the article has poped it's ugly head in this article too. Just because the TV show <i>24</i> has some common cast members with this film is not particularily notable and doesn't deserve mention in an encyclopedia. The other trivia items are directly related to the film, like the aircraft and locations used for filming and what camera techniques were used. --<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerd_6b4d.html" title="User:Rogerd">rogerd</a> 23:41, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

"that automatic weapon fire in the corridors of the aircraft would quickly shred its aluminum skin and ruin its aerodynamics."</p>
<p>I would contest that this is wrong: aren't the bulkheads of Air Force One kevlar-lined? And in any case, wouldn't all firearms aboard the plane be loaded with frangible/fragmenting ammunition? User:Spock 03:11 April 4, 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I concur that this statement is wrong. Full auto small arms fire would make a "sewing machine" pattern of small, neat holes, or a cluster of closely spaced, small neat holes. Considering the massive skin surface of the aircraft, the chance of there being enough disruption to cause significant aerodynamics is remote. Greater problems than this would be caused if certain hydraulic lines or wiring harnesses were hit.</p>
<p>Further clarification: frangible and fragmenting ammunition are two different things. Fragmenting ammunition comes apart in dense media, such as a human target, as an additional wounding mechanism. Frangible ammunition is designed to disintegrate when it hits something sturdy, such as brick or thick steel, as a safety mechanism. It's an open question whether frangibles would penetrate an aircraft skin. I'd think they'd penetrate. Next time I have a chance to go shooting, I'll see what frangibles do vs a 55 gallon steel drum.</p>

<p>I am calling into question this particular trivia passage</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Viewers are given a detailed tour of the aircraft and its systems; both real and fictional. Most notable among the departures from reality include that the real Air Force One does not carry a known escape capsule, and that automatic weapon fire in the corridors of the aircraft would quickly shred its aluminum skin and ruin its aerodynamics. Contrary to popular belief, however, it would not necessarily result in instant death for all aboard; it would merely force a quick landing."</dd>
</dl>
<p>If I remember correctly, the use of special hollow-point bullets allows a weapon to be fired within an airplane without fear of penetrating the skin, even if shot at a window, although I imagine that glass windows would shatter, although plastic ones may withstand several hits. If I recall correctly, these are the types of bullets used by Federal Air Marshals to allow counter-terrorism fire in the event of an emergency without fear of destroying the plane.--71.235.66.254 01:37, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The trivia section states that MP5 A5's are used in the movie. Anyone know if this is definite, or is it possible the ones shown are A3's instead?
