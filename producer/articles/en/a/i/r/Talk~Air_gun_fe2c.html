<p>I think there is too much overlap between these three articles. When one looks for information on a particular aspect of this topic, one sometimes finds it scattered across all three.</p>
<p>Please consider the following propositions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. <i>Air guns</i> are currently covered by three articles: <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_gun.html" title="Air gun">air gun</a> and <a href="../../../b/b/_/BB_gun_a68b.html" title="BB gun">BB gun</a>.</li>
<li>2. Additionally, the same "<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a>" article covers the <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sport</a> or <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game.html" title="Game">game</a> known as "<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a>".</li>
<li>3. A <a href="../../../b/b/_/BB_gun_a68b.html" title="BB gun">BB gun</a> is a species of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_gun.html" title="Air gun">air gun</a>, just like a sporting <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_pistol.html" title="Air pistol">air pistol</a> or an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html#Airsoft_guns" title="Airsoft">airsoft pistol</a>.</li>
<li>4. There is an international sporting activity known as <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">Airsoft</a>. It employs <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html#Airsoft_guns" title="Airsoft">airsoft pistols</a> (and occasionally rifles) (apparently along similar lines to <a href="../../../p/r/a/Practical_shooting.html" title="Practical shooting">I.P.S.C.</a>).</li>
<li>5. In at least some parts of the world an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html#Airsoft_guns" title="Airsoft">airsoft pistol</a> is commonly called a "<a href="../../../b/b/_/BB_gun_a68b.html" title="BB gun">BB gun</a>".</li>
</ul>
<p>I propose: 1. That the <a href="../../../b/b/_/BB_gun_a68b.html" title="BB gun">BB gun</a> article be merged with the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_gun.html" title="Air gun">air gun</a> article. 2. That the portions of the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a> article relating to the mechanics and operation of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html#Airsoft_guns" title="Airsoft">airsoft guns</a> be moved to the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_gun.html" title="Air gun">air gun</a>. 3. That the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a> article restrict itself to the <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sport</a> of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a> (including required equipment not thoroughly canvassed in other Wikipedia articles</p>
<p>So, in essence I propose that we have one article for the <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sport</a>/<a href="../../../g/a/m/Game.html" title="Game">game</a> of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a> and one for <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_gun.html" title="Air gun">air guns</a> (whether designed for the <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sport</a> of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">airsoft</a> or not.</p>
<p>I'm posting this on the talk pages of all three articles. Please give us your thoughts. If there's no great opposition to this I'll go ahead and make the edits, but I thought it was only fair to raise the matter with contributors first. <a href="../../../w/u/l/User%7EWulfilia_3479.html" title="User:Wulfilia">Wulfilia</a> 19:42, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Under <b>Usage Tips</b>, can someone clarify the 2,500rd break-in period? I've personally never needed more than a few dozen rounds to cook the maker's grease.</p>
<p>Also, does someone have the time to write more about the differences in recoil and handling, elaborating on <i>"Get comfortable with your airguns first."</i>. Moreover, should we add a bit about Airgun Safety? --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferBlack_eaf3.html" title="User:LuciferBlack">LuciferBlack</a> 04:13, Dec 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The 2,500 round break-in claim seems to be traceable to the questionable writings of Robert Beeman, who copied a lot from Robert Law and Ladd Fanta without noting the context. The old leather-sealed guns that used heavy grease were very different from modern, minimally lubed guns with synthetic seals. This claim is also found on Pyramid's "blog" (<a href="http://www.pyramydair.com/blog/2005/05/bad-vibes.html" class="external free" title="http://www.pyramydair.com/blog/2005/05/bad-vibes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyramydair.com/blog/2005/05/bad-vibes.html</a>).</p>
<p>My own experience- and I tested a lot of guns for American Airgun, as well as my own- was that most modern guns need no break-in whatsoever. Michael Edelman 2:39 26 Jan 2007 (EST)</p>

<p>This is going to come across as being extremely inappropriate, but I genuinely believe in my heart of hearts that my own article on this topic at Everything2 <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=575763" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=575763" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is generally of a higher standard than this one; ableit that it is written for a different audience, and in a chattier, more openly entertaining style - I was trying to emulate [The Straight Dope] rather than an encyclopaedic.

<p>the airgun calibers are wrong (in mm) there is no 5.6mm (shoud be 5.5), and 6.4 shoud be 6.35 (I think 5.1 shoud be 5.0, but these I'm not sure). And the most powerfull airgun is diana 350 magnum which can shot a pellet at 360 m/s</p>
<p>This page should be re-edited and the locked-out (read-only) to prevent vandals and jerks to keep putting obscenities in it</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually that's nonsense. Airgun calibres vary between countries. In Europe the Metric system is used and this produces barrels in (for example) 5.5mm calibre. In the UK, the old Imperial system produces barrels with a calibre of .22" (inches) and that, when converted to Metric, is closer to 5.6mm. This anomaly exists in the three main calibres .177, .22 and .25. and is one of the reasons that it is possible to purchase different sized pellets according to whether your barrel originated in the UK or Europe.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The most powerfull airgun is not the Diana 350 Magnum either. It is one of the most powerful spring powered rifles, but certain precharged rifles are capable of more power than that, and more to the point, better accuracy too.</li>

<p>I can't research <i>real</i> airguns anymore without the interference of the "6mm BB." For crying out loud, a plastic "Airsoft" projectile could by no means be used as either a Ball Bearing or a shotshell load between 'B' and 'BBB' size! All BBs are 4.5mm steel or lead shot, period. As far as I'm concerned Airsofts are for people who can't afford paintball. They should be confined to their own Wiki page, subsumed under 'Airgun' and tucked well into a back corner of a subscript of a link, maybe on "fake guns" or "replicas." 67.163.0.9 13:09, 5 May 2006 (UTC)semiautopellet</p>

<p>CO2 is not liquified under pressure by the way.</p>

<p>When you get a big cylinder of CO2 from the bottled gas store, you have a choice of syphon-type or non-syphon, according to whether you want the cylinder to dispense liquid CO2 from the bottom or gas from the top. You never see liquid CO2 because it instantly turns to a mixture of dry ice and gas at atmospheric pressure.--Another name 00:03, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Uhm, yeah, should we change it so that it doesn't refer to pressurized CO<sub>2</sub> as "liquid gas?" not only does it sound oxymoronic, but I was under the impression that carbon dioxide, being a sublimating substance, is either gas or solid. Just a little confusing there. 64.90.198.6 21:13, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>

<dd>"Liquid gas" is an accepted term--for example, in the term <i><a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquified_petroleum_gas.html" title="Liquified petroleum gas">liquified petroleum gas</a></i>. While CO2 does sublimate at standard pressure (14.7 psi), that's only because the vapor pressure at room temperature is about 50 times atmospheric (700 psi). If you take CO2 liquid and compress it to that vapor pressure, you will liquify the gas. This is opposed to liquifying, say, nitrogen, which is done by cooling it at standard pressure. If you burst a CO2 catridge (say, by punching a 1/8" hole right trough the seal) what happens is that the liquified gas instantly sublimates, and in doing so, gets very, very cold. So cold, in fact, that some if it turns into CO2 snowflakes--little bits of dry ice. I figured this one out making a spigot mortar that used 12 gram powerlets, and punched the seal with a nail to trigger it. You'd get a loud "THUMP" as the PVC and foam rocket launched, and then there would be a small dusting of CO2 snow around the base of the spigot that would quickly sublimate away. Never did spend much time shooting it though--at US$0.50 a shot it was too expensive to play with much.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, you are right in that it's confusing, so I'll see about changing that... <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 21:56, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Regarding the airgun image.

It should be labeled "bore". Bullet holes are what appear in a target after a gun has been fired.</li>

<p>As I understand it, if a CO2 powerlet is left in an airgun it burns the seals. This is a pretty big negative as one has to fire off the excess gas before retiring the gun until the next shoot, thus wasting an energy source that is not free to charge (unlike a spring/gas ram gun). If this is true it should be included in the relevant section to balance things. It's an even bigger issue with Crosman's new Airsource 88g units: if you just fire half a dozen shots you've wasted an entire cannister which has to be emptied if you don't plan to shoot again very shortly after (I don't want to go hunting with a power source that cost me £12 if I only fire off half a dozen shots and I have to use the rest firing "blanks" or shooting at tin cans). Can something with greater knowledge than me please comment? 86.7.209.101 00:00, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Depends. CO2 doesn't "burn" the seal, there's no chemical reaction involved. What does happen is that the seal is left under compression, and can eventually "set" into the compressed position. Once the seal sets, it will have trouble sealing again. However, this is not a big deal, a new seal is about US$0.50 or so. Modern plastic seals are far better about this than old leather or rubber seals (leather is used in pump pneumatics, maybe in CO2 as well). These degrade naturally with age--standard black rubber O-rings are subject to the same thing, after years of use they get hard and brittle and start to crack and leak. I have stored CO2 in my guns (Crosman 357, 2240, 2210, 1008, Daisy 693) and the only problem I had was with the Daisy. I left a partial CO2 cartridge in place for a couple of months, and when I unscrewed it, it twisted the piercing cap, seal, and O-ring loose. I had to replace the O-ring, because it got cut when I was fiddling with the CO2 cartridge trying to get it out, but I bought a 10 pack for under US$1 at the local hardware store to replace it, and it's still going strong years later.</dd>
<dd>One problem that you do encounter with seals is opening a CO2 catridge when it's still partially full. This dumps all the gas past the piercing cap seal, and this freezes it--really cold, I've actually seen dry ice snow form by dumping a 12 gram cartridge all at once, and that's about 189 Kelvin as I recall. This will make most soft materials brittle, such as the plastics used in the seal, and tightening or even further loosening of the seal might fracture it and cause a leak.</dd>
<dd>The thing to remember though is that all seals are expendable; dirt, age, wear, solvents, pressure cycles, and temperature cycles can all take their toll. Do what you want, and keep a spare piercing cap seal or two handy, or you can use a bit of thick grease as an emergency seal. Most airguns are actually pretty easy to take apart and repair, and I know that Daisy and Crosman will send you parts lists if you contact them. I assume if these low end companies will be so helpful, and higher end company ought to have even better customer service. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 03:28, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep, that it could. I fixed the powerplant section a bit, still needs some work; for one example, the PCP and the old resevior guns are actually the same concept (many, many pumps to fill, multiple shots per fill). I moved the pneumatic piston up to spring-piston, those are the same technology, just one uses a steel spring, one an air spring--in fact you can buy drop-in pneumatic springs for many spring-piston guns. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 03:03, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a question, sicne a picture got me rather excited. The rifle which is shown for the spring action, what model/make/name is it? I have 2 of them exactly the same, made in hungary, with serial numbers, and would like to know their specifications. Many thanks</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have two of them you're probably in a better position to tell us the details.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>EDIT:The two I ahve were passed down to me by my father, so they're about 30 years old. He can't remember what model they are or where he got them. A Captian I once served under suggested that they were probally a certain brand, but I can't remember what that is. Hopefully if he knows, someone else here will know.</p>

<p>Do we really need a photo of a 7 year old child and airgun? I don't think it really adds anything to the encyclopeadic nature of the article.</p>

<dd>Yes and no. The picture in question may be a case of someone wanting to stick their son's picture in the article, but air guns and <a href="../../../b/b/_/BB_gun_a68b.html" title="BB gun">BB guns</a> are the choice for young shooters. A better choice might be, say, a <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cub_Scout_4d75.html" title="Cub Scout">Cub Scout</a> shooting a BB gun, or the NRA's junior shooting badge, as it would tie in air guns to organized youth shooting. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 15:51, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought the article would be better served by example photos of the various types of rifles, for example (which I have tried to upload). I just think the photo doesn't illustrate or explain anything in particular. Perhaps just a comment that air guns are "starting points" for many shooters would suffice, but that also gives an impression that they're used (mainly) by youths, which I don't think they are, there are thousands of adult airgunners globally.

<p>without a doubt, big bore air rifles are among the most powerful. logic would dictate that, of course, due to the mass of the bullet. however, one line says, "such as the .45, .50, and .68 calibre paintballs" paintball markers are among the most powerful? it qualifies for the classification of a bigbore airgun, but i think it is a little misleading as a reader would associate something like a .50 shinsung dragon slayer with a sub 350fps paintball marker. i will leave it to someone else to reword this. 198.166.226.14 00:50, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I tried to make a change, and the bot decided it was vandalism. Does it think c_ck is a dirty word?</p>
<p>"The spring in a spring piston air gun is very powerful and is held back by a sear that has a very small engagement area. There have been cases of severe crushing and even amputation when the spring has been released unexpectedly. " MY ATTEMPTED CHANGE: Because of this, break barrel spring piston guns should never be c_cked before loading, and the breech should never be left open with the gun c_cked. The proper loading procedure is to open the breech just until it rests on the spring loaded stop, insert the pellet, and then c_ck the gun. If you are not shooting immediately after loading, you can load the gun without c_cking it and c_ck it just before shooting to reduce the risk of accidental discharge. If you forget to load before c_cking or if you decide not to shoot, you can dec_ck the gun by pulling the barrel hard against the spring as if c_cking it and pulling the trigger, then slowly bringing the barrel forward to release the spring tension. Note that this method of dec_cking is only for spring piston guns! Be sure you understand the mechanism of your particular gun. --17:23, 6 November 2006 (UTC)Another name</p>

<p>First, a breakbarrel gun should not necessarily be loaded with a pellet prior to cocking. There's 2 reasons for this.</p>
<p>1) Many guns do not allow this to be done easily. Even when the breach is cracked open, some rifles do not have sufficient clearance to allow a pellet to be inserted. This requires a user to hold the barrel partially open with one hand (against the mainspring) and attempt to feed a pellet with the other, while holding the gun under the armpit. Very awkward, and it's easy to pinch fingers.</p>
<p>2) Cocking the gun with a pellet already in the breach increases the chance that the pellet will inadvertently be shaken out during the cocking stroke. If the shooter doesn't notice this, the result is a "dry-fire", which can damage the gun.</p>
<p>Second, many (if not most) modern break-barrels cannot be de-cocked as described. They have an "anti-beartrap" that prevents the trigger from being pulled when the breach is open. This is to prevent "barrel slam" because that could also damage or destroy the gun. The only modern ones I know of that CAN be "de-cocked" are the very cheap and unreliable Chinese B1 and B2 series, and the Xisico B20/B26 (and probably the Beeman R9 it's copied from).</p>
<p>Third, there is really no reason a shooter would get his or her fingers far enough into the mechanism that a severe injury would likely result... at least not during a normal loading procedure. The injury problem is far more common with the "sliding compression tube" type of breach, as is found in many Chinese underlever and sidelever guns and the RWS 48/52/54 series.</p>
<dl>
<dd>More good points. I recall it being the HW77 (and similar) that seemed to make people cautious about their loading habits / fingers. I assumed methods of loading had changed since I began shooting, it's not a method I have ever used with my own break barrel. I have removed the text for now, maybe it can be modified, even reduced to a sentence or two, or eventually the section on "Springers" broken down into break-barrel, under-lever, side-lever and a word of warning added in the appropriate section. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephenjh_a1fc.html" title="User:Stephenjh">Stephenjh</a> 07:08, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rather hilarious that people here seem to be more worried about damaging their guns than, for example, destroying someone's eye (which happened to someone I know a couple of days ago - even though the gun in question wasn't even loaded. Let's have a section on safety, please, written by someone who knows what they're talking about.</dd>
