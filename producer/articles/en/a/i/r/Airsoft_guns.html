<p><b>Airsoft guns</b> (also known as <i>Soft Air guns</i> by some <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Airsoft_Manufacturers_4560.html" title="List of Airsoft Manufacturers">manufacturers</a>, such as <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybergun.html" title="Cybergun">Cybergun</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crosman.html" title="Crosman">Crosman</a>) are spring, electric, or gas powered <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_gun.html" title="Air gun">air guns</a> that fire small spherical plastic <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft_pellets.html" title="Airsoft pellets">pellets</a> of either 6 mm or 8 mm diameter (0.24 or 0.32 inches). Inexpensive airsoft guns are often used as toys, while more expensive models may be used for firearms training or in the sport of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft.html" title="Airsoft">Airsoft</a>, which is similar in concept to <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paintball.html" title="Paintball">Paintball</a>.</p>
<p>Generally they are replicas (in appearance only) of real firearms, but occasionally fictional firearms are available, such as the <a href="../../../m/4/1/M41A_Pulse_Rifle_6cf7.html" title="M41A Pulse Rifle">M41A Pulse Rifle</a> from the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliens_%281986_film%29.html" title="Aliens (1986 film)">Aliens</a> films. Some very inexpensive airsoft guns are reduced scale models (such as the <i>Boys</i> models by some makers) or caricatures (like the <i>mini-electrics</i>) of firearms.</p>
<p>Because airsoft guns are visually accurate replicas they are often used as <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatrical_properties.html" title="Theatrical properties">movie props</a>.</p>
<p>While in essence the three types of airsoft guns, spring, gas, and electric, all work on the same principle of compressed gas expanding to force a BB down the gun's barrel, each type has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft_guns.html" title="Edit section: Spring powered">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spring powered</span></h3>
<p>Spring-powered airsoft guns are single-shot devices that use potential energy stored in a spring to launch an airsoft pellet down the barrel of the gun. The user must cock a spring gun prior to each shot. This is typically achieved by pulling back the slide (pistols), bolt (rifles), or the grip on a shotgun, which in turn compresses the spring and makes the gun ready to fire. Because of this, these guns are by definition incapable of automatic or semi-automatic fire.</p>
<p><br />
While most electric guns also use springs for propulsion of the airsoft pellet, they are not considered to be in the same category as the single-shot spring-powered guns. Low-end spring guns tend to be much cheaper than their electric-powered equivalents due to their simplicity and lack of electrical components (spring assembly, electric motor, battery, and battery charger) and thus are widely available. These guns are less suited for competition because they are at a disadvantage against automatic guns in close combat and do not provide enough accuracy and power for long-range use. Some exceptions: higher-end spring-powered airsoft rifles can be quite expensive; these guns are typically suited for "marksman" applications in airsoft matches and provide competitive muzzle velocities. Additionally, pump shotguns are sometimes used, especially in <a href="../../../c/q/b/CQB_bb01.html" title="CQB">CQB</a> (Close Quarters Battle). In colder weather, spring pistols are more reliable than gas-powered pistols (see below) and even the batteries on AEPs (Automatic Electric Pistols) both of which can be adversely affected by extreme cold.</p>
<p>This represents one of the major advantages of a spring powered airsoft gun, as it can be fired in any situation, without reliance on an external source of air, such as batteries or gas. Electrics are also more susceptible to malfunction from water.</p>
<p>The other major advantage that spring weapons hold over other powered airsoft guns is price. True AEGs can range from $200-$500 and high-end gas pistols generally cost from $80-$200 both of which also require extra equipment; gas, batteries etc. Spring guns tend to not exceed $50, except in cases of high end "sniping" rifles which average out to be around $100-$370 in price. Most players start with a spring pistol as their first airsoft weapon, which will usually cost about $10-$30. They are also more readily available in most department stores. Because of their price, spring guns tend to act as "training guns" to bring new players to airsoft games and are considered the primary weapon of "backyard skirmishes." Almost all airsoft players at some point own a spring weapon, whether for its actual use in the sport or for the replica value since some airsoft weapons are only available as spring versions.</p>

<p>Gas-powered airsoft guns use pressurized gas to propel pellets. These guns are capable of automatic and semi-automatic operation. The most common gases used are "<a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_gas.html" title="Green gas">green gas</a>" (which consists of a mixture of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propane.html" title="Propane">propane</a> and a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polysiloxane.html" title="Polysiloxane">polysiloxane</a> lubricant) and <a href="../../../h/f/c/HFC-134a_ce70.html" title="HFC-134a">HFC-134a</a>. Less commonly used gases include "red gas" (which is actually <a href="../../../h/c/f/HCFC-22_f379.html" title="HCFC-22">HCFC-22</a>), <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_dioxide.html" title="Carbon dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></a> and <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrogen.html" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen/high pressure air</a>. Red gas is usually avoided unless the airsoft gun has undergone modification, as its relatively high critical pressure can cause damage to the airsoft gun. CO<sub>2</sub>, nitrogen, and high pressure air are less common because they need to be stored at higher pressures than "green gas" or HFC-134a.</p>
<p>The first ever gas powered airsoft gun are commonly referred to as 'classic' guns, owing to their age. These guns were most commonly powered by liquid propellants such as <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dichlorodifluoromethane.html" title="Dichlorodifluoromethane">R-12</a> (Which was marketed by the Japanese as FLON-12 or brand name Freon-12) freon feed system with a majority of the configurations containing two tanks, one containing the R-12 and one used as an expansion tank, and the gun itself. R-12 was commonly used in car air conditioning systems. It is also illegal in some states and parts of the world because it is not environmentally friendly. Later users modified these old guns to be powered by regulated CO<sub>2</sub> canisters or nitrogen/high pressure air bottles to increase power and consistency. However, these guns have largely been superseded by the newer and more versatile AEGs, or automatic electric guns. One of the reasons for this is because the most commonly available propellant, R-12, is costly. Additionally, at high flow rates, liquid propellants tend to cool down, eventually freezing. As cooldown progresses, the rate of fire gradually decreases until the gun ceases operation. The user would then be forced to wait for the propellant to warm up again. CO<sub>2</sub> is not affected as badly by this tendency, and nitrogen/high pressure air is immune to it. Furthermore, if liquid propellant is introduced into the gun's mechanism, rubber parts can freeze and eventually damage the gun.</p>
<p>Gas power tends to be used in airsoft pistols where size constraints make electric-powered mechanisms impractical. Other instances where gas is favored are where adjustable velocities are required or where a blowback feature is desired. A blowback feature is a mechanism which cycles a slide or bolt to better simulate a real firearm's operation. Because of the mechanical complexities involved with distributing and regulating gas, these guns have largely given way to electric guns for less specialized applications, however, they still remain a favorite amongst airsofters and no competitive airsoft game is ever complete without a 'pistols-only' match. They are not just limited to pistols; submachine gun airsoft replicas and sniper rifle airsoft replicas commonly use gas mechanisms. Whilst the submachine gun replicas typically feature a blowback mechanism similar to the pistol replicas, sniper rifle replicas usually omit the blowback mechanism in favor of reduced <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recoil.html" title="Recoil">recoil</a> and increased muzzle velocity.</p>
<p>Along with using gas to power guns, it is also applied for use in replica grenades. These grenades are both projectiles, fired from a grenade launcher such as the <a href="../../../m/2/0/M203.html" title="M203">M203</a> or <a href="../../../g/p/-/GP-30_97ee.html" title="GP-30">GP-25</a>, or throwable. The shells work on the system of an internal piston, filled with gas. Either a series of BBs or in some cases a rubber or soft foam head is seated in or on top of the shell. When the pressure is released the projectile(s) are shot from the launcher sent downrange.</p>
<p>In the case of the throwable grenades, inside the grenade there is a similar piston to the one used in the shells, but is on a literal "timer" that allows the user to clear the area of effect. BBs or powder act as the projectile in the case of these grenades. Currently both types of grenades are not very common, mostly because grenade launchers are quite expensive and the throwable grenades are not very reliable.</p>

<p>Electric-powered airsoft guns typically use a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Rechargeable_battery.html" title="Rechargeable battery">rechargeable battery</a> to drive an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_motor.html" title="Electric motor">electric motor</a>, which cycles an internal piston/spring assembly in order to launch pellets. Automatic and semi-automatic operation is possible which gives these guns the popular name "automatic electric guns" or AEGs. These guns often attain muzzle velocities of 200 to 400 ft/s (60 to 120 m/s) and rates of fire of between 300 and 1100 rounds per minute. They are the most commonly used and widely available type of airsoft gun.</p>
<p>These type of guns were developed in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> and the Japanese company <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo_Marui_e2ca.html" title="Tokyo Marui">Tokyo Marui</a> dominates the market. In a Tokyo Marui AEG, the motor drives a series of 3 <a href="../../../g/e/a/Gears.html" title="Gears">gears</a> mounted inside a gearbox. The gears then compress a piston assembly against a spring. Once the piston is released, the spring drives it forward through the cylinder to push a pellet into the chamber, through the barrel, and forward from the muzzle. Many manufacturers have now more or less replicated this basic model, adding reinforced parts or minor improvements.</p>

<p>These guns are powered primarily by <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickel_cadmium.html" title="Nickel cadmium">nickel cadmium</a> (NiCad) or <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickel_metal_hydride.html" title="Nickel metal hydride">nickel metal hydride</a> (NiMH) with varying <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volt.html" title="Volt">voltages</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milliampere-hour.html" title="Milliampere-hour">milliampere hours</a> ratings. The most common battery is an 8.4 V large battery (usually about 2400 mA•h.) Also available are 8.4 V "mini" batteries, which generally have 600 mA•h capacities. Voltages for large batteries range from 7.2 V, all the way up to 12 V. The rule of thumb usually is the higher the mAh, the longer the battery lasts while the higher voltage, the higher Rate of Fire (RoF).</p>
<p>External modifications, such as metal bodies and reinforced plastics that make AEGs look and feel even more realistic, have become very popular. AEG manufacturers such as <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classic_Army_7a99.html" title="Classic Army">Classic Army</a> (Yick Fung) produce replicas that are visually nearly identical to their real counterparts, boasting metal bodies and stronger furnishings.

<p>Some cheaper and lowered powered AEGs are called <i>low powered electric guns</i> (LPEGs) to distinguish them from the original, more expensive and more powerful AEGs even though their mechanical/electrical design and operation is similar and are not to be confused <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft_guns.html#Mini_Electric" title="Airsoft guns"><i>Mini Electrics</i></a> (described below). Originally they were only of novelty value, often regarded below spring operated guns due to their construction and low velocities.</p>

<p>Recently, the company UHC, well known for its spring guns, began manufacturing a range of electric guns in miniature size that fire only full automatic. They differ from LPEGs in that they are not replicas of real firearms, being miniaturized version of real firearms, mostly made of black or clear plastic.</p>
<p>They have a small ammo capacity, usually between 50 and 100 rounds, but they have good range and functional <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hop-up.html" title="Hop-up">hop-up</a>. Even among experienced airsofters, they are great for impromptu games and for kids. They have become very popular in recent years, and are now being imitated by the <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwanese</a> company HFC, which are still functional but less sturdy. These “minis,” as they are referred to, are not a viable option in games against AEGs since their small ammo capability, short range and poor accuracy would be a huge disadvantage. However, Mini electric guns are able to compete with spring pistols at close ranges, due to their high rate of fire. Tokyo Marui also makes these "minis."</p>
<p><a name="AEP" id="AEP"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft_guns.html" title="Edit section: AEP">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">AEP</span></h4>
<p>Automatic Electric Pistols , abbreviated AEPs, was first introduced by <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo_Marui_e2ca.html" title="Tokyo Marui">Tokyo Marui</a> in 2005 with their <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glock_18.html#Variants" title="Glock 18">Glock 18C</a> (followed later by a <a href="../../../b/e/r/Beretta_93R_3aaa.html" title="Beretta 93R">Beretta 93R</a> model). They were the first handguns to incorporate an electric powered system that capable of full-automatic operation.</p>
<p>Although the Glock was the first manufactured automatic pistol. Some semi-automatic pistols can easily be modified to be automatic pistols. These weapons often wear out quickly because to make them effective they must be given a 9v battery instead of the normal two AA batteries. This makes the gun wear out quicker.</p>
<p>In cold weather, they are considered better sidearms than gas powered pistol, because batteries are not as badly affected by very cold weather. Gases like CO<sub>2</sub> and green gas are stored in liquid form and require heat in order to turn into a gaseous form. A gas pistol in 10°F will usually only get one to two usable shots from a full magazine.</p>
<p>Because the AEP technology is relatively new, the velocity of the pellets is considered slow for airsoft play. The velocity of the AEP is usually between 200 to 225 ft/s. However, the advanced hop up units on these new guns tend to compensate for the low power and can produce an effective range comparable to those of an AEG.</p>
<p>An AEP differs from an Electric Blow Backs because the AEP has has a fixed slide where there is no external movement by the slide during operation, while an EBB attempts to simulate of the "blow back" in the slide experienced in a real pistol or Gas Blow Back (GBB). An AEP, however, has much more power and accuracy.</p>
<p>One of the newer AEP styled guns is the Marui replica of the Heckler &amp; Koch <a href="../../../m/p/7/MP7_fbb1.html" title="MP7">MP7</a>. It is considerably larger than either of the other guns, and can be upgraded to a much higher power through the use of an external battery, but uses the same system as the AEP, so the classification is not clear. It is slightly more powerful than the others and is a suitable choice for <a href="../../../c/q/b/CQB_bb01.html" title="CQB">CQB</a> (Close Quarter Battle) games due to its small size and decent barrel length relative to its size.</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../c/l/a/Classic_airsoft.html" title="Classic airsoft">Classic airsoft</a></b> guns are usually older variety airsoft guns which are gas powered. Unlike gas pistols of today can run on either an internal tank using conventional airsoft gas, or use an external CO2 tank much like a paintball gun. They generally cost more than the standard AEG but provide a more realistic approach to airsoft. There is usually a little bit of "recoil" provided by these guns. These guns also have a lot more power than the average AEG, usually reaching up to around 500 fps stock. They also have a higher rate of fire because a spring doesn't need to be pulled back each time a shot must be fired.</p>

<p>Magazines are realistic looking replicas of real firearm's magazines and as such are made of the same materials like stamped metal or high impact plastic. They occasionally feature markings and/or engravings that match or mimic their real counterparts.</p>
<p>Gas blowback magazines are usually made out of thicker metal, since they contain compressed gas to power the guns as well as the pellets. The magazines usually have a valve on the bottom that is used to charge its internal cylinder with gas. They are designed to be similar in weight to a fully loaded magazine from a real firearm.</p>
<p>Airsoft Magazines are divided into the following classes according to the number of pellets they hold:</p>
<p><a name="Standard" id="Standard"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft_guns.html" title="Edit section: Standard">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Standard</span></h3>
<p>These type of magazines aren't classified according to their capacity (in some cases up to 300 rounds), but by the fact that they are the standard unmodified magazines originally included with the weapon itself. They are normally loaded by inserting BBs down a shaft, compressing a spring held inside that will later feed the pellets into the gun.</p>
<p>Standard magazines offer quiet operation (no rattle or manual winding of <i>high-capacity</i> magazines) and are sometimes the only alternative available for certain airsoft gun models. They are also useful to help players limit their ammunition consumption.</p>
<p>Standard magazines almost only come with <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo_Marui_e2ca.html" title="Tokyo Marui">Tokyo Marui</a> guns whereas some companies like <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classic_Army_7a99.html" title="Classic Army">Classic Army</a> or ICS supply <i>high-capacity</i> magazines with their guns. However, most magazines will not feed every single pellet, leaving 2-3 pellets at the end of the magazine (some players may circumvent this problem by inverting the gun to allow gravity to feed the pellets instead).<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>This is a loose category used to describe a <i>standard</i> type of magazine that has been modified to hold more rounds - usually between 100 and 200.</p>
<p>Mechanically they still function like a standard magazine and as such keep the advantage of quiet operation over <i>high-capacity</i> magazines (that also require a winding mechanism), but minimize the disadvantage of a <i>standard</i> magazine's lower number of rounds.</p>
<p><a name="Low_capacity_.28Low-Cap.29" id="Low_capacity_.28Low-Cap.29"></a></p>

<p>Low cap mags hold less than 100 rounds of ammo. They usually are made to make airsoft combat more realistic, by holding the same ammount of rounds as the real firearm's magazine does. One company known for their affordable, high quality abs low caps is STAR.</p>
<p><a name="High_capacity_.28Hi-Cap.29" id="High_capacity_.28Hi-Cap.29"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft_guns.html" title="Edit section: High capacity (Hi-Cap)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">High capacity (Hi-Cap)</span></h3>
<p>This term is used for all magazines with capacities in excess of 290 pellets (some up to 5,000) and can be one of two types, manual or battery controlled.</p>
<p>With both types a toothed wheel is rotated to bring pellets from a reservoir, along a track and up into a channel into the gun. With one type this gear is turned manually while in the other a pressure sensitive pad is used to operate a battery powered electrical motor to perform the same function.</p>
<p>These magazines are almost exclusively used in AEG type of guns and the obvious advantages is the greater number of rounds, which can be especially useful for automatic fire. The disadvantage is that the loose pellets can rattle and the noise could betray a players position to other competitors. Also, Hi-cap magazines are not allowed at most major airsoft events, where realism is often a prerequisite.</p>
<p><a name="Real_capacity" id="Real_capacity"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft_guns.html" title="Edit section: Real capacity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Real capacity</span></h3>
<p>Real-Caps are identical in operation compared to standard magazines, but they carry the same amount of ammunition that the real version of the magazine can carry, which is often much less than the standard magazine, e.g. an M-16 Real-Cap will hold 30 rounds instead of the 68 of a standard magazine. However, in airsoft, because of a lack of accuracy and range, more shots are fired, requiring magazines with more ammunition.</p>
<p>These tend to be used solely by those wanting the most realistic MILSIM ("MILitary SIMulation") games. Again they offer the stealth of no rattling rounds, but their main use is for the realistic qualities.</p>
<p><a name="Performance" id="Performance"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airsoft_guns.html" title="Edit section: Performance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Performance</span></h2>
<p>Airsoft guns shoot 0.2 g BBs at velocities from 100 ft/s (30 m/s) for a low-end spring pistol, to 550 ft/s (170 m/s) and beyond for heavily-upgraded customized sniper rifles. Most non-upgraded AEG's using the Tokyo Marui system are in the middle, producing velocities from 270 to 300 ft/s (80 to 90 m/s) with the exception of a few companies like G&amp;G and G&amp;P which manufacture guns that produce velocities of 350-375fps range. The internal components of most guns can be upgraded to can increase the pellet velocity significantly.</p>
<p>Internal modifications revolve around increasing the rate of fire and the velocity of the pellets. The velocity of the pellets is increased by installing a stronger spring. The rate of fire is increased by using a battery with a voltage of 9.6 volts or higher and high speed ratio gears, together with a high speed motor. Rates of fire can be increased to 25 rounds per minute and in extreme case, up to 50 rounds per second. As with any modification, an upgrade on one internal part means the other internal components might have to be upgraded as well.</p>
<p>Airsoft guns commonly come with mounts or rails on which you can add external accessories. Some common upgrades added are flash lights, <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telescopic_sight.html" title="Telescopic sight">scopes</a>, lasers etc. Since some airsoft guns have the exact external frame as real guns you can use these external upgrades meant for real guns, but the opposite does not apply. In no way can an airsoft rifle be modified to shoot real ammunition. In most cases, scopes and flash lights have little effect on the performance of the airsoft gun itself, rather the user's ability to use their gun effectively in different situations. In most cases these types of add-ons are more for aesthetics rather than performance.</p>

<p>Barrels should be cleaned after every use especially in sandy environments. After playing airsoft, you should fire two to three shots in semi-automatic mode to decompress the gearbox spring (some guns come with a button that can be pressed to decompress the spring). Empty the magazine in order to preserve the strength of the magazine spring. For guns with <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hop-Up_731b.html" title="Hop-Up">Hop-Up</a>, you should turn off your Hop-Up if you are not planning to use your gun within two to three days. Not doing so may cause the O-Ring to expand and eventually break. It is also smart to spray a non-corrosive silicon spray into the gun barrel and hop-up chamber from time to time, as suggested in most AEG and other airsoft gun manuals.</p>
<p>Magazines for gas guns should be left pressurized so all seals stay intact. If the gas used has silicon lubricant in it, then further lubrication usually isn't necessary; if not, a drop or two on the internals will do. When Expelling gas From a Gun you should never use the release valve located on the magazine as the releasing gas can freeze the o ring causing gas leakage.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Some longtime airsoft gun owners complain about their gun's paint either scratching or wearing off. While in most situations it's a bad idea to do "touch ups," if a full repainting is needed, a flat, <a href="../../../e/n/a/Enamel_paint.html" title="Enamel paint">enamel</a> based spray paint should be used, such as Krylon. More and more retailers offer painting services to restore an airsoft gun's original appearance.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of gun care, specifically in the case of AEG's, is using the correct battery. Using a battery which is too strong may strip the teeth from the piston or gears whereas using a battery which is too weak can put unnecessary strain on the motor as it struggles to pull back the spring. It is highly recommended that the airsoft gun owner make certain what the appropriate battery <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltage.html" title="Voltage">voltage</a> is, depending on what, if any, upgrades an airsoft gun contains.</p>

<p>There are rumors, driven by the realistic look of some airsoft guns, that they can be modified to kill.

It is, however, impossible to convert or modify any airsoft replica to fire a real bullet due to the materials (mostly plastic), internal design (battery/gas powered) and construction that differ completely from real firearms.</p>
<p>Airsoft guns are also occasionally confused with other, higher powered types of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_guns.html" title="Air guns">air guns</a> which are dangerous and can be potentially lethal. BB Guns and other Air guns use high-density BB's which are metal pellets and are not to be confused with the low-density, plastic pellets airsoft guns use. Metal BB's that are used in air guns also have a much, much higher velocity (approaching 1000 fps in some models) that can break the skin and could possibly be fatal.
