<p><a href="../../../e/l/e/Ace_Combat_3%7E_Electrosphere_3c44.html" title="Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere">Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere</a> features a large number of notable <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_aircraft.html" title="Fighter aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> in the <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_626c.html" title="Ace Combat">Ace Combat</a> series. Some of the notable aircraft featured in the game are based on real-life prototype aircraft, while others are completely fictional.</p>
<p>One of the differences between aircraft in Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere and other games in the series is the COFFIN (Connection for Flight Interface) system. Aircraft are piloted and controlled through nerve signals (including vision) communicated to and from an electronic system installed inside. Therefore, pilots do not physically control aircraft, instead relying on electronic signals translated from the pilot's mind and reflexes. This technology also makes possible of remote control of aircraft through wireless transmissions from COFFIN systems installed at ground locations.</p>
<p>The notable aircraft are categorized by original manufacturers featured in the game, which includes:</p>

<p>The F-16XA Sakerfalcon is a fictional <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multirole_aircraft.html" title="Multirole aircraft">multirole aircraft</a> designed for both <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air-to-air.html" title="Air-to-air">air-to-air</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air-to-ground.html" title="Air-to-ground">air-to-ground</a> combat. It has a brown-gold, army-looking camouflage color scheme and is manufactured by General Resource LTD. Its design is based on the real-world prototype aircraft F-16 AFTI.</p>
<p>Unlike the F-16 Gyrfalcon, where the wings are located next to the center of the aircraft, the F-16XA Sakerfalcon's wings extend across the aircraft's length. Another visible difference is that there are two vertical stabilizer fins instead of one. Its acceleration performance is significantly better than the F-16XF Gyrfalcon, making it more apt at escaping dangerous situations. In addition, its excellent defence performance makes it less susceptible to missile and gun attacks. It can carry up to 96 <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missiles.html" title="Missiles">missiles</a>. It can acquire missile lock-on as far as 2043m for both aircraft and ground targets. Due to its small consturction, it can only survive light damage.</p>

It has a brown-green-black, army-looking camouflage color scheme and is manufactured by General Resource LTD. Its design is based on the real-world prototype aircraft X-32 Joint Strike Fighter, and bears a striking resemblance to the FB-22 Concept, an attacker aircraft concept of the <a href="../../../f/-/2/F-22A_Raptor_4d61.html" title="F-22A Raptor">F-22A Raptor</a>.</p>
<p>It varied immensely from the actual prototype. The Erne had a longer nose with more tapered chimes along the side. The air intake of the X-32 Joint Strike Fighter was more recessed. The aircraft also had two engines, compared to one for the X-32 Joint Strike Fighter; it also sports larger tail fins. While it is an agile aircraft, its acceleration is not particularly fast. It is particularly immune to <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missile.html" title="Missile">missile</a> attacks, dodging missiles easily especially when it is slowed down. It can carry up to 136 missiles.

<p>This fighter aircraft is only playable in the mission "Stratosphere" in the game. In the mission, it is launched into the stratosphere with the help of booster rockets. With two enormous rockets as its engines, it is the largest and heaviest aircraft available in the game, which contributes to its loud noise and poor maneuverability performance. However, it can accelerate near its maximum speed (5068km/h) without the help of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a>, making it the fastest aircraft in the <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_626c.html" title="Ace Combat">Ace Combat</a> series. Designed to fly in the stratosphere, it can reach higher <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altitudes.html" title="Altitudes">altitudes</a> while maintaining speed and stability. It is able to carry up to 160 <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missiles.html" title="Missiles">missiles</a>. While it can acquire missile lock-on for aircraft targets as far as 2246m, it needs to reach within 1159m for ground targets, making it the worst <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air-to-ground.html" title="Air-to-ground">air-to-ground</a> performance aircraft in the game.

<p>The XFA-36A Game is an advanced, fictional <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_aircraft.html" title="Fighter aircraft">fighter aircraft</a>. Its shape has little resemblance to the XFA-27 Phoenix featured in <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_2_b7fd.html" title="Ace Combat 2">Ace Combat 2</a> and has a closer resemblance to the <a href="../../../x/-/0/X-02_Wyvern_925e.html" title="X-02 Wyvern">X-02 Wyvern</a> in <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_04_3903.html" title="Ace Combat 04">Ace Combat 04</a>. Its color scheme is grey and white for models manufacturered by General Resource LTD. and black for those operated by <a href="../../../o/u/r/Ouroboros.html" title="Ouroboros">Ouroboros</a>. The "X" prefix signifies its <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prototype.html" title="Prototype">prototype</a> status, in line with the model naming conventions in the game series. It is based on the real-world <a href="../../../x/-/3/X-36.html" title="X-36">X-36</a> experimental aircraft.</p>
<p>During flight the aircraft's variable geometry wingtips can fold inwards and out whenever it accelerates or decelerates. It also possesses 3-dimensional <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrust_vectoring.html" title="Thrust vectoring">thrust vectoring</a> for greater maneuverability, allowing it to accelerate while making sharp turns. The maximum speed attainable from this aircraft is 3304km/h. Its performance characteristics is one of the most balanced of all aircraft in the game, with its defense, attack, power, mobility, and stability performance ratings all equally approaching the top. It can carry up to 184 <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missiles.html" title="Missiles">missiles</a>. Its attacking ability is the most impressive in the game, acquiring missile lock-on as far as 2455m for aircraft targets and 2521m for ground targets, both which are the maximum figures attainable respectively.</p>

X-49 Night Raven</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The X-49 Night Raven is an advanced, fictional <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_aircraft.html" title="Fighter aircraft">fighter aircraft</a>. Its shape resembles a <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boomerang.html" title="Boomerang">boomerang</a> and its appearance is very similar to the XR-900 Geopelia, except that is has a black color scheme instead of silver. It was stolen by the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist_organization.html" title="Terrorist organization">terrorist organization</a> <a href="../../../o/u/r/Ouroboros.html" title="Ouroboros">Ouroboros</a>. It was General Resource LTD.'s ultimate manned fighter, after which it became one of the Ouroboros' main weapons.</p>
<p>In the game's story the fictitious character Rena Hirose was the only pilot for this aircraft. It was launched from the UI-4053 Sphyrna airborne carrier. The X-49 Night Raven was responsible for the destruction of an island named "Megafloat" with one shot from the its Laser Cannon. It draws its amazing power from <a href="../../../a/e/o/Aeon.html" title="Aeon">Aeon</a> Generators in the mission "Self Awareness" in the game, which contributes to the behavior where its engine ejects aeon particles during acceleration at high speeds.</p>
<p>In the game's alternative storyline, Rena piloted the aircraft to destroy its own airborne carrier instead of "Megafloat". However, Dision retaliated by activating a remote <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-destruction.html" title="Self-destruction">self-destruction</a> mechanism that was installed in the aircraft, causing it to explode afterwards. The aircraft landed near the island and Rena was able to escape from the aircraft.</p>
<p>Due to the wings' unique design, the aircraft has incredible maneuverability compared to other aircraft in the game. A complete vertical loop can be performed by this aircraft in less than two seconds, while conventional aircraft require approximately ten seconds to perform the same maneuver. Engine noise has a unique high pitch, although the volume decreases considerably when it reaches speeds in excess of 4300km/h. The special engine allows the aircraft to propell to top speeds in excess of 4000km/h without the help of gravity, and can reach its maximum speed of 5068km/h otherwise. When compared to the XR-900 Geopelia, this aircraft is significantly heavier. However, it can reach a slightly higher speed in practice (difference within 5km/h). It relies on air passing through the gaps of its wings to provide stability during flight. The large gaps also make the aircraft incredibly difficult for <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missiles.html" title="Missiles">missiles</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine-guns.html" title="Machine-guns">machine-guns</a> to hit it successfully.</p>
<p>This aircraft has one of the largest missile capacities of all aircraft in the game at 184 missiles. It can acquire missile lock-on as far as 2455m for aircraft targets and 2043m for ground targets. The aircraft can only be fitted with a unique Laser Cannon weapon. The laser is fired from the center of the aircraft and can last approximinately one second per fire. In addition, it can withstand heavy damage.</p>

It has a sky blue color scheme and is manufactured by Neucom Inc. Models operated by the Universal Peace Enforcement Organization have a tan color scheme. It is the entry model in the Delphinus series - nicknamed "Delphinus" (dolphin) presumably because of the aircraft's unique shape.</p>
<p>The blue color scheme model is not playable in the game's storyline. It has a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardioid.html" title="Cardioid">cardioid</a>-shape tail and two fuselages in a lightweight construction. Its engine is silent during acceleration and can propell the aircraft to speeds up to 2856km/h. It is the only model in the Delphinus series that cannot be equipped with the Pulse Laser [[machine-gunand also without an engine protrusion under the body. As an entry-level model in the Delphinus series, it delivers good maneuverability and fast acceleration, due to its light weight (8098kg). It can carry up to 88 <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missiles.html" title="Missiles">missiles</a>. It can acquire missile lock-on as far as 2043m for both aircraft and ground targets. Due to its small consturction, it can only endure light damage.</p>

It has a purple color scheme and is manufactured by Neucom Inc. It is the middle model in the Delphinus series - nicknamed "Delphinus" (dolphin) presumably because of the aircraft's unique shape.</p>
<p>Unlike other models in the Delphinus series, the R-102 Delphinus#2 has a more discrete-looking engine at the bottom of the aircraft. Air intakes are located between the aircraft body and the engine that almost resembles a mouth. As a result it is unlike any real-world fighter aircraft. Its maneuverability is theoretically better than the R-103 Delphinus#3 by a small margin, according to performance ratings in the game. However, its worse stability performance makes this not the case in practice. It can carry up to 128 <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missiles.html" title="Missiles">missiles</a>. It can acquire missile lock-on as far as 2246m for aircraft targets and 2275m for ground targets. Due to its small consturction, it can only withstand light damage.</p>

Its design is somewhat similar to the <a href="../../../a/d/f/ADF-01_Falken_0f27.html" title="ADF-01 Falken">ADF-01 Falken</a>. It is the top model in the Delphinus series - nicknamed "Delphinus" (dolphin) presumably because of the aircraft's unique shape.</p>
<p>It is the lightest (10040kg) advanced fighter aircraft available in the game, due to its unique shape and an advanced engine developed by Neucom Inc. Together they make the aircraft very quick to accelerate to top speeds. Its engine noise is considerably more silent and has a lower <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitch.html" title="Pitch">pitch</a> than other aircraft in its class. In addition, it can reach a higher maximum speed (3920km/h) than many other advanced fighter aircraft, such as the <a href="../../../x/f/a/XFA-36A_Game_32b0.html" title="XFA-36A Game">XFA-36A Game</a> and Su-43 Berkut. One interesting design feature is the vertical missile firing system. Unlike conventional fighter aircraft where <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missiles.html" title="Missiles">missiles</a> are launched from the two wings, the R-103 Delphinus#3 launches missiles from the center. Unlike other Delphinus models, it contains canards and the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardioid.html" title="Cardioid">cardioid</a>-shape tail is joined together with the body, giving it a more integrated appearance. It can carry up to 168 missiles, and can acquire missile lock-on as far as 2455m for aircraft targets and 2275m for ground targets. These statistics exceed even that of the XR-900 Geopelia and <a href="../../../x/-/4/X-49_Night_Raven_2eb1.html" title="X-49 Night Raven">X-49 Night Raven</a>.</p>

R-201 Asterozoa</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The R-201 Asterozoa is a fictional attacker aircraft specifically designed for <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air-to-ground.html" title="Air-to-ground">air-to-ground</a> attacks. It has a lime color scheme and is manufacturered by Neucom Inc. Models operated by the Universal Peace Enforcement Organization have a tan color scheme. It is the only aircraft in the game to feature two <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canopies.html" title="Canopies">canopies</a>.</p>
<p>It has a twin-fuselage design, to carry more fuel and ammunition with less aerodynamic drag than a single-fuselage aircraft. Each one contains a canopy, which suggests it can be piloted from each one. The fuselages are connected by its <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannon.html" title="Cannon">Cannon</a> machine-gun hanging at the center, which also improves aerodynamics and stability. This model breaks several design conventions of Neucom Inc. aircraft. First, it is the slowest aircraft in the game with a maximum speed of only 1540km/h. While lower maximum speeds is a common trait of attacker aircraft, the slow acceleration and speed of this aircraft makes it particular vulnerable to <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missile.html" title="Missile">missile</a> attacks as its ability to evade them is relatively limited. All other Neucom Inc. aircraft are the fastest in their respective class. The engine appears to be of an older design, with louder noise and higher pitch. In addition, it is one of the few Neucom Inc. models that cannot be equipped with the Pulse Laser <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine-gun.html" title="Machine-gun">machine-gun</a>. It can carry up to 104 missiles. It can acquire missile lock-on as far as 2043m for aircraft targets and 2275m for ground targets. Due to its large construction, the aircraft can survive heavy damage.</p>

<p>The R-311 Remora is a fictional <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_aircraft.html" title="Fighter aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> specifically designed for <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogfights.html" title="Dogfights">dogfights</a> in the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratosphere.html" title="Stratosphere">stratosphere</a>. Its design resembles a <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocket.html" title="Rocket">rocket</a> or a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missile.html" title="Missile">missile</a>. It is manufactured by Neucom Inc.</p>
<p>This fighter aircraft is only playable in the mission "Power for Life" in the game. In the mission, they are launched from R-531 Mobura transport aircraft in the stratosphere. Its body is long and narrow with three fins at its rear. The power source is likely a rocket since the aircraft lacks air intakes to operate at high <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altitudes.html" title="Altitudes">altitudes</a>. The engine is silent during acceleration similar to other Neucom Inc. aircraft. Being the lightest aircraft (less than 8000kg) in the game, it can accelerate close to its maximum speed (5068km/h) without the help of gravity. However, due to its thin body and design, its <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerodynamics.html" title="Aerodynamics">aerodynamics</a> makes it unstable during flight and unable to make nimble turns. Designed to fly in the stratosphere, it can reach higher altitudes while maintaining speed and stability. As with the EF-2000E Typhoon II, it has the smallest missile capacity of all aircraft in the game at 72 missiles. It can acquire missile lock-on as far as 2043m for aircraft targets and 2275m for ground targets. Due to its small construction, it can only sustain light damage.</p>

<p>The R-352 Sepia is a fictional fighter <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spacecraft.html" title="Spacecraft">spacecraft</a>. Its shape is similar to the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Shuttle_Colombia_3be8.html" title="Space Shuttle Colombia">Space Shuttle Colombia</a>. It is manufactured by Neucom Inc. It is the first and only playable spacecraft featured in the <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_626c.html" title="Ace Combat">Ace Combat</a> series.</p>
<p>This fighter spacecraft is only playable in the mission "Zero Gravity" in the game. It is launched with the help of rocket boosters from a launching pad located at a small island under the control of Neucom Inc. During the launching event, fighter aircraft and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antlions.html" title="Antlions">antlions</a> from General Resource Defence Force attempted to raid the base station in order to destroy the R-352 Sepia during its flight into <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space.html" title="Space">space</a>, and to also seize control of the island facilities. Peacekeeping aircraft from the Universal Peace Enforcement Organization arrived to protect the spacecraft on its way into space. In the mission, the R-352 Sepia destroyed four Orbital Satellite Lasers in space, which were operated by the General Resource Defence Force. The satellites were designed to fire powerful <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser_beams.html" title="Laser beams">laser beams</a> which can destroy any object in the game in one hit.</p>
<p>The R-352 Sepia has <a href="../../../h/r/s/HRSI_13c4.html" title="HRSI">HRSI</a> tiles on its bottom allowing it to safely re-enter into the <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmosphere.html" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>. In the game's story, aircraft from the General Resource Defence Force also attempted to destroy the spacecraft after it re-entered and attempted to land on the island. The handling of this spacecraft is different from all other aircraft in the game. Due to the lack of atmosphere in space, heavy inertia occurs when it changes direction while it is in motion. It is equipped with weapons designed for space combat including the Neutron Beam and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_Beam_c476.html" title="Plasma Beam">Plasma Beam</a>. The spacecraft can carry up to 156 <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missiles.html" title="Missiles">missiles</a>. It can acquire missile lock-on as far as 2043m for flying targets. Designed to withstand atmospheric friction during re-entry, it can endure heavy damage.</p>

XR-900 Geopelia</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The XR-900 Geopelia is an advanced, fictional <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_aircraft.html" title="Fighter aircraft">fighter aircraft</a>. Its shape resembles a <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boomerang.html" title="Boomerang">boomerang</a> and is the most futuristic and radical aircraft design in the <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_626c.html" title="Ace Combat">Ace Combat</a> series. Its appearance is very similar to the <a href="../../../x/-/4/X-49_Night_Raven_2eb1.html" title="X-49 Night Raven">X-49 Night Raven</a>, except that is has a silver color scheme instead of black. It is manufacturered by Neucom Inc.</p>
<p>In the game's story eight XR-900 Geopelia aircraft were piloted by submininated <a href="../../../a/i/_/AI_0a40.html" title="AI">AI</a> programs (unmanned) controlled by the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist_organization.html" title="Terrorist organization">terrorist organization</a> Ouroboros. Due to the wings' unique design, the aircraft has incredible maneuverability compared to other aircraft in the game. A complete vertical loop can be performed by this aircraft in less than two seconds, while conventional aircraft require approximately ten seconds to perform the same maneuver. The engine ejects <a href="../../../a/e/o/Aeon.html" title="Aeon">aeon</a> particles when it accelerates and reaches a speed of approximinately 1680km/h. Engine noise has a unique high pitch, although the volume decreases considerably when it reaches speeds in excess of 4300km/h. The special engine allows the aircraft to propel to top speeds in excess of 4000km/h without the help of gravity, and can reach its maximum speed of 5068km/h otherwise. When compared to the X-49 Night Raven, this aircraft is significantly lighter. However, it reaches a slightly lower speed in practice (difference within 5km/h). It relies on air passing through the gaps of its wings to provide stability during flight. The large gaps also makes the aircraft incredibly difficult for <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missiles.html" title="Missiles">missiles</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine-guns.html" title="Machine-guns">machine-guns</a> to hit it successfully.</p>
<p>This aircraft has the largest missile capacity of all aircraft in the game at 192 missiles. It can acquire missile lock-on as far as 2455m for aircraft targets and 2043m for ground targets. The aircraft can only be fitted with a unique Laser Cannon weapon. The laser is fired from the center of the aircraft and can last approximately one second per fire. In addition, it can withstand heavy damage.</p>
<p>Weapons available for this aircraft include:</p>

<p>The UI-4054 Aurora is an advanced, fictional <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_aircraft.html" title="Fighter aircraft">fighter aircraft</a>. It shape has some resemblance to the <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_Advanced_fighter_6567.html" title="TIE/Advanced fighter">TIE/Advanced fighter</a> featured in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> series, along with a similar color scheme.

<p>It possesses four parallel jet engines positioned at the bottom center of the body. Two vertical stabilizer fins positioned on the back of the aircraft improves its maneuverability, rivaling the Su-43 Berkut. In addition, it has two small delta-shaped wings for yawing. There are four parallel intake ramps at the front part of the body that take air through the engine, after which is ejected through its four parallel <a href="../../../a/f/t/Afterburner.html" title="Afterburner">afterburner</a> ramps. It can carry up to 176 <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missiles.html" title="Missiles">missiles</a>, and can acquire missile lock-on as far as 2455m for aircraft targets and 2275m for ground targets. While its attacking ability is slightly behind the <a href="../../../x/f/a/XFA-36A_Game_32b0.html" title="XFA-36A Game">XFA-36A Game</a>, it can sustain heavier damage.</p>
