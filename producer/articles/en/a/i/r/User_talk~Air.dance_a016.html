<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Anne-sexton stewart.png</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Air.dance_9dce.html" title="Special:Contributions/Air.dance">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<p>I was doing them as a job lot - it seemed easier to copy paste into all the talk pages in one go, they all have a template now. In terms of references, it is my understanding that articles must have references, this is not the same thing as having a reference section. Sometimes I do create that section and add refs to it with the &lt;ref&gt; citation method. Other times I just nominate the article assuming that since the refs are there and its just a formatting thing the lack of a section will not exclude it from being a GA.

<dl>
<dd>Oh, okay, sorry for jumping the gun there on the templates! About the refs, though.. hrm. If the refs aren't stated in any clearly delineated sec (refs, sources, notes, etc.) would we be able to count them as such? For example, it looked the Windows article might have had refs listed under the External Links sec, but there was no way of telling. Cheers! <a href="../../../a/i/r/User%7EAir.dance_a424.html" title="User:Air.dance">Air.dance</a> 04:13, 26 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah you're right, I was hoping I wouldn't be spending all my time creating reference sections for good articles that just lack the section, but I guess that is part of the point of the process. No point nominating if I'm not prepared to fix a few issues first... I kinda hoped somebody else might do it&#160;:-) (can you tell I'm a slacker already...) Ah well it's a dirty job but somebody has to do it. I suppose I'm getting sort of used to it now, the old &lt;ref&gt;citation&lt;/ref&gt; at least is easier to use than previous methods.</dd>
<dd>A point that's worth making though is that there are quite a few articles in the main GA page that slipped in at setup and probably need fixed up or weeded out. Regards <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanMack_83e5.html" title="User:SeanMack">SeanMack</a> 15:14, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm confused. Before I nominated <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacutainer.html" title="Vacutainer">Vacutainer</a>, I read each of the URL's that were referenced inline to be sure they comprised the facts listed in the article. They did, except for the mention of OJ Simpson. You delisted with the rationale "<a href="../../../v/a/c/Talk%7EVacutainer_493d.html" title="Talk:Vacutainer">No references</a>". Did you mean there were no references for the OJ Simpson reference? I've seen many Good Articles and even Featured Articles that are mostly referenced, but may have a fact here or there unreferenced. I thought such minor transgressions were allowed for GAs. But of course, we could just dig up a reference for the OJ Simpson bit, or delete it entirely.

<dd>Aw, crap, I didn't even see those -- I was doing a sweep for actual ref sections (a heading entiled Notes, Sources, Refs, etc.) and totally missed the inline URLs.

<p>Hey Airdance. There is a lively debate about use of promo photos on wikipedia. My name is Jeff and I <b>Do not support</b> the interpretation of <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> as implemented by user's like <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok">User:Chowbok</a>. They believe that Wikipedia should be free of all promotional photos that are "replaceable with an equivalent" (i.e. an amateur photo from flickr). Their rationale is being debated in many places, and take it a step further believing that <b>all promo photos should be deleted and let someone else deal with finding and uploading a free alternative.</b></p>

<p>And many other places I've no doubt missed.</p>
<p>I and many others who support use of fair use promotional photos have not been successful in changing the actions of Chowbok and rampant deletion and changing of many hundred's of useful images from Wikipedia articles continues. One good example is the <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Granholm_43a0.html" title="Jennifer Granholm">Jennifer Granholm</a> article which had a great promo photo replaced by a terrible photo. I seek to raise the profile of this issue through challenging promotional photos on high profile article's like <a href="../../../i/n/a/Ina_Garten_8454.html" title="Ina Garten">Ina Garten</a> which is a front page, feature article. I'm sorry, really I am, but fair use policy as implemented by Chowbok has left me with few viable options.</p>
<p>I invite you to join the battle for Promotional Photo usage on Wikipedia and the protection of Fair Use concepts. --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffness_f8de.html" title="User:Jeffness">Jeff</a> 06:46, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
