<dd>I disagree. We can't know if the changes we are making to the atmosphere are for good. For instance, if we talk about water pollution, and i throw sugar on a river, i'm not damaging the water, i'm making it sweeter!. Maybe the sugar is harmless, maybe it's not, but i have polluted the river. Polution comes from the latin "pollere" meaning "soil" and "defile". On the other side, From The Longman Dictionary of Environmental Science, as "any harmful or undesirable change in the physical, chemical or biological quality of air, water or soil . . . ". I think there is a strong controversy here, some definitions include harm made by humans and by nature (ie: the explosion of a volcano), and some definitions accept changes to the environment that are not harmful (for instance, aesthetic changes, or ) as being non-pollution. Maybe we should put both views here. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaTo_669c.html" title="User:ChaTo">user:ChaTo</a> Thursday, July 18, 2002.</dd>

<p>its not the point whether we are making changes for the good or not. any change from prehistoric times is simply a change and de facto pollution of the atmosphere. we are not smart enough to judge what effect these changes will have on people and ecosystems. our job is to factually record in wikipedia what these changes or pollutants are. maybe the phrase is "materially alter the content of air". its a mouthful though and someone can come up with a better wording <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> February 17, 2006</p>
<p>Hey. I disagree with ChaTo on the sugar part, when you add sugar on a river or water, there's no way you will have water again. You anticipated a product from the mixture, which is "sweet water" but not water. And yes it does damage the water because it natural flavor isn't there anymore, and sugar isn't a safe substance for human due to the fact that we do have diabetic agents within our enviroment. And to continue with the main subject, I think that air pollution is an enormous issues, and i indeed appreciate the effort done by the engineers, scientists, enviromentalists, and all those that volunteer to put an end to this matter. The French, Russians, Japonese, and many more are contributed on that behalf by operating their vehicle with water, hybrid and diesel instead of gasoline. which are steps that prove that they are working to reduce the chances for "Global warming", and many incidents to come. User:nikel81ex Tuesday, March 20, 2007</p>
<p>But still, what is a "natural state" of the atmosphere? When the first leaf plants began to produce oxygen (a poison from some perspective) a mass extinction followed. IMHO, pollution definitions are very atropocentric - if it harms the human body, it is a pollution. Also, pollution is not only man-made: think about a volcano, even if its natural, we call it a polluter. --Oderbolz 06:07, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True. A better example in this context would be carbon monoxide.<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Will McW</a> 23:06, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I am afraid it all depends what you mean by 'air pollutant'. There are natural sources of carbon monoxide as well as of carbon dioxide (especially natural wildfires). Ozone is also essential for life as we know it - without the ozone layer levels of ultraviolet light would be huge. However there is no doubt in most people's minds that low level ozone is a pollutant. The point about CO<sub>2</sub> is that its levels are substantially elevated above the levels observed in recent geological time and is now believed by most scientists to be changing the climate. A good definition of air pollution is that from the state of Maine:
<blockquote>
<p>"Air pollution" means the presence in the outdoor atmosphere of one or more air contaminants in sufficient quantities and of such characteristics and duration as to be injurious to human, plant or animal life or to property, or which unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of life and property throughout the State or throughout such areas of the State as shall be affected thereby.<a href="http://janus.state.me.us/legis/statutes/38/title38sec582.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://janus.state.me.us/legis/statutes/38/title38sec582.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
Although I would extend that to be global rather than one state and to also include indoor air pollution. Still, in the context of the article, CO is probably a better example. This is probably also relevant to the above discusion as well.--<a href="../../../n/h/s/User%7ENHSavage_61bf.html" title="User:NHSavage">NHSavage</a> 09:49, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This image was removed with the rationale "these particuates are from concrete &amp; road dirt, not air pollution." I have replaced the image. I agree the the particulates may be mostly from concrete and 'road dirt.' However, according to the article, these are in fact sources of air pollution.

<p>Basically, yes.

<dd>Particulates are the chief form of air pollution in many communities, especially those engaged in agriculture, and can be a major health problem.

<dd>The other question is what one means by pollution. Particulates with a diameter greater than 2.5 microns may not be considered pollution by the EPA (the standard in the UK actually has an upper cut off at 10 microns) but they may still have harmful effects. Some examples of this could be the soiling caused by the particulates or the radiative effects. Many people would feel that reduced visibility itself is undesireable. Not all pollution is simply about effects on human health. I agree we might find a better picture though. I'll have a think.--<a href="../../../n/h/s/User%7ENHSavage_61bf.html" title="User:NHSavage">NHSavage</a> 23:22, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Air pollution is a broad term. there are several fields under air pollution. Air toxics is in itself a big field of study. There is a seperate section at USEPA office which is working on Air toxics. <a href="http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/index.html</a> I am a graduate student in atmospheric sciences working on Air Quality issues at NC state university and currently working on a project to develop a full fledged course on air toxics.

As Naserke (please sign your edits&#160;:-)) is the graduate student in atmospheric sciences I am not going to argue either side, there seems to be an overlap, but if there is potential for separation then thats fine. However, the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_toxics.html" title="Air toxics">Air toxics</a> article needs considerable formatting work done, especially wikification, its still a monstrosity! And as you pointed out TomTheHand, its not particularly useful solely as a copy of another site, it might as well just be an external link on this page if we're going to keep it like that. Basically, it just needs to be brought into line with the stern hand of Wikipedia&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdcooper_7efd.html" title="User:Jdcooper">Jdcooper</a> 18:10, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Air toxics should be linked to air pollution not merged. the notion of toxics is clearly separated from air pollution in general. for example CO is not a carcinogen, but radon is. air toxics is an important topic in itself and should not be redirected or merged here. <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 14:15, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The term 'air pollution' is an umbrella term and encompasses a wide range of topics including both criteria pollutants such as ozone and particulates and also air toxics such as benzene. I believe criteria air pollutants are those which EPA has set national ambient air quality standards for, and air toxics do not have standards. I think the air pollution page should have an air toxics subsection with general overview and a link to a separate air toxics page which contains more detailed information.

<p>I happened to hear mention about this on one or another NPR program, perhaps Science Friday, about a couple of weeks ago. I don't know how controversial it is or what the quantitative dependencies are understood to be (how much more CO2 would cause how much of a lower pH). Also, I haven't heard mention about how much ocean pH would need to lower by in order to have an effect on marine life. As I understand it, the greatest effects would be on the more primitive or "lower echelon" life forms such as coral and plankton and these would in turn affect things which feed on them, which indirectly means everything in the water. This sounds like a pretty important consequence of something happening in the atmosphere. I mention it on this talk page because it would be one effect of an increase in the level of carbon dioxide in the air and believe this would probably justify a brief mention with a link to any more relevant existing article about the ocean or ocean pollution, such as may exist. I was thinking I would add such info if/when I can find more references. Perhaps I am just not looking in the right place. If anyone else knows more about a wikipedia precedent for this feel free to pipe in. I don't want to reinvent the wheel, so to speak. -<a href="../../../o/n/c/User%7EOnceler_94a0.html" title="User:Onceler">Onceler</a> 01:59, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On a cautionary note, reference to primary and secondary pollutants does seem to be common elsewhere and as such might have had a place in the article--I base this only on a google search. As I am not familiar with them, might I ask, what are primary and secondary standards? Could both senses (re pollutants/re standards) be used if they are properly defined? -<a href="../../../o/n/c/User%7EOnceler_94a0.html" title="User:Onceler">Onceler</a> 15:55, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I was not aware of these terms with respect to standards myself, I'll mention this for future reference. Regarding</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>standards:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The EPA ranks regulations in accordance with who or what they are intended to protect as <i>primary</i> ("human health, including sensitive populations such as children, the elderly, and individuals suffering from respiratory disease") and <i>secondary</i> ("public welfare" such as "building facades, visibility, crops, and domestic animals"). This is per the article <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Ambient_Air_Quality_Standards_4a0e.html" title="National Ambient Air Quality Standards">National Ambient Air Quality Standards</a> as sourced from the EPA website. Does anyone know if these terms are based on any other more general or universal regulatory framework outside the EPA?</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>pollutants:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Primary</i> and <i>secondary</i> had formerly been used in this article to refer respectively to pollutants which are released directly and those which form after the fact from some combination of primary pollutants and/or other substances. It would be worthwhile knowing whether there are alternate formal or more appropriate terms to indicate the same thing.<br /></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, my comment is to weigh in on the relevance of primary/secondary distinctions in both senses and that there need not be confusion within the article as long as references are made clearly and appropriate caveats noted. Something like the above bullets might be worthwhile putting in the article itself. Unless more appropriate terminology is found, it would be better for this article to include and clarify multiple-sense terms which might cause confusion instead of ducking the question for the sake of convenience. -<a href="../../../o/n/c/User%7EOnceler_94a0.html" title="User:Onceler">Onceler</a> 02:04, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
