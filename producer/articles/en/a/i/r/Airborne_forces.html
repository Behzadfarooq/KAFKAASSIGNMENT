<p><b>Airborne forces</b> are <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">military</a> units, usually <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_infantry.html" title="Light infantry">light infantry</a>, set up to be moved by <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft.html" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> and 'dropped' into battle. Thus they can be placed behind enemy lines, and have an ability to deploy almost anywhere with little warning. The formations are limited only by the number and size of their aircraft, so given enough capacity a huge force can appear "out of nowhere" in minutes, an action referred to as <i>vertical envelopment</i>.</p>
<p>Conversely, airborne forces typically lack the supplies and equipment for prolonged combat operations, and are therefore more suited for <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airhead.html" title="Airhead">airhead</a> operations than long-term occupation; furthermore, parachute operations are particularly sensitive to adverse weather conditions. Advances in <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopter</a> technology since <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> have brought increased flexibility to the scope of airborne operations, and helicopters have largely replaced large-scale <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parachute.html" title="Parachute">parachute</a> operations, and (almost) completely replaced combat glider operations. Due to the limited range of helicopters and the limited number of troops that can be transported by them many countries retain <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paratrooper.html" title="Paratrooper">Paratroopers</a> as a valuable strategic asset. The first military to actually use airborne forces in combat was Russia.</p>

<p>Airborne forces can be divided into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/a/r/Paratrooper.html" title="Paratrooper">Paratroopers</a> — landed by parachute from aircraft,</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/l/i/Glider_infantry.html" title="Glider infantry">Airlanding</a> troops — landed by aircraft (usually <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_glider.html" title="Military glider">glider</a>),</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_assault.html" title="Air assault">Air assault</a> troops or airmobile infantry — transported to the battle by helicopter or by aircraft.</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic premise of the Airborne is that they can arrive with such speed that a coherent defence cannot be mounted against them for some time. It is assumed that this tactical advantage cannot be sustained for very long, so effective Airborne missions require the rapid advance of ground based troops in support.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airborne_forces.html" title="Edit section: Early history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early history</span></h2>
<p>The idea of "Sky Soldiers" is by no means a recent thought; <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Franklin_3062.html" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> envisioned a time when soldiers would be delivered from the sky, with a crude, rudimentary understanding of parachutes. The first modern consideration of the use of what we now call a paratroop force dates back to <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>. Towards the end of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Mitchell_5084.html" title="Billy Mitchell">Brigadier General Billy Mitchell</a> suggested dropping elements of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._1st_Infantry_Division_d8ad.html" title="U.S. 1st Infantry Division">United States 1st Infantry Division</a> behind German lines near <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metz.html" title="Metz">Metz</a>. The war ended before such an attack could be seriously planned. It's somewhat unclear how this was to be achieved given the state of development of both the parachute and aircraft at the time.</p>
<p>The first true paratroop drop was carried out by <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> in November <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>. Within a few years several battalions had been raised and were eventually formed into the two elite Folgore and Nembo divisions. Although these would go on to fight with distinction in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the divisions were never used in a parachute drop. Men drawn from the Italian parachute forces were dropped in a distrous special forces operation in North Africa in 1943 in an attempt to destroy on the ground aircraft of the USAAF based there. In 1945 men drawn from the Folgore and Nembo and operating with British equipment and under British command as No 1 Italian Special Air Service Regiment dropped in small groups from American aircraft and carried out a successful railway sabotage operation in Northern Italy known Operation Patata|Potato.</p>
<p>At about the same time the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> was also experimenting with the idea, planning to eventually drop entire units complete with vehicles including light tanks. To train enough experienced jumpers, parachute clubs were set up all over <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> with the aim of being able to transfer skilled members (or at least the men) into the armed forces if needed. Planning and organization progressed to the point that Corps-size drops were demonstrated to foreign observers, including the British Military Attache Archibald <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wavell.html" title="Wavell">Wavell</a>, in the Kiev military district maneuvers of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>. By the late 1930s, the USSR possessed the largest Airborne forces in the world, but development stagnated prior to WW2 as a result of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Purge_75df.html" title="Great Purge">Great Purge</a><sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since April 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>One of the observing parties, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, was particularly interested. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, Major F W Immans was ordered to set up a parachute school at Stendal (Borstel), and was allocated a number of <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junkers_Ju_52_e67c.html" title="Junkers Ju 52">Junkers Ju 52 aircraft</a> to train on. The military had already purchased large numbers of Junkers Ju 52 aircraft which were now modified (slightly) for use as paratroop transports in addition to their other duties. The first training classw was known as "Ausbildungskommando Immans", They commenced the first course on May 3rd, 1936.</p>
<p>Other nations, including <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>,<a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> also organized airborne units around this time.</p>

<p>Several groups within the German armed forces attempted to raise their own paratroop formations, resulting in confusion. As a result, <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> General <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Student_ed81.html" title="Kurt Student">Kurt Student</a> was put in overall command of developing a paratrooper force to be known as the <i><a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallschirmj%C3%A4ger.html" title="Fallschirmjäger">Fallschirmjäger</a></i>.</p>
<p>During the invasion of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Weser%C3%BCbung_2f0d.html" title="Operation Weserübung">Operation Weserübung</a> the Luftwaffe dropped paratroopers on several locations. In Denmark a small unit was dropped on the Masnedøfort on the small island of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masned%C3%B8.html" title="Masnedø">Masnedø</a> to seize the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storstr%C3%B8m_Bridge_2580.html" title="Storstrøm Bridge">Storstrøm Bridge</a> linking the islands of <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falster.html" title="Falster">Falster</a> and <a href="../../../z/e/a/Zealand.html" title="Zealand">Zealand</a>. A paratroop detachment was also dropped at the airfield of <a href="../../../a/a/l/Aalborg_Air_Base_4cad.html" title="Aalborg Air Base">Aalborg</a> which was crucial for the Luftwaffe for operations over Norway. In Norway a company of paratroopers was dropped at Oslo's undefended airstrip. Over the course of the morning and early afternoon of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_9.html" title="April 9">April 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, the Germans flew in sufficient reinforcements to move into the capital in the afternoon, but by that time the Norwegian government had fled.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_France_ab9b.html" title="Battle of France">Battle of France</a>, members of the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandenburgers.html" title="Brandenburgers">Brandenburg Regiment</a> were landed by <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fieseler_Fi_156_5354.html" title="Fieseler Fi 156">Fieseler Fi 156</a> Storch light reconnaissance planes on the bridges immediately to the south of the 10th <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panzer_Division_f92a.html" title="Panzer Division">Panzer Division</a>'s route of march through the southern <a href="../../../a/r/d/Ardennes.html" title="Ardennes">Ardennes</a>. In <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> a small group of German glider-borne troops landed on top of the Belgian fortress of <a href="../../../e/b/e/Eben_Emael_430a.html" title="Eben Emael">Eben Emael</a> on the morning of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_10.html" title="May 10">May 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> and it was captured in a matter of hours. This opened up Belgium to attack by the German Army Group B.</p>
<p>Two simultaneous airborne operations were made during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Netherlands_ea1d.html" title="Battle of the Netherlands">invasion of the Netherlands</a>. German paratroopers landed at an airport near <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hague_6158.html" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>, hoping to seize the Dutch government. But they were driven out of the airport before they were reinforced by troops brought in by <a href="../../../j/u/-/Ju-52.html" title="Ju-52">Ju-52s</a>. This was one of the few occasions where an airfield captured by paratroops has been recaptured. Simultaneously the Germans dropped small packets of paratroopers to seize the crucial bridges that led directly across the Netherlands and into the heart of the country. They opened the way for the 10th Panzer Division. Within a day the Dutch position was hopeless. Nevertheless, Dutch forces inflicted a high loss of transportation aircraft on the Germans.</p>
<p>The Fallschirmjäger's greatest victory and greatest losses occured during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Crete_4bf7.html" title="Battle of Crete">Battle of Crete</a>. The <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra.html" title="Ultra">Ultra</a> enabled the British to wait on each German drop zone, yet despite compromised secrecy, surviving German paratroops and airlanded mountain troops pushed the Commonwealth forces off the island in part by unexpected fire support from LG40 recoilless rifles. However, the losses were so great that <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> forbade their use in such operations in the future. He felt that the main power of the paratroop was novelty, and now that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> had clearly figured out how to defend against them, there was no real point to using them any more.</p>
<p>There was one notable exception to this and that was the use of airborne forces in special operations.

Convinced of the effectiveness of airborne assaults, the Allies hurried to organize their own airborne units.</p>
<p>A fundamental decision was whether to create small Airborne units to be used in coup-de-main type operations, or to organize entire Airborne Divisions for larger operations. Many of the early, successful Airborne operations were coups-de-main carried out by very small units. The Allies eventually formed two British and five US Airborne Divisions: the British <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_Airborne_Division_ee23.html" title="1st Airborne Division">1st Airborne Division</a> and <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_Airborne_Division_8302.html" title="6th Airborne Division">6th Airborne Division</a>, and the US <a href="../../../1/1/t/11th_Airborne_Division_6f0f.html" title="11th Airborne Division">11th Airborne Division</a>, <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_Airborne_Division_9756.html" title="13th Airborne Division">13th Airborne Division</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_Airborne_Division_a34b.html" title="17th Airborne Division">17th Airborne Division</a>, <a href="../../../8/2/n/82nd_Airborne_Division_9932.html" title="82nd Airborne Division">82nd Airborne Division</a>, and <a href="../../../1/0/1/101st_Airborne_Division_bd51.html" title="101st Airborne Division">101st Airborne Division</a>.

The U.S. 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion flew 1500 miles from Britain, over Spain, intending to drop near Oran and capture two airfields. The drop was a fiasco.

<p>As part of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Husky_ac7e.html" title="Operation Husky">Operation Husky</a> four airborne operations were carried out, landing during the night of the <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">9</a>/<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">10 July</a>; two were British and two American. The American troops were the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._82nd_Airborne_Division_2dd0.html" title="U.S. 82nd Airborne Division">U.S. 82nd Airborne Division</a>, making their first combat <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parachute.html" title="Parachute">parachute</a> jump. The strong winds blew the dropping aircraft off course and scattered them widely; the result was that around half the US paratroops failed to make it to their rallying points. British <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glider.html" title="Glider">glider</a>-landed troops fared little better; only 12 out of 144 gliders landing on target, many landing in the sea. Nevertheless the scattered airborne troops maximised their opportunities, attacking patrols and creating confusion wherever possible. Some reserve 82nd paratroops dropped later during the campaign. This resulted in heavy <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friendly_fire.html" title="Friendly fire">friendly-fire</a> casualties when U.S Navy ships shot down 23 of the transports as they flew over the beachhead.</p>
<p>The First Air Landing Brigade captured the Ponte Grande Bridge and before the Germans counter attack, the beach landings took place unopposed and the First Air Landing Brigade were relieved by the 8th Army as it swept inland and north towards Catania and Messina.

The British First Parachute Brigade's initial target was to capture the Primosole bridge and the high ground around it, providing a pathway for the 8th Army, but heavy anti-aircraft fire shot down many of the Dakotas before they reached their target. Only 295 officers and men were dropped close enough to carry out the assault on the bridge. They captured the bridge but the German 4th Parachute Brigade recaptured it. They held the high ground until relived by the 8th Army, but the mission had been a failure.</p>
<p>The Allied command was forced to reassess the use of airborne forces after the many misdrops and the deadly <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friendly_fire.html" title="Friendly fire">friendly fire</a> incident. However, improved training and some tactical changes kept Airborne units in the war, eventually in much-increased numbers.</p>

<p>The Soviets mounted no large-scale Airborne operations in WW2, despite their early leadership in the field in the 1930s. The largest drop was Brigade-sized, and was not successful. However, Airborne formations were used as elite Infantry units and played a critical role in several battles. For example, at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Kursk_74b4.html" title="Battle of Kursk">Battle of Kursk</a>, the defense of the eastern 'shoulder' of the southern penetration by Guards Airborne units was critical to holding back the German penetration.</p>
<p>Russia pioneered the development of combat gliders, but used them only for cargo during the war.</p>
