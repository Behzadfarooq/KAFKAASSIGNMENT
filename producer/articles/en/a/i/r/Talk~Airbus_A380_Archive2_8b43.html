<h2><span class="mw-headline">Whalejet</span></h2>
<p>The term "Whalejet" is certainly in use, as a quick googling reveals, but mostly amongst a certain community, best described as relentlessly POV. I don't think that including this term in the lead para is appropriate.</p>
<p>The editor supporting this usage seems to have a history of revert-warring on unsourced quotes and nicknames. Saying that something is "oft-quoted" is all very well, but without a source, we can't use it.</p>
<p>(I certainly hadn't heard the term "Whalejet" previously, and if asked, I would have connected it with the "Orca" B737s of Southwest - very striking and handsome aircraft indeed.) --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 17:56, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Likewise with "Whalejet". No checkable source given, and even if it was used in an aviation machine, the general usage is very POV and negative, unlike "Superjumbo" which looks like it has been widely taken up by the aviation community and especially the press as a useful word for a class of aircraft beyond the well-loved "jumbo jet". --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 22:56, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks. But that's hardly an unbiased viewpoint. There's not a word against Boeing in it. Nobody's disputing that the term is in circulation, but it's used in a derogatory sense. You might as well go to the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">Slavery</a> article and insist that "nigger" is a good word to use there. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 04:47, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hardly think you can compare the two.

<dd>I'm not <b>comparing</b> the two. I'm pointing out that the principle is the same. Using words in a derogatory sense is not good encyclopaedic practice. With BUFF and SLUFF, the usage isn't derogatory, even though one might think so by looking at the words behind the acronyms. Looking at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-52_Stratofortress#Trivia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-52_Stratofortress#Trivia" rel="nofollow">B-52</a> article, I see this quote:
<ul>
<li><i>Among its crew, the B-52 is affectionately known as the "BUFF"</i></li>

<p>See my comment above: "<i>the general usage is very POV and negative</i>". I got that from "a quick look at Google". It seems our impressions differ. In any case, I invite you to compare the relative number of hits returned by googling the two search terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Whalejet 380"</li>
<li>"Superjumbo 380"</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't mind if you start off a section on nicknames, but including a rarely used and arguably derogatory term in the lead paragraph is going a bit far. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 08:10, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> - I have certainly never heard of the term <i>whalejet</i> used to describe the A380 (certainly not in Europe), and if it was used I don't think it's very complimentary. If I think "whalejet", the first thing that comes to mind is the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus_Beluga_7736.html" title="Airbus Beluga">Airbus Beluga</a>, which probably won't win many beauty contests&#160;:). I don't think the term should be in the article at all - IMO it's not commonly enough used to be described as an "alternative name" for the plane (in the way "superjumbo" is), and we're not in the business of listing every nickname for things... — <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuantumEleven_2375.html" title="User:QuantumEleven">QuantumEleven</a> | <a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuantumEleven_5e82.html" title="User talk:QuantumEleven">(talk)</a> 15:15, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also agree with <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a>. I've never heard the term or seen it used in any of the aviation press (or other press). The usage of the term seems to be almost exclusively in the Boeing biased US area. For a Google count I return only 479 hits for it, and quite a few of them are for a defunct German airplane hire company called Whalejet. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 15:52, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've pulled off the <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spruce_Goose_83dc.html" title="Spruce Goose">Spruce Goose</a> mention. Not because it was wrong or even derogatory, but because I thought it inappropiate for the lead. The diagram includes the Spruce Goose, and clearly shows the wingspan. A flower on the head of whoever put in that diagram - it shows the comparative sizes very well. Wingspan and fin height aside, the A380 and the B747 are pretty similar in size.</p>
<p>A general word here, and that is that the article size is bulging a bit, so it might be time to start thinking about deleting small bits that are no longer as interesting as they once were.</p>
<p>An even more general note, and that is that so much of the Airbus/Boeing articles seem to be comparing one model against another. I'm not sure why this is so, but airliners from the days when there were more than two major manufacturers don't go into this sort of thing to any great extent, so I'm thinking it's probably not really necessary. Maybe someone can whip up an article on modern airliner comparisons for those who are really into this sort of stuff, but for my part if I look at an article on an airliner I want to know about that specific airliner, not its real or imagined competition. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 04:56, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In actual use, among pilots, industry insiders, Wall Street analysts, etc. the term WhaleJet is just about universally used and not in either a complimentary or derogatory way. It is simply descriptive. The term SuperJumbo is much more often used to refer to the Boeing B747-8. Using the term SuperJumbo here is confusing at best and probably just false. -- <a href="../../../m/c/a/User%7EMcarling_0ae7.html" title="User:Mcarling">M Carling</a> 00:01, 6 Apr 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Terminal criticism</span></h2>
<p>I've removed the following from the article:</p>
<pre>
Besides runways and taxiways, many international airports would also 
have to extensively reconstruct their terminals and handling facilities
to accomodate the A380. Most airports had been designed with the 747
in mind, and all subsequent airliners since the 747 have been smaller
until the advent of the A380.
</pre>
<p>This is purest unsourced gammon. As can be seen from the size diagram, the A380 has much the same dimensions as the 747. In fact the longest airliner in the world is the A340-600, which hasn't needed too much in the way of terminal modification, though if they try to cram too many into LAX, they might jam.</p>
<p>The A380 will fly with 550 pax in a typical configuration, and this isn't a great deal higher than the 747's maximum capacity. I haven't seen any useful stories about massive terminal redesign, and that's because no airport thinks it necessary. What they might need are more seats in their lounges and perhaps two levels on their jetways, but all that does is relocate the need to climb stairs from one end of the jetway to the other. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 02:41, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you are missing something. I have read numerous citations of the fact that airports do indeed need extensive modifications in order to accomodate the A380. The most important factor is the loading gate/tubes. Passengers will enter/exit the A380 <i>on two levels simultaneously</i>. This requires entirely new jetways and gate structure to feed them. The size/configuration of the aircraft will likely require new equipment for refueling, loading cargo, on and offloading catering, etc. Safety concerns will also require significant changes. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 03:53, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>New jetways don't mean "extensive terminal modifications". LAX, for instance, has modified two gates at Tom Bradley and is now ready to handle A380s. The aircraft have been designed for compatibility with existing refueling and loading equipment. If you have some reliable sources (i.e. not speculation) to back your claims, I would be interested to see them. So far the major works at airports appear to be runway and taxiway widening to cater for the engines being hung further out than on other 4 engine wide-bodies. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 07:45, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Plus a lot of these modifications are not actually needed, just beneficial. They will still be able to load the A380 using standard jetways just not both levels at the same time, so the redesign would make things more efficient but isn't totally vital. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 08:02, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Depends on what you mean by "extensive terminal modifications". The A380 has a large wingspan, which means that one A380 slot at a terminal takes the place of two or three other slots, in some cases you can fit one A380 and a narrow body where you can currently fit two 747s. Also, those slots often have to be at the ends of the terminal as at many airports there's not enough room to taxi an A380 to the inside gates. JFK has spent ~$150 million on terminal, taxiway and fillet improvements to accommidate the A380 - CDG and LAX have spent around $50 million IIRC. DFW has spent much less because its only expecting A380 freighters. My sources are the infrastructure managers for those four airports who gave presentations at a conference I attended earlier this week.</dd>

<dd>The big issue is runway width - If the A380 is not certified for operations on 45 meter runways, it won't be in passenger service in the US at least any time soon. The runway-taxiway separation is not as big an issue, it can be overcome by modifying ground traffic flow but that will cause delays. The visual obstruction of the A380 is a factor there as well as its wingspan. <a href="../../../t/o/i/User%7EToiyabe_d751.html" title="User:Toiyabe">Toiyabe</a> 17:33, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My view of "extensive terminal modifications" would be major infrastructure works falling in between normal terminal maintenance and modernisation and entire new terminal buildings. Runways generally aren't included inside terminal buildings, so it's a little disingenuous to claim large sums spent on runway widening as being terminal improvements, and you say that "the big issue is runway width ".</dd>

<dd>One A380 slot does NOT take the place of two or three 747 slots. If you are trying to imply that a terminal that can take 24 747s can only accommodate 8 or 12 A380s without "extensive modifications", then you are wrong. I appreciate the fact that the wings are longer, and terminals built with tight limits can't possibly put one A380 into each B747-sized slot, but it's not an "extensive terminal modification" issue. Changi issued a press release late last year going into some detail about modifications, and none of this stuff seems particularly difficult or complex.</dd>

<dd>The fact is that only a few airports will handle A380 flights on a regular basis, and the terminal modifications needed to handle them are mostly a matter of relatively minor modifications such as installing new jetways, increasing the sizes of gate lounges, and making procedure changes. This is nothing like the extensive terminal modifications we saw during the 1970s when the B747 first arrived, and we should keep things in perspective. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 22:17, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Chill, dude. I didn't say that an A380 takes the place of two or three 747s at the terminal. The diagrams I've seen show it taking the place of 3 narrow bodies, 2 777s or 1 A380 and 1 narrow body for 2 747s. This will vary much from terminal to terminal. I also didn't say that I view that as "extensive terminal modifications". I also didn't say those sums were just for terminals.</dd>
<dd>None of those airports I've mentioned have done runway widening. If they do it'll cost much more then $150 million (estimated at $2 billion for SFO, but that's cause they'll have to put it in the bay), however they seem confident they'll get waivers. Overall the airport managers that presented at the conference I attended thought that the A380/airport compatibility issue was overblown. <a href="../../../t/o/i/User%7EToiyabe_d751.html" title="User:Toiyabe">Toiyabe</a> 23:01, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The fact that expensive modifications have to be made to airports and terminals is a matter of fact and should be included in the article. But we shouldn't let this criticism become overblown to the point where we are including biased speculation as stated fact. That's just unencyclopaedic. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 23:45, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There's a <a href="../../../g/a/o/GAO_b2f7.html" title="GAO">GAO</a> report at www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-02-251 which has estimated costs, although it is four years old. According to page 18 of that report "upgrading terminals, concourses and aprons accounts for 15 percent of the total cost [of A380 related upgrades for 14 US airports] ($317 million). At some airports, airlines are responsible for these areas, so upgrading them does not show up as a cost to airports". I'd be careful of including that, because a lot has changed in the last four years. It is at least well-sourced information, though.</dd>

<dd>I find interesting the idea that the <i>New York Times</i> article, or at least the bit about Airbus (sometimes specifically the A380) and standing-room-only seats, "is complete hogwash". At the moment, it seems that the best that one can say, at least with the sources cited in the Wikipedia article and in this section of the Talk page, is that it's a case of sources' giving contradictory reports—none of which automatically makes one story true or another story false.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Interestingly,</dd>
<dd>• <i>The New York Times</i> names the Airbus spokeswoman, Mary Anne Greczyn, while <i>The Register</i>’s article (1) names only a German researcher who has seen the design, and (2) presents nothing but miltigenerational information, relying on <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i>’s article and <i>The Guardian</i>’s blog, both of which also don't name the spokespersons they heard from.</dd>
<dd>• <i>The New York Times</i> reports that the company wouldn't "comment on the upright-seating proposal"; not commenting on something is not at all the same as explicitly denying it.</dd>
<dd>• <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> was told, by an unnamed spokeswoman, "I can't comment" and "I am not aware". Again, a refusal to comment; and, this time, the reason given is unawareness. Lack of awareness is not the same as the lack of something to be aware of.</dd>
<dd>• The actual <i>Herald</i> article, just before quoting the unnamed spokeswoman, says that she "said she could not confirm or deny the plan". So the spokeswoman also says she can't deny it.</dd>

<dd>Carrying any more than a handful of people in such seats would make it impossible to evacuate the aircraft in 90 seconds, which is the standard an airliner MUST meet. Perhaps they considered such seating for flight attendants on landing and takeoff? In addition, if you cram more passengers in, you also add to the weight. More bodies, more baggage, more food to feed them. The range would shrink dramatically, and with it the aircraft efficiency. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 01:10, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In any case, the A380 is only allowed to carry 853 passengers and no more (per the evacuation test), and they proved (during the evacuation test) that they can carry 853 using just standard economy-class seating, and don't need any 'standing room' seats to do so.

<dd>Well there are probablly countries with less strict rules or enforcement somewhere, also its not unheared of for airlines to have planes modified and retested to meet evacuation requirements with a greater passenger count. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 21:58, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The record for most passengers is held by a B747, with over 1 000. That was an El Al jumbo packed with refugees on a flight from Somalia to Israel. While it is conceivable that an airline could fill an aircraft with "standing" seats, the fact that it hasn't yet happened anywhere with any aircraft is a good indication that it won't happen in future. Such a fit-out would certainly not meet any international standards. For the A380, Qantas will have 501 passenger seats, and Singapore Airlines 485. This is an indication that passengers will have far more space, not less. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 23:24, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>A bit of an old issue but I thought I'd point something out. There may very well be countries with less strict enforcement of the rules. However you'd have to consider will the airlines in these countries be able to afford A380s? More importantly is it likely that there will be the need for a A380 to carry more then 853 passengers between two such countries? The answer two both these questions is no. While an airline may be able to get away with exceeding the certification in certain poor African countries, you can rest assured that these poor African countries won't have A380s and if they did, they definitely wouldn't be using them to transport passengers to another poor African country. (I should mention also that the distance between these two countries will be presemuably quite large too and so they will run in to the problem of the displeasure of other countries they fly over with their airlines violating the rules. Then of course, there is the fact Airbus is unlikely to want to sell airplanes to these airlines who are going to violate the rules potentially resulting in bad headlines for them) <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 17:34, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Certainly not a regular civil flight! It was a flight to get as many refugees out of Ethiopa as possible. NWT was just being sensational. The way things are going, the A380 gives passengers more room, not less, and the chance of passengers paying actual money for standing-room only seats is pretty minimal. Besides, the lawsuits on health issues would soon mount up and make it unprofitable. Can't see how you could evacuate the aircraft in any reasonable time, either. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 23:46, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not really that big a reduction - Airbus standard is 555 passengers in three classes, 501 is a 10% reduction.

</ul>
<p>The term refers to an "option contract", which is a contract to guarantee a price at a later date, for which consideration (i.e. money) is exchanged. So, part of the contract between the airline and the builder is a purchase contract (to buy airplanes now), another part is an option contract, to guarantee the future price of airplanes should the airline choose to buy them later ("exercise" the option.) I believe that dates, quantities, and configurations are typically specified.</p>

<dd>As to the four engines, I don't know for sure but I strongly suspect that it's because the four-engine design allows the use of jet engines that are from the same family line as existing designs (the A380 engines are smaller than the Boeing 777). Something big enough to power the A380 with two engines would require an entirely new engine that would be radically bigger than anything that's flown before, and wouldn't be of much use on anything except the A380. Designing an entirely new jet engine twice the size of existing ones would be a hugely costly undertaking, and the market for the A380 isn't <i>that</i> extensive. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 13:39, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is that, and a theoretical engine powerful enough to power the A380 with only two instead of four would be so large (in diameter) that it would drag along the the ground (assuming you want an engine with a similar sort of efficiency to existing designs) unless the wings were raised, and raising the wings creates a whole different set of problems. So the designers chose to design the A380 to fly with existing engines (which are big enough already!). — <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuantumEleven_2375.html" title="User:QuantumEleven">Quantum</a><i><a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuantumEleven_5e82.html" title="User talk:QuantumEleven">Eleven</a></i> 06:22, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Double-decker jetways aren't <i>required</i> for the A380 - many airports will be boarding from a single jetway - but many are building them for the simple reason that it'll allow much quicker loading and unloading. Also, note that of the three options, a jetway on each side is probably the least likely. Conventionally, aircraft are boarded from the port (left) side (possibly a holdover from mounting horses from the left), so most airports, their gates and the aircraft themselves are set up that way. It'd be an even more major modification than a double decker jetway to build a starboard jetway on, and it too would be unusable for most aircraft. Finally, the starboard is generally busy with service vehicles and the like (e.g. catering truck, baggage loading etc.) and the doors are sometimes smaller (though I don't know what the A380's are like), as they are only intended for service and emergency use. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Wilson_16a7.html" title="User:Scott Wilson">Scott Wilson</a> 15:50, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The doors on both sides are the same size, but Scott is right - all airports board from just the left side. The A380's <i>preferred</i> boarding arrangement would be three jetways, two to the lower deck (fore and aft) and one to the top deck, but it's designed so that it can be boarded with no problems with two jetways, either both to the lower deck (as currently done with the 747, so no refit necessary) or one to each deck.

<dd>Yup, you can see the Airbus Triangluar winglet things (like on the A320 Series)... Wonder if they'll get changed to ones like the for the A320 series which are more like the 737NG winglets.... <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReedy_Boy_3c7f.html" title="User:Reedy Boy">Reedy Boy</a> 10:35, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It doesn't really matter how many jetways it has. There's going to be a bottleneck somewhere, and if you have several jetways, it just moves the bottleneck to the boarding gate. If you have a double decker jetway, then it just means that passengers will have to use stairs inside the terminal instead of inside the aircraft. As a matter of fact, the A380 should load <i>faster</i> than a B747, even with just a single jetway. Each of the A380's decks is as long as a B747's, but the plane only carries a hundred passengers more. Therefore, on average, there will be fewer passengers per deck (and presumably more space, such as wider aisles and longer pitch) and this will translate into faster loading, once the passengers for the two decks are separated. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 00:36, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The A380 <b>is</b> the largest airliner in the world. It just hasn't entered commercial service yet. It has already carried passengers on flights, albeit not on scheduled routes. The first plane for commercial delivery made its first flight last month. We can be coy and say that the B747 is the largest airliner in scheduled service, but that's about it. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 05:22, 1 June 2006 (UTC) Calling the A380 a "prototype" is misleading, to be generous. At a stretch one might call the first four aircraft prototypes (although the design process didn't use a prototyping methodology) but with production aircraft already flying and the assembly line in full swing it is well beyond prototype stage. I emphasise that this aircraft has carried significant passenger loads on test and promotional flights. It is an airliner because it certainly isn't anything else. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 11:10, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To my mind it is simply a product which is complete but hasn't been delivered as yet.

<p>While we are not being coy, let us also note that the 747-800i is not a competitor of the Airbus A380. At 450 passengers, the 747-800i is in a totally different class of airplane and has no direct competition from Airbus. The 747-800i fills a gap between the B777and the A380.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually no. Singapore Airlines is planning to fly fewer than 480 on their A380s, according to their website. Both planes are large and efficient, but if the A380 has 50% more space than a B747 and only 3 rows of economy passengers to put in it, I'd say that we're looking at unprecedented standards of room per passenger, and the 748 isn't going to be filling any gaps. Qantas has announced that they are only going to fly 501/380, and I can't see Emirates packing them in like sardines either. RyanAir, maybe. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 22:26, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, if they will only be flying 500 passengers then this totally shoots a hole in their lower cost per seat mile numbers. Just how much is it actually going to cost to fly the A380 with so few passengers. Maybe this is why its not selling.</p>
<p>That unsigned comment above is BS. The A380 can fly with between 850 and 1 passenger, and it's the airline who decides. There are rumors that the A380 will sport some business class (now that First is gone) as never has been seen before; rumors about individual compartments like those on wagons-lits are continuous. In matters of booking, it's always the airline who decides, not the manufacturer. The A380 can sport 500 seats with the same or greater comfort as a B-747 in a 350 seats configuration, period.</p>
<p>As a side note, less seats and less passengers (and thus less luggage) mean more cargo, and the container capacity of the A380 is pretty above that of a B-747. Kg per Kg, cargo is more profitable than luggage or passengers. --Bill Bones 17:23, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nickname</span></h2>
<p>On the subject of whether or not the most common nickname is Megaliner or Superjumbo. EADS may use the term Megaliner internally, but in the wider world the most common parlance in the media is Superjumbo. Megaliner gets ~48,000 hits on Google (I hate Google hit counts but here we are) of which 10,000 are buses, some are coaches, many are cruiseliners and ships and some are the Airbus A360 with a small selection of them being for the A380. Superjumbo gets 259,000+ hits including news stories from the worlds big name media providers like BBC, CNN etc on the first page and the vast majority of them that I can see all referencing the A380 (plus some political pamphlet that I cannot tell about). Superjumbo is most definitely the nickname for it in the eyes of the public no matter what they say inside EADS, and is used even by big name Aerospace media outlets like Space.com and Aerospace Technology.

<dd>Perhaps I'm biased on this, but "Superjumbo" is the name I've long heard used to describe the A3XX/A380. For the reason that the airliner is bigger than the iconic Jumbo jet. At the moment there is only one airliner larger than the Jumbo, so it is a very apt name. "Megaliner" isn't a name I've heard used to describe any airliner, and even if it was, it could describe any large airliner, such as the A340-600, B747, A380. The top hits on Google all refer to cruise liners, of which there are any number of massive ships. This is something that should be discussed before being included in the article, especially in the lead section, and I am unimpressed by sneaky attempts to insert it without consensus. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 21:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually Google hit counts are incredibly bad. You can be as specific as you want but the fact remains that you are only looking at a specific subset of the English users out there. There is strong evidence to suggest internet pages are biased in favour of the US over and above their relative population compared to other developed English-native countries such as the UK, NZ, Australia etc. Not only that but the internet is heftly biased against the large second-language English speakers in the developing world (India is a big one but also many parts of Africa, Pakistan, Malaysia etc). I'm not saying there is necessarily a Commonwealth English - North American English difference here or that a mistaken conclusion was made. Indeed the fact is that the A380 probably doesn't get that much attention in many parts of the developing world. But this does not negate the fact that a Google search or any attempts to use the Internet to establish the frequency of the usage of a word is usually incredibly unfair and misleading. 12:31, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's as may be, but "Megaliner" remains a nickname that is not in general circulation. I hang out on various aviation-related forums and it's not used at all, whereas "Superjumbo" is, albeit not often. Those who talk airliners tend to use "380" or "A380". Maybe Airbus used Megaliner in development, but it didn't translate to the wider world. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 17:29, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As the discussion above indicates, the consensus is for "Superjumbo" as a commonly-accepted nickname, whereas "Megaliner" is far less common and not specifically associated with the A380. However, we will always listen to a good argument, especially if sources are given. If a fact is true, notable and well sourced, then it should be included in the article. None of us are part of a single-minded conspiracy to promote Superjumbo over Megaliner, but the way you are trying to push your version is not the way we do things.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">When is the Airbus A380 officially "in service"</span></h2>
<p>I noticed that there is a question as to whether the A380 "is" or "will be" the largest passenger jet. Since the A380 has only had its "1st flight" and has not gone into revenue service, the Boeing 747 actually "is" the largest passenger jet since the term "passenger jet" implies that it is in revene service. There are many planes that have never entered service after a "1st flight" and until the A380 actually flies passengers in revenue service we should use the following terminology.</p>
<p>The Boeing 747 is the largest passenger jet in revenue service. The Airbus A380 is the largest passenger jet to have flown. (Assuming that there are passenger test flights.)</p>

<dd>The A380 is taking passengers on various test and promotional flights, and has been doing so for several months. It's an airliner. It's a passenger jet. It's not in scheduled service yet, and won't be until December, when Singapore Airlines uses its first pair on the Singapore-Sydney daily service. Implying that the A380 won't enter service when five have already flown and the first delivery hull is now getting its seats installed is a very long bow to draw. The lead paragraph makes it quite clear that the A380 is not yet in commercial service, but quite clearly it is a bigger passenger jet than the B747.

Qantas is going to suffer a six month delay in introducing the aircraft. I'm a little puzzled as to why Singapore Airlines is ordering 20 787s, as these aircraft are even further from service than the A380, but that's what the news reports say.

<p>The order for 20 787s from Singapore Airlines could be a possible replacement for the early 777-200s and some of the 777-200ERs, since the 787 competes with the early 777 models. That is just my guess. -Blau</p>
<p>The 20 787s will be used to expand routes in Asia. The 787 is not meant to be a replacement for the 747, 777 or A380.

<dd>Thanks for that. It must be hard for some to understand why there are delays when the aircraft has already flown. After all, what's the problem with wiring? Just run wires from the cockpit to the control surfaces. How hard can that be? Yet the thought of signals crossing over from one wire to another makes my hair stand on end. And apart from alarming safety and control implications, even if it's signals for (say) audio-visual systems and cabin thermostats leaking over, that might produce uncomfortable passenger experiences. These things need to be sorted out before installing the cabin furniture.</dd>
<dd>I've rewritten the Delivery section in an attempt to clarify the three announced delays:
<ul>
<li>June 2005 - a six month slippage for <b>all</b> aircraft</li>
<li>June 2006 - a slowdown in the delivery schedule affecting those aircraft further back in the pipeline, rather than those already built and flown.</li>
<li>July 2006 - a delay in certification affecting the first delivery only. Actually, this hasn't been a formal announcement by Airbus, more in the nature of a "read between the lines" thing.</li>

<p>The Singapore orders for 787 are not linked to the A380 program at all. Singapore had been reviewing the B787 for 2 years before deciding to buy it. The B-787 is a sexed-up replacement for airplanes in the B-767 range; it is NOT a competitor for larger airplanes like the A340, B-777, B-747 or A380. Also, it would make no sense that Boeing was building a competitor to its own jewel-of-the-crown the B-777, would it?</p>
<p>As for Airbus troubles, many of them come from bottlenecks caused by shifting requirements. As operators shifted their requirements, some airplanes have had to be refitted, and some even had to be moved back to previous stations of the assembly line in order to acces already finished areas to fit in additional wiring. This caused bottlenecks and Airbus feared they coul drive to a total jam, so the production pace has been slowed down. --Bill Bones 17:03, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This list is superfluous. An A380 can operate out of any airport that can take a B747. It doesn't need special airbridges or gates or anything else. The only major difference between a 747 and a 380 is that the longer wings of the latter may need wider runways and separation between taxiways, as well as restricting which gates it may use in space limited terminals. The interior gates at LAX T4 spring to mind; they are a tight squeeze for a B747, but there would be no difficulty in using the gates at the end of the "egg". --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 06:09, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Might I add that <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_International_Airport_6290.html" title="Denver International Airport">Denver International Airport</a> is more than compatible with the A380. The newest sixth runway (16R/34L) is about 16K feet long, the longest runway in North America. Is is very capable of landing the A380. Although, most international flights depart in Concourse A, which is sandwiched between Concourse B and The Jeppesen Terminal, which, by the way, has a connecting bridge to Concourse A with a clearance of 42 feet, much below the height of the A380. However, the international gates are on the north siide of the councourse and the bridge connects to the south side, which houses mostly A320's and the like. The DIA article, though, says that the gates could easily be modified to support the A380. They could potentially build A380 gates if they do ever build Councourses D and E, which I figure won't happen soon because I haven't heard much about them. 67.177.244.157 -- Please Sign your comments!</dd>

<p>That list is incomplete... Many other Canadian, and Asian airports are preparing for the A380. India's Kingfisher Airlines ordered 5 of em, and many Indian airports are getting to handle it. Delhi (DEL) and Mumbai(Bombay) are expecting a daily A380 flight and the work has begun to upgrade the taxiways and terminals. Toronto's Pearson International (YYZ) is also ready to handle the A380, since the airport is going through a major expansion. Vancouver International is also expecting A380 flights. Any suggestions?</p>

<dd>I say scrub the entire list. Seems relatively pointless to me. As mentioned above any airport with a decent runway can handle an A380 even if they don't have the updated skybridges, loading ramps etc the normal ladder units will work fine from the lower doors. There isn't a list of airports capable of handling the An-225, or the 747, so why should the A380 have one? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 17:13, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand that some airports will be able to handle the A380 and some will not. Maybe we should add a section to each airport called "A380 Certified: Yes/No". At the same time, the number of airports that will be <i>certified</i> to support the A380 will be limited and maybe a list will be helpful. --mnw2000</p>

<p>Does anyone know if the already built gate corridors in the airports listed in the article load as a single jetway or one on top and one on the main floor? I'm particulalrly interested in LAX, SFO, SIN, and JFK. A ticketing agent in LAX told me when I was travelling to Singapore that they hadn't built the gate for the A380 yet, which is one of the reasons why SQ did not select LAX as one of the start cities for their flights.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Airport Compatibility (again)</span></h2>
<p>I think the article currently does a poor job of describing the way airports are preparing for the A380. There is a brief mention under the Testing section (?!?) and Amenities section (?!?) which unfairly single out London Heathrow, and then a few further points about taxiway reconfiguration in the Technical Concern section... which I don't think belong there because airport modifications do not qualify as a technical problem (financial, perhaps...)</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that we should revive a list of A380 compatible airports, but instead that there be a short, concise paragraph describing the issue of airport compatibility with the A380. I am willing to take a first stab at this, but am not sure where in the article outline it really belongs... suggestions? --<a href="../../../c/t/i/User%7ECtillier_c7a7.html" title="User:Ctillier">Ctillier</a> 05:11, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why should the article have any more material than it already has? Any compatibility issues are minor - if an airport can operate a B747, it can operate an A380. Realistically, the only difficulty is that the outer engines are further outboard and the wings are a few metres longer, meaning that a few airports that are tight on space will need to make adjustments. The plane itself carries about as many as a Jumbo: 485 for <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Airlines_77f1.html" title="Singapore Airlines">Singapore Airlines</a> and 501 for <a href="../../../q/a/n/Qantas.html" title="Qantas">Qantas</a>, so passenger loading will not be a problem. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 05:27, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not true. There are articles all over the place about airports spending millions of dollars to widen taxiways, move lights, etc. for the Airbus A380. There is no such expenditures to accept Boeing 747 aircraft, or at the very least, it was done decades ago when the Boing 747 was first released. I think we should revive the list of airports that have announced plans to upgrade thier airports for the Airbus A380 along with thier progress (planned, underway, completed). Here is one such article for Memphis International Airport <a href="http://www.theairlinehub.com/2006/07/memphis_intl_airport_readying.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theairlinehub.com/2006/07/memphis_intl_airport_readying.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> planned upgrade scheduled for 2009.

<p>Actually, I think there are many airports that can handle a Boeing 747, but is not ready for the Airbus A380. Why else would all these international airports that have been handling the Boeing 747 for decades need to spend a single dollar (or euro) in order to "prepare" for the arrival of the Airbus 380? I feel that supporters of the Airbus A380 do not want to believe that this new aircraft does require changes and can land anywhere a Boeing 747 can. But that just isn't the case. There are tons are articles (do a google search) about the need of airports to upgrade to handle the new plane. I was under the impression that Wikipedia is suppose to report facts, and not take make a judgement call.

<dd>I think the issue of airport compatibility is relevant to the article. However, a chart showing individual airports would be mostly a waste of space. I do like the idea of a separate section discussing the issues the are arising with the introduction of the A380, because there very clearly are quite a few, such as the wingspan affecting gates and taxiways, and also the fact that they potentially need to enplane/deplane passengers from both decks concurrently. There are also other considerations, so thumbs up for such a section from me. <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalar71_7ed7.html" title="User:Galar71">galar71</a> 20:22, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Houm... actually airports worldwide are upgrading to face growing passenger traffic. Improve their abbility to handle the A380 is just a logical thing to do, provided they already are spending the bucks and would be stupid to not take the chance and improve the handling of a bigger aircaft. Anyway, that would be an "airports" issue. I wonder why should it be mentioned in an article about the aircraft, unless someone was desperately in need to find a crytizism -with the convenient short-term memory to forget that the B-747 was incepted in a world where it could land on ZERO, NULL, NONE airports, and many airports had to expend big bucks to handle the aircraft &amp; enter the (then) short, privileged list of "jumbo-ready" airports. This was the second alrgest update in history, right after the "jet-ready" airports arrived. The A380 is a fair lesser trouble and the costs are asssumed as a part of the mobility upgrades. An "airport" issue completely. --Bill Bones 10:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article erroneously claims that any airport that can handle a Boeing 747 can handle an A380. This is false, as the two aircraft are in different design groups, The 747 being in Design Group V, and the A380 being in Design Group VI. The primary consequence of this difference is that the A380 requires a 200' (60m) wide runway, whereas the 747 can operate on a 150' (45m) wide runway.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.7.64.107 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.7.64.107_459c.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.7.64.107">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I agree with that. Some readers may like to see the "totals" of aircraft that each airline has on order. For example, Emirates has three orders (and a transfer transaction) to come to thier 43 plane on order.</p>
<p>Should we standarize on this "dual charge" concept? Should orders for Boeing 787, Boeing 747-8 and Airbus A350 (on thier pages) also have this dual charge concept or should it be unique to the Airbus 380? --<a href="../../../m/n/w/User%7EMnw2000_d6d1.html" title="User:Mnw2000">user:mnw2000</a> 14:30, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm all for the other aircraft pages having a simple chart that lists by airline. These other charts are unweildy and prone to being inacurate for that reason (like the one here). If there are people out there who care what date some airline confirmed it had changed its previous order by adding to an earlier order which was itself changed to reflect a move to the larger model, then they should be shot.</p>

We all know what it looks like now, and have plenty of real photos so this is just not needed.

Also the boarding at Farnborough seems pointless, so it's a stairwell to a door, we haven't seen that before. Also the first flight one, sorry but it's just a poor photograph. I'd also leave the GP7200 engine cutaway for an article on the engine rather than the A380 article. Just my thoughts. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 06:48, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. The information is more important than the photos. I remember an old encylopedia that I found that had NO pictures, only text and a few sketches. We have come along way, maybe too far. Is there a Wikiapedia guideline for the use of photos in articles? --<a href="../../../m/n/w/User%7EMnw2000_d6d1.html" title="User:Mnw2000">user:mnw2000</a> 14:37, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, so I removed a few per Ben's advice above, and added what I find a striking picture of the landing gear, with a guy standing in front of it to give the scale. I also moved the gallery under the media section-- it used to live under specifications, which didn't make much sense. I hope those changes are reasonable. --<a href="../../../c/t/i/User%7ECtillier_c7a7.html" title="User:Ctillier">Ctillier</a> 06:13, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm really pleased with the way the article has shaped up. I wouldn't say that there are too many pictures, as this is an article where pictures can tell a story that words cannot, and I particularly like the photographs and diagrams that show the distinctive features of the aircraft. The comparitive size diagram is an excellent one, as is the cross-section. The landing gear photograph is a great example of details unique to the A380. The gallery section shows the aircraft in various configurations, but I can see that we need to guard against "happy snaps" that essentially duplicate existing material. Unless, of course, they are of superior quality. Future possibilities are interior photographs, showing seating, staircases, casinos and bowling alleys (or whatever Virgin Atlantic chooses to install), but we'll probably have to wait until 2007 before we can get free photographs, though we may be able to use some press releases from Airbus and Singapore Airlines. There are videos showing the evacuation test. Can we use stills from that video, I wonder? --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 19:07, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I may accused of attempting to "dumb down" the project however I think the advanced materials/Advanced avionics architecture/Systems sections need to be simplified.

<li>I don't think there's anything wrong with the Advanced Materials section - it's kept fairly brief and none of the information there is inaccessable to the lay person. The Avionics and Systems sections could perhaps do with some editing, although as this <i>is</i> supposed to be an encyclopaedia article rather than a brief overview (plenty of those elsewhere) I'd be sorry to lose too much of the technical detail. --<a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYummifruitbat_2d22.html" title="User:Yummifruitbat">Yummifruitbat</a> 17:45, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Possible additions</span></h2>
<p>I have recently visited the A380 facility and have the following info that could easily be added in. Obviously people may want to find references for verifications - at the moment I am not in the position to do so myself.</p>
<ol>
<li>15 aircraft have been finished to date. 2 of them have already been dispatched (i.e. Singapore Airlines already have the aircraft, they just can't use them coz the certification is not due until November).</li>
<li>The assembly facility consists of 3 hangars. The large one is used to assemble the actual parts - one aircraft at a time. Then it is towed to one of the other two hangars for connecting the circuitry, installing the interior, fixing in the titanium latches for the engines and the engines themselves, painting, etc. Each hangar has a capacity of 3 aircraft, worked upon simultaneously.</li>
<li>The assembly facility churns out 5 aircraft a month. The total time taken to build one of these babies (i.e. including the parts) is around 19 months.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a discussion with a colleague, I was told that on the maiden (test?) flight, the pilot was very finicky about the fact that the rear wheels / landing gear, which as per specification open down by mere gravity, stayed 5 seconds still before opening. He forced them to oil it up, add animal grease to it... they cut it down to 3 sec. The pilot then accepted to take off, though requiring that the issue be solved after the flight.</p>

<dd>Interesting. Maybe the dynamics in an airstream are different to what you get in a static test on the ground?

<dd>I saw a programme which featured that problem. In the event of hydraulic failure the wheels are supposed to be able to be released, push the doors open and lock. However they were sticking on the doors. The grease was a makeshift solution I think. A long term solution was a new material on the inside of the doors to reduce friction and allow the wheels to slide over them. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 13:56, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was trying another copy edit of this section and decided that it could use a complete rewrite. The chronology was confusing, and the section seemed to say more about the 747 than the A380. I have attempted to rewrite it without making the article longer, and without leaving out any factual information that it used to contain. I based some of the information on the book by Norris and Wagner cited at the bottom of the article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Engine selection figures.</span></h2>
<p>Section 2.2 of this article states that "the Engine Alliance GP7201 sales total has since surpassed the Trent 900's by a sizable margin". However, according to this press release from airbus <a href="http://www.airbus.com/en/presscentre/pressreleases/pressreleases_items/06_08_25_a380_EA_engines_flight.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.airbus.com/en/presscentre/pressreleases/pressreleases_items/06_08_25_a380_EA_engines_flight.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, dated 25/08/06, there are 82 firm EA orders, out of a total of 159 firm orders. This should mean that there are 77 firm RR orders surely. I wouldn't call 5 orders a 'sizable margin'. Also why don't these figures match those shown in the table of orders near the bottom of the article? <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EAbc30_e5cc.html" title="User:Abc30">Abc30</a> 14:46, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some airframes have not yet had their engines selected (see order tables). But I agree with you that the margin is not really "sizable"... I would be in favor of dropping the whole sentence.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Drop the Tsunami Tidbit?</span></h2>
<p>The trade pressure on Thailand item in the 'Technical Concerns' section is not a technical concern and doesn't really fit with the other items in that section of the article. It seems altogether rather minor and not something one would expect to be in the article 5 years from now. Furthermore, the Scotsman article, which appears to be the only source for this tidbit, is a shoddy piece of journalism-- the headline and lead paragraphs sensationally imply the Thais were told to buy six airplanes after the tsunami, when in fact they had already ordered them well before the tsunami. That changes the whole tenor of the situation, doesn't it? I move that we drop this item entirely... but I don't want to do this without discussion.
