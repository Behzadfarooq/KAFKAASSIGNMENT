<p>This is a list for the Air TV series, why is one entry about the movie in here?

<dd>I think it may be partially because other similar lists have the movie(s) listed as well (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Fullmetal_Alchemist_episodes_00b0.html" title="List of Fullmetal Alchemist episodes">List of Fullmetal Alchemist episodes</a> for example). ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">Nihon</a><a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">jo</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><b><font color="darkgreen">e</font></b></a></small></sup> 02:55, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, it is true that the series and movie for FMA do follow each other closely (and I've heard the movie called the unofficial 52nd episode since there were only 51 and 1 missing in the final season), so that sort of makes sense. But I do agree with the Air movie and it is of my opinion it should have never been made since it does nothing for the main story except tell it the same way with different circumstances; therefore they can be seen as alternate universes of each other, which is sometimes seen in anime (like in <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam.html" title="Gundam">Gundam</a> or <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenchi_Muyo_059b.html" title="Tenchi Muyo">Tenchi Muyo</a>). If the Air movie stays, then I believe the article title should be changed to reflect that.--<a href="../../../j/u/h/User%7EJuhachi_79a5.html" title="User:Juhachi">Juhachi</a> 03:05, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The Ah! My Goddess OVA and movie as well as mini series detach from the plot. Yet they exist on the featured list. There is absolutely no harm putting explanation to the movie to the article.

<dd>I give list of oh my goddess episodes as example. none of the series are related including the movie. Air movie and tv series are somewhat related (they have a similar yet distant plot). It is perfectly usefull to link the movie.

<dd>I say we move the movie mention to its own article and make a link there from here. The reason: this is a list of Air episodes, and the movie is not an episode. Especially given that the movie has its own article. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">_dk</a> 03:58, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, strongly. For one, a movie is not an episode. Of course it's related, that's why we have links and nav templates and the main article mentioning both. But this is a list for the Air TV series, not non-TV-series-canon movies that were done by a different group! If you wish to link to it, then fine, but do not include it. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Stargate_SG-1_episodes_00dc.html" title="List of Stargate SG-1 episodes">List of Stargate SG-1 episodes</a> doesn't include <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_%28film%29.html" title="Stargate (film)">Stargate (film)</a>, and they're more related to each other than the Air TV series and Air movie! If this was List of Air media, then <i>maybe</i> it'd make sense. Cooperation doesn't mean ignoring simple and painfully clear logic. If no one has a strong reason to include it then it goes off the article and gets a sentence that mentions it, but makes it clear that it is not apart of the series. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 05:20, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Stargate is not an anime list and unlike Air that thing has ten seasons. A featured list, (OMG list) has dvd covers and comunity has not objected its presence during candidacy. I do not see any reason why this anime list should be treated any more diferently than OMG list. Since movie has its own article we just give a very brief summary. Just because something has its onw article disqualifies it from being on this list. There is nothing logical about removing information from wikipedia. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 15:20, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Stargate being animated or not doesn't matter. Being animated doesn't change the fact that it's a list of episodes from a TV series. I understand your words, but I disagree with your reasons, and I am not the only one (see above). See where I'm going with this? -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 20:46, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lets see. Nihonjoe agrees with me (thats one other person). Two featured lists (articles surviving heavy peer review) have a movie section (meaning its not problematic). Do we not consider Star Wars movies to be "epidoes"? (somehwat). Perhaps stargate can have a movie section. The place it aired (big theater, tv screen) doesnt really matter. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 17:39, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No.. no he didn't agree with you. I think he was trying to explain to me why you added the movie to the article. "Two featured lists", those are articles YOU edited, there's no weight in that argument. And, again, featured list criteria says nothing about these types of issues, so the issue is not likely to come up during the candidacy. I agree that where something was shown doesn't matter, but that's not my point. The point is these are two very different works both based on the same game. This is not like a movie based off the anime series. If it was a movie based off the Air TV series then I wouldn't have a problem listing a movie with a group of episodes. Unlike our style disputes, this is actually <i>harmful</i> in that it is very confusing to the reader and is needlessly redundant. This is not.. lets mention every work based on Air game on every Air article. This is nothing more than article filler to make it seem larger. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 05:23, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Every featured list goes through heavy peer review. If such an issue does not come up on a FAC (enough to prevent promotion), it probably is not a big deal (nothing harmfull).</dd>
<dd>This article should be and is about the anime Air. Game, Manga as well as soundtracks disqualify to be on the list. Movie, OVA, TV episodes do qualify. Both (movie and anime) have a similar plot, identical characters (though few only make cammo appearances), identical title. We are not mentioning every work based on air game on every article, we are mentioning every anime based on the air game. There is no harm in multiple referances whenever relevant.</dd>

<dd>Just because something didn't come up during an FLC doesn't make it a non-issue for all lists of episodes. In all honestly, Featured lists should be renamed to Good lists, as they are more inline with a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_article_3e1a.html" title="Wikipedia:Good article">Good article</a> than a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_7cf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article">Featured article</a>. OMG, Planetes, and FMA definitely did NOT go thought a "heavy peer review". This is not an article about the Air anime, but about the Air TV series. The OMG list could be renamed, but because it so clearly covers the topics of several different works it's not as confusing. FMA's movie was apart of the same plot as the episodes, so it would make sense to include it. These articles should make it extra clear that these two stories are unrelated as far as being canon to each other. It's confusing, it's unnecessary, and it only serves to "fluff" the article. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 19:06, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do not see any fluffing. But as other examples exist (of a movie being posted on an episode list) I do not see the problem.

<p>Here's what I see happening (that makes sense): One, we remove the Air movie listing. Or, two, we keep it, merge the soundtrack listing, make a manga listing, and then rename the article to List of Air media.

<li><b>Support</b>: I think it goes along better with the page and is more compact and thus easier to scan the page. It's not always about the eye candy since this is an encyclopedia after all and thus shouldn't the information about the actual episodes be more important than the way they are displayed? That being said, I'd say just stick with the current standard format using the Japanese episode template.

<li><b>Support</b>. I'd like to note I oppose the exitance of this poll. Don't vote for everything. Having said that here are my rationale:
<ol>
<li>The TV screen shots of individual episodes are really not the right way. If you look at the various star Trek lists for instance, you will see that most of the screencaps are unintelligable. At best, you can tell there is a peson or a ship but it isnt any more significant. Furthermore <b>LEGALLY</b> speaking, I am not sure we can claim fair-use on episode screenshots used like this. DVD covers on the other hand are from amazon.com and are promotional by nature. It is less likely for companies to complain.</li>
<li>Both of the LOE templates make heavy use of meta temlates. Meta templates should be avoided if they are not making peoples and/or coders life any easier. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_Sandbox_15d9.html" title="User:Cool Cat/Sandbox">My version</a> (as of now) has a similar usage (same parameters) while using less code.

<li><b>Support</b>: My major reason for supporting this format is that the seperation between English, kanji, and romaji titles is much more clear and is better. Also though, the reason that anime episode lists are more able to use DVD covers instead of American TV series is because anime is commonly only released a couple of episodes per DVD. With American shows, you have them released as complete seasons, so it's much harder to use a DVD cover image as 24 epiodes might be using the same cover. --<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 17:06, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> Okay, it seems that the only real difference between the two templates is the placement of the episode number, and the placement of the romaji and kanji/kana titles. Outside of that, they are pretty much the same. Perhaps one (Cool Cat's) could be used for lists using the DVD cover shots, and the other could be used for episode lists with screenshots for each episode? Cool Cat's seems to be designed more for using the DVD cover with multiple episodes (or that's what it's mostly been used for, anyway). ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">Nihon</a><a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">jo</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><b><font color="darkgreen">e</font></b></a></small></sup> 20:06, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is also about the format of using DVD covers on the side vs no images or individual screenshots, as well as the THICK lines. DVD covers only help identify an episode if you own the DVD..

<dd>I don't think that should be part of this poll. Basic format should be decided first, and then we can worry about DVD covers vs. episode screenshots, IMHO.

I comprimised everything but the place where episode names and numbers appear. I think such a minor diference isn't worth a discussion. We all have better things to do than discuss this to death.</p>
<p>I believe on this list "my version" (not that it is any more different than the other version now) is preferable as episode titles are ridiclously short.</p>
<p>I am eager to archive this discussion, get the article unlocked and continue with episode summaries.</p>

<dd>Actually, even those minor details seem to be apart of which style and template editors wish to use in the poll. And one other thing, I still wish to discuss the idea of not using DVD covers beside the episode entries, but rather, using them in their own table with information about the DVDs. I was hoping that would have been apart of this poll, but it was suggested to take this one step at a time and just choose a template first. I understand that you've updated your template to mimic the Japanese episode template, but there are still other concerns, such as the template being in the "care" of a WikiProject, where more editors are likely to voice future input. And even the episode title formatting is apart of this, although minor to some. Ending the poll now means using the Japanese episode template, according to consensus, it does not mean that we forget about this and you keep getting to "run the show". Sure, you considered our input now when you were under pressure from this poll, but what about later? -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 06:34, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh good grief, exactly what is wrong with the example I gave? It achieves 90% of the things you originally wanted while using a <a href="../../../l/o/e/WP%7ELOE_88f8.html" title="WP:LOE">WP:LOE</a> template. That is what is called a compromise.

<dd>Wasn't the originally reason you were against the <a href="../../../l/o/e/WP%7ELOE_88f8.html" title="WP:LOE">WP:LOE</a> templates was because you couldn't achieve the layout you originally wanted? But instead of looking at the example as a compromise, you created a new template—and no, it is not an "old" template but a brand new template you created as a reaction to this poll—that behaves almost exactly like the <a href="../../../l/o/e/WP%7ELOE_88f8.html" title="WP:LOE">WP:LOE</a> templates, thus a fork of the original, and then call it a compromise.

<dd>It achieves 90% of the things I want because the templates were never all that diferent. They are much more similar since my modifications to my version.</dd>
<dd>I did not want to edit the old version so as not to break the existing usage (on this very article for instance) <a href="../../../l/i/s/Template%7EList_of_Anime_Ep_TV_8121.html" title="Template:List of Anime Ep TV">Template:List of Anime Ep TV</a> was created 5 december 2005. The current version of my template is a copy paste of it. The main two differences is that the parameters passed now have variables, and other is that image is now passed to the template. The cols and rows parameter does not exist on LOE templates. Those parameters make the dvd covers more managable. See usage on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Planetes_episodes_e172.html" title="List of Planetes episodes">List of Planetes episodes</a>. Is this illogical and unreasonable?</dd>
<dd>I also feel it is more aproporate to sort animes titles in 3 scripts (english, kanji, romaji) in a vertical format as all of them are just too short and can easily fit a single line even on very low resolutions. Is this illogical and unreasonable?</dd>
<dd>Your example was most insightful. Based on that I have attemped something new in hopes that it could be something we all could agree on. I call it a coprimise because it is more like what you want than it was before. Is it not? By doing so, I have pulled back some of the conditions I seeked. Hence comprimised. I thought by making it more like LOE template would make it eaiser to resolve the issue.</dd>
<dd>As unlikely as this sounds, we can agree on how this should be. In fact, so far we have actualy agreed on certain points such as the templates markup, and tables header.</dd>

<dd>Very well we can go that direction. I did not suggest modifying the LOE template to meet my demands as I felt that would be me being way out of line. I also did not want to add aditional complexity to the template. Since that is not an issue I can gladly accept that.</dd>
<dd>TheFarix, second line should be for additional info. The official title (which often is in kanji) should be on the first line along with airdate and episode number. Everything else can be considered "trivia" (no insult intended, just being blunt). Allow me to explain:
<ul>
<li>It would be easier to follow. On some anime episode names can be rather in consistant in length. When placed in individual cells, this issue is compensated.</li>
<li>It is more likely for an anime episode to have a kanji/romaji title than an english air date. Most anime never air in the US. At the very least this one (AIR TV) hasn't. The first line should be reserved for information that is more likely to apply to all anime lists and second line for optional info.</li>
<li>How do we clarify what the script is. Is it Kanji? Katakana? Traditional chineese? Simplified chineese? Ancient Greek? Romaji? I for one can't necesarily tell the diffrence between katakana from kanji. I really want to avoid an ugly disclaimer.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>May I ask the logic why kanji, and romanji is placed on the second line?</dd>

<dd>The <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA">WP:MOS-JA</a> states that the English form should come first followed by kanji or kana and then the romanization if it is different then the English form. This order should also apply to episode titles and it appears that is what <a href="../../../l/o/e/WP%7ELOE_88f8.html" title="WP:LOE">WP:LOE</a> did. As for why they put the kanji/kana and romanization on the line below the English title, I can only guess that it is because anime titles can sometime be very long and this way just looks cleaner when that's the case. I also don't think there is a need to distinguish between kanji and kana; it is usually not specify anywhere else on Wikipedia and it hasn't presented a problem that I know of.

Perhaps my comments were ambiguous, but when I refered to "template," I meant that what I would like from the LOE-Japanese template is that the <i>official titles used in Japan</i> (in whatever script or language) be listed before <i>unofficial transliterations</i> provided for anglophones' benefit.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonocrat_e146.html" title="User:Monocrat">Monocrat</a> 17:05, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do not think I was lecturing. On my version of the template, kanji is given priority on the proposed version its at the second line and is ambigious. It may very well be kana. My version clearly identifies it. I frankly am not certan of the issue here, both templates present the same amount of information only its just that my version presents it in a more organised manner which you consider bad... --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 17:10, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

With this conflict escalating to the point of a vote, I was expecting something drastically different.

<li><b>Support</b>. I'd like to note I oppose the exitance of this poll. Don't vote for everything. Having said that here are my rationale:
<ol>
<li>The TV screen shots of individual episodes are really not the right way. If you look at the various star Trek lists for instance, you will see that most of the screencaps are unintelligable. At best, you can tell there is a peson or a ship but it isnt any more significant. Furthermore <b>LEGALLY</b> speaking, I am not sure we can claim fair-use on episode screenshots used like this. DVD covers on the other hand are from amazon.com and are promotional by nature. It is less likely for companies to complain.</li>
<li>Both of the LOE templates make heavy use of meta temlates. Meta templates should be avoided if they are not making peoples and/or coders life any easier. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_Sandbox_15d9.html" title="User:Cool Cat/Sandbox">My version</a> (as of now) has a similar usage (same parameters) while using less code.

<li><b>Support</b>: My major reason for supporting this format is that the seperation between English, kanji, and romaji titles is much more clear and is better. Also though, the reason that anime episode lists are more able to use DVD covers instead of American TV series is because anime is commonly only released a couple of episodes per DVD. With American shows, you have them released as complete seasons, so it's much harder to use a DVD cover image as 24 epiodes might be using the same cover. --<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 17:06, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> Okay, it seems that the only real difference between the two templates is the placement of the episode number, and the placement of the romaji and kanji/kana titles. Outside of that, they are pretty much the same. Perhaps one (Cool Cat's) could be used for lists using the DVD cover shots, and the other could be used for episode lists with screenshots for each episode? Cool Cat's seems to be designed more for using the DVD cover with multiple episodes (or that's what it's mostly been used for, anyway). ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">Nihon</a><a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">jo</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><b><font color="darkgreen">e</font></b></a></small></sup> 20:06, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is also about the format of using DVD covers on the side vs no images or individual screenshots, as well as the THICK lines. DVD covers only help identify an episode if you own the DVD..

<dd>In all reality, this is such a minor anime that I really shouldn't care, and my quick reactions are probably not helping. However, I don't think ignoring issues for the sake of making Cool Cat happy is the right thing to do. I think it's pretty clear from this talk page that Cool Cat is interested in only doing things his way, and only considered the input from others when he was under the threat of the above straw poll.

<dd>An editor cannot be blocked for starting a RfC... And this is clearly not harassment... You feel this is a threat from me, so you try to threaten me?

<p>Cool out, your comments are crossing into the realm of pure vanity now. Not only are you continue to insisting that your template be used over the LOE template even though the LOE template reached a high enough threshold to be considered the consensus, but now you are claiming that the straw poll was "rigged" and should be made invalid without providing any evidence of vote rigging.</p>
<p>You have also made the claim that since you are the principle contributor to the list, that your preferences should be used over the preferences outlined by the straw poll's results. Statements such as those gives everyone else a strong impression that you think you <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> the list as a result and therefore have complete control over its continents and structure.</p>
<p>Now let me ask one simple question. Is there a reason not to use a template that is being maintained by a wikiproject and addresses <b>most</b> of the concerns express in the debate and straw poll beyond things that are superficial? --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 20:14, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, is there a reason why not to use my template? Since as you point out, the diference is superficial. The straw poll is currently about where the kanji, romaji, and episode numbers appear. Infact I do not exactly see the point of this insistance on the LOE template.</dd>
<dd>Define "maintained". I did not know templates required maintanance. They just sit there... sometimes additional parameters are added, but that doesn't require a wikiproject.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Wikipedia%7EStraw_polls_a7e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Straw polls">staw poll</a> was inaproporate in first place. Not only was it conducted inproperly but also its purpose was not about the content of the article.</dd>

<p>To be honest, I'm tired of seeing this series of arguments drag on. It's pointless and you're not going to reach a consensus ever at this rate, so this article will become perennially locked from editting. Why don't you just drop the argument for the moment, go finish up the article, and then come back to argue about the finer points? There is no point in trying to reach consensus now since someone always object to it, and nothing is gained if things continue like this.</p>
<p>So how about it? Let's say we request that the article to be unprotected, go fill in the article (but NOT mess around with the template or removing the movie entry, because I don't want to go through this again), and when everything else is done, concerned parties can continue with their drama.

<dd>No, I'm sorry, but to many users have had similar problems with Cool Cat for me to just let this go and let him have "his way". There's over-flowing examples of his bad editing behavior, and to just ignore this issue because he's being a pain is the kind of thing that is harmful to wikipedia. Maybe if this wasn't an article that I was interested in personally in editing, then I might be able to let it go. Cool Cat continues his attempts to force his way and not work with others time and time again. This is ridicules that I have to stand here and argue very basic things simple because he chooses to ignore logic. The more I interact with him the more I find this out. I'd like to point out the comments on the following pages to support my words: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Cool_Cat_%2801%29_ddec.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Cool Cat (01)">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Cool Cat (01)</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Cool_Cat_%2802%29_29bf.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Cool Cat (02)">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Cool Cat (02)</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Cool_Cat_%2803%29_f86c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Cool Cat (03)">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Cool Cat (03)</a>, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Administrators/Requests_and_votes/Cool_Cat_1" class="extiw" title="m:Template:Administrators/Requests_and_votes/Cool_Cat_1">m:Template:Administrators/Requests and votes/Cool Cat 1</a>, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Administrators/Requests_and_votes/Cool_Cat_2" class="extiw" title="m:Template:Administrators/Requests_and_votes/Cool_Cat_2">m:Template:Administrators/Requests and votes/Cool Cat 2</a>, in addition to the above comments and quotes I pointed out as well. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 21:37, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm thinking more along the lines of including a wikilink to the movie in the <i>See also</i> section, but not actually include a description of the movie among the list of episodes. That's because the movie is an alternative telling of the same story instead of a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prequel.html" title="Prequel">prequel</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequel.html" title="Sequel">sequel</a> of the TV story line, like how the FMA movie is a sequal of to TV series. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 00:05, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm just saying we should delay this arguement for later, this is not an endorsement for Cool Cat's behaviour.

<dd>About the images, personally I'm just waiting to see if we're allowed to use any images before going back to that dispute (although I do agree with you).

<dd>Look, that's great that Cool Cat is actually discussing this with other editors, but you guys need to involve all of us. So far I can't see any discussion on anyone's talk page about this, so I assume it was an IRC thing? A great deal of debate went into what template and style to use, and if you want to revisit the topic you need to bring it up on this talk page first. And, if I read this right, Taw was the one who unprotected the article, in order to place in these edits? So Cool Cat, instead of discussing it here, went behind everyone's backs and went directly to an admin to sneak in his template. This is extremely inappropriate for both Cool Cat and Taw. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 08:53, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I unprotected it mainly to get DVD covers replaced by screenshots. Anyway, the list still sucks and it shouldn't be indefinitely staying in such state.

<dd>The straw poll was nothing more than an organization of comments. Each "vote" has a comment and rational behind it. The majority supported LOE's template (some even citing the reason as those differences you think are so minor), especially considering that any changes to LOE templates are discussed ON Wikipedia and promote more input from more editors. These are the reasons why we decided to use the LOE template, not because of a vote, but because the vote was the only way we could spell it out for you. This is called a consensus. You've been repeatedly warned on this issue, and just because you don't agree with the outcome doesn't mean that you get to switch the template over. If you continue you will likely be given a temporary block from Wikipedia for having <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">ownership</a> problems.</dd>

<p>Uhm, I looked at some other lists.

So if we want to standarize then two-line format actually makes some sense. Then, in this article I think one-line format looks much nicer, so if we don't care about standarization I'd go for one-line 120%-font titles. I guess I don't really care much either way, just be nice to each other guys and finish the descriptions&#160;:-) After we're done with the content we can agree to toss a virtual coin or something about the format&#160;;-) <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETaw_8bc0.html" title="User:Taw">Taw</a> 23:50, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, consistency was apart of my argument.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not all together against the Kanji and Romaji on one line, but I haven't heard any significant argument that would warrant breaking from a standard format. Also, I think there are times when, even if you can "fit" that much information on one line, that isn't always a good thing to do so. The use of white space when formatting text can help you guide the reader's eyes, letting them quickly jump from title to title, without getting lost in a sea of text.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are some other disagreements other than the Title row. Such as, the extra spoiler text that states "Some of the episode overviews may contain spoilers, but attempts are made to limit their spoilage." <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> states that such self-references should be avoided, and rather, use the standard {{<a href="../../../s/p/o/Template%7ESpoiler_6a46.html" title="Template:Spoiler">spoiler</a>}} templates for such messages. For one, the spoiler template tags have meta data that can allow them to be turned on or off via css (I think I said that correctly). Second, the statement is no longer true, as I have begun to edit summaries and add more, and hopefully more editors other than CC and myself will to the same.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The above discussion about whether or not to list the movie with the episodes seems to favor not including the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_%28film%29.html" title="Air (film)">Air movie</a>, and making the list for episodes, or even additional ovas and movies (if made) as long as they are apart of the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_%28TV_series%29_a1d6.html" title="Air (TV series)">Air TV series</a> canon. Only one editor desires it's inclusion, despite concerns that this could confuse the reader. That being said, I'm still open to debating the issue rather than just removing the entry.</dd>

I understand that now his template has undergone more changes. However, if he would like to re-visit the issue then it should be discussed on the talk page first, as the previous consensus is still in effect. Going ahead and changing it without discussion, knowing full well that the issue has not been taken lightly, is very disrespectful to all editors of this article, regardless of what styles they prefer. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 05:29, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Since you ask for guidance. Here is what I suggest: I'll be creating a new section below and I'd like you to tell me why your version (two line template) is better for this articles case. Please do not quote policies, guidelines etc, just your reasonings.</dd>

<dd>You are the one wanting to change consensus. It's simply redundant to re-explain what has already been told to you, especially when I've told you in detail why the LOE template is the better choice. And I wasn't the only editor to tell you this. Look at the straw poll results, most cite reasons other than the Kanji placement. Some votes even came in after your template looked very similar to the LOE template, and still went in favor of LOE's template. The LOE template will be maintained and grow with open and well documented discussion. Your suggestions for the Title row to be one line were not ignored, and if you wish for that formatting change then I suggest you take it up on <a href="../../../l/o/e/WT%7ELOE_d7e6.html" title="WT:LOE">WT:LOE</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 12:34, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is your argument so weak that it cant survive a debate? And all isues but the kanji debate is invalid since my template offers the exact same thing. Furthermore <a href="../../../s/t/r/Wikipedia%7EStraw_polls_a7e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Straw polls">Straw polls</a> are not absolute.</dd>
<dd>I do not see WP:LOE as a legitamate authority endorsed by the foundation to rule over articles related to episode lists. It is just a very small wikiproject. All issues about this article should be discussed right here.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, my argument is not weak, my argument has already been made. WP:LOE is not an authority, and no one is claiming it is. However, the current consensus is to use the templates under that WikiProject's care. It's an open project that any editor can participate in, including you. Your template does not do the exact same thing, it currently has some very different formatting options (text size, boldness, cell color). Even if it did do the same thing, there still wouldn't be significant reason to use your template over the LOE template. Again, as Taw even said, constancy can also be a very important factor, which would point to LOE's template's usage. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 14:10, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Here are some of the comments from the previous consensus that cite reasons (as in, not "per") and don't have additional comments. Basically, I'm taking examples of reasons already brought up, but stripping the extra discussion, per Cool Cat's request. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 14:47, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Support</b>, I not only think this looks better, but I think it's easier to read. I'll repeat some of my reasonings from my past comments, "<i><a href="../../../l/o/e/WP%7ELOE_88f8.html" title="WP:LOE">WP:LOE</a>'s template itself is used in over 20 articles already (<a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Template%7EJapanese_episode_list_60d8.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Japanese episode list">Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Japanese episode list</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Template%7EJapanese_episode_list_%28no_image%29_bf78.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Japanese episode list (no image)">Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Japanese episode list (no image)</a>), and has been very well received so far. Meanwhile, the OMG inspired/Cool Cat episode template has some objections (<a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_list_candidates_Featured_log_June_2006_29c5.html#List_of_Fullmetal_Alchemist_episodes" title="Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/Featured log/June 2006">Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/Featured log/June 2006#List of Fullmetal Alchemist episodes</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Naruto_episodes_c1a9.html#Reorganisation" title="Talk:List of Naruto episodes">Talk:List of Naruto episodes#Reorganisation</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_Archive_2006_06_240f.html#Air" title="User talk:Cool Cat/Archive/2006/06">User talk:Cool Cat/Archive/2006/06#Air</a>). WP's LOE episode templates are easy to use, with clearly marked parameters. The template also makes use of individual episode screenshots seen on most lists of episodes.</i>" Also, style layout is not a <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_featured_list__6de1.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a featured list?">factor</a> for <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_lists_c1de.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured lists">Featured lists</a> (although I think it should be). Featured list status seems to be the only pro-argument I can see for the other template and style. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 03:20, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b>: I think it goes along better with the page and is more compact and thus easier to scan the page. It's not always about the eye candy since this is an encyclopedia after all and thus shouldn't the information about the actual episodes be more important than the way they are displayed? That being said, I'd say just stick with the current standard format using the Japanese episode template. Besides, I already hate how warped this discussion and article have gotten.--<a href="../../../j/u/h/User%7EJuhachi_79a5.html" title="User:Juhachi">Juhachi</a> 05:15, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support.</b> I've switched the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Excel_Saga_media_0a5c.html#Episodes" title="List of Excel Saga media">Excel Saga episode list</a> from the OMG format to the LOE-Japanese template. I have issues with how the template gives pride of place to unofficial romaji titles and how the official Japanese titles are a little small, but its aesthetic value outweighs those concerns.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonocrat_e146.html" title="User:Monocrat">Monocrat</a> 14:16, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> per TheFarix's example as my concerns were addressed. Now that the tables are basically the same, I vote for this because this one just looks so much better. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">_dk</a> 22:00, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support.</b> The Japanese version looks better and is compatible with WP:LOE and thus better maintainable in the future. - <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheDJ_515e.html" title="User:TheDJ">TheDJ</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheDJ_8bc8.html" title="User talk:TheDJ">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheDJ_82c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheDJ">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WikiProject Television</a>) 22:04, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'll dig through some more stuff and post it here, and I'll even re-write my own personal reasons. But right now I need to get some sleep.

<dd>Some of these statements (from the poll) do not hold any value, at least one is self contradictary. I'd like to see arguments (preferably one line arguments, lets summarise and not rant) showing this articles supremecy compared to the rival template.</dd>

<dd>Why do they not hold any value? And I'm sorry, but I'm not going to tailer my arguments to your demands. That is extremely ridiculous to dictate how you want a statement formatted.

If so, I will unprotect the page as it's been more than long enough and re-protect should the edit warring continue. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 03:41, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Merge with main article?</span></h2>
<p>Is there a reason this is a separate article from the main Air article at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_%28TV_series%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_%28TV_series%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_%28TV_series%29</a>&#160;? I can't really fathom why it needs its own article, when other series integrate theirs in the main entry. 71.162.249.23 10:40, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's its own article just for the other reason that many series split the episodes section because it gets too long and obstructive to view on the main article, such as with: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Melancholy_of_Haruhi_Suzumiya_episodes_6d40.html" title="List of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya episodes">List of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya episodes</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_episodes_bc5d.html" title="List of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni episodes">List of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni episodes</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ouran_High_School_Host_Club_episodes_b0f9.html" title="List of Ouran High School Host Club episodes">List of Ouran High School Host Club episodes</a>, etc. etc. And while I do see your point in that the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_%28TV_series%29_a1d6.html" title="Air (TV series)">Air (TV series)</a> article is lacking content, I believe they should still be split.--<font color="#FF66CC"><b>(</b><a href="../../../j/u/h/User%7EJuhachi_79a5.html" title="User:Juhachi"><b><font color="#0066CC">十八</font></b></a><font color="#FF66CC"><b>|</b></font><a href="../../../j/u/h/User_talk%7EJuhachi_fae6.html" title="User talk:Juhachi"><b><font color="#0066CC">talk</font></b></a><b>)</b></font> 10:53, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
