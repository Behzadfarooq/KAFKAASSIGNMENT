<p>Airlines vary from those with a single airplane carrying mail or cargo, through full-service international airlines operating many hundreds of airplanes. Airline services can be categorized as being intercontinental, intracontinental, <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regional_airline.html" title="Regional airline">regional</a> or domestic and may be operated as scheduled services or charters.</p>

<ul>
<li>The pattern of ownership has gone from government owned or supported to independent, for-profit public companies. This occurs as regulators permit greater freedom and non-government ownership, in steps that are usually decades apart. This pattern is not seen for all airlines in all regions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The demand for air travel services depends on: business needs for cargo shipments, business passenger demand, leisure passenger demand, all influenced by economic activity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The overall trend of demand has been consistently increasing. In the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, annual growth rates of 15% or more were common. Annual growth of 5-6% persisted through the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Growth rates are not consistent in all regions, but countries with a de-regulated airline industry have more competition and greater pricing freedom. This results in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>,<a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and other markets exhibit this trend.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The industry is cyclical. Four or five years of poor performance preceed five or six years of improved performance. But profitability in the good years is generally low, in the range of 2-3% net profit after interest and tax. In times of profit, airlines lease new generations of airplanes and upgrade services in response to higher demand. Since 1980, the industry has not earned back the cost of capital during the best of times. Conversely, in bad times losses can be dramatically worse.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Buffett_9524.html" title="Warren Buffett">Warren Buffett</a> once said that despite all the money that has been invested in all airlines, the net profit is less than zero. He believes it is one of the hardest businesses to manage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As in many mature industries, consolidation is a trend. Airline groupings may consist of limited bilateral partnerships, long-term, multi-faceted alliances between carriers, equity arrangements, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mergers_and_acquisitions.html" title="Mergers and acquisitions">mergers</a>, or <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeover.html" title="Takeover">takeovers</a>. Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries, most consolidation takes place within a country. In the U.S., over 200 airlines have merged, been taken over, or gone out of business since deregulation in 1978. Many international airline managers are lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation to achieve higher economy and efficiency.</li>

<p>Following <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the United States found itself swamped with aviators. Many decided to take their war-surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns, performing acrobatic maneuvers to woo crowds. In 1918, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Postal_Service_3c00.html" title="United States Postal Service">United States Postal Service</a> won the financial backing of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">Congress</a> to begin experimenting with <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_mail.html" title="Air mail">air mail</a> service, initially using <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtiss_Jenny_7b75.html" title="Curtiss Jenny">Curtiss Jenny</a> aircraft that had been procured by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> for reconnaissance missions on the Western Front. Private operators were the first to fly the mail but due to numerous accidents the US Army was tasked with mail delivery. During the course of the Army's involvement they proved to be too unreliable and lost their air mail duties. By the mid-1920s, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Postal_Service_3c00.html" title="United States Postal Service">Postal Service</a> had developed its own air mail network, based on a transcontinental backbone between <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York%2C_New_York_5001.html" title="New York, New York">New York</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a>.

<p>Passenger service during the early <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> was sporadic: most airlines at the time were focused on carrying bags of mail. In 1925, however, the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford Motor Company</a> bought out the Stout Aircraft Company and began construction of the all-metal <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Trimotor_3bfa.html" title="Ford Trimotor">Ford Trimotor</a>, which became the first successful American airliner. With a 12-passenger capacity, the Trimotor made passenger service potentially profitable. Air service was seen as a supplement to <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_transport.html" title="Rail transport">rail</a> service in the American transportation network.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Trippe_2686.html" title="Juan Trippe">Juan Trippe</a> began a crusade to create an air network that would link America to the world, and he achieved this goal through his airline, <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_American_World_Airways_c80c.html" title="Pan American World Airways">Pan American World Airways</a>, with a fleet of flying boats that linked <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> to <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai.html" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a> to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. Pan Am was the only U.S. airline to go international before the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_247.html" title="Boeing 247">Boeing 247</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_DC-3_fa22.html" title="Douglas DC-3">Douglas DC-3</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, the U.S. airline industry was generally profitable, even during the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>.

<p>The first countries in Europe to embrace air transport were <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/l/m/KLM_7464.html" title="KLM">KLM</a>, the oldest carrier still operating under its original name, was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>. The first flight transported two English passengers to <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schiphol.html" title="Schiphol">Schiphol</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> from <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>. Like other major European airlines of the time (see France and the UK below), KLM's early growth depended heavily on the needs to service links with far-flung colonial possessions (<a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_Indies_1dfa.html" title="Dutch Indies">Dutch Indies</a>). It is only after the loss of the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_Empire_666c.html" title="Dutch Empire">Dutch Empire</a> that <a href="../../../k/l/m/KLM_7464.html" title="KLM">KLM</a> found itself based at a small country with few potential passengers, depending heavily on transfer traffic, and was one of the first to introduce the hub-system to facilitate easy connections.</p>
<p>France began an air mail service to <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> in 1919 that was bought out in 1927, renamed <a href="../../../a/%C3%A9/r/A%C3%A9ropostale_%28aviation%29.html" title="Aéropostale (aviation)">Aéropostale</a>, and injected with capital to become a major international carrier. In 1933, Aéropostale went <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankrupt</a>, was nationalized and merged with several other airlines into what became <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_France_27d0.html" title="Air France">Air France</a>.</p>
<p>In Finland, the charter establishing Aero O/Y (now <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnair.html" title="Finnair">Finnair</a>, one of the oldest still-operating airlines in the world) was signed in the city of <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helsinki.html" title="Helsinki">Helsinki</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">12 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a>. <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junkers_F_13_ea87.html" title="Junkers F 13">Junkers F 13</a> D-335 became the first aircraft of the company, when Aero took delivery of it on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_14.html" title="March 14">14 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>. The first flight was between Helsinki and <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tallinn.html" title="Tallinn">Tallinn</a>, capital of <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estonia.html" title="Estonia">Estonia</a>, and it took place on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">20 March</a> 1924, one week later.</p>
<p>Germany's <a href="../../../l/u/f/Lufthansa.html" title="Lufthansa">Lufthansa</a> began in 1926. Lufthansa, unlike most other airlines at the time, became a major investor in airlines outside of Europe, founding <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varig.html" title="Varig">Varig</a> and <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avianca.html" title="Avianca">Avianca</a>.

The peak of German air travel came in the mid-1930s, when <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> propaganda ministers approved the start of commercial <a href="../../../z/e/p/Zeppelin.html" title="Zeppelin">zeppelin</a> service: the big <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airship.html" title="Airship">airships</a> were a symbol of industrial might, but the fact that they used flammable hydrogen gas raised safety concerns that culminated with the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindenburg.html" title="Hindenburg">Hindenburg</a> disaster of 1937. The reason they used hydrogen instead of the not-flammable helium gas was a United States military embargo on helium.</p>

Post-war airline route structure.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As governments met to set the standards and scope for an emergent civil air industry toward the end of the war, it was no surprise that the U.S. took a position of maximum operating freedom. After all, U.S. airline companies were not devastated by the war, as European companies and the few Asian companies had been. This preference for "open skies" operating regimes continues, within limitations, to this day.</p>
<p>World War II, like World War I, brought new life to the airline industry. Many airlines in the Allied countries were flush from lease contracts to the military, and foresaw a future explosive demand for civil air transport, for both passengers and cargo. They were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_Stratocruiser_f74e.html" title="Boeing Stratocruiser">Boeing Stratocruiser</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_Constellation_7e6d.html" title="Lockheed Constellation">Lockheed Constellation</a>, and <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_DC-6_7144.html" title="Douglas DC-6">Douglas DC-6</a>. Most of these new aircraft were based on American bombers such as the <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-29.html" title="B-29">B-29</a>, which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pressurization.html" title="Pressurization">pressurization</a>. Most offered increased efficiency from both added speed and greater payload.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, the <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Comet_b1bf.html" title="De Havilland Comet">De Havilland Comet</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_707.html" title="Boeing 707">Boeing 707</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_DC-8_3c95.html" title="Douglas DC-8">Douglas DC-8</a>, and <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sud_Aviation_Caravelle_462e.html" title="Sud Aviation Caravelle">Sud Aviation Caravelle</a> became the first flagships of the Jet Age in the West, while the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> bloc countered with the <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupolev_Tu-104_45a1.html" title="Tupolev Tu-104">Tupolev Tu-104</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupolev_Tu-124_a6e9.html" title="Tupolev Tu-124">Tupolev Tu-124</a> in the fleets of state-owned carriers such as <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeroflot.html" title="Aeroflot">Aeroflot</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interflug.html" title="Interflug">Interflug</a>.

<p>The next big boost for the airlines would come in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, when the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_747.html" title="Boeing 747">Boeing 747</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10_b672.html" title="McDonnell Douglas DC-10">McDonnell Douglas DC-10</a>, and <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_L-1011_3190.html" title="Lockheed L-1011">Lockheed L-1011</a> inaugurated widebody ("jumbo jet") service, which is still the standard in international travel. The <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupolev_Tu-144_59df.html" title="Tupolev Tu-144">Tupolev Tu-144</a> and its Western counterpart, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concorde.html" title="Concorde">Concorde</a>, made supersonic travel a reality. In 1972, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus.html" title="Airbus">Airbus</a> began producing Europe's most commercially successful line of airliners to date. The added efficiencies for these aircraft were often not in speed, but in passenger capacity, payload, and range.</p>
<p>1978's U.S. airline industry deregulation lowered barriers for new airlines. In this period, new start-ups entered during downturns in the normal 8-10 year business cycle. At that time, they find aircraft, are financed, contract hangar and maintenance services, train new employees, and recruit laid off staff from other airlines.</p>
<p>As the business cycle returned to normalcy, major airlines dominated their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings, often swamping new startups. Only <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_West_Airlines_ad51.html" title="America West Airlines">America West Airlines</a> (which has since merged with US Airways) remained a significant survivor from this new entrant era, as dozens, even hundreds, have gone under.</p>
<p>In many ways, the biggest winner in the deregulated environment was the air passenger. Indeed, the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel, as many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequent_flyer.html" title="Frequent flyer">frequent flyer</a> loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, for almost any point in the country. Air travel's advantages put intercity bus lines under pressure, and most have withered away.</p>
<p>By the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.</p>

De-regulated airline route structures.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Toward the end of the century, a new style of <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low-cost_carrier.html" title="Low-cost carrier">low cost airline</a> emerged, offering a no-frills product at a lower price. <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Airlines_2156.html" title="Southwest Airlines">Southwest Airlines</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/t/JetBlue_eebe.html" title="JetBlue">JetBlue</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/r/AirTran_Airways_0a36.html" title="AirTran Airways">AirTran Airways</a>, and other low-cost carriers represent a serious challenge to today's legacy airlines, as do their low-cost counterparts in Europe, Canada, and Asia. Their commercial viability represents a serious competitive threat to the legacy carriers.</p>
<p>Thus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region. Today, airlines representing approximately one-half of total U.S. seat capacity are operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy provisions.</p>

<p>Many countries have <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_airline.html" title="National airline">national airlines</a> that are owned and operated by the government. Even fully privatized airlines are subject to a great deal of government regulation for economic, political, and safety concerns. Airline labor actions, for instance, are often halted by government intervention in order to protect the free flow of people, communications, and goods between different regions without compromising safety.</p>
<p>The United States, Australia, and to a lesser extent Brazil, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Japan have "deregulated" their airlines. In the past, these governments dictated airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand.</p>
<p>The entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets, and average fares tend to drop 20% or more. The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base.</p>
<p>As a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines. These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business, in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants.</p>

<p>Groups such as the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization_93f3.html" title="International Civil Aviation Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> establish worldwide standards for safety and other vital concerns. Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes. The model of such an agreement was the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bermuda_Agreement_c4ce.html" title="Bermuda Agreement">Bermuda Agreement</a> between the US and UK following World War II, which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes.</p>
<p>Bilateral agreements are based on the "<a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedoms_of_the_air.html" title="Freedoms of the air">freedoms of the air</a>," a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country (a very rarely granted right known as <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabotage.html" title="Cabotage">cabotage</a>).

<p>Historically, air travel has survived largely through state support, whether in the form of equity or subsidies. The airline industry as a whole has made a cumulative loss during its 120-year history, once subsidies for aircraft development and airport construction are included in the cost.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The lack of profitability and continuing government subsidies are justified with the argument that <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positive_externalities.html" title="Positive externalities">positive externalities</a>, such as higher growth due to global mobility, outweigh microeconomic losses. A historically high level of government intervention in the airline industry can be seen as part of a wider political consensus on strategic forms of transport, such as <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highways.html" title="Highways">highways</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railways.html" title="Railways">railways</a>, both of which are also publicly funded in most parts of the world. Profitability is likely to improve in the future as privatization continues and more competitive low-cost carriers proliferate.</p>
<p>Although many countries continue to operate state-owned or parastatal airlines, many large airlines today are privately owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles in order to maximize shareholder profit.</p>

<p>Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized <a href="../../../y/i/e/Yield_management.html" title="Yield management">yield management</a> systems.</p>
<p>Most airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price_discrimination.html" title="Price discrimination">price discrimination</a>, in order to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the current booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day. Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travel_class.html" title="Travel class">travel classes</a> for pricing purposes.</p>
<p>A complicating factor is that of origin-destination control ("O&amp;D control"). Someone purchasing a ticket from say, Melbourne to Sydney for $A200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same airplane, and who is willing to pay $A1400. Should the airline prefer the $A1400 passenger, or the $A200 passenger + a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $A1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily in their markets.</p>
<p>The advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, most notably <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabre_%28computer_system%29.html" title="Sabre (computer system)">Sabre</a>, allowed airlines to easily perform <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost-benefit_analysis.html" title="Cost-benefit analysis">cost-benefit analyses</a> on different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere). The intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term "fare war" to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes. Through computers, new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines' sales channels. For this purpose the airlines use the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline_Tariff_Publishing_Company_4d56.html" title="Airline Tariff Publishing Company">Airline Tariff Publishing Company</a> (ATPCO), who distribute latest fares for more than 500 airlines to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_Reservation_System_92b0.html" title="Computer Reservation System">Computer Reservation Systems</a> across the world.</p>
<p>The extent of these pricing phenomena is strongest in "legacy" carriers. In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer preannounced and simplified price structure, and often quote prices for each leg of a trip separately.</p>
<p>Computers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for "no-shows," but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats. Since an average of ⅓ of all seats are flown empty<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with overbooking on high demand flights can help reduce this figure.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline.html" title="Edit section: Operating costs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Operating costs</span></h3>
<p>Full-service airlines have a high level of fixed and operating costs in order to establish and maintain air services: labor, fuel, airplanes, engines, spares and parts, IT services and networks, airport equipment, airport handling services, sales distribution, catering, training, <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviation_insurance.html" title="Aviation insurance">Aviation insurance</a> and other costs. Thus all but a small percentage of the income from ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers.</p>
<p>Moreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed, however, due to a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes, and surcharges they have little or no control over, and these are passed through to various providers. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the originating country.</p>
<p>Analysis of the 1992-1996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales. While airlines as a whole earned 6% return on capital employed (2-3.5% less than the cost of capital), airports earned 10%, catering companies 10-13%, handling companies 11-14%, aircraft lessors 15%, aircraft manufacturers 16%, and global distribution companies more than 30%. (Source: Spinetta, 2000, quoted in Doganis, 2002)</p>
<p>In contrast, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Airlines_2156.html" title="Southwest Airlines">Southwest Airlines</a> has been the most profitable of airline companies since 1970. Indeed, some sources have calculated Southwest to be the best performing stock over the period, outperforming <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and many other high performing companies. The chief reasons for this are their product consistency and cost control.</p>
<p>The widespread entrance of a new breed of low cost airlines beginning at the turn of the century has accelerated the demand that full service carriers control costs. Many of these low cost companies emulate <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Airlines_2156.html" title="Southwest Airlines">Southwest Airlines</a> in various respects, and like Southwest, they are able to eke out a consistent profit throughout all phases of the business cycle.</p>
<p>As a result, a shakeout of airlines is occurring in the U.S. and elsewhere. <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Airlines_e78f.html" title="United Airlines">United Airlines</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Airways_3275.html" title="US Airways">US Airways</a> (twice), <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Air_Lines_1541.html" title="Delta Air Lines">Delta Air Lines</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_Airlines_ad36.html" title="Northwest Airlines">Northwest Airlines</a> have all declared <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chapter_11.html" title="Chapter 11">Chapter 11</a> bankruptcy, and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_cdc7.html" title="American Airlines">American</a> has barely avoided doing so. <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alitalia.html" title="Alitalia">Alitalia</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavian_Airlines_System_0354.html" title="Scandinavian Airlines System">Scandinavian Airlines System</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/b/SABENA_e099.html" title="SABENA">SABENA</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan_Air_System_2c97.html" title="Japan Air System">Japan Air System</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Canada_a526.html" title="Air Canada">Air Canada</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansett_Australia_e9f9.html" title="Ansett Australia">Ansett Australia</a>, and others have flirted with or declared bankruptcy since 2000, as low cost entrants enter their home markets as well. Some argue that it would be far better for the industry as a whole if a wave of actual closures were to reduce the number of "undead" airlines competing with healthy airlines while being artificially protected from creditors via <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> law. On the other hand, some have pointed out that the reduction in capacity would be short lived given that there would be large quantities of relatively new aircraft that bankruptcies would want to get rid of and would re-enter the market either as increased fleets for the survivors or the basis of cheap planes for new startups.</p>
<p>Where an airline has established an engineering base at an airport then there may be considerable economic advantages in using that same airport as a preferred focus (or "hub") for its scheduled flights.</p>
<p><a name="Assets_and_financing" id="Assets_and_financing"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline.html" title="Edit section: Assets and financing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Assets and financing</span></h3>
<p>Airline financing is quite complex, since airlines are highly leveraged operations. Not only must they purchase (or lease) new airliner bodies and engines regularly, they must make major long-term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain. Compare <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Airlines_2156.html" title="Southwest Airlines">Southwest Airlines</a> and their reliance on a single airplane type (the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a> 737 and derivatives), with the now defunct <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Air_Lines_a709.html" title="Eastern Air Lines">Eastern Air Lines</a> which operated 17 different aircraft types, each with varying pilot, engine, maintenance, and support needs.</p>
<p>A second financial issue is that of hedging <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petroleum.html" title="Petroleum">oil</a> and <a href="../../../f/u/e/Fuel.html" title="Fuel">fuel</a> purchases, usually second only to labor in its relative cost to the company but with the current high fuel prices it has become biggest part of total airlines expenses. While hedging instruments can be expensive, they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs, such as in the 2000-2005 period.</p>
<p>In view of the congestion apparent at many international <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airport.html" title="Airport">airports</a>, the ownership of slots at certain airports (the right to take-off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night) has become a significant tradable asset for many airlines. Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline. If a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper. Other factors, such as surface transport facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway.</p>
<p><a name="Airline_partnerships" id="Airline_partnerships"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline.html" title="Edit section: Airline partnerships">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Airline partnerships</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_sharing.html" title="Code sharing">Code sharing</a> is the most common type of airline partnership; it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline's flights under its own airline code. An early example of this was <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan_Airlines_e1cf.html" title="Japan Airlines">Japan Airlines</a>' code sharing partnership with <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeroflot.html" title="Aeroflot">Aeroflot</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> on flights from <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> to <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>: Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft.</p>
<p>Since airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as "show me flights from Chicago to Düsseldorf"), an airline who is able to code share with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago-Düsseldorf flight. The passenger is advised however, that Airline 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and Airline 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to Düsseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms so as to increase sales.</p>
<p>Virtually all international airlines practice code sharing.</p>
<p>A more recent development is the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline_alliance.html" title="Airline alliance">airline alliance</a>, which became prevalent in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. Groups of airlines such as the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Alliance_2d03.html" title="Star Alliance">Star Alliance</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/e/Oneworld.html" title="Oneworld">Oneworld</a>, and <a href="../../../s/k/y/SkyTeam_c5df.html" title="SkyTeam">SkyTeam</a> coordinate their passenger service programs (such as lounges and frequent flyer programs), offer special interline tickets, and often engage in extensive codesharing (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinations-- sometimes including cross-equity arrangements-- in which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was <a href="../../../k/l/m/KLM_7464.html" title="KLM">KLM</a>, who partnered with <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_Airlines_ad36.html" title="Northwest Airlines">Northwest Airlines</a>. Both airlines later entered the <a href="../../../s/k/y/SkyTeam_c5df.html" title="SkyTeam">SkyTeam</a> alliance after the fusion of KLM and <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_France_27d0.html" title="Air France">Air France</a> in 2004.</p>
<p>Often the companies combine IT operations, buy fuel, or purchase airplanes as a bloc in order to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.</p>

<p>Each operator of a scheduled or charter flight uses a distinct <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline_call_sign.html" title="Airline call sign">airline call sign</a> when communicating with airports or air traffic control centers. Most of these call-signs are derived from the airline's trade name, but for reasons of history, marketing, or the need to reduce ambiguity in spoken English (so that pilots do not mistakenly make navigational decisions based on instructions issued to a different aircraft), some airlines and air forces use call-signs less obviously connected with their trading name. For example, British Airways uses a <i>Speedbird</i> call-sign, named after the logo of its predecessor, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation_f055.html" title="British Overseas Airways Corporation">BOAC</a>.</p>
