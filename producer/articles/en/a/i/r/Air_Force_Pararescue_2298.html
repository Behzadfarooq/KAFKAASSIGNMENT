<p>As early as <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> there was a recognized need for trained personnel to go to remote sites to rescue airmen. In that year, <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Medical_Department_%28United_States%29_0ad3.html" title="Army Medical Department (United States)">Army Medical Corps</a> doctor Colonel Albert E. Truby predicted that "airplane ambulances" would be used to take medical personnel to crashes and to return victims to medical facilities for treatment. However, it was another two decades before technology and need helped to create what would eventually become Air Force Pararescue.</p>
<p>Even so, there were developments in critical technologies. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, two <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Forest_Service_7b44.html" title="United States Forest Service">U.S. Forestry Service</a> <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smokejumper.html" title="Smokejumper">Smokejumpers</a>, Earl Cooley and Rufus Robinson, showed that <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parachute.html" title="Parachute">parachutists</a> could be placed very accurately onto the ground using the newly-invented 'steerable parachute'. These parachutes and the techniques Smokejumpers used with them were completely different from the techniques used by Army <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airborne_forces.html" title="Airborne forces">airborne</a> units. And it was in that year that Dr. (Captain) Leo P. Martin was trained by the U.S. Forestry Service Parachute Training Center in Seely Lake, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montana.html" title="Montana">Montana</a> as the first 'para-doctor'.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Pararescue_2298.html" title="Edit section: World War II">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">World War II</span></h3>
<p>During the opening months of the war, there was very little need for air rescue. American forces were in retreat or consolidating their positions and most long-range flying was limited. As the war progressed and American airmen began flying missions that would cover hundreds - and sometimes thousands - of miles, air rescue began to play a key role.</p>
<p>Rescue units were formed around the globe under the operational control of local commanders. While training, techniques and equipment varied, one rule was constant: "Rescue forces must presume survivors in each crash until proved otherwise."</p>
<p>Search and rescue of downed aviators in the continental United States fell primarily to the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Air_Patrol_cea9.html" title="Civil Air Patrol">Civil Air Patrol</a>, a civilian aviation group under the command of the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Air_Corps_dc92.html" title="Army Air Corps">Army Air Corps</a>. The CAP would usually send in ground crews after locating a crash site; however, they would sometimes land small aircraft and they did experiment with parachute rescue teams.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Theater_99ca.html" title="European Theater">European Theater</a>, there was very little opportunity for ground rescue. Most flights were over enemy-occupied territory, where a landing meant immediate capture. Crashes during over-water flights created a great many casualties, the <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighth_Air_Force_f1db.html" title="Eighth Air Force">Eighth Air Force</a> initiated a 'sea rescue' group. From its creation in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> until the end of the war, the recovery rate of aircrews downed at sea rose from less than five percent to over forty percent.</p>
<p>In the vast reaches of the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Theater_6317.html" title="Pacific Theater">Pacific Theater</a>, a plane crash meant almost certain death from exposure to the elements. The Army formed several squadrons in theater specifically to aid and rescue downed flyers - both at sea and on islands - with great success.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../c/h/i/China_Burma_India_Theater_of_World_War_II_e44d.html" title="China Burma India Theater of World War II">China-Burma-India Theater</a> (CBI) was the birthplace of what would eventually become pararescue. Here was a unique combination of long overland flights through territory that was loosely held by the enemy and survivable. Dominating the flying in the CBI was 'The Hump' route: cargo flights that left India carrying thousands of tons of vital war supplies had to cross the spine of the <a href="../../../h/i/m/Himalayas.html" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> to reach their destinations in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>. Every day thousands of flight crews and their passengers risked their lives making this passage in <a href="../../../c/-/4/C-46.html" title="C-46">C-46</a> and <a href="../../../c/-/4/C-47_Skytrain_ba01.html" title="C-47 Skytrain">C-47</a> aircraft. Many of these flights never arrived at their destinations due to mechanical problems, weather and mistakes. Crews forced to bail out or crash land faced weeks of hardship in tracing a path back to civilization, enduring harsh weather, little food and the injuries they carried with them.</p>
<p>Capt. John L. 'Blackie' Porter - a former <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stunt_pilot.html" title="Stunt pilot">stunt pilot</a> - is credited with commanding the first organized air rescue unit in the theater. Known as "Blackie's Gang" and flying out of Chabua, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, they were equipped with two C-47 aircraft. One of their first rescue missions was the recovery of twenty people who had bailed out of a stricken C-46 in August of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> in the Naga area of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burma.html" title="Burma">Burma</a>; an area that contained not just Japanese troops, but tribes of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_hunters.html" title="Head hunters">head hunters</a> as well. Among the twenty was <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Broadcasting_Service_37f9.html" title="Columbia Broadcasting Service">CBS</a> reporter <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Sevareid_d97f.html" title="Eric Sevareid">Eric Sevareid</a>. The men were located and supplies were dropped to them. The wing <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_surgeon.html" title="Flight surgeon">flight surgeon</a> Lt. Col. Don Flickinger, and two combat surgical technicians, Sgt. Harold Passey and Cpl. William MacKenzie, parachuted from the search planes to assist and care for the injured. At the same time, a ground team was sent to their location and all twenty walked to safety.</p>
<p>Although parachute rescues were not officially authorized at the time, this is considered by PJs to be the birth of Air Force pararescue. Eric Sevareid said of his rescuers: "Gallant is a precious word: they deserve it".</p>
<p>A few short months later, Capt. Porter was killed on a rescue mission when his B-25 was shot down.</p>
<p>In 1944, General <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_H._Tunner_542f.html" title="William H. Tunner">William H. Tunner</a> took command of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Transport_Command_af20.html" title="Air Transport Command">Air Transport Command</a> operations in CBI. Declaring the rescue organization to be a 'cowboy operation', he appointed Maj. Donald C. Pricer commander of the 3352nd Air Search and Rescue Squadron and assigned him several aircraft for the mission. In addition to fixed-wing aircraft, early <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopters</a> were deployed to the CBI for use in rescue, marking the start of a long association between rotary-wing aircraft and air rescue.</p>

<p>Recognizing the need for a unified organization to perform search and rescue, the Army Air Force formed the Air Rescue Service (ARS). Officially established on May 29, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>; the ARS was charged with saving the lives of aircrews who were involved in aircraft disasters, accidents, crash landings, ditchings or abandonments occurring away from an air base, and with being world-deployable to support far-flung air operations.</p>
<p>In the area around an air base, the air base commander had search and rescue jurisdiction through the Local Base Rescue (LBR) helicopter units. However, these were limited to a 135-mile radius around the base due to the range and payload limitations of the aircraft. In order to reach beyond this limitation, Pararescue teams were authorized on July 1, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, with the first teams to be ready for fielding in November. Each team was to be comprised of a para-doctor and four pararescue technicians trained in medicine, survival, rescue and tactics. Pararescue was given the mission of rescuing crews lost on long-range bomber and transport missions and to support other agencies when aerial rescue was requested.</p>
<p>A mission earlier in 1947 was the final impetus for the formal creation of Air Force Pararescue. In May, Dr. (Capt.) <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_B._Holliday%2C_Jr._4c58.html" title="Pope B. Holliday, Jr.">Pope B. 'Doc' Holliday</a> parachuted out of an <a href="../../../o/a/-/OA-10_Catalina_9434.html" title="OA-10 Catalina">OA-10 Catalina</a> into the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicaragua.html" title="Nicaragua">Nicaraguan</a> jungle to aid a crewmember who had parachuted from a crippled <a href="../../../b/-/1/B-17_Flying_Fortress_15c9.html" title="B-17 Flying Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortress</a>. His actions earned him the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze_Star_Medal_c027.html" title="Bronze Star Medal">Bronze Star</a> and made him another of pararescue's early legends.</p>
<p>Shortly after Pararescue teams were authorized, the 5th Rescue Squadron conducted the first Pararescue and Survival School at <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacDill_AFB_d68b.html" title="MacDill AFB">MacDill AFB</a> in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>. The core of instructors were experienced officers and enlisted men who were recruited from all branches of service. The commandant of that first school was pilot Lt. Perry C. Emmons, who had been assigned to the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_of_Strategic_Services_f08f.html" title="Office of Strategic Services">Office of Strategic Services</a> (OSS) during World War II. At the close of the war, Emmons and six sergeants flew <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_War_9e23.html" title="Prisoner of War">prisoners of war</a> out of <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, earning his group the nickname "Perry and the Pirates", after the popular comic strip "<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_and_the_Pirates_854d.html" title="Terry and the Pirates">Terry and the Pirates</a>". After the war, Emmons completed Airborne School at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Benning_8d6e.html" title="Fort Benning">Fort Benning</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28U.S._state%29_7f30.html" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a>, becoming only the second jump-qualified Air Force pilot.</p>
<p>In late 1947, the crash of the <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-29.html" title="B-29">B-29</a> "Clobbered Turkey" in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> brought home the need for specialized, well-trained pararescuemen. On December 21, the "Clobbered Turkey" hit a mountain and when the wreck was spotted on the 27th, Medical Corps Lt. Albert C. Kinney, First Sergeant Santhell O. London and T-5 Leon J. Casey - none of whom were trained Pararescuemen - volunteered to jump onto the crash site, located ninety-five miles north of <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nome%2C_Alaska_4eff.html" title="Nome, Alaska">Nome</a>. The team encountered poor visibility, extreme temperatures and high winds on the site and as a result, all three perished. Casey's body was found seven miles from the crash site, swept there by the surface winds. Two members of the crew of the "Clobbered Turkey" who set out to seek assistance also perished a few miles from the site. When ground rescue crews finally arrived at the crash site two days later, they found that the remaining six members of the crew - who had stayed with the aircraft - had all survived. Dr. Kinney's body was not located until July of the next year.</p>
<p>In 1949, due to a shortage of available doctors, Medical Service Corps officers replaced para-doctors on the teams, receiving the same training as the enlisted pararescuemen. One of the first of these officers was <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_C._Shumate_7fcc.html" title="John C. Shumate">John C. Shumate</a>, a pharmacist, who was appointed commandant of the Pararescue and Survival School.</p>
<p>At this time the Air Rescue Specialist Course was created at the School of Aviation Medicine, <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunter_Air_Force_Base_9683.html" title="Gunter Air Force Base">Gunter AFB</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>. Designed to teach pararescuemen the skills needed to determine the nature and extent of injuries and to administer treatment, the course was taught by Medical Corps officers with previous pararescue experience, including: Dr. <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_B._Holliday%2C_Jr._4c58.html" title="Pope B. Holliday, Jr.">Pope B.'Doc' Holliday</a>, Dr. <a href="../../../r/u/f/Rufus_Hessberg_7e3a.html" title="Rufus Hessberg">Rufus Hessberg</a>, Dr. Hamilton Blackshear, Dr. Randal W. Briggs and Dr. Burt Rowan.</p>

<p>As Pararescue grew, PJ teams were assigned to every Air Rescue Service squadron to provide global coverage. By 1950, the unification of all the formerly independent Air Rescue Squadrons under the umbrella of the Air Rescue Service was complete.</p>
<p>In 1950, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> attacked across the <a href="../../../3/8/t/38th_parallel_north.html" title="38th parallel north">38th parallel</a> and began the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_Conflict_e218.html" title="Korean Conflict">Korean Conflict</a>. This was an opportunity for Air Rescue to put training into practice and to develop theories into policies. One of the key new concepts was rescue of stranded personnel from behind enemy lines. This, along with evacuating critically wounded men from aid stations close to the front, were Air Rescue's primary missions.</p>
<p>Pararescuemen were a normal part of Air Rescue crews for these missions. Their medical and tactical skills made them invaluable for evacuation and rescue missions of this type.</p>
<p>Pararescuemen were often called upon to leave the helicopters that carried them in order to assist the personnel they were sent to rescue. This might call for an extended stay behind enemy lines and overland travel of several miles. The longest of these 'Lone Wolf' missions lasted seventy-two hours.</p>
<p>By the end of the Korean Conflict in 1953, Air Rescue had evacuated over eight thousand critical casualties and rescued nearly a thousand men from behind enemy lines.</p>

<li>The term "Pararescue Jumper" is a <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retronym.html" title="Retronym">retronym</a> of the initials 'PJ' that were used on an Air Force Form 5 (Aircrew Flight Log) to identify anyone who is onboard in order to jump from the aircraft. Pararescuemen originally had no 'in flight' duties and were listed only as 'PJ' on the Form 5. The pararescue position eventually grew to include duties as an aerial gunner and scanner on rotary wing aircraft, a duty now performed by aerial gunners. Currently, aircrew qualified Pararescuemen will be recorded using aircrew position identifier 'J' ('Pararescue Member') on the AFTO form 781.<a href="http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/pubfiles/af/11/afi11-401/afi11-401.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/pubfiles/af/11/afi11-401/afi11-401.pdf" rel="nofollow">(AFI 11-401)</a></li>
