<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_France_Flight_4590_db4d.html" title="Edit section: The flight">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The flight</span></h2>
<p>During the plane's take-off run from <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport_2b50.html" title="Charles de Gaulle Airport">Charles de Gaulle Airport</a>, a piece of <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titanium.html" title="Titanium">titanium</a> debris on the runway shredded a tyre, which then burst. The piece was about 3 cm wide and nearly 50 cm long. A large chunk of tyre (4.5 kg) struck the underside of the aircraft's wing at over 300 km/h, causing the fuel tank above the landing gear to fail from the inside out, possibly by a hydrodynamic pressure surge. Leaking fuel was ignited by an electric arc in the landing gear bay or through contact with the hot parts of the engine (the latter is disputed by the British investigators). At the point of ignition, engines 1 and 2 both surged and lost all power, but slowly recovered over the next few seconds. A large plume of flame developed; the crew then shut down engine 2 in response to a fire warning.</p>
<p>Having passed <a href="../../../v/1/_/V1_speed.html" title="V1 speed">V<sub>1</sub> speed</a> the crew continued the take-off but they could not gain enough airspeed on the three remaining engines, because the undercarriage could not be retracted. The aircraft was unable to climb or accelerate, and it maintained a speed of 200 <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knot_%28speed%29.html" title="Knot (speed)">knots</a> (370 km/h) at an altitude of 200 feet (60 m). The fire caused damage to the port wing. Engine 1 surged again but this time failed to recover. Due to the asymmetric thrust, the starboard wing lifted, banking the aircraft to over 100 degrees. The crew reduced the power on engines 3 and 4 to attempt to level the aircraft but with falling airspeed they lost control, crashing into Les Relais Bleus hotel near the airport.</p>
<p>The crew was trying to divert to nearby <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Bourget_Airport_dbe1.html" title="Le Bourget Airport">Le Bourget Airport</a>, but accident investigators say that a safe landing with the flight path the aircraft was on would have been highly unlikely.</p>
<p>Flight AF4590 carried 96 Germans, two Danes, one American and one Austrian as well as nine crew members, all of whom were killed, along with four people on the ground. The flight was <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_charter.html" title="Air charter">chartered</a> by German <i>Peter Deilmann Cruises</i> and all passengers were on their way to board a <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruise_ship.html" title="Cruise ship">cruise ship</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/07/25/concorde.crash.07/" class="external autonumber" title="http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/07/25/concorde.crash.07/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>As the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockpit_voice_recorder.html" title="Cockpit voice recorder">CVR</a> transcript recorded it, the last intelligible words of the crew were (in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>):</p>
<p><i>Co-pilot</i>: "Le Bourget, Le Bourget, Le Bourget."</p>
<p><i>Pilot</i>: "Too late (unclear)."</p>

<p><i>Pilot</i>: "No time, no (unclear)."</p>

<p>Concorde had been the safest working passenger airliner in the world according to passenger deaths per distance travelled, although the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_737.html" title="Boeing 737">Boeing 737</a> fleet acquires more passenger miles and service hours in one week than the Concorde fleet acquired in its entire service career. The crash of the Concorde was the beginning of the end of its career.</p>
<p>A few days after the crash, all Concordes were grounded, pending an investigation into the cause of the crash and possible remedies. Air France Concorde F-BVFC was allowed to return home from its stranded position in New York, empty of passengers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_France_Flight_4590_db4d.html" title="Edit section: Investigation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Investigation</span></h2>
<p>The official investigation was conducted by the France’s accident investigation bureau, the BEA, and it was published on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_14.html" title="December 14">December 14</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. It concluded that the crash was caused by a <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titanium.html" title="Titanium">titanium</a> strip, part of a <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrust_reverser.html" title="Thrust reverser">thrust reverser</a>, that fell from a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Airlines_a2f8.html" title="Continental Airlines">Continental Airlines</a> <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10_b672.html" title="McDonnell Douglas DC-10">DC-10</a> that had taken off about four minutes earlier. This metal fragment <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_object_damage.html" title="Foreign object damage">punctured</a> Concorde's tyres, which then disintegrated. A piece of rubber hit the fuel tank and broke an electrical cable. The impact caused a shockwave that fractured the fuel tank some distance from the point of impact. This caused a major fuel leak from the tank, which then ignited. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning but were unable to retract the landing gear, hampering the aircraft's climb. With engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain height or speed, entering a rapid pitch-up then a violent descent, rolling left. The impact occurred with the stricken aircraft tail-low, crashing into the Hotelissimo Hotel in Gonesse. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> According to the report, the piece had not been approved by the US <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Aviation_Administration_0ef7.html" title="Federal Aviation Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_France_Flight_4590_db4d.html" title="Edit section: Conclusions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conclusions</span></h3>
<p>The investigators concluded that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aircraft was airworthy and the crew was qualified. The landing gear that later failed to retract did not show serious problems in the past. However, despite the crew being trained and certified, no plan existed for the simultaneous failure of two engines on the runway, as it was considered highly unlikely.</li>
<li>The aircraft was slightly overloaded, being about a tonne too heavy.</li>
<li>After reaching take-off speed, the tyre of No. 2 wheel was cut by a metal strip lying on the runway, which came from the thrust reverser cowl door of number 3 engine of a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Airlines_a2f8.html" title="Continental Airlines">Continental Airlines</a> DC-10 that had taken off from the runway several minutes before. This strip was installed in violation of the manufacturer's rules.</li>
<li>Aborting the take-off would have led to a high-speed runway excursion and collapse of the landing gear, crashing the plane anyway.</li>
<li>While two of the engines had problems and one of them was shut down, the damage to the plane's structure was so severe that the crash would have been inevitable, even with the engines operating normally.</li>

<p>The accident led to modifications being made to Concorde, including more secure electrical controls, <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevlar.html" title="Kevlar">Kevlar</a> lining to the fuel tanks, and specially developed, burst-resistant tyres. The new-style tyres would be another contribution to future aircraft development. However, just before services resumed, the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> took place, resulting in a marked drop in customer numbers and leading to the eventual end of Concorde flights. Air France stopped flights in May 2003, while British Airways ended its Concorde flights in October 2003.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">March 10</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> French authorities began a criminal investigation of Continental Airlines.<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2005-03-10-continental-concorde_x.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2005-03-10-continental-concorde_x.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
