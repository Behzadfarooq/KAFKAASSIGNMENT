<p>I'm wondering if anyone has put thought to the fact that Air Force One is often a show of the office of the president, especially during diplomatic missions or election campaigning? To have Air Force One (and entourage) land at your airport in Anytown, USA is impressive and guaranteed to make the local news. Additionally, to have Air Force One land at an airport in another country is a massive projection of power. I'm not sure how best to sum this up, but do think it's a valid point to raise in a few sentences in the article. I'd welcome any thoughts from other Wikipedians about this. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 01:04, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is only a <i>projection</i> of power. Such a power is granted by others to you, a dialog, as it were. If you agree it is power, then you have granted it. Air Force One cannot land in another country without the permission granted by others. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncheta_Wis_6134.html" title="User:Ancheta Wis">Ancheta Wis</a> 08:16, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I think, however, that to not mention the boost which accompanies the president arriving on AF1 is to deny the truth of the matter. It's a projection of REAL power, not just psychological influence. The trappings of the office can be a huge boost during campaigns, diplomatic missions, etc. In a similar manner to the Oval Office being the best home field advantage in the world, Air Force One is the best away-team advantage, if you will. My suggestion: "Presidential use of Air Force One in campaigns and diplomatic missions can be a powerful advantage; the projection of American executive power can be enough to sway public opinion or change the outcome of a given diplomatic mission." I'd be content to discuss changes to that, as I don't think it's necessarily NPOV or encyclopedic enough, but it's a place to start. As I said before, even if you deny the projection of power, the airtime on the nightly news it buys you to land Air Force One in Anytown, USA, is a factor that would be worth mentioning in some manner. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 23:42, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
what is the point of mentioning that Bush boarded the aircraft in Pakistan from lower deck but from India on the upper deck? I think the true reason was security since a few days earlier a bomber had killed a US diplomat in Karachi, I dont believe it to make any political points to Pakistan, which Bush has repeatedly called an ally in his "war on terror". I request that the paragraph be removed and I suspect it was inserted by an Indian or someone with pro-India bias. It does not make any sense that Bush would behave like that in Pakistan.</p>

<dd>There may be some disagreement about what "range" or "operational range" mean. Air Force One is capable of mid-air refueling and thus has a VERY large operational range, but of course has a smaller range on a single tank of gas, so to speak. Other factors are considered (food, supplies, etc), but I think we should speficy what KIND of range we're talking about. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 02:58, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<p>Not only does the VP get AF2, there's an established hierarchy all the wat down to AF7. The callsign AF2 may be used by the VP, a governor of a state in his own state, Chief Justice of the USSC, and several dozen other people. AF7 may be used by Captains USN or USCG; Colonels United States Air Force, USA, or USMC; or Comparable Rank Officers of Friendly Nations, Counselors in Charge of Consulates of Foreign Powers, or, finally, by GS/GM-15 (Civilians). The DOD "General Planning" Flight Information Publication (FLIP) details it all. Mykej 12:45, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That scenario may have military significance for flight or mission planning, but I only recall President, VP, and their families as candidates for those sorts of callsigns from my 30 years of ATC. This link to <a href="http://www.faa.gov/ATpubs/ATC/Chp2/atc0204.html#2-4-20" class="external text" title="http://www.faa.gov/ATpubs/ATC/Chp2/atc0204.html#2-4-20" rel="nofollow">FAAH 7110.65</a> confirms my memory. That document governs both the FAA <b>and</b> military ATC ops. Although I didn't work around Washington, whose controllers have lots of opportunities to work the presidential flights, I did work A1 once and A2 once. I even kept the strip for A1 for my <i>love me</i> wall. Incidentally, the Special Air Mission (SAM) callsign mentioned in the main article is used with the tail number of the aircraft when the President (etc.) is <b>not</b> on board. e.g. SAM 29000 (technically, the correct phraseology would be SAM two niner zero zero zero, however everyone I know would say SAM twenty nine thousand). A little known happening (although it's been aired on a documentary that probably everyone reading this has seen), was when Nixon flew back to California the day he resigned. He left ADW on A1 and somewhere over Kansas when Ford was sworn in (back in DC), the pilot advised ATC that they were changing the callsign of the flight to SAM 27000. <a href="../../../d/u/c/User%7EDuckecho_ef43.html" title="User:Duckecho">Duckecho</a> 22:06, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The plane listed isn't necessarily Air Force One. Remember, the plane and the callsign are two totally different things. When the President is not on the plane, it is NOT referred to as Air Force 1. The page has to be changed to reflect this. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolGuy_a681.html" title="User:CoolGuy">CoolGuy</a> 09:37, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Does anyone care that this article is totally wrong, since the 747s have nothing to do with the callsign "Air Force One." They are totally different. Perhaps this page should be renamed "U.S. Presidential Fleet" <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolGuy_a681.html" title="User:CoolGuy">CoolGuy</a> 22:17, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article's only wrong in that it assumes that the only Air Force planes POTUS ever flies on are those two 747. Which he almost always does, for various practical reasons. The fix is to simply mention that on the rare occasions he flies on another Air Force plane, that plane becomes "Air Force One". ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 06:28, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I distinctly recall Clinton flying to Martha's Vineyard for a break during his term. That airport won't handle a 747. They flew in a C9 (military DC9). Naturally it was Air Force One. Bush I may also have had that issue going to Kennebunkport (I don't know that for a fact). The one time I worked A2, I vectored it for final approach at DBQ (Dubuque, IA) and as I recall, it was one of the 707s (VC137, if you want to pick nits). <a href="../../../d/u/c/User%7EDuckecho_ef43.html" title="User:Duckecho">Duckecho</a> 21:44, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yea the airport at Martha's Vineyard is small. I flew a small passenger plane part way there <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudtz_4295.html" title="User:Dudtz">Dudtz</a> 9/6/05 9:29 PM EST</p>
<p>And, while we're picking this *particular* nit, the photo caption is wrong. I'd be *insanely* surprised if they flew the plane that close to Mount Rushmore (and yes, I'm a photog; I *do* understand foreshortening&#160;:-) with the pres on it... so it wasn't AF1 then, either. &#160;:-)</p>
<p>But this really *is* pedantry, and the general public considers 28000 and 29000 to *be* AF1 (y'know, kinda like Mary Kate and Ashley played one character on Full House?)... and since those two airframes are not really used operationally for any other service, that's probably not really unreasonable. --72.91.20.127 17:26, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Would it be worth mentioning that the ship <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_One_108d.html" title="Colonial One">Colonial One</a> of the reimagined <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar_Galactica_%282003%29_9620.html" title="Battlestar Galactica (2003)">Battlestar Galactica</a></i> series is heavily based on Air Force One? A number of charactistics are similar, including the color scheme, and the swearing in of Laura Roslin, which resembles the swearing in of LBJ. It's not quite Air Force One in fiction, but using Air Force One as for inspiration for Colonial One was talked about in the commentary of a few episodes. <a href="../../../a/s/c/User%7EAscendedDaniel_6dc7.html" title="User:AscendedDaniel">AscendedDaniel</a> 11:11, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Except that "Colonial One" was originally a heavy passenger transport that shuttled cabinet minister Roslin, other dignitaries and press out to the Galactica for decommissioning ceremonies, and was carrying them back when the war began. When Roslin learned she was the highest ranking survivor of the government, she became president, and at that point, the captain, on the radio, abruptly changed the designation from its original flight-craft number to "Colonial One". It is not too unlike the movie <i>Air Force One</i>, at the end of which the president (Harrison Ford) is hauled aboard a Hercules-type craft and it becomes Air Force One only because the president is aboard. Since this colonial heavy is one of few surviving FTL-equipped craft, it remains in service as Colonial One. <a href="../../../g/c/a/User%7EGcapp1959_07ea.html" title="User:Gcapp1959">GBC</a> 16:55, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Occasionally, to get a political point across, the President would enter/exit Air Force One via the self contained Air Stairs via the lower deck instead of the Main Deck.

Bush</a>, during his visit to Pakistan in March 2006, boarded and disembarked the 747 via the lower deck rather than the main door. This might have been a security precaution, but it also might mean that the White House wanted to bring across the "Flying Fortress" role of Air Force One to the politicians of the host country. Note that a day earlier, during Bush's stop over in India, he boarded via the Main Deck.</dd>

<dd>I don't know. But if I was going to doctor up a cool photo, I would have gotten a better angle or more of a frontal shot of Mt Rushmore to start with. The fact that Mt Rushmore is not at the most desirable angle for the photo tells me that either it really is a real photo, or the photo doctorer is really sly.</dd>

<p>In the top level summary paragraph, "Air Force One costs approximately 325 million dollars". Wouldn't it be more correct to state the original cost in past tense in it's original dollar value and also state the year that it was built. Then in the future (which I assume we're already in), a note can be added to show an adjusted cost in future (current) dollars adjusted for inflation. --<a href="../../../l/o/y/User%7ELoyt_8a59.html" title="User:Loyt">Loyt</a> 14:54, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As it [Air Force One] was attempting to take off from there [Champaign, Ill] this afternoon, a controller ordered the pilot to make a 270 degree turn. As he did, one of the plane's wheels left the taxiway and became stuck in the mud, Mr. Beeman said.</dd>
<dd>The plane, a military version of the Boeing 707 usually used by Cabinet members, was chosen for the President's trip because his usual plane was too big for the taxiways at Champaign. But the 707 apparently was not quite small enough.</dd>

<dd>The last paragraph of the "Location of past planes that served as Air Force One" sections contains a line about replacement by 2010.

I have read somewhere recen;ty (I don't recall where, but it may have been on Wiki) that the 777 is being promoted by Boeing as a replacement.

<dd>I agree with the idea of a split. "Air Force One" is a mission and a call sign. Doesn't matter what the type of aircraft, when POTUS is onboard, it's AF1. Thus, it seems natural to have an article under that name which describes the mission and its history, including all the aircraft that have served as AF1 over the years. As the VC-25 is a rather unique aircraft in and of itself, having an article on it is also appropriate, and that's the place for the aircraft-specific info like infoboxen and specs. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 00:28, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I picked this one in a hurry, partly because it was similar to the previous one, though different enough to warrant a try. I know there are much better/more dramatic pics out there, but whether they are useable here is the question. We have more than enough pics to rule out using a fair-use image.
