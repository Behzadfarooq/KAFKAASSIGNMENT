<dd>My only qualm with the renaming is that it changes how I was going to go about splitting the articles up. I was going to leave it at (video game), let it be a full article, and have something along the lines of an "Adaptations" section with main article links to the others.

But I guess it doesn't really matter too much as we're not really going to find much information to compliment them with. However, I'm pretty certain that Air also has an audio drama series. I haven't been able to find much on this, but I don't think that would need to be in the same section once the information is present.

<dd>You only actually notice it because of how short the title is. Japanese have a tendancy to print their gratuitous English in all caps (I'm guessing because they learn capital letters better than lowercase). Really, check any English named anime. 90% of them are all caps.

<dd>I think either is fine. I created Category:Air images because that is how many other articles have dealt with image categorization. They become a subcategory of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Category%7EAnimanga_images_4844.html" title="Category:Animanga images">Category:Animanga images</a> and so it depends if you want to expand that category as a global category for anime and manga images.

<dd>Cool Cat, sorry if I seemed a bit aggressive, but this is Air we're talking about here, there's only so much you can say. The idea is not to make stubs when they still fit on the main article, because stub articles can become "hidden" (even if not intended) to other editors, and then never grow past being stubs. We want to focus editing efforts, not split them. If we have lots to say about a character, then great, lets give them their own article. The movie gets tons more info, awesome, I'm all for it's own article. But I honestly think the best chance for these sections to grow is to not split them up so much.</dd>

This is unrelated, and I assure you it's nothing personal. I've been following the discussion on the talk page for a while, so don't think I'm just "butting in". I'm not trying to pressure anyone or say "if this article isn't big in 5 days, I'm gonna kill it!". It shouldn't matter if we're adding the information to a list of characters or to their own articles, as long as the information itself is there. If you want to keep them as stubs, no problem. If you feel strongly about making a separate movie article, then do it. Notice that I haven't done any deletion nominations or anything that is irreversible. I'm apart of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Digimon_Systems_Update_43f9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Digimon Systems Update">WikiProject Digimon</a>, and there are literally hundreds of stubs.

I see only one comment, from Cool Cat, about splitting those sections into their own articles.

<dd>All of the "hidden" character articles are linked multiple times already. They are under a category. If there is a potential (which there certainly is) for sections to easily grow into articles, I do not see why they shouldn't be stubs. Expansion does not go through deletion. A lot can be said about Kanna, Michiru, Misizu and others. Since we agree they have the potential, a merger is premature and inaproporate. I could expand the stubs to complete articles, but I am the kind who likes tweaking rater than writing complete articles. Besides User:SeizureDog has volunteered.</dd>

I will not stop in doing so, that is not how things are done in wikipedia. I'm sorry if I'm rocking your boat and making you feel uncomfortable. This is wikipedia, and you have no choice but to "tolerate" my interference.

<dd>Your logic is flawed. I have been dealing with anime related articles for quite some time now. 3 of the lists I have helped create as a major contributor had been gratnted featured status. To my knowlege they are the only anime related articles that had made it to be featured. With that I am neither braging nor clamining any seniority, however with that record of mine being accused of fancruft hardly is fair.</dd>
<dd>I am getting out of line? Sorry, let me list for you... You have:

<li>merged 3 templates, "series" "characters" "other" (which I created)</li>
<li>proposed the deletion of stubs (which I created)</li>
<li>Merged <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sora_%28Air%29_e196.html" title="Sora (Air)">Sora (Air)</a> and <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukito_Kunisaki_ef32.html" title="Yukito Kunisaki">Yukito Kunisaki</a> which was actualy pending discussion.</li>

<dd>The template merge is a no brainer, it takes up less space, allows navigation without having to click through more than one article, etc. I have not proposed anything for deletion, I only proposed a merge. No discussion was necessary for Sora and <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukito_Kunisaki_ef32.html" title="Yukito Kunisaki">Yukito Kunisaki</a>, they are the same character, mergers don't always require discussion, and you were the one who proposed the merge in the first place. I don't care who you are or what you've done, I think separate Air character articles encourages fancruft. I would have said this to anyone, and I say it not because I think they want to encourage fancruft, but because I fear it might and I wanted to bring it up. I also don't care how praised OMG's stuff is, Air is not OMG, and I'd rather go with standard formatting that can be found in other anime articles as well as what is recommended by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Anime_and_manga_89fb.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Anime and manga">WikiProject Anime and manga</a>.

Hello guys&#160;:-) Could you cool down a bit, this is getting a bit silly ^^; If you can't resolve the problem on your own, and want some outside opinion, here's mine - single templates with all remotely revelant links are more convenient to use than tons of small templates, and episode lists with pictures look a lot nicer than those without ^^; Oh, and be nice to each other <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETaw_8bc0.html" title="User:Taw">Taw</a> 22:40, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

WP's LOE episode templates are easy to use, with clearly marked parameters. The template also makes use of individual episode screenshots seen on most lists of episodes. (I know, the screenshots are in debate at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Lost_episodes_b415.html" title="Talk:List of Lost episodes">Talk:List of Lost episodes</a>, but DVD images are in the same boat in that discussion. LOE's template can easily remove the images with less formatting by using the same parameters for {{<a href="../../../j/a/p/Template%7EJapanese_episode_list_%28no_image%29_205b.html" title="Template:Japanese episode list (no image)">Japanese episode list (no image)</a>}} if the images do get rejected as fair use.)</dd>

<dd>On a related note, Cool Cat wants to make individual articles for each episode, a tender subject here on Wikipedia.

If episodes expand even more, then I see no problem in splitting, but these article creations are way to pre-mature. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 19:22, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, no, I would not mind at all. I think it is much healthier for article growth, keeping track of information, and so on to follow a path of: main article -&gt; split to list of characters when character section is too big -&gt; split characters as sections grow. However, I do understand that stubs are not always bad, and there are many times when it's obvious that a stub article will grow eventually. I don't think it's so obvious for Air, and I think people tend to fill things out for the sake of filling things out, often resulting in <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a>. But even then, this process in no way limits the information one can write about a character. It does not limit the potential for a character to get their own article. On the other hand, when you have a large group of stub articles then the reader has to hop to several articles to get a small amount of information, which doesn't help anyone. And lastly, if a character has their own article or not does not, by any means, make that a less or more important character. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 05:44, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with SeizureDog; there's no reason to have it in all caps. Considering a large amount of Japanese media titles, when written with English titles, are in caps is most likely because of the 52 characters we have in our Alphabet (upper and lower case), I think the upper case is tought first or otherwise it's much easier to recognize the upper case letters with Japanese-natives than are the lower case letters, or maybe it's just because ALL CAPS seems to stand out more. Whatever the reason, it has no bearing in Wikipedia, and I am against this topic, or subsequent topics, being written in all caps.--<font color="#FF66CC"><b>(</b><a href="../../../j/u/h/User%7EJuhachi_79a5.html" title="User:Juhachi"><b><font color="#0066CC">十八</font></b></a><font color="#FF66CC"><b>|</b></font><a href="../../../j/u/h/User_talk%7EJuhachi_fae6.html" title="User talk:Juhachi"><b><font color="#0066CC">talk</font></b></a><b>)</b></font> 00:13, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

But people call AIR "AIR" more than "Air".</i><a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESana_Jisushi_9b6f.html" title="User:Sana Jisushi">Sana Jisushi</a> 00:40, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's only because the longer a title a gets, the more unnatural it feels to put in all caps. <i>Air</i>, at 3 letters, is especially easy to call <i>AIR</i> due to many acronyms being the same length. I'll also point out that <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2480" class="external text" title="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2480" rel="nofollow">ANN</a> spells it <i>Air</i>.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 05:50, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>People say <a href="../../../s/h/u/SHUFFLE%21_b6de.html" title="SHUFFLE!">SHUFFLE!</a> too, and that's as long as Naruto or Bleach. (Sadly, that's been de-capitalized too...) <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESana_Jisushi_9b6f.html" title="User:Sana Jisushi">Sana Jisushi</a> 04:19, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've never seen someone type Shuffle! as SHUFFLE!.. I don't doubt that some people do... but why? It's normal for titles to be in all caps in a logo, but that doesn't mean that's how it's supposed to be written. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 05:36, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
