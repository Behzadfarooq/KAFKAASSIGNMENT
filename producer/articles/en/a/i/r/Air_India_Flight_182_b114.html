<p><b>Air India Flight 182</b> was a <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_747.html" title="Boeing 747">Boeing 747</a> that exploded on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_23.html" title="June 23">June 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> while at an altitude of 31,000 feet (9500 m) above the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ocean_570a.html" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, south of <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>; all 329 on board were killed, of whom 82 were children and 280 were <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> citizens.</p>

The caller also requested to be wait-listed on Air India 181 from Toronto to Montreal and AI 182 from Montreal to Delhi.</p>
<p>At 1910 GMT, a man paid for the two tickets with $3,005 in cash at a CP ticket office in Vancouver. The names on the reservations were changed; "Jaswand Singh" became "M. Singh" and "Mohinderbel Singh" became "L. Singh.".</p>

CP Agent Jeanne Bakermans initially refused his request to inter-line the baggage, since his seat from Toronto to Montreal and Montreal to Delhi was unconfirmed, but later relented <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/05/05/airindia050503" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/05/05/airindia050503" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>At 20:22 GMT, CP Air Flight 60 arrived in Toronto twelve minutes late. Some of the passengers and baggage, including the bag Mr. Singh checked in, were transferred to the Air India flight. Other passengers and baggage from <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Canada_a526.html" title="Air Canada">Air Canada</a> Flight 136, which also came from Vancouver, were handled as well.</p>

<p>At 07:15 GMT, Air India Flight 182, which had departed Mirabel bound for London, disappeared.

<p>A bomb located in the forward cargo hold had exploded while the plane was in mid-flight at 31,000 ft. The bomb caused rapid decompression, and consequent in-flight breakup. The wreckage settled in 2,000&#160;m deep water off the south-west <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> coast 180 miles (290 km) offshore of <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Cork_4166.html" title="County Cork">County Cork</a>.</p>
<p>The bomb killed all 22 flight crew and 307 passengers on board the aircraft, including 82 minors and numerous <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikhs</a>. Post-accident medical reports graphically illustrated the horror inflicted by this act on the passengers and crew. Of the 329 persons on board, only 131 bodies were recovered. 198 bodies were lost forever to the depths of the Atlantic Ocean. The bodies recovered included 30 children. Eight bodies exhibited "flail pattern" injuries, indicating that those 8 victims exited the aircraft in the air prior to it hitting the water. This, in turn, was a sign that the airplane had broken up in mid-air rather than crashing into the water intact. 26 bodies showed signs of hypoxia (lack of oxygen), including 12 children. 25 bodies, mostly of victims who were seated near windows, showed signs of <a href="../../../e/x/p/Explosive_decompression.html" title="Explosive decompression">explosive decompression</a>, including 7 children. 23 bodies had signs of "injuries from a vertical force". 21 passengers were found with little or no clothing.</p>
<p>One official quoted in the report stated, "All victims have been stated in the PM reports to have died of multiple injuries. However two of the dead, one infant and one child, are reported to have died of Asphyxia. There is no doubt about the asphyxial death of the infant. In the case of the other child (Body No. 93) there could be doubt because the findings could also be caused due to the child undergoing tumbling or spinning with the anchor point at the ankles. Three other victims undoubtedly died of drowning." <a href="http://www.ntsb.org/page11/page11.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ntsb.org/page11/page11.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>But for the one hour and forty minute delay in leaving Toronto, Air India 182 would have been at London's Heathrow airport at the time of the explosion; with an outcome similar to that of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_India_Flight_301_64b8.html" title="Air India Flight 301">the Narita bomb</a> which had exploded fifty five minutes earlier.</p>

<p>The main suspects in the bombing were the members of a <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikh</a> separatist group called the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babbar_Khalsa_bf3d.html" title="Babbar Khalsa">Babbar Khalsa</a>. The Babbar Khalsa was devoted to creating a Sikh state called <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalistan.html" title="Khalistan">Khalistan</a> in the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjab%2C_India_6b2e.html" title="Punjab, India">Punjab</a>.</p>

Surjan Singh Gill, Hardial Singh Johal, and Manmohan Singh.</p>
<p>Talwinder Singh Parmar was a <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigration_to_Canada_6fc5.html" title="Immigration to Canada">naturalized Canadian citizen</a> living in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> and was wanted for extradition to India for his role in activities in the Punjab including the murder of two Police officers. At this time, the Indian police and Khalistan supporters were engaged in a bloody war in which many innocent people were caught by excesses on both sides. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_5.html" title="March 5">March 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, three months before the bombing, the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service_0f67.html" title="Canadian Security Intelligence Service">Canadian Security Intelligence Service</a> (CSIS) had obtained permission to tape Parmar’s phone on the basis that he was the leader of the Babbar Khalsa. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/airindia/documents/tab1.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/airindia/documents/tab1.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Inderjit Singh Reyat was living in <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncan%2C_British_Columbia_18b0.html" title="Duncan, British Columbia">Duncan</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Island_06d5.html" title="Vancouver Island">Vancouver Island</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, and working as an auto mechanic and electrician.</p>

<p>Ripudaman Singh Malik is a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> businessman who helped fund a credit union and several Khalsa Schools.</p>
<p>Ajaib Singh Bagri was a mill worker living in <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamloops.html" title="Kamloops">Kamloops</a>, British Columbia. Part of the evidence in the trial was a tape of Bagri giving a speech to Sikhs at <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison_Square_Garden_6f37.html" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> on July 1984. Excerpts from the speech mentioned in the verdict include the need to murder Hindus and makes the request to murder the families of those in the Sikh community who would "betray us".</p>
<p>"They say Hindus are our brothers. Oh, I say denounce such Sikhism that calls Hindus our brothers. . . If any speaker from this stage ever mentions Hindus as our brothers he will be denounced as a traitor of the Sikh nation. . . They say Hindus are our brothers, many have said that, but I give you my most solemn assurance until we kill 50,000 Hindus, we will not rest!. . . Now I make a request: if anybody tries to betray us now, if anybody tries to get our nation annihilated, all of his family and children will be crushed in crushers and reduced to pulp."</p>
<p>Hardial Singh Johal and Manmohan Singh were both followers of Parmar and active in the Sikh temples where he preached. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_15.html" title="November 15">November 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> Hardial Singh Johal, died of natural causes at 55. He had allegedly stored the suitcases with bombs in the basement of a Vancouver school but was never charged in the case.</p>
<p>Daljit Sandhu is later named by a Crown witness as the man who picked up the tickets for the bombing. During the trial the Crown played a video from January, 1989, in which Daljit Sandhu congratulated the families of Indira Gandhi’s assassins and stated that “she deserved that and she invited that and that’s why she got it”. Mr. Sandhu was cleared by Judge Josephson in his <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_16.html" title="March 16">March 16</a> judgement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I began by describing the horrific nature of these cruel acts of terrorism, acts which cry out for justice. Justice is not achieved, however, if persons are convicted on anything less than the requisite standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Despite what appear to have been the best and most earnest of efforts by the police and the Crown, the evidence has fallen markedly short of that standard. <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/Jdb-txt/SC/05/03/2005BCSC0350.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/Jdb-txt/SC/05/03/2005BCSC0350.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>

Instead Mr. Reyat was charged with perjury on his testimony on the Air India Trial. He was denied parole and brought back to British Columbia to face the new charges. He has indicated he will plead not guilty.<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/cpress/20060107/ca_pr_on_na/air_india_reyat;_ylt=AqUl3SEPRLKlG5nWqsF9Wd1iyL4F;_ylu=X3oDMTA3OWI1ZGNqBHNlYwM3Mzc-" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/cpress/20060107/ca_pr_on_na/air_india_reyat;_ylt=AqUl3SEPRLKlG5nWqsF9Wd1iyL4F;_ylu=X3oDMTA3OWI1ZGNqBHNlYwM3Mzc-" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<p>Twenty years after the downing of Air India Flight 182, families gathered in <a href="../../../a/h/a/Ahakista.html" title="Ahakista">Ahakista</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> to grieve. Canadian Prime Minister <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Martin_629b.html" title="Paul Martin">Paul Martin</a> declared the anniversary a <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Day_of_Remembrance_for_Victims_of_Terrorism_5f6b.html" title="National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism">national day of mourning</a>. During the anniversary observances, he said that the bombing was a Canadian problem, not a foreign problem, saying: "Make no mistake: The flight may have been Air India's, it may have taken place off the coast of Ireland, but this is a Canadian tragedy." <a href="http://www.pco.gc.ca/default.asp?Language=E&amp;Page=archivemartin&amp;Sub=speechesdiscours&amp;Doc=speech_20050623_519_e.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pco.gc.ca/default.asp?Language=E&amp;Page=archivemartin&amp;Sub=speechesdiscours&amp;Doc=speech_20050623_519_e.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> He also ordered that every June 23, flags across Canada be flown at <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-staff.html" title="Half-staff">half-staff</a> to mark the anniversary of the Air India bombing. Many families say they are still searching for answers and justice, and demand a public inquiry.</p>
<p>Former <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a> premier <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Rae_f137.html" title="Bob Rae">Bob Rae</a> was selected to determine if a public inquiry is needed and was asked to determine whether or not the response by Canadian agencies was sufficiently co-ordinated, and if not, to find out if those problems had been fixed.</p>
<p>In a letter he submitted to the Attorney General of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/p/Ripudaman_Singh_Malik_a8ae.html" title="Ripudaman Singh Malik">Ripudaman Singh Malik</a> has demanded compensation from the Canadian government for wrongful prosecution in his arrest and trial. Malik owes the government $6.4 million and Bagri owes $9.7 million in legal fees.</p>
<p>In February Inderjit Singh Reyat was charged with perjury with regard to his testimony in the trial. The indictment was filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia and lists 27 instances where he allegedly misled the court during his testimony. Reyat had pleaded guilty to constructing the bomb but denied under oath that he knew anything about the conspiracy.</p>
<p>In the verdict Justice <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Josephson_1541.html" title="Ian Josephson">Ian Josephson</a> said: "I find him to be an unmitigated liar under oath. Even the most sympathetic of listeners could only conclude, as do I, that his evidence was patently and pathetically fabricated in an attempt to minimize his involvement in his crime to an extreme degree, while refusing to reveal relevant information he clearly possesses."</p>
<p>Reyat has a hearing with the National Parole Board on March 3rd. If found guilty of perjury he could sentenced with up to 14 years in prison.</p>

<p>September 25, 2006, saw the opening of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Commission_08f4.html" title="Royal Commission">Royal Commission</a> into the Air India bombing and subsequent investigation, beginning with testimony from a man who lost his wife in the bombing. The opposition Liberal Party of Canada, which has been opposed to any form of enquiry into the bombing [citation needed], has been putting pressure on the ruling Conservative Party to limit the extent of the enquiry. The Liberal Party is under strong pressure from Canada's fundamentalist and powerful Sikh community to pressure the ruling Conservatives to limit the Royal Commission. The Sikh community is concerned that the enquiry will put the Sikh community in a negative light and will curtail their political aspirations and will help to politically destabilize the community which generally still supports the creation of a separate Sikh state called Khalistan in India.</p>

<p>The Canadian government had been warned by the Indian government about the possibility of terrorist bombs aboard Air India flights in Canada. And over two weeks before the crash CSIS reported to the RCMP that the potential threat to Air India as well as Indian missions in Canada, was high <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/airindia/documents/tab3.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/airindia/documents/tab3.pdf" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>In his verdict Justice <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Josephson_1541.html" title="Ian Josephson">Ian Josephson</a> cited "unacceptable negligence" by CSIS when hundreds of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone_tapping.html" title="Telephone tapping">wiretaps</a> of the suspects were destroyed. Of the 210 wiretaps that were recorded during the months before and after the bombing, 156 were erased. These tapes continued to be erased even after the terrorists had become the primary suspects in the bombing.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service_0f67.html" title="Canadian Security Intelligence Service">CSIS</a> claims the wiretaps contained no relevant information but a memo from the <a href="../../../r/c/m/RCMP_2336.html" title="RCMP">RCMP</a> states that "There is a strong likelihood that had CSIS retained the tapes between March and August 1985, that a successful prosecution of at least some of principals in both bombings could have been undertaken." <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/airindia/parmar_p7.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/airindia/parmar_p7.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_4.html" title="June 4">June 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, CSIS agents <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Lowe_d818.html" title="Larry Lowe">Larry Lowe</a> and Lynn McAdams trailed Talwinder Singh Parmar and Inderjit Singh Reyat to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Island_06d5.html" title="Vancouver Island">Vancouver Island</a>. The agents reported to the RCMP that they had heard a noise like a "loud gunshot" in the woods. Later that month Flight 182 was bombed. After the bombing the RCMP went to the site and found remains of an electrical blasting cap. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/airindia/documents/tab3.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/airindia/documents/tab3.pdf" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>The suspects in the bombing were apparently aware that they were under surveillance, because they used pay phones and talked in code. Translator's notes of the wiretaps records this exchange between Talwinder Parmar and a follower named Hardial Singh Johal on the same day the tickets were purchased on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_20.html" title="June 20">June 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/airindia/documents/tab6.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/airindia/documents/tab6.pdf" rel="nofollow">[10]</a><br />
Parmar: Did he write the story?<br />
Johal: No he didn't.<br />
Parmar: Do that work first.</p>
<p>After this call a man called the CP Air and booked the tickets and left Johal's number. Shortly afterwards, Johal called Parmar and asked him if he "can come over and read the story he asked for". Parmar said he would be there shortly.</p>
<p>This conversation appears to be an order from Parmar to book the tickets used to bomb the planes. Because the original wiretaps were erased by CSIS they were inadmissible as evidence in court.</p>
