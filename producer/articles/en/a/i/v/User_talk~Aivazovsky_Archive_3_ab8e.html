<p>Well done. I like the choices very much; however, I propose we change the photos of Andranik, Bayrakdarian, Mashtots and Petrosian. I know of much better ones for all four. I'll show the photos to you later tonight so you can implement the changes. --<big><b><a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator"><font color="#00N510">Ευπάτωρ</font></a></b></big> <sup><small><a href="../../../e/u/p/User_talk%7EEupator_d1d3.html" title="User talk:Eupator"><font color="#974423">Talk!!</font></a></small></sup> 00:55, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here we go for Bayrakdarian, I suggest you use of these two:<a href="http://www.bayrakdarian.com/gallery/img/portraits/4.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bayrakdarian.com/gallery/img/portraits/4.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.bayrakdarian.com/gallery/img/portraits/2.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bayrakdarian.com/gallery/img/portraits/2.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. for Andranik either this <a href="http://netarmenie.com/photo/antranik.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://netarmenie.com/photo/antranik.jpg" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> or this <a href="http://www.electpress.com/books/andranik.gif" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.electpress.com/books/andranik.gif" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (I mainly object to the non-Armenian hat he's wearing on the current photo). I changed my mind about changing Petrosian's photo.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I couldn't find a better illustration of Mashtots, I think the current one really sucks though. Consider replacing Mashtots altogether with Vartan Mamikonian,...Another thing that bugs me is that we have so many artists and no scientists there, I wish Victor Hambartsumian was there...--<big><b><a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator"><font color="#00N510">Ευπάτωρ</font></a></b></big> <sup><small><a href="../../../e/u/p/User_talk%7EEupator_d1d3.html" title="User talk:Eupator"><font color="#974423">Talk!!</font></a></small></sup> 15:56, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

As for Mashtots, the current image really blows, so just try to find a better one (not the statue) or if not you can always replace him with Vartan or even St. Isaac. If there is no alternative for Andranik then replace him with Victor.--<big><b><a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator"><font color="#00N510">Ευπάτωρ</font></a></b></big> <sup><small><a href="../../../e/u/p/User_talk%7EEupator_d1d3.html" title="User talk:Eupator"><font color="#974423">Talk!!</font></a></small></sup> 21:19, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>So you don't want to replace Andranik with Hambartsumian? As for Isabelle's current photo, my edit patterns should help you figure that one out.--<big><b><a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator"><font color="#00N510">Ευπάτωρ</font></a></b></big> <sup><small><a href="../../../e/u/p/User_talk%7EEupator_d1d3.html" title="User talk:Eupator"><font color="#974423">Talk!!</font></a></small></sup> 23:59, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nope. Let's just say she looks better in the other ones. So there are 9 people now?

<p>I think I have a solution. We can use your version, but we can also quote from the HRW (or Weisbrode or Croissant). How does that sound? <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 06:33, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anyways, my point is that we should state what the sources say, and if we don't have any sources that say it was unprovoked, then we shouldn't say that. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 06:33, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not sure if you still need it but here's an excerpt:</p>
<p>"Armenia denied its troops had crossed into the Nakhichevan region. It acknowledged that Armenian forces had punched through a corridor linking Armenia and the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh and that convoys of supplies and wounded were now travelling along it.</p>
<p><i>"The Armenians do not react to diplomatic pressure. It's vital to speak to them in a language they understand," Rza Ibadov, Nakhichevan's foreign minister, told the ITAR-Tass news agency."</i></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"Mr. Ibadov, speaking to the agency from the Turkish capital Ankara, said Armenian fighters had pressed their offensive into Nakhichevan for the second consecutive day and controlled two strategic peaks. He said Armenia's aim in the region was to seize control of Nakhichevan.</p>
<p>Mr. Ibadov said fierce battles were raging around the town of Sadarak and residents had been moved out of villages near the scene. He appealed to Ankara to accommodate the overflow of injured residents in Turkish hospitals."</p>
<p>-"Azeri minister asks Turkey to send weapons Border region of Nakhichevan seeks help to counter Armenian threat".

<p>Hello Aivazovsky I was wondering if <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artsvashen.html" title="Artsvashen">Artsvashen</a> city should also be included in the template called Cities and Towns in Armenia the template that shows under every Armenian cities? I thought it should be included because it is officially Armenian city and part of Gegharkunik province of Armenia. I am having a hard time editing that template, can you please help me add <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artsvashen.html" title="Artsvashen">Artsvashen</a> or if you could do it that would be fine with me. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7EROOB323_48aa.html" title="User:ROOB323">ROOB323</a> 19:36, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi.

<dl>
<dd>In fact this category is placed in the category "Turkish people". It is clearly an anachronism, caused, perhaps, by geographic confusion. There is already the "Category:Byzantine saints" (which is also placed in that one), in which all of them can be placed, but a category "Saints from Asia Minor or Anatolia" would also be OK. Lets wait to see Khoikhoi's ideas on the matter. Regards <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 19:04, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You don't need to be an admin to rename a category. <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_rename_%28move%29_a_page_3490.html" title="Wikipedia:How to rename (move) a page">Wikipedia:How to rename (move) a page</a> states, "To change the name of a category, one needs to change all category tags, and copy the editable part." Therefore, you can simply create <a href="../../../s/a/i/Category%7ESaints_from_Anatolia_aeed.html" title="Category:Saints from Anatolia">Category:Saints from Anatolia</a>, and use it to replace <a href="../../../t/u/r/Category%7ETurkish_saints_1675.html" title="Category:Turkish saints">Category:Turkish saints</a>.

<dd>Hello Aivazovsky. I just noticed your message on my WP talk page. Being very busy in real life, I’m currently not active on Wikipedia. I’ll try to find out other Caucasus-related publications authored by Andrew Andersen. I still think that the best solution is to contact Andersen himself and request the sources he used for his description of the division of Qazakh. Best, <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 10:15, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! Since you are an experienced wikipedian and an English native speaker:</p>

<dd>I left this message earlier and you deleted it. Let me repeat, engaging in sterile reverting across many pages is unproductive. When you have disputes with others, you <i>must</i> use dispute resolution, and not engage in edit warring.

<p>Well, I simply won't let him remove the maps unless he has specific reasons on why he wants to remove them. Just saying they're "unreliable" isn't good enough.

<p>I don't know whatever I did it for the Armenian editors or rather against AdilBaguirov, probably the later. I tried helping Grandmaster out also, he does not want to listen to me. Adil has a very bad influence on him. Take the situation as if you are on a court. Someone is accused of a crime and the evidences are just too strong, and then another person is accused of complicity. How do you think the judge will take it, if that person accused of complicity start justifying the acts, make it as there was nothing wrong and even defending the person mainly accused. The evidence used against the main accused will harm the person who refuse to dissociate himself from that person and once one is sentenced he will bring down with him that person who justified his acts. Refusing to accept you did something wrong will get you a much harsher sentence. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 16:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am glad that there is an attempt for resolution on Qazakh, and I wish all of this was addressed on talk page. But there are some issues to be resolved, and I am waiting for Khoikhoi's response on that. Namely, I agree to Azerbaijani exclaves of Barkhudarli and Yuxari Askipara being mentioned as military controlled, instead of occupied, but specific reference should be made that the State Department, UN SC resolutions, PACE and CoE reports do spell the word "occupied".</p>
<p>Regarding Andersen, I cannot agree, I am sorry. If his credibility is not legible for this article, I don't see why he would qualify for having his invented maps decorate other pages. So, specifically his map will have to go away from <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan_Democratic_Republic_5183.html" title="Azerbaijan Democratic Republic">Azerbaijan Democratic Republic</a> page as being simply fake and unsubstantiated. Instead, I propose using the map of ADR presented to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. I guess the Armenian side can do the same for the DRA page. These are conflicting maps, but at least the posting of each sides official maps reflects their respective views at that time, and will let the reader take an impartial view. Since neither ADR nor DRA were de-jure recognized within certain borders, that could be a good compromise. And I leave it up to Georgian side to accept or reject this, they can continue showing Andersen's map if they want to. I do have body of material at hand to substantiate that Georgia claimed the Lori district from Armenia and that, the Georgian takeover of Borchaly, Azerbaijan initially complained to Georgia then simply gave in (per Hajinski) for the sake of alliance. There is no evidence about Zaqtala district.<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 14:45, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let's leave emotions aside and concentrate on resolution. Yes, Paris Peace conference map presents the claims of ADR, but so does the Paris Peace conference map of Armenia present the claims of DRA. So if you accuse Azerbaijani side of allegedly "attempting to take over Caucasus", same can apply to Armenia vice versa. Since neither side was recognized, and since Andersen's map is simply untrue and unsubstantiated, the best compromise might be just presenting both maps and saying this was ADR view and this was DRA view, and neither side's position was recognized since final borders were not demarcated. I think that's a fair approach. Mikkalai's opinion is quite relevant to revealing the fact that Andersen does not qualify as a scholar. His position vs Ldingley is none of concern on Qazakh topic. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 14:53, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Georgian users are welcome to claim what they like as well. But the evidence should be substantiated by scholars and NPOV sources. An adventurist Canadian blogger, allegedly fired from University for racism against Muslims, and not having a single publication in any reputable or non-reputable journal or conference, simply is not acceptable for encyclopedic material. In addition, he is also not acceptable for his proven racist (thus biased) stance to Azerbaijani side. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 14:58, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, Mikkalai's view of Ldingley is irrelevant, given the fact that references Mikkalai presented are verifiable.</dd>
<dd>You should never say "I will never agree", that does not really show your interest in having compromise. As I said, instead of having biased and fake map taking one of the sides against the other or coloring territories randomly, we should have just everyone present their view of the story on their respective page: DRA MFA map on DRA page and ADR MFA map on ADR page. I have access to both maps, if you can find them. My objective is not to show part of Armenia was Azerbaijan or vice versa and start arguments over it, when neither side was recognized de jure anyway. My objective is to rid Wikipedia of unqualified and adventurist blogger's reference, which has no encylopedic or scholarly basis whatsoever, plus taking sides. And if you think Andersen map is fair you should not, it misrepresents and simply lies about many claims of control on Georgian-Armenian issue as well, and not to Armenian favor. But the bulk of Andersen's fake map scribbles is directed against Azerbaijan.<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 15:07, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for revealing your uncompromising position on that one. I don't think we should go back and forth on this, "I agree" - "I disagree". As I said, Andersen was disqualified as scholar, so he should be out not just of Qazakh references, but from any page which uses him as reference per view of editors. I guess, I will wait for Khoikhoi and request separate arbitration on Andersen issue specifically. Mikkalai's evidence as well as those presented by myself and AdilBaguirov should serve as a good basis for ridding Wikipedia of Andersen's adventurist and proven racist POV. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 15:15, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see a point for your argument, as DRA map for Paris Peace Conference also reflects the extensive designs of Armenia upon Azerbaijan similarly. Or maybe you're concerned about Wilsonian map being revealed which recognized whole of Elisavetpol governorate as part of Azerbaijan. We can show that one as well. Those are legitimate maps made at the time and presented at conferences and official meetings. Andersen's invention is made 100 years later and not based on historical research. Khoikhoi is already on the case and you're welcome to invite Kober, I don't see why he would disagree posting the official maps of DRG, especially because Georgia unlike Armenia and Azerbaijan was recognized de-jure in 1921. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 15:22, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You deleted this article without discussion again.

<p>ok, I agree on redirect on condition that you will finally stop Artaxiad from multiplying conflict related pages. Otherwise it does not make sense - we can reach agreement, as once we did with you, but he continue his activity. At least for Khachkar problem we should also delete section on page Nakhchevan <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhichevan#Status_of_Armenian_cultural_monuments" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhichevan#Status_of_Armenian_cultural_monuments" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> or put redirect. Also Artaxiad put that dispute on page "Cultural genocide", as usually supported by Fadix. Otherwise, without these two users we can't reach agreement. At least, I am not bound to that.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 21:38, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hope that the arbitrators will read my comments and take them into consideration. While I agree with the ArbCom on most of their decisions, I feel that there are some parts of their decision should be revisited.</p>
<p>First of all, I believe that a one year block for <a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">User:AdilBaguirov</a> won't solve anything because he'll just return after the block has expired and cause more trouble. I think that the best solution for to this issue would be to indefinitely block Adil from Wikipedia. Secondly, I feel that <a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">User:Eupator</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">User:Fedayee</a> should be granted reduced sentences from one year blocks to revert paroles. In all fairness, Fedayee had very little involvement in Armenian-Azeri issues until this whole dispute sprung up and Eupator made some very positive contributions to Wikipedia (especially on WikiProject Armenia and Portal:Armenia) that should not be overlooked. Both of these users have done more good to Wikipedia than bad. I actually think that <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">User:TigranTheGreat</a> (who has made offensive comments towards users on a few occasions) deserves a one year block more than either of these users. I'm not sure where I stand on the verdict of <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix">User:Fadix</a> as I haven't paid too much attention to his edits.</p>
<p>I agree on the rest of the decisions. My own revert parole will keep me disciplined while editing Wikipedia. All the best, <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 12:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
