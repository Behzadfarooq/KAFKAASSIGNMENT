<dd>For very very different and complex reasons least of which have to do with Turkey or Turks and absolutely not because some recognize it and some don't.

<p>Hi Cleve. I’ve got a question. How do you know that Ordubad is known as Ordubada? The word consists of Turkic Ordu (army) and Persian bad (town), i.e. army town. That additional letter doesn’t add any meaning to it. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 11:26, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was part of Ayrarat, Vaspurakan and Syunik. Most of it in Ayrarat. I mean just look at a map of Greater Armenia and compare it to modern Nakhichevan. Use any primary source that describes the provinces of Greater Armenia, be it Strabo, Ptolemy or Anania.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 14:11, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Cleve, sorry for late reply. I think Mr Andersen’s bio and works speak of his credibility and I don’t know how else to prove this. To be honest, however, I detected some minor inaccuracies in the Georgia section of his website. Unfortunately, I don’t know much about Nakhichevan’s modern history and cannot consider GM’s doubts to be completely illegitimate. How about we consider using extra references?

<p>Hey I saw you reverted some stuff on the article, I was just adding some more stuff while u reverted, so there was an edit-conflict. Let's have a look at the new version and tell me what u think. I posted some stuff in the talk page.. I hope that we can improve the page together. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 13:02, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes I read that article a while ago but many of us Armenians have been quarreling over an anthem change for several years now. I myself would prefer Khachaturyan's SSR anthem with only the references to Lenin and socialism removed.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 03:14, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is actually another contender other Armenians want called Առաչ Նահատակ (Arrach Nahatak), which is essentially a war song that calls for Armenians to die fighting for their country. It has an interesting message but in terms of rhythm and tune, I don't like it. Keep in mind Mer Hayrenik was written several decades before the founding of the Dashnaktsakan Party and was adopted by the Armenian government in 1918 for practical reasons rather than partisan politics. In any case, I think Armenia has more important things to worry about than an anthem.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 20:19, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I seem to be the only one doing any discussing. In the meantime, either the lengthy and accurate text containing what Josephus actually wrote, or no text at all, is acceptable. Josephus did not use any Armenian word; that he meant Nakichevan or Nauxana is conjecture; that it derives from Noah is nonsense. <a href="../../../j/c/s/User%7EJCScaliger_7ada.html" title="User:JCScaliger">JCScaliger</a> 19:37, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wouldn't be too bothered by their comments. Naturally they'll posture for the crowds but Azerbaijan, contrary to what you might think, doesn't have the willpower to take the region. It can spend billions of dollars on all the weaponry it wants but in the end the situation will be similar to that of 1993-1994 where Armenians are fighting for survival and and self-preservation while the Azerbaijan army is fighting for more practical things, money, territory, etc. In early 1994, while nearly every male in Karabakh was wearing a camoflague or military uniform, Azeri youths at draft-age were sipping tea in downtown Baku, oblivious and quite carefree of what occuring in some war that they had obviously disconnected themselves with.</p>
<p>Anyways, didn't you watch the great military parade in the hraparak on Wedsnday? No tanks, but nevertheless very daunting&#160;:)--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 03:04, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Depends on what theory you believe in, the <i>Yekvort</i> or <i>Bneek</i>, native or trans-European. If its the latter, "Armenia" itself was a collection of several tribes and scattered alongst the opening of the south Caucasus, placing it, at the closest, to Ararat. The Noah's ark theory depends more or less on faith rather than what you would find in the history book. Plausible, yes, but not quite scientific. Anyways, the Hayasa, Hittites and others thus formed a federation and become <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urartu.html" title="Urartu">Urartu</a> which according to the newest discoveries in archaeology, is where the Armenian people originated from. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 03:03, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure why you are removing information having to do with Azerbaijan and Azeris from articles. I recall having a little discussion on <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kars.html" title="Kars">Kars</a> with you, after which you decided it was fair to add the Azeri version of the city's name. Now you're removing the same sort of info for <a href="../../../i/g/d/Igdir.html" title="Igdir">Igdir</a> despite the fact that the town has a large Azeri community. Same goes with the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_Albania_1fac.html" title="Caucasian Albania">Caucasian Albania</a> article. If this is merely lack of information/knowledge, then I would recommend doing some research on the given topics before editing them. But if this has something to do with your opposition to "aggressive separatism in Abkhazia and South Ossetia" and "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", yet at the same time support of "the independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic", i.e. your ideological likes and dislikes, then there is a lot to talk about. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 03:09, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't realize that Iğdır had a significant Azeri population. I apologize for that. I am not "removing information having to do with Azerbaijan and Azeris from articles." As a matter of fact, I have worked constructively with many Azeri editors on Wikipedia and I have even helped develop the page on the Republic of Azerbaijan. I still find Baku87's map of Caucasian Albania questionable, however, and will continue to challenge it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now then, I'm not sure why, instead of being diplomatic towards me in your message, that you would present yourself as openly hostile with criticism for my political views. I mean you no harm in my edits and contributions and I apologize if I came off that way. If you must know, I am neither completely pro-seperatist or non-seperatist. I support Georgian unity (thus I am opposed to the sepratism of Abkhazia and South Ossetia which have historically been part of the Georgian nation) and I believe the best solution for Georgia in the long term is the establishment of a federal republic. I believe that the TRNC should work constructively to unify itself with the Republic of Cyprus instead of trying to seperate. I hold the view that both Greek and Turkish Cupriots should get along and that there should only be one Cyprus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I support Nagorno-Karabakh's sepratism from Azerbaijan because I believe that at certain times in history, the region was part of Armenia and that Baku has proven itself unworthy of regaining it (with its constant threats against Armenia and its encouragement for public hostility towards Armenians). Overall, I hope that Armenians and Azerbaijanis can work together in peace and that Azerbaijan's claim over Karabakh is the only stumbling block between the two nations. I am sure that you have an opposing view and I really don't want to argue over this matter, so I won't go any further. This is just my opinion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I'm sorry if I came off as being brash. I hope that we can work together constructively on Wikipedia. Kindest regards, <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 10:26, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologize if I got the wrong impression. And I'm sorry if my message sounded a bit harsh. I do appreciate your help and valuable contributions, despite this little misunderstanding. Just to make sure, Azeri names are only added for places that historically have had more or less significant Azeri population. I would definately not object if an Azeri name for Lisbon or Rio de Janeiro was taken off the main article. I hope we're on the same page here. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParishan_572c.html" title="User:Parishan">Parishan</a> 06:07, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Clevelander. How are you? As far as I know Suny’s family comes from Kars. I’ve read somewhere that his grandfather migrated to Tiflis during the Genocide and left for the US after the Bolshevik takeover of Georgia in 1921. I don’t really know anything about his political views. Maybe someone should write an article about him.

<dd>just to add a tidbit on him, Suny was a Sovietologist and learned to speak Russian and Georgian before he ever got in touch with his Armenian roots. Armenians for the most part dislike him due to his unopopular views on how to solve the Karabakh problem. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 19:59, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. In my opinion, the article <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Nagorno-Karabakh_f14f.html" title="History of Nagorno-Karabakh">History of Nagorno-Karabakh</a> sucks big time, both in terms of accuracy and English grammar. It is based on unreliable sources and violates NPOV policy. We have an experience of resolving such problems in Nakhichevan article, I suggest we do a major rework of History of NK whenever you have time. We may ask some third party editors for help as well, as it is a controversial issue.

<p>One of my problems with the text is that it tries to prove that ancient Artsakh was exclusively Armenian and ignores the sources, such as Columbia:</p>
<p><i>A part of Caucasian Albania called Artsakh, the area was taken by Armenia in the 1st cent. A.D. and by the Arabs in the 7th cent.</i> <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/na/NagornoK.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/65/na/NagornoK.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Or Iranica:</p>
<p><i>Albania (Iranian Aran, Ar. Aluank), an ancient country in the Caucasus. It was bounded on the north by Ceraunian mountains, an extension of the Caucasus, on the east by the Caspian sea, and on the south by the lower course of the Araxes (Aras); on the west its borders were unstable: The frontier along the Kura (Kor), affirmed by Strabo (Geography 11.14.5) was repeatedly overrun, to the advantage sometimes of Albanians, sometimes of Armenians.</i> <a href="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f8/v1f8a022.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f8/v1f8a022.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>The article should be consistent with the articles <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artsakh.html" title="Artsakh">Artsakh</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_Albania_1fac.html" title="Caucasian Albania">Caucasian Albania</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 11:51, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure. Any contribution is welcome, I actually would like to ask some third-party editors to join as well, since the issue is controversial.

The real pathetica part of their avowals is that they are short-term, six months at most. When France recognized the Genocide, they cancelled military contracts and vowed to never buy anything French again, only to see them purchasing L'oreal just several months later.

<p>Hey Clevelander. Unfortunately, I'm not really comforttable with moving a page to a title that there wasn't any clear consensus for in the first place. You seem to have a good argument for the "March Days" title, and if you went to <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, I would support you. However, I've deleted the edit history of the redirect...so if you want to move the page, go right ahead.

<dd>Thank you for your response (on <a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">User:Eupator</a>'s talk page). I appreciate the fact that sources have now been provided supporting your side of the dispute. As Armenia is a member of the Council of Europe, this indicates that politically they may be considered a part of Europe. It now appears to me that the weight of evidence is roughly equal on both sides. The trouble with the whole Wikipedia process is that, in almost all disputes, it is possible to locate sources to support both sides of the argument, which sends us 'back to square one' as far as the whole dispute-resolution process is concerned. The only solution I can see is to edit all the disputed articles to add something along the lines of: <i>Some authorities consider Armenia an Asian country, due to its geographical position and the historical relationship of Armenians to Asian peoples. However, Armenia is part of the Council of Europe, and is now considered part of Europe for some purposes. Armenians themselves disagree about whether their country is Asian or European.</i> Do you agree with this as an acceptable form of phrasing? <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 10:54, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Clevelander,</p>
<p>I think that we need to tweak the colors on Armenian flag a little bit. I believe that <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/flags/am-flag.html" class="external text" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/flags/am-flag.html" rel="nofollow">CIA's colors</a> and <a href="http://www.fifa.com/en/organisation/confederations/associationdetails/0,1483,ARM,00.html?countrycode=ARM" class="external text" title="http://www.fifa.com/en/organisation/confederations/associationdetails/0,1483,ARM,00.html?countrycode=ARM" rel="nofollow">FIFA's colors</a> look closer to the real one than the one at <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Flag_of_Armenia.svg" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Flag_of_Armenia.svg">Wikimedia Commons</a>. Also, take a look at <a href="http://www.fotw.net/flags/am.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fotw.net/flags/am.html" rel="nofollow">Flags of the World page</a>, even though they have a flag similar to the one at Commons, the color specifications on that page are closer to the CIA's colors and FIFA's colors.</p>
<p>Granted, the one at Commons look a lot nicer, but not real.--<a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzycheetah_e38b.html" title="User:Crzycheetah">Crzycheetah</a> 02:11, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S.<br />
Why am I saying this to you? Because you changed the colors on <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Armenia_flag_construction_sheet.png" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Armenia_flag_construction_sheet.png">the image I uploaded</a>.</p>
<p>One more thing, the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Armenia_coa.png" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Armenia_coa.png">coat of arms</a> colors, I believe, are wrong too. Take a look at the <a href="http://www.gov.am/enversion/armenia/emblem.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gov.am/enversion/armenia/emblem.htm" rel="nofollow">Armenian Gov't page</a>, the blue and red colors are switched. --<a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzycheetah_e38b.html" title="User:Crzycheetah">Crzycheetah</a> 04:45, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now, that I think more about it, it is a very serious change; therefore, I propose that we take a poll at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Armenia_971d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Armenia">WikiProject Armenia</a> to see what everybody else thinks about flag and coat of arms.

<p>Hi there. Thanks for implementing my changes to the SSR infobox and for working on the former country infobox in other entries. In case you are interested, I have just completed a more comprehensive set of instructions for using the Former Country infobox <i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Former_Country_Instructions_4f40.html" title="Template:Infobox Former Country/Instructions">here</a></i>.

<p>I don't know if you ever took notice but is it just me but are the templates used on the SSR articles ugly? I know how red is used for communism and all but is it possible to get rid of the color (and the type of font used) and instead opt out on the ones used on the ones used on the American states articles? Goes double for the bottom template of the Soviet republics, the color, the shape, the eyesore red color....its just awkward and looks wrong.

<p>Parev Clevelander, very nice work on the Armenian Diaspora map. But I believe there is a problem with Argentina, there are way more Armenians there than 5 000 to 15 000. They are quite a vibrant community with certain estimates putting them over 100 000. They also have a big influence there and recently the Argentine parliament recognized the Genocide as a day of mourning. I'm not sure if I can find an exact number but this site <a href="http://www.armeniadiaspora.com/followup/population.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.armeniadiaspora.com/followup/population.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> states about 130 000. This is the Argentino-Armenians site <a href="http://www.ian.cc/inicio.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ian.cc/inicio.php" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> sadly, I can't really tell if there is an English version of it lol.

<dd>Clevlander, regarding this template the template of Armenian diaspora, I think Turkey should be removed from the list because they are not actually diasporans. I mean, the land that is called Turkey today is the homeland of those Armenians still their - you can't be considered to be leaving in the diaspora when you are living in your own homeland, dont you agree?</dd>

<p>Hi Clevelander. Please use the talk page and cite your sources before reverting the article. Otherwise I see no end to the dispute. Regards, <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 11:49, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>“Liberation” and “occupation” are POV, “control” is neutral. It’s been discussed before, and no matter how referenced it is, you cannot say that Russians liberated the city from Persia, for whom it belonged for centuries. Iran definitely does not consider it to be liberation, and correct word would be conquered, but neutral word would be “took under control”. The article in Iranica says “Erevan fell to the Russians”, why not using that reference? This should not be an issue. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 12:44, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was foreign occupation anyway, Russia was a foreign country that seized the region from Persia.

<p>I am sorry, but I had to revert your edits in the fr rel tr article. Please remember that it is the fr rel tr, not history of turkey article. Please keep that in mind. It doesn't make sense to change "Russia and Caucasus" to "post-soviet caucasus". I am sorry to say this, but turkey's relations with russia are more important to turkey than Turkey's relations with Armenia or georgia. The section title will be about Russia and Caucasus, and it will be mainly about Russia when that section will be worked on. Please put things in context. That article needs work, and most of the historical stuff will be taken out sooner or later. Half the article is a stub in any case. There is also no reason to create a "Pakistan" subsection. It is not like Pakistani-Turkey relations form the main axis of power of Asia&#160;:) The AG issue is talked about in the "Debates and frictions" section in the article, there is no need to duplicate information. I have the feeling that you jumped into the article without reading it fully. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 23:49, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

There is already a debates and frictions section. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 00:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is mentioned in "debates and frictions". That version was agreed upon after long discussions and debate way back when. Another reason I am reverting is the fact that it could lead to an edit war. It is mentioned, there is a see also for AG right under the subsection, and the situation is talked about in the debates and frictions section. That's all I am saying, it is not like it is not mentioned at all&#160;:) Even the selection of the AG seealso for the Caucasus subsection was talked about. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 00:14, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Be careful man. There is no such thing as <i>if past midnight you're entitled to 3 more rv's</i>! It applies for any 3 rv's within a 24h period (regardless dates).

<p>Its only been going a day, and while I may think that is a reasonable solution, we should leave it a few days at least. If there is no useful discussion by say Saturday, let me know again.

<p>Don't take him too seriously, he has anger issues. One should tell him that Hungarians are Magyars who are Finno-Ugric and have nothing to do with Huns. Btw, Magyars themselves were very few in numbers hen they inavded Europe, their language remained but most Hungarians are descendants of people who lived there since the Ice Age.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 21:35, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can only be proud of your Hungarian ancestry.

Hell I would consider you Armenian even if you were 99% Hungarian. I especially like the fact that you're learning Armenian, I know some so called pure Armenians who dodn't knwo half the Armenian you know.</dd>
<dd>You added more than that, he wasn't talking about that obviously. Tigran was being a prick but i'm going to have to agree with Fadix on this one.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 00:33, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Dear Cleve, I always admired you for your true Armenian identity and wisdom. You have been very helpful for your countrymen which does not limit to only Armenians but to Georgians and Azeri. You are a very special person and I want to wish you most happy Christmas and New Year. Wishing you and your family all of success, happiness and love. Marry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

<p>Wow, what a mess. Thanks for that. Sorry I couldn't reply earlier, I was somewhat busy in real life.
