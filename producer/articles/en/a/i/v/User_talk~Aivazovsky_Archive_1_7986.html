<p>Hi Clevelander, Thanks for being honest about the name-changing bit. I'm just a bit paranoid lately about making sure everything's perfect for the featured article review, so don't mind me.&#160;:) One thing, though -- make sure you log in when you edit a page; this does two things: (1) it gives you personally credit for the editing you've done, and (2) the chances of me calling you out on a talk page are much less.&#160;:) Thanks again for all your work; it's much appreciated. Take care -- <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacknCanes_334e.html" title="User:PacknCanes"><font color="#CC0000">Pack</font><font color="black">n</font><font color="#B80103">Canes</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/c/User_talk%7EPacknCanes_f583.html" title="User talk:PacknCanes"><small><i><font color="gray">say something!</font></i></small></a> 23:22, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I had a peek at some of the photos you've uploaded. They all seem to be scanned images from <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_FAQ_fe96.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright FAQ">copyrighted</a> materials, yet you've tagged them as being in the public domain. What's the story? - <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurekaLott_6975.html" title="User:EurekaLott">EurekaLott</a> 00:49, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Which ones are you referring to specifically? The ones from the League of Women Voters' "Seven Making History" book are PD, that I'm almost certain. - <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 01:13, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While I'm not familiar with that book, it looks like it covers recent history and is copyright 1990. I don't know why it would be in the public domain. For starters, it looks like all the images in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Cleveland%2C_Ohio_8758.html" title="History of Cleveland, Ohio">History of Cleveland, Ohio</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terminal_Tower_dcbe.html" title="Terminal Tower">Terminal Tower</a> articles are problematic. You know what you've uploaded better than I do. - <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurekaLott_6975.html" title="User:EurekaLott">EurekaLott</a> 01:36, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, sorry. I'll change them. I'm new and I apologize if I'm causing any problems. - <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a>
<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid that changing the tags to <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Images" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> isn't going to cut it. If the images are copyrighted and are being used without permission, they need to be deleted, not reclassified. - <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurekaLott_6975.html" title="User:EurekaLott">EurekaLott</a> 02:26, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I've gone back and started looking over all of my sources for my uploaded images, instead of just blindly changing tags. So far, most of them are okay to include on Wikipedia (and would be classified as PD). These have been taken from library collections and from defunct newspapers (such as <i>The Cleveland Press</i>). However, I still need to research a few of the mayoral portrait photographs (on such figures as Johnson, Farley, Hopkins, Baehr, and Baker). I'll let you know about these in a few days. - Best Regards, Clevelander</dd>

<p>Thanks for the information, but alas, "available to the general public" and "The Cleveland State University Library allows reproductions of materials from Special Collections for the purposes of research, scholarship, teaching, news reporting, criticism, or comment" do <i>not</i> mean that these materials were in the public domain. CSU explicitly states that it "makes no representation of copyright ownership for the non-digital materials in Special Collections. For example, copyright ownership of Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), Acme, or United Press International (UPI) photographs may still remain with those organizations. Organizations and individuals seeking to use materials for publication <b>must obtain permission directly from the appropriate copyright holder.</b>" (emphasis mine). In fact, at <a href="http://web.ulib.csuohio.edu/SpecColl/policies.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.ulib.csuohio.edu/SpecColl/policies.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, the CSU even writes that "you are responsible for how you intend to use these materials. We assume you are using them for purposes covered under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">Fair Use</a> regulations." (link added). I don't know about the WRHS (their web site gives me an internal server error), but they certainly won't claim copyright on most of their holdings, either. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 07:48, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Asking CSU for permission is probably futile, because they won't be in a position to grant you whatever permission on items to which they don't hold the copyright. But you're welcome to try. However, please note that they must grant permission to license the works under a free license (GFDL, some <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_License_4fc5.html" title="Creative Commons License">Creative Commons Licenses</a>, public domain, etc.). Saying "yes, you may use them on Wikipedia" is not good enough; that'd be a "by permission only" license, and those are no longer tolerated as per <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html" rel="nofollow">Jimbo's decree</a>. A free license must allow anyone to use the work for any purpose, subject only to proper attribution. That includes commercial uses, republishing, redistributing derivative works etc. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 12:05, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So they wrote: "Yes, our low-resolution images on the Cleveland Memory Project are available for use <b>in educational projects like this</b>, with a proper photo credit <b>and link back to CMP</b>. We request that the original photographer's name (if given) and the collection name be included in the credit." I've highlighted the problems. A free license must also allow the use in non-educational projects, and not require a backlink. We on Wikipedia would probably even voluntarily put such a backlink on the image description page to give the source of the image, but we cannot require all our downstream users to do so, too. And "educational use only" is not free, either.</dd>

CMP claims copyright. On what grounds they do so is unclear; they seem to have acquired these images from a donation; that process typically does not involve a transfer of copyrights, and it would be unclear anyway whether the donor held the copyright (normally, the photographer is the copyright holder). The image was taken on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_29.html" title="August 29">August 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a> by one Robert E. Hawkins. <i>Our</i> version apparently was scanned from the book by Thea Gallo Becker. Where did she get the image from? When and where was the image first published, if at all? If it was, was the copyright renewed? (If published before 1964 and copyright was not renewed, or if published before 1989 without copyright notice, it'd actually be in the public domain). If it wasn't, when did Mr. Hawkins die, and when was the image eventually published? (If unpublished and if Mr. Hawkins died before 1935 and if the eventual publication did not occur between 1978 and 2002, it'd also be in the public domain.) All this might be very hard to research. Probably you're better off by just making a fair use claim: historic photograph, only small part of a whole series, mediocre scan of a quality sufficient for web publication, but unfit for serious print republication. Also give the photographer's name and the date on the image description page; and you also might want to include the link to the image description at the CMP.</dd>

<dd>I'm really sorry that this licensing business is such a hassle; I think these images are great, and we should use them, if we can.

<ul>
<li>is the default license of Wikipedia,</li>

<li>and to do so with derived works from that image (different crop or edited otherwise), again, with crediting all authors and distributing the GFDL text;</li>
<li>and that in my experience, the requirement to distribute the text of the GFDL with any redistributed image in practice is enough to prevent or at least discourage most serious commercial exploitations of the image.</li>

</dd>
<dd>Many, especially academic types, are quite happy to go along with this, and if they do, we're in the clear and just tag the image as {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}}, mention the explicit permission, and forward the permission e-mail, together with the inquiry e-mail, to <tt>permissions AT wikimedia.org</tt>.</dd>

<dd>Hey Celevelander, thank you for the map. It looks great and modern&#160;:) Is it possible to include the Crusader states as well? With Principality of Antiouch and the County of Edessa in particular, perhaps even Cyprus? The map then could be used for Crusader states and the various Crusades articles. None of the articles have modern maps. Btw, it would also be good to chnage Cilicia to somehtign else. The official name was Kingdom of Armenia but historians always called it Kingdom of Lesser Armenia much like Eastern Roman Empire is is Byzantium so if you oculd fit Kingdom of Lesser Armenia that would be great.

<p>Hi Clevelander. Yes, I have sources for all my edits. This is from the book by Thomas de Waal called <i>Black Garden</i>. See an excerpt from the chapter 5 - <i>Yerevan: Mysteries of the East</i>.</p>
<p><i>Yet by the twentieth century the Azerbaijanis people, who had lived in Eastern Armenia for centuries, had become its silent guests, marginalized and discriminated against. The Armenians asserted their right to their homeland at the expense of these people. In 1918 ‚Äì 1920, tens of thousands Azerbaijanis were expelled from Zangezur. In 1940s, tens of thousands more were deported to Azerbaijan to make way for incoming Armenian immigrants from Diaspora. The last cleansing, in 1988 ‚Äì 1989, got rid of the rest</i>.</p>
<p>I can provide you with the full text of Stalin's decree on deportation of Azeris from Armenia to make space for Armenian immigrants. Regards, <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 11:17, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's because of the ambguity of the name "Hem≈üince". For example, if you ask the people of the W. group if they speak Hem≈üince, they will say that they don't, the people of Hopa are the ones who speak Hem≈üince. "Hem≈üince" is usually used for Homshetsi in Turkish. But, when a speaker of standard Turkish has difficulty in understanding their dialect and asks them why, they will answer "Because we speak Hem≈üince". <a href="../../../b/e/h/User%7EBehemoth_656c.html" title="User:Behemoth">Behemoth</a> 01:26, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Cleve, I think the map should give a good picture of where the fighting took place. I'm thinking that perhaps we should include two maps: one showing the location of Armenia, Azerbaijan, perhaps Turkey and Russia, and of course Karabakh and the other showing the locations of key cities in Karabakh. The cities and towns in Karabakh should be mainly those that major firefights took place: <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stepanakert.html" title="Stepanakert">Stepanakert</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shusha.html" title="Shusha">Shusha</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadrut.html" title="Hadrut">Hadrut</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/z/Fizuli.html" title="Fizuli">Fizuli</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelbajar.html" title="Kelbajar">Kelbajar</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/d/Agdam.html" title="Agdam">Agdam</a>, <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khojaly.html" title="Khojaly">Khojaly</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lachin.html" title="Lachin">Lachin</a>, etc. If you need a reference, here's good place <a href="http://www.reisenett.no/map_collection/commonwealth/Nagorno-Karabakh.GIF" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.reisenett.no/map_collection/commonwealth/Nagorno-Karabakh.GIF" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<dd>Hmm, this one is better but I don't like all those microrayon borders since they cluster up the map and that the names of the cities are all denoted by starts (might confuse readers into thinking which capital is which, use a round black dot instead). If you use something close to the map on the left part of the page here <a href="http://www.rferl.org/features/features_Article.aspx?m=06&amp;y=2006&amp;id=BA8125D0-0B71-4333-9A97-D0BF78C079BE" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rferl.org/features/features_Article.aspx?m=06&amp;y=2006&amp;id=BA8125D0-0B71-4333-9A97-D0BF78C079BE" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and simply zoom in slightly to focus on Karabakh and its cities (keep the old map key), I think it would be much better. If you can include some key roads include the Lachin corridor's that would be good too.</dd>

<dd>Edit:By the way, I'm thinking of creating at least two more detailed articles related to Nagorno-Karabakh's history: one that entails from the Sovietization phase from 1915-1923 and one that talks about the movement sparked from 1988-1991 or to present day; the latter which could be continously updated along with the war article.</dd>

I know I might be asking you for too much but its worth a try isn't it?&#160;;) If not, then we can just zoom out a little so readers can get a bigger picture of the area.

<p>I just took a closer look at your locator map for N-K, and noticed you kept my dashed lines for the northeast and northwest. Those were there because the Azeri rayons there are split between Azerbaijan and N-K; you may want to solidify the line, as a dashed line like that implies an uncertain border.

<p>Hello. The term "Tajik" is only a loose expression applied to sedentary, Persian-speaking people in Central-Asia ... it'S not really the name of an "ethnic group". "Tajik" is a synonym for "Persian" is given to heterogenious group of Persian-speakers.</p>
<p>I've never been to Tajikistan, but I do know Tajikistanis. There are differences between the Tajiks of Tajikistan and the Persian-speakers of Afghanistan ... but all in one, Persian-speakers in the region (including Persians of Iran) are not really different: same history, same culture, same language (with minor differences in dialects and accents), etc.</p>
<p>A good comparison is Germany. Germans, German-speaking Austrians, German-speaking Swiss people, etc are not really "different" from each other .... the same goes to Americans, English, Australians, and so on.</p>

<dd>Hey, I was thinking, is it possible to create an infobox on the bottom of Nagorno-Karabakh related articles in much the same way there is on the bottoms of the Cold War and World War II articles? I think we have enough articles, and enough ones to be created. WHat do you think? Also, for the Sumgait, article, I was thinking of having 2-3 pictures including drawings of the neighborhoods and perhaps having the one you upload be shown near the "Pogroms" section rather than right up on the top. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 18:52, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Cleve, I told you I'd email you but apparently you haven't specified your email on Wikipedia yet. But a while back you asked about my position on the issue of Karabakh. I think that the Karabakh Armenians have a right to secede. However that position compromises the premise - if 99% of Ohioans want to withdraw from the US, do they have the right? I think the fact that the land was partitioned and annexed to Azerbaijan in 1923 is the entire reason why many of us feel so passionately about it. Its about correcting a historical wrong, of aligning a misalignment caused by that smug looking, mustachioed thug from Georgia. Its delicate but, 94% of the region was Armenian in 1923 and after being Azerified, was nearly 75% Armenian. It has historical churches and forts which are of Armenian origin. Too many things to list. How did it go with the map?--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 05:52, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Cleve, this is just a message I posted at Eupator's talk page. The topic is on a new war with Karabakh so give it a read, and if you're interested we can discuss more about it.</p>
<p>I just realized your "busy" label on the top of this article but if you can, maybe we can talk about this together with Tigran, Cleve, and perhaps Moosh. I just finished reading this <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060623/wl_afp/azerbaijanarmenia_060623121717" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060623/wl_afp/azerbaijanarmenia_060623121717" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and it seems it maybe the final nail for the coffin of the peace process so to speak.

<dd>Heh, looks like you're very picky on spelling and grammar issues on Wikipedia - I like that, I'm like that too&#160;;). I, frankly don't favor Armenians living under Azeri control, no matter how much autonomy there is on paper. Its somewhat closer to overall distrust for the Azeris: their destruction of cultural artifacts, their belligerent finger waving and bellicose language, their equating of us to the Nazis, the treatment of Armenians not only in Sumgait, but in Baku, in Kirovobad (Ganje), in Hadrut, at Maragha, of Gurgen Markarian. The list goes on and it only proves that Armenians will not remain safe under their control. It will become much like the Israeli-Arab conflict in Gaza or East Jerusalem or the West Bank. Thousands of Armenians died to free the country from its oppressors twelve years ago and we are going to allow them to retain back the territory? I'm willing for some compromise such as allowing most, if not all the Azeri refugees back but ceding the territory is tantamount to the American colonists giving back South Carolina to the British during the Revolutionary War after forcing them to the sea.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I understand the regions of Kelbajar and Fizuli belong to the Azeris more or less, but I surely don't want Nagorno-Karabakh to be an island surrounded by fire. Just think of what will happen if we do cede the territory, revenge killings, pogroms this time in Shusha and Stepanakert, repeats of Sumgait at much greater magnitudes. Its general mistrust against others that is so prevalant amongst us Armenians. Surely a war could be much more devastating for Azerbaijan if it decides to invade, the buffer zone is covered with so many land mines that'll it give the Korean DMZ a run for its money. You can't liberate a region that doesn't even want you to liberate it. France was liberated, Belgium was liberated, Poland was liberated more or less, but Nagorno-Karabakh is like you compared, like Hungary. There's a reason why the people chose to declare their independence. I'd like Nagorno-Karabakh to be state of its own but would prefer it even more if it united with Armenia. I think we all know what the Azeri editors on this encylopedia want: "Of course we don't want war and want to resolve this diplomatically, <b>but</b> if it need be, we'll take it by force." That's a prevailing sentiment. If they do invade, and we do beat them back, then understand we won't have any better choice than to make a drive straight to Baku. As <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrei_Sakharov_b5cd.html" title="Andrei Sakharov">Andrei Sakharov</a> once said before he passed away, "For the Azeris, Nagorno-Karabakh is a matter of ambition, for Armenians, its a matter of life and death."--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 17:43, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hey Cleve, sorry for the late response. In reply to your last message, I'd favor indpendence but would believe it would be all the best if there is one Armenian country and not two, where Karabakh would become an autonomous republic in Armenia. I liked the analysis made by the the Armenian on RFE but I felt his comments on that the Soviet military doctrine was a practical failure and things such as hazing continue in the Armenian army, were out of place and inaccurate. But I'm glad he was impartial about it and didn't choose to take any sides during the Q&amp;A session. Also, in regards to Azerbaijan's outlandish military spending, I think we can all learn from the conditions of the people living in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> where their GDP is spen so much money on defense and so little for the people themselves, that this will do Azerbaijan little good. I think the key issue here is that Armenians have the will to fight because they are fighting for their survival, the Azeris, for a piece of land they think is theirs but never was.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 16:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Seems too simplistic a solution. Is Azerbaijan going to be surprised when 100% of the enclave, or if the displaced Azeris are included, 75% of Armenians vote for seccession? No, something seems out of place, I suspect some sort of nefarious going on here. Especially the new US mediator's comments which, the US position has always been pro-Azeri:</dd>

<p>Hey Cleves, sorry for my late responses. The article looks good and I might contribute a little also in adding sources including the Hitler quote which many Turks think was never uttered by Hitler. Keep up the good work, what do you think of the section on Kelbajar in the war article?--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 15:50, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to most sources, none. I also specify that in the footnote on Monte Melkonian who was the commander of the fighting forces to take Kelbajar.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 16:00, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Edit: well, none, militarily that is. Fighters like Melkonian had came from Lebanon (he was imprisoned in France before coming to Armenia) and Syria but that's not tantamount to saying their governments sent weapons and aid. Greece sent a great deal of economic aid also but none militarily. It was basically Russia and and weapons being smuggled in by Diaspora groups.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 16:02, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yup, seems illogical to place the railroad through there and seems completely logical through Turkish-Azeri mindsets, just take the Baku-Tiflis-Jeyhan pipeline for example. Its simply to anger Armenia because of Karabakh, but I guess as a plus side, they lose millions doing it so its not so bad. Turkey, which obviously has the beef and "4-conditional rules" with Armenia; Azerbaijan which is simply still trying to anger Armenia because it holds 14% of "its" land; and Georgia simply plays along with whomever can benefit it the most, I don't consider them allies at all, and don't like their people either. By the way take a look at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_volunteer_units" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_volunteer_units" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, its obvious the guy making these articles, OttomanReference, is trying to create the image that the volunteer units were so vast that they even warrant articles. Can you give him a warning that if he does include them, then he must explicitly cite the Armenian Genocide in the context? The guy is Turkish so we both can expect the same thign on his perception of 1915. If he refuses, I'll nominate that article, the Armenian "revolution at Van" and other such nonsense for immediate deletion. Circulate that among the other users too so they can be aware of the stuff that's being allowed to be used as educational material through Wikipedia.

<dd>I forget where Walker studied but I know he holds a degree(s) in history at a high level British University (Oxford maybe). Cornell seems more like a political scientest rather than a historical scholar. His entire biography is littered in oil politics and the Middle East. I don't know how far a degree in "Peace and Conflict" and "International" studies. The languages he speaks fluently are, in particular, Turkish and Azeri. Now what has precluded him from learning Armenian out of curiosity? The guy's education has come quite alot from Turkey.

<p>The reason that there were two closing parens )) at the end of official languages was that there were two imbedded parentheticals, the first gave the name of the laguage in Arabic, and the second gave the transliteration of that name. So, either the second closing ) needs to be restored, or the two parentheticals need to be reduced to a single one such as (ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å translitered as FƒÅrsi).

<p>Hi Clevelander. Nakhichevan was taken, in 1211/2, by the Armeno-Georgian prince Zachary <a href="http://rbedrosian.com/atmi2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://rbedrosian.com/atmi2.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> who ruled many Armenian lands under the authority of the Georgian queen <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamar_of_Georgia_3ce7.html" title="Tamar of Georgia">Tamar</a>. It remained in the possession of the Zacharid house and was plundered by the Mongols in 1220 and Khwarezmians in 1225 <a href="http://rbedrosian.com/atmi3.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://rbedrosian.com/atmi3.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. The Zacharids lost it to the Mongol lords in 1236 when the Caucasus was invaded by <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chormaqan.html" title="Chormaqan">Chormaqan</a>. <i>The History of Christian Caucasus</i> by <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyril_Toumanoff_fbeb.html" title="Cyril Toumanoff">Cyril Toumanoff</a> probably covers the events in greater details, but, unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have that book at hand. I‚Äôll give you more sources if I find them in English. Regards, --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a> 04:32, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just a small addition. Zacharyan Armenia (i.e. the lands ruled by Zacharid/zacharyan princes), were ruled as an independent principality. Zacharid princes were chief commanders (amirspasalar) in Georgian queen Tamar's court, so formally they were subject to the Georgian crown. But their lands outside Georgia proper (i.e. Zacharyan Armenia) were an independent principality. I am not sure what Toumanoff said, but being half Georgian (and half-Armenian), one would expect him to be at least slightly biased.</p>
<p>Before Zacharyans, Nakhichevan was in the very middle of the various Armenian kingdoms (Artashesyan, Arshakuni, Bagratuni). This is textbook stuff.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 08:07, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>With all due respect, Tigran, I have to disagree with you. Zacharid Armenia was indeed a dependency of Georgia and was within its borders but for a short time. It's clearly stated in all major works about the medieval Caucasian history. The Zacharids emerged from a petty nobility to a major feudal house when the kings of Georgia liberated northern Armenia from the Seljuk grasp and granted these lands (plus some territories in southeastern Georgia) to Prince Sarkis and his sons, Zachary and Ivane, in hereditary possession. The Zacharid princes did not pay taxes, but they were oblidged to support the Georgian crown with their armies. As for "Armeno-Georgian", this is a scholarly term used not only by Toumanoff, but also by Kazdhan, Minorsky, Sunny, etc. This term is usually applied to a number of noble fmailies active in the Armeno-Georgian marchlands like Tayk/Tao, Lori, etc. The fact that the Zacharids (actually, most medieval Armenian and Georgian sources knew them as Mkhrargrdzelis) were bicultural is testified by their bilingual inscriptions found in Lori, Ani and elswhere in the historic Armenian and Georgian lands. Subsequently, Ivane converted to Georgian Orthodox Christianity, while Zachary remained Armenian in his faith. Both lines went extinct when their sons died in the 1230s-40s. Their minor branches continued as a purely Georgian noble families of Gagels, Torels, etc.</dd>

<dd>Kober, Mkhargrdzeli is a title not a name. Not all Zakardis had this title. The title began used starting from 1185, yet Zakarids served Georgia from 1100. It means dolgoruki (longhanded). The Zakarids were an offshot of the greater house of Artsrunis. --<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 21:39, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What's wrong with using Chris Walker's book on the Armenian SSR? I already used him on the Armenian WWII articles.

<dd>I think you're thinking about Grigor Suny who supports the unification of Azerbaijan and calls the Genocide something that was not planned in its stead. Otherwise, Walker has been very forthcoming on Armenians in the books but I haven't heard much from him in the past few years.</dd>

<dd>The statistics that dispute it come from the time period of 1914, where Muslims represented a majority and had a superiority over Armenians in numbers.

<p>I have more issues with Nakhichevan on your page. My biggest problem is that Josephus mentioning Nakhijevan is earlier than Ptolemy, thus making the Josephus quote the first attestation. The second major thing that I noticed for now is regarding Vaspurakan. Nakhichevan was never part of Vaspurakan. For a brief period the Artsrunis who ruled from Vaspurakan gained possesions in Syunik of which Nakhijevan was part of. I suggest you look at the maps at Armenica here <a href="http://www.armenica.org/cgi-bin/history/en/getHistory.cgi?3=1==Armenia==1=3=AAA" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.armenica.org/cgi-bin/history/en/getHistory.cgi?3=1==Armenia==1=3=AAA" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> to get a visual idea.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 23:34, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Clevelander, "trading" compromises between two articles (i.e. "I will do this on Nakhichevan if you do this on Syunik") rewards attempts to make a point, which is forbidden in Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>). GM tried to make a point by arguing "well, Nakhichevan page says this, so if we are going to adopt such a policy, then I will do the same on Syunik article." This is not the way Wikipedia works, so it is not wise to go along with such cross-article "negotiation." Each article has its own reasons and should be discussed on its own merits. Plus, it is not wise for you to "promise" something on the Nakhichevan page that you cannot stick to. You can't control what other users (including me) will edit on Nakhichevan and Syunik pages--and as far as I am concerned, there is no reason to include multinational spellings on Shunik page, while there is plenty of reason to include them on the Nakhichevan page (due to the Kars treaty etc).--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigranTheGreat_39e8.html" title="User:TigranTheGreat">TigranTheGreat</a> 04:01, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Clevelander! I hate to break it to you, after you've done a good chunk of work already, but Soviet autonomous oblasts actually have their own stubs. For example, you put the autonomous oblasts template to <a href="../../../t/u/v/Tuva.html" title="Tuva">Tuva</a>, while in fact it should have gone to <a href="../../../t/u/v/Tuvan_Autonomous_Oblast_251e.html" title="Tuvan Autonomous Oblast">Tuvan Autonomous Oblast</a>. I'd appreciate if you could fix it; let me know if you need help. Nice template, by the way.

<p>Thanks for the pointer, but that would take a lot of work to implement, since I'd have to convert it to straight HTML if I want optional fields like that. But I'll do that anyway (maybe tomorrow, though), because I guess it's important that all SSRs use the same infobox for further changes. Could you help me put the SSR infobox on all the different SSRs? It's a lot of work, and I could use some help. <small><a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LittleDan</a></small><sup><a href="../../../l/i/t/User_talk%7ELittleDan_c646.html" title="User talk:LittleDan">talk</a></sup> 23:03, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I finished making those changes you suggested, thanks again. Do you think I should make the Established field optional? The <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karelo-Finnish_SSR_0e7e.html" title="Karelo-Finnish SSR">Karelo-Finnish SSR</a> lacks it, but Established is written anyway, so I'm not sure what I should do about it. <small><a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LittleDan</a></small><sup><a href="../../../l/i/t/User_talk%7ELittleDan_c646.html" title="User talk:LittleDan">talk</a></sup> 12:42, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here:</p>
<p>Dr. Andrew Andersen - anders@allstream.net Andrew Andersen was born in the USSR and grew up in Siberia and Latvia. He received his Master's degree from Moscow State University in 1980 where he later taught. His Master's thesis covered the influence of the World Wars on 20th Century American literature. In 1984 he obtained his Ph.D. from Moscow State University. Andersen's Ph.D. thesis analyzed the evolution and transformation of American public opinion and mass-media coverage regarding the US role in the Vietnam War (1962-75). At the beginning of Perestroyka, Andersen left the USSR and settled in Germany where he coordinated a number of Eastern European seminars, courses and projects organized by Wirtschaftsakatdemie in Kiel (Schleswig-Holstein). In 1994 Andrew Andersen immigrated to Canada. Upon landing in Toronto (Ontario) he worked as a TV reporter and show co-host at Mix-TV Broadcasting Company. In 1996 he moved with his family to British Columbia. Between 1996 and 2003 Andrew Andersen taught various Political Science courses at the University of Victoria. In 2003 he was granted a position of research fellowship with the Centre of Military and Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary. Andrew Andersen has written a number of books and articles for national and international professional magazines on ethnic, territorial and ideological conflicts, as well as on other international security-related issues</p>

<p>Hi, I am Georgian and I was just wondering that if the name "Nagorno"-Karabakh should be changed to "mountainous"-Karabakh, because 'nagorno" is just a Russian word as you know and Russian is not an official language of Armenia. For example in Georgian we say "Mtiani-Karabakhi" "mtiani" meaning mounatinous.
