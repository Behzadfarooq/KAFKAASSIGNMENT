<p>This is a start. From where I sit, there will be pointers going in many directions as the description expands. AI Winter is classic and ought to be cherished (it's a concrete example of something we need to get a hold of).</p>
<p>Until this page is more fully expanded, please see <a href="../../../i/c/a/ICAD_8071.html" title="ICAD">ICAD</a> and <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge-Based_Engineering_82b6.html" title="Knowledge-Based Engineering">Knowledge-Based_Engineering</a> for recent examples of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Understanding the dynamics behind the AI Winter will be an important part of the future of computing. So, there is no shame to be associated with the related events. Rather, what we have here is just a blimp in the long trail of evolution. --<a href="../../../j/m/s/User%7EJMSwtlk_8dfb.html" title="User:JMSwtlk">jmswtlk</a> 14:38, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the contribution, but the article doesn't currently seem to be the type of encyclopedic writing that Wikipedia is looking for. For one, what is the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">source</a> for the material? Unles the term is a proper noun, <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a> call for it to be lower case. Another is that the article never really tells what the term is or means or how it is used. I don't mean to criticize, but familiarizing yourself with the editing conventions can help your contributions be more useful. Let me know if there is anything I can help with. You don't need to learn everything all at once, but some time spent getting used to the major policies will save time in the end. --<a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 15:46, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I see what you mean. The stub was there empty; I entered some thoughts to get response.

<dd>Taxman- the term "AI Winter" (whether it should be capitalized, I do not know- I've seen it both ways, but as it refers to a specific downturn in a specific part of the tech industry, I'd say leave it caps- the direct links to here instead of the lowercase argue for leaving it be) was coined, as far as I can tell, by the press covering the AI industry back in the late '80s, and is used widely- I heard of it long before I began researching Lisp machines or even before I ever heard of Wikipedia. It's definitely not a neologism worth deleting. As far as JMS' editting goes, I can't disagree there, but I'm confident he'll pick it up quickly. His contributions have already improved markedly. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">Maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">Contribs</a> 18:16, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Taxman and Maru - It's good to have the reviews so fast. I'll work to get 'source' and other details in line. I was there (on the commercial side as a user - several types of applications) and am happy to see that the events are interesting enough to write about.</dd>

<p>I don't get all the text about microcomputers and AI winter. Surely having more general access to computing should have improved any field of comp sci research? Could someone a) scale back the references and b) explain the ones left a little better? Thanks! --<a href="../../../j/a/i/User%7EJaibe_6dd3.html" title="User:Jaibe">Jaibe</a> 08:59, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Jaibe. I think that this page has its particular flavor since the original development came from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisp_machine.html" title="Lisp machine">Lisp machine</a> discussion. About your reference to comp sci reaseach, I must add that many corporate research organizations had AI activities. I know personally that there was a lot of money involved with AI outside the academic environment. Not all of this was funded through government projects. Much of this work was tied to the Lisp machine. Depending upon one's view of Lisp, these workstations were very much productivity enhancing devices. Then, the work to add Lisp cards to the PC and the Mac was a very interesting blip in the long evolution of the computer. So, the parts dealing with hardware are important, I think, but may play a lesser role in the whole page eventually.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are probably ranges of meaning for "AI Winter" that ought to be made more clear. For instance, some might point mainly to the '<a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_AI_efb5.html" title="Strong AI">strong AI</a>' aspect dealing with how far the computational can go in meeting or beating human intelligence. From the operational side, there are the issues that might come under software engineering practices, however it involves much more than that. This was my motivation for putting the <a href="../../../e/n/d/End-user_computing.html" title="End-user computing">End-user computing</a> link. <a href="../../../j/m/s/User%7EJMSwtlk_8dfb.html" title="User:JMSwtlk">jmswtlk</a> 15:53, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK -- I have made a stab at making the intro more general and giving the lisp machine part its own section, but I'm not sure that a) I put the section in the right place or b) that it has as much detail as it deserves. Now that it's not in the intro, perhaps your explanation could be moved into the article? Or maybe we should have a brief explanation in this article, and make more leverage of the existing lisp machine article?</p>
<p>Also, maybe there should be another subsection about AI Spring, rather than just a line in the lisp machine section? I did a google search on "ai winter" and the top N articles were about the new AI Spring (it's in wired so it <i>must</i> be true...) --<a href="../../../j/a/i/User%7EJaibe_6dd3.html" title="User:Jaibe">Jaibe</a> 10:41, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm commenting out some recent edits- the chill on British research and on neural nets in the '70s are not what this topic addresses.

<dd>I have to say I think that's quite a mistake, that was the most solid content in this article so far. Rather than comment them out, if you think it's just *an* AI winter, then edit the sections to say so. But I've heard that it the 70s to mid 80s were *the* canonical AI winter in AI courses at both MIT and Edinburgh. But whatever, pitch it the way you want. But why lose good content?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, I commented them out (not the same thing as removing them- as far as I can tell, they are perfectly factual and such; I'm just questioning whether this is the right article for the text to be in); I'm not trying to lose good content here. It's just that I thought this article concerned itself with the American AI bubble and crash in the '80s, with Symbolics, LMI, Goldhill, etc. not those other AI Winters, since I hadn't heard the term AI Winter applied to the specific time periods adduced. I could be wrong here, so you other editors who were around, please weigh in.</dd>

<dd>At some point, the thing could be split into the respective (agreed upon) categories. This is where 'wiki' gets interesting in that it can support 'convergence' almost realtime of entries from disparate views. Did you put the original 'red node' (however the empty article is called)? I saw it first in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisp_machine.html" title="Lisp machine">Lisp machine</a>. When I made the first post, I did so in order to not have it empty. It seemed to me that AI Winter was something that needs discussion. And, we need to do this from more than the normal perspectives.</dd>

<dd>Now, about the particular viewpoint of my post (and the relative weight, thereof&#160;:-), it was from a practitioner's that is seldom heard. Why? Those within the commercial environment are usually under heavy stricture. Even if they are allowed to publish, it’s under serious restraining edits. Why? IP, competitive advantage. So, I’m writing from the perspective of someone who actually had his hands on and used 9 different variety of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisp_machine.html" title="Lisp machine">Lisp_machine</a>. So, that makes me an interested party. I also have been involved continually from those days in the various methods that have been allowed to carry forward. This despite the so-called large influence of the “AI Winter.” From where I sit, I’ve seen many mini “AI winters” which upon careful study leads me to suspect that more attention on the management of expectation, on truth in computing, better <a href="../../../e/n/d/End-user_computing.html" title="End-user computing">End-user computing</a>, and several other factors might be of interest to the large community.</dd>

<dd>I'm sensing that you two want to steer this article towards a more general coverage of AI winters in general, so I uncommented the sections. As you said, JMS, the important thing is to flesh the article out, and worry about editing it down later.</dd>
<dd>As far as the more philosophical portion goes, I chalk this up as showing that even academia and the tech industry are vulnerable to bouts of irrationality. At least modern computers are starting to incorporate Lisp machine ideas. (ex. Emacs, <a href="../../../s/t/u/StumpWM_c9e8.html" title="StumpWM">StumpWM</a>, that sort of thing). --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">Contribs</a> 02:15, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed a section on Google hiring Lisp and Python programmers and Google making AI, and Marudubshinki put it back (admittedly, better written now). The reason I took it out originally was that I didn't see any relevance to "Lisp and Lisp machines," the section header; lots of companies hire Lisp programmers, so singling out Google didn't seem to be of much use. It might seem more appropriate for a new "AI Spring" header. (I made an AI spring redirect to this article.)</p>
<p>By the way, this was mentioned in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/technology/18brain.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/technology/18brain.html" rel="nofollow">a recent NYTimes article</a>. Don't know if it's an appropriate External link, since these links go dark after a week or so and require an account. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 14:44, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We should be mentioning Google because they are one of the vanishing few companies who we can source (as in, to the specific piece of software; ex. <a href="../../../m/a/p/MapReduce_7eeb.html" title="MapReduce">MapReduce</a>) using AI and related things. As for the NY Times article, sure (we link to Encyclopedia Britannica, and they don't just go dark, but are always restricted), but I generally like to add page numbers and dates to make hardcopies easy to look up. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 03:29, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I actually think the edit is a mistake &amp; it should go back the way it was. First I've heard the rumour confirmed by Peter Norvig -- Google are trying to do human-level AI &amp; have put it on their project timeline. Second, I think the whole lisp-machine thread is kind of lame &amp; detached from the main topic, but the fact a significant software company a) uses lisp &amp; b) is trying to solve strong AI actually brings the section back into being interesting to the main article reader. --<a href="../../../j/a/i/User%7EJaibe_6dd3.html" title="User:Jaibe">Jaibe</a> 20:21, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The whole combined edit (I think that should be obvious from what I said!) The reversal is better than the deletion, but I liked the original best of all. --<a href="../../../j/a/i/User%7EJaibe_6dd3.html" title="User:Jaibe">Jaibe</a> 10:30, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Erm- what? Look at what it said before, as I deleted it as much for poor style as for the unclear relevance to the section:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In particular, the online search company <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> is rumoured to hire any lisp programmers they can find, as well as <a href="../../../p/y/t/Python_programming_language.html" title="Python programming language">Python</a> programmers. The company has also been rumoured to be interested in solving AI.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"lisp" isn't capitalized</li>
<li>as well as Python programmers? What? Is Python associated from AI? This is out of nowhere.</li>
<li>"solving" AI? What does that mean? And "rumored" is pretty wimpy, especially if marudubshinki is correct that they have outright said that they're interested (which I belive is correct).</li>
</ul>
<p>I find marudubshinki's edit as a vast improvement over what was said before, making the intent of the passage obvious and writing in clear prose. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 18:57, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>About <a href="../../../p/y/t/Python_programming_language.html" title="Python programming language">Python</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_Intelligence_4365.html" title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</a>, please reference Peter Novig's work (<a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/python/readme.html" class="external text" title="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/python/readme.html" rel="nofollow">AIMA Python Code</a>). Some claim that Python can do about everything that <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisp_programming_language.html" title="Lisp programming language">Lisp</a> does (one noted exception is providing macros) thereby offering a possible replacement to those who need to get away from <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisp_programming_language.html" title="Lisp programming language">Lisp</a> (for various reasons).</dd>
<dd>In the context of history (applied view dealing with implementations), the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisp_Machine_10f7.html" title="Lisp Machine">Lisp Machine</a> page, I think, is a definite plus. I see a whole lot of extensions that can built from that page. For example, there were many development (IDE type) of packages that provided their mark for a time. <a href="../../../i/c/a/ICAD_8071.html" title="ICAD">ICAD</a> was one that carried over to Unix. Also, I believe that many user interface improvements were prototyped within that environment. <a href="../../../j/m/s/User%7EJMSwtlk_8dfb.html" title="User:JMSwtlk">jmswtlk</a> 19:52, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I was speaking as an ignorant reader. Python was not mentioned in the article with regards to AI, and still isn't. I do happen to be a Python programmer where I work... but not everyone reading the article is. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 21:28, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please see the addition of Python's (and its cohorts - the multi-paradigm languages) contribution to the AI Spring.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, I still think it lacks punch. I'm going to try to edit back in the human-level AI stuff. I don't care if we explicitly reference google or not. If you guys revert me again though I won't thrash.</dd>
