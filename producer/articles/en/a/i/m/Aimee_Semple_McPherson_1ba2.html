<p>Born <b>Aimee Elizabeth Kennedy</b> in <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salford%2C_Ontario_41c3.html" title="Salford, Ontario">Salford, Ontario</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, she was the daughter of James Morgan Kennedy, a widower and devout <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodist</a>, and Mildred Ona Pearce, 36 years his junior, who had been hired to nurse his first wife during her terminal illness. The age difference had caused a scandal in their small Southwestern Ontario community, prompting the couple to elope to the nearby <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._state_5a68.html" title="U.S. state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>.</p>
<p>Her mother had been orphaned at an early age, and raised by a couple who worked with the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation_Army_4c99.html" title="Salvation Army">Salvation Army</a>. As a result, Aimee was raised in an atmosphere of strong <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> beliefs. As a <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teenager.html" title="Teenager">teenager</a>, however, she became an avowed <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic.html" title="Agnostic">agnostic</a>, and began her public speaking career at the age of 13 in this context, writing letters to the newspaper defending <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, debating local clergy, etc.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Robert and Aimee Semple, 1910</div>

<p>She met her first husband Robert James Semple, a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecostalism.html" title="Pentecostalism">Pentecostal</a> <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionary.html" title="Missionary">missionary</a> from <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, in December 1907 while attending a revival meeting at the urging of her father. After her conversion and a short courtship, they were married on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_12.html" title="August 12">August 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>. Shortly thereafter, the two embarked on an evangelistic tour, first to Europe and then to <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, where they arrived in June 1910. Shortly after they disembarked in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, however, they both contracted <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a>. Robert Semple died of the disease on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_19.html" title="August 19">August 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>. Aimee recovered and gave birth to a daughter, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Roberta_Semple_Salter_1ba9.html" title="Roberta Semple Salter">Roberta Star Semple</a>, on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_17.html" title="September 17">September 17</a>, after which she returned to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. Roberta died in January 2007.</p>
<p>Her mother "Minnie" had, in the footsteps of her foster parents, remained active with the Salvation Army, and after a short recuperation, Aimee joined her in this work. While so occupied in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York</a>, she met her second husband, Harold Stewart McPherson, an accountant. They were married on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_5.html" title="May 5">May 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, and they had a son, <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolf_McPherson_a7e7.html" title="Rolf McPherson">Rolf Potter Kennedy McPherson</a>, born <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_23.html" title="March 23">March 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/m/Aimee_Semple_McPherson_1ba2.html" title="Edit section: Evangelism and Foursquare Gospel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Evangelism and Foursquare Gospel</span></h2>
<p>After the birth of her son, McPherson suffered from <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postpartum_depression.html" title="Postpartum depression">postpartum depression</a> and several serious health issues. She tried to settle down to a quieter home-life, but her personal call to Christian service remained constant. Growing weaker and weaker from sickness, Aimee, while on her deathbed after her second operation within two years, committed to devote herself to to what she felt was God's call. Soon thereafter, her health improved. After this <a href="../../../n/e/a/Near-death_experience.html" title="Near-death experience">near-death experience</a> in 1913, she embarked upon a preaching career in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the U.S.</p>
<p>In keeping with the promise to God made in her illness, she had left home by June of 1915 and began evangelizing and holding tent revivals, first by traveling up and down the eastern part of the United States, then expanding to other parts of the country. She eventually held meetings in all parts of the world. People began coming in ever-increasing numbers to hear this remarkable female evangelist. When not in a tent, she would need to find the largest auditorium in town in order to hold the record number of people that would come to her meetings. Often she would have to share the time with whatever event was happening in the town. On one occasion she met in a boxing ring, but had to hold her meetings before and after the boxing match. Once in San Diego, the National Guard had to be brought in to control the crowd of over 30,000 people. People would often stand in line and wait many hours for the next service to begin in order to be assured a seat.</p>

<p>In 1916 she made a tour through the southern U.S. in her "Gospel Car", a 1912 <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packard.html" title="Packard">Packard</a> touring car with religious slogans painted on the side; standing in the back seat of the convertible, she would give sermons through a bullhorn. On the road between sermons, she would sit in the back seat typing sermons and other religious materials. By 1917 she had started her own newspaper, named <i>The Bridal Call</i>, for which she wrote many of the articles.</p>
<p>Although her husband initially made efforts to join her on her religious travels, he soon became frustrated with the situation, and by 1918 had filed for separation. His petition for divorce, citing abandonment, was granted in 1921.</p>
<p>Aimee McPherson spent the four years of 1918 to 1922 as itinerant Pentecostal preacher. Weary of constant traveling and having no place to raise a family, Aimee eventually settled in Los Angeles. This was to be her base of operation. There she maintained both a home and a thriving church. For several years she continued to travel and raise money for the construction of a large, domed church building in the <a href="../../../e/c/h/Echo_Park%2C_Los_Angeles%2C_California_9f3c.html" title="Echo Park, Los Angeles, California">Echo Park</a> area of Los Angeles, named <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelus_Temple_8b92.html" title="Angelus Temple">Angelus Temple</a>. On January 1, 1923, Angelus Temple was dedicated. The church had a <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seating_capacity.html" title="Seating capacity">seating capacity</a> of 5,300 people and was filled to capacity three times each day, seven days a week. In the beginning, Aimee preached every service. It became the spiritual home for thousands of her followers and a base for her evangelistic ministry. What grew out of a desire to have a base of operation to preach the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">Gospel</a>, quickly evolved into a church organization called the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Church_of_the_Foursquare_Gospel_59fe.html" title="International Church of the Foursquare Gospel">International Church of the Foursquare Gospel</a> ---supporting and sending out missionaries, providing commissary and community services that were more reliable than the city's own relief programs, as well as a full program of church ministries.</p>
<p>Aimee was famous both inside and outside of religious circles. Every city where services were held usually had in attendance civic leaders, as well as pastors representing the local churches of every <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_denomination.html" title="Christian denomination">denomination</a>. She made sure that Angelus Temple was represented in local parades and entered floats into the famous Rose Parade in Pasadena. Her illustrated sermons attracted even those from the entertainment industry, looking to see a "show" that rivaled what <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> had to offer. These famous stage productions drew people who would never have thought to enter a church, and then presented them with her interpretation of the message of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation.html" title="Salvation">salvation</a>. Aimee believed that the Gospel was to be presented at every opportunity and used worldly means at her disposal to present it to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>At the time, women in the <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulpit.html" title="Pulpit">pulpit</a> ministry were rare—those who wore makeup and jewelry in the pulpit, nonexistent. Her uniqueness was in this respect: she was flamboyant and showy. Many believed that Aimee's charismatic personality was really a God-given gift used to draw people to hear her. Her sermons, unlike other contemporaries, e.g. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Sunday_7377.html" title="Billy Sunday">Billy Sunday</a>, were not the usual <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_and_brimstone.html" title="Fire and brimstone">fire-and-brimstone</a> messages, but were based around a more friendly interpretation of the modern Christian texts. There were many who found her theology suspect. Her use of unconventional methods was disparaged, even earning criticism for "her unashamed use of low-key sex appeal to attract converts". Amiee would, at many times, appear before parishioners in a white gown, carrying a bouquet of flowers.</p>
<p>Since Pentecostalism was not popular in the U.S. during the 1920s she avoided the label, but she was heavily influenced by this faith, incorporating demonstrations of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossolalia.html" title="Glossolalia">speaking-in-tongues</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith_healing.html" title="Faith healing">faith healing</a> into her sermons, and keeping a museum of crutches, wheelchairs and so forth. She was also strongly influenced by the Salvation Army: in a campaign to spread the church nationwide, she adopted a theme of "lighthouses" for the satellite churches, referring to the parent church as the "Salvation Navy."</p>
<p>Always seeking publicity, McPherson continued publishing with the weekly <i>Foursquare Crusader</i> and a monthly magazine dubbed <i>Bible Call</i>. She also began broadcasting on radio in its infancy of the early '20s. McPherson was first woman in history to preach a radio sermon, and with the opening of Foursquare Gospel-owned <a href="../../../k/x/o/KXOL_e806.html" title="KXOL">KFSG</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_6.html" title="February 6">February 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>, she also became the first woman to be granted a broadcast license by the Federal Radio Commission (which became the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> in 1934).</p>
<p>McPherson made the most of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">show-business</a> atmosphere of Los Angeles to incorporate entertainment into her religious meetings, using stage props, contemporary music, and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality_play.html" title="Morality play">morality plays</a> (which she called "illustrations"), with elaborate costumes and scenery, to their best advantage to draw listeners. She even wrote and produced a couple of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">operas</a>, and at one meeting made a dramatic entrance riding a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorcycle.html" title="Motorcycle">motorcycle</a> down the aisle of Angelus Temple.</p>

</div>
<p>She was also very skillful at fundraising. Collections were taken at every meeting, usually with the admonishment of "no coins, please". When the $1.5 million Angelus Temple opened its doors, construction was already entirely paid for through private donations.</p>
<p>With Aimee, all were called and all were welcomed. She evangelized when segregation was rampant in the South. Although she invited all to come to her meetings, often she would go to the "black" parts of town and hold meetings after the main meeting was over. She broke down racial barriers such that one time at Angelus Temple, some <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> members were in attendance, but after the service, many of their hoods and robes were found thrown on the ground in nearby <a href="../../../e/c/h/Echo_Park_c6e6.html" title="Echo Park">Echo Park</a>. She is also credited with helping many of the Hispanic ministries in Los Angeles get started, and there was even a great <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma_people.html" title="Roma people">Gypsy</a> following, after the wife of a Gypsy chief and the chief himself had been healed in a Denver revival meeting. With Aimee Semple McPherson there was no color, ethnic, or status separation line.</p>
<p>In 1925, the license for KFSG was suspended by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Commerce_1c40.html" title="United States Department of Commerce">Commerce Department</a> for deviating from its assigned frequency. Many broadcast histories claim McPherson sent an angry telegram to then-Commerce Secretary <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Hoover_33d7.html" title="Herbert Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> ordering his "minions of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>" to release her station at once. This may be an urban legend.</p>
<p>McPherson also received several death threats in 1925, and an alleged plot to kidnap her was foiled in September of that year, thus setting the stage for the episode for which she is best known.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/m/Aimee_Semple_McPherson_1ba2.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Kidnapping&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Kidnapping"</span></h2>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_18.html" title="May 18">May 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, McPherson went to Ocean Park Beach, California, north of <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice%2C_Los_Angeles%2C_California_180a.html" title="Venice, Los Angeles, California">Venice Beach</a> with her <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary.html" title="Secretary">secretary</a>, to go swimming. Soon after arrival, McPherson disappeared.</p>
<p>It was generally assumed at the time that she had drowned; <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mourner.html" title="Mourner">mourners</a> crowded Venice Beach, and the commotion sparked a days-long <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media.html" title="Media">media</a> coverage of the event, fueled in part by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Randolph_Hearst_c64a.html" title="William Randolph Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>'s <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Herald_Examiner_76d5.html" title="Los Angeles Herald Examiner">Los Angeles Examiner</a></i>, and even including a poem by <a href="../../../u/p/t/Upton_Sinclair_68d1.html" title="Upton Sinclair">Upton Sinclair</a> commemorating the "tragedy." Daily updates appeared in newspapers across the country; parishioners held day-and-night seaside <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigil.html" title="Vigil">vigils</a>. A futile search for the body resulted in one parishioner drowning, and another diver dying from exposure.</p>
<p>At about the same time, Kenneth G. Ormiston, <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineer.html" title="Engineer">engineer</a> for KFSG, also disappeared. The two incidents were seen as unrelated.</p>
<p>About a month after the disappearance, McPherson's mother, Minnie Kennedy, received a <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ransom.html" title="Ransom">ransom</a> note, signed by "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Avengers_81f8.html" title="The Avengers">The Avengers</a>", which demanded a half million <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dollar.html" title="Dollar">dollars</a> to ensure kidnappers would not sell McPherson into "<a href="../../../w/h/i/White_slavery.html" title="White slavery">white slavery</a>". Kennedy later said she tossed the letter away, believing her daughter to be dead.</p>
<p>After 35 days (on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_23.html" title="June 23">June 23</a>), McPherson stumbled out of the desert in <a href="../../../a/g/u/Agua_Prieta%2C_Mexico_0663.html" title="Agua Prieta, Mexico">Agua Prieta</a>, a <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexican</a> town just across the border from <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas%2C_Arizona_a16b.html" title="Douglas, Arizona">Douglas, Arizona</a>. She claimed that she had been kidnapped, drugged, tortured, and held for ransom in a shack in Mexico, then had escaped and walked through the desert for about 13 hours to freedom.</p>
<p>Several problems were found with McPherson's story. Her shoes showed no evidence of a 13-hour walk; indeed, they had grass stains on them after a supposed walk through the desert. The shack could not be found. McPherson showed up fully dressed while having disappeared wearing a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathing_suit.html" title="Bathing suit">bathing suit</a>, and was wearing a watch given to her by her mother, which she had not taken on her swimming trip.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_jury.html" title="Grand jury">grand jury</a> convened on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_8.html" title="July 8">July 8</a> to investigate the matter, but adjourned 12 days later citing lack of evidence to proceed. However, several witnesses then came forward stating that they had seen McPherson and Ormiston at various hotels over the 32-day period.</p>
<p>The grand jury re-convened on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_3.html" title="August 3">August 3</a> and received further testimony, corroborated by documents from hotels in McPherson's handwriting. McPherson steadfastly stuck to her story that she was approached by a young couple at the beach who had asked her to come over and pray for their sick child, and that she was then shoved into a car and drugged with <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chloroform.html" title="Chloroform">chloroform</a>. However, when she was not forthcoming with answers regarding her relationship with Ormiston (who was recently estranged from his wife), <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge.html" title="Judge">Judge</a> Samuel Blake charged McPherson and her mother with <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obstruction_of_justice.html" title="Obstruction of justice">obstruction of justice</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">November 3</a>.</p>
<p>Theories and <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innuendo.html" title="Innuendo">innuendo</a> abounded: she had run off with a lover; she had had an <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a>; she was recovering from <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastic_surgery.html" title="Plastic surgery">plastic surgery</a>; she had staged the whole thing as a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publicity_stunt.html" title="Publicity stunt">publicity stunt</a>.

<p>McPherson continued preaching but fell out of favor with the press. While she and her ministry still received a good deal of publicity, most of it was bad. Additionally, she became involved in power struggles for the church with her mother and daughter. McPherson suffered a <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nervous_breakdown.html" title="Nervous breakdown">nervous breakdown</a> in August 1930.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">September 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>, McPherson married again, this time to an actor and musician, David Hutton. The marriage got off to a rocky start: two days after the wedding, Hutton was sued for <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alienation_of_affection.html" title="Alienation of affection">alienation of affection</a> by a woman, Hazel St. Pierre, whom he claimed never to have met. He eventually settled the case by paying $5,000 to St. Pierre. While McPherson was away in Europe, she was incensed to discover Hutton was billing himself as "Aimee's man" in his <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabaret.html" title="Cabaret">cabaret</a> singing act.</p>
<p>The marriage also caused an uproar within the church. The tenets of Foursquare Gospel, which were set up by McPherson herself, stated that no one should remarry while their previous spouse was still alive (which Harold McPherson was at the time). McPherson and Hutton separated in 1933, and divorced on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, McPherson was active in creating <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soup_kitchen.html" title="Soup kitchen">soup kitchens</a>, free clinics and other charitable activities; with the outbreak of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, she became involved in <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_bond.html" title="War bond">war bond</a> rallies.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_27.html" title="September 27">September 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, shortly after giving a sermon, she was found dead in her hotel room in <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland%2C_California_0bc0.html" title="Oakland, California">Oakland, California</a> of an overdose of prescription <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbiturates.html" title="Barbiturates">barbiturates</a>. Once again, rumors flew, this time conjecturing <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a>. However, it is generally agreed that the overdose was accidental, as stated on the coroner's report.</p>
<p>McPherson is buried in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_Lawn_Memorial_Park_%28Glendale%29_adc6.html" title="Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)">Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery</a> in <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glendale%2C_California_2c37.html" title="Glendale, California">Glendale, California</a>. According to <i>The Preachers</i> by James Morris, she was buried with a live telephone in her casket to ensure her survival in the event of bodily resurrection, although other biographers do not mention this and groundskeepers at Forest Lawn deny it. The Foursquare Gospel church, whose leadership was assumed by McPherson's son Rolf for 44 years after her death, continues worldwide with over two million members, over 90% of whom are outside the United States.</p>
