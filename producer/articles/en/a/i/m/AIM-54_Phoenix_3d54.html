<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/m/AIM-54_Phoenix_3d54.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The Phoenix missile was the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>' only long-range air-to-air missile, and first missile capable of multiple-launch against more than one target. Most other US aircraft relied on the smaller, less-expensive <a href="../../../a/i/m/AIM-7_035f.html" title="AIM-7">AIM-7</a> Sparrow classified as a Medium Range Missile (MRM). Guidance for the Sparrow required that the launching aircraft use its radar to continuously illuminate a single target for the missile seeker to track, or guidance would be lost. This method meant the aircraft no longer had a search capability while supporting the launched Sparrow, effectively reducing situational awareness. The Tomcat's <a href="../../../a/w/g/AWG-9_86cf.html" title="AWG-9">AWG-9</a> radar was capable of tracking up to 24 targets in Track-While-Scan mode, with the AWG-9 selecting priority targets for potential launch by the AIM-54. The pilot or Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) could then launch the AIM-54 Phoenix missiles when launch parameters were met. The large Tactical Information Display (TID) in the RIO's cockpit gave an unprecedented amount of information to the aircrew (the pilot had the ability to monitor the RIO's display) and, importantly, the AWG-9 could continually search and track multiple targets after Phoenix missiles were launched, thereby maintaining situational awareness of the Battlespace. Link-4 datalink capability allowed the Tomcats to share information with the <a href="../../../e/-/2/E-2_Hawkeye_fad5.html" title="E-2 Hawkeye">E-2C Hawkeye</a> AEW aircraft and during Desert Shield in 1990, Link-4A was introduced that allowed the Tomcats to have fighter-to-fighter datalink capability, further enhancing overall situational awareness. The F-14D entered service with the JTIDS that brought the even better Link-16 datalink "picture" to the cockpit.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/m/AIM-54_Phoenix_3d54.html" title="Edit section: Active Guidance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Active Guidance</span></h2>
<p>The Phoenix has several guidance modes and achieves its longest range by using updates from the F-14's AWG-9 radar (APG-71 in case of the F-14D) as it climbs to cruise between 80,000 ft and 100,000 ft at close to Mach 5. Utilizing its high altitude to gain kinetic energy, the missile dives toward its target and activates its terminal active radar system for the final phase of the flight. By comparison, the AMRAAM uses an on-board computer made possible by digital technology to compute a collision course to the target. It can be updated by the launching aircraft, before also using an active seeker in its final phase.</p>
<p>The AIM-54/AWG-9 combination was the first to have multiple track capability (up to 24 targets) and launch (up to six Phoenix can be launched nearly simultaneously) the large 1,000 lb missile equipped with a conventional warhead. The airframe is a scaled-up version of the USAF <a href="../../../a/i/m/AIM-47_Falcon_1ab1.html" title="AIM-47 Falcon">AIM-47 Falcon</a> with 4 cruciform fins. 4 can be carried under the fuselage tunnel attached to special aerodynamic pallets, and 1 under each glove station. A full load of 6 Phoenix missiles and the unique launch rails weigh over over 8,000 lb, about twice the weight of Sparrows, so it was more common to carry a mixed load of 2 Phoenix, 3 Sparrow and 2 Sidewinder missiles. Depending on the source, there are reports that an F-14 could not be recovered on a carrier with all six missiles, but only two or four.</p>

<p>The Phoenix was designed to defend the Carrier Battle Group against a variety of threats including cruise missiles and its range and loiter capability provided defense in depth. During the height of the Cold War, the threat included regimental-size raids of Badger and Backfire bombers equipped with high-speed cruise missiles and considerable Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) of various types. The upgraded Phoenix, the AIM-54C, was developed to better counter projected threats from tactical aircraft and cruise missiles and its final upgrade included a re-programmable memory capability to keep pace with emerging threat ECM. It is thought that the Phoenix was based on the similar <a href="../../../a/i/m/AIM-47_a21c.html" title="AIM-47">AIM-47</a> missile. The AIM-47 was developed for the experimental Mach 3 <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_YF-12_ac76.html" title="Lockheed YF-12">Lockheed YF-12</a> interceptor version of their venerable <a href="../../../s/r/-/SR-71_Blackbird_d4d3.html" title="SR-71 Blackbird">SR-71 Blackbird</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Air_Force_5fa2.html" title="US Air Force">US Air Force</a> adopted neither the AIM-47, nor the AIM-54, operationally. The Air Force had no similar capability with the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-15_Eagle_89ec.html" title="F-15 Eagle">F-15 Eagle</a> until the introduction of the <a href="../../../a/i/m/AIM-120_AMRAAM_26ef.html" title="AIM-120 AMRAAM">AIM-120 AMRAAM</a>. The latest model, AIM-120C-5, has a range of 65 miles (110 km), still significantly less than the retired AIM-54.</p>
<p>The associated AWG-9 radar system carried by the F-111B and F-14 Tomcat was the largest and most powerful ever fitted to a fighter.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Despite the much-vaunted capabilities, the Phoenix was rarely used in combat, with only two confirmed launches and no confirmed targets destroyed in US Naval service.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The USAF F-15 Eagle had responsibility for overland Combat Air Patrol (CAP) duties in <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert_Storm_ee3e.html" title="Desert Storm">Desert Storm</a> in 1991, primarily because of the onboard F-15 IFF capabilities; the Tomcat did not have the requisite IFF capability mandated by the JFACC to satisfy the Rules of Engagement (ROE) in order to utilize the Phoenix capability at Beyond Visual Range (BVR). From an engineering and service standpoint, the Phoenix could be said to be a notable success. However, as the only surviving member of the Falcon missile family, it was not adopted by any other nation besides <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>; any other US armed service, or even supported by any other aircraft. It was heavy, large, expensive and not practical in close combat compared to the Sparrow or AMRAAM.</p>

<p>Little to nothing is known about Iran's use of its seventy-nine F-14A Tomcats (delivered prior to 1979) in most western outlets, the exception being a book released by Osprey Publishing titled "Iranian F-14 Tomcats in Combat" authored by Tom Cooper and Farzad Bishop<a href="http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_452.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_452.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Most of the following accounts are based on the research contained in this book, possibly the only book devoted solely to the topic of Iranian F-14s.</p>
<p>Reports of use of the 285 missiles supplied to Iran <a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0077.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0077.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> during the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran-Iraq_War_b457.html" title="Iran-Iraq War">Iran-Iraq War</a>, from 1980–88 vary. US technical personnel report that they sabotaged the aircraft and weapons before they left the country following the 1979 <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Revolution_81d3.html" title="Iranian Revolution">Iranian Revolution</a>, making it impossible to fire the missile. However, the IRIAF was able to repair the sabotage and the damage only affected a limited number of planes; not the entire fleet.</p>
<p>Some western sources claim that it is unlikely that the Phoenix was used operationally. First, as difficult as the missile and fire control systems were to operate, Iran had hired many American technicians. Upon leaving, they took most of the knowledge about how to operate and maintain these complex weapon systems with them. Also, without a steady supply of engineering support from Hughes Aircraft Missile Systems Group and corresponding spares and upgrades, even a technically competent operator would have extreme difficulty fielding operational weapons. Iran had, indeed, aggressively pursued spares for their planes in the years following the revolution.</p>
<p>Most less informed sources claim that the primary use of the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-14.html" title="F-14">F-14</a> was as an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airborne_early_warning.html" title="Airborne early warning">airborne early warning</a> aircraft, guarded by other fighters.</p>
<p>However, in reality the IRIAF used the F-14s actively as a fighter-interceptor and at times escort fighter with the AIM-54 scoring 60-70 kills. F-14s were often used to protect IRIAF tankers supporting strike packages into Iraq, and scanned over the border with their radars, often engaging detected Iraqi flights. Also, some F-14s were modified into specialized <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airborne_early_warning.html" title="Airborne early warning">airborne early warning</a> aircraft.</p>
<p>Supporters of these claims point to the fact that, in the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_bc7b.html" title="Gulf War">1991 Gulf War</a>, Iraqi fighter pilots consistently turned and fled as soon as American F-14 pilots turned on their fighters' very distinctive <a href="../../../a/n/2F/AN_AWG-9_d04c.html" title="AN/AWG-9">AN/AWG-9</a> radars, which suggests that Iraqi pilots had learned to avoid the F-14. The counter-argument is that virtually all Iraqi fighters turned and fled when confronted, regardless of the type of aircraft facing them, although the USAF had much better success engaging Iraqi fighters with their <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-15.html" title="F-15">F-15</a> Eagles in the same vicinity where Tomcats operated.</p>
<p>During the entry of the F-14 and AIM-54 into Iranian service, the Shah ordered live-firing exercises with AIM-54s. The exercise was targeted against the Soviet Union, who was flying <a href="../../../m/i/g/MiG-25_597f.html" title="MiG-25">MiG-25</a> recon sorties over Iran. Five AIM-54s were shot at AQL-34 target drones, two flying Mach 2 at 60,000 feet. Four missiles hit the targets. After the exercise the Soviets approached Iran and both sides reached agreement, that allowed the tensions to de-escalate, avoiding further conflicts between the two states.</p>
<p>On 16th September 1980, Iranian F-14s were vectored against a fast-moving contact, approaching Khark oil terminals at Mach 3. The MiG-25 was shot down by an AIM-54. This was the first confirmed kill by F-14 against MiG-25s.</p>
<p>On the same day, another MiG-25RB was shot down in extremely hard conditions. The MiG-25 was approaching fast and was already within 113 km, yet the F-14 RIO was unable to acquire the target. A positive lock-on was made at a distance of only 70 km, almost inside the minimum range for this type of look-up shot against a high-speed target. A single AIM-54 was launched in snap-up engagement mode at 64 km. The missile worked perfectly and the MiG was downed.</p>
<p>On 2nd December 1980 one of the closest range shoot=downs by AIM-54 occurred. Captain F. Dehghan of the 8th TFS was flying on patrol covering Khark Island oil teminals, when a number of approaching bogies were detected. Lock-on was attained only from a distance of 10 miles, too close to the minimum range of the missile. The F-14 had to use the Phoenix, though, as otherwise the plane would have been too heavy for dogfighting. The Phoenix was launched in short-range active mode and it managed to hit a MiG-21.</p>
<p>At 20th November 1982, two Iraqi generals boarded an Mi-8 helicopter to visit the front lines. The Mi-8 was escorted by two other Mi-8s, an Mi-25, four MiG-21s and four MiG-23s, that were replaced by additional fighters when they ran low on fuel. The formation was spotted by two Iranian Tomcats escorting an IRIAF KC-707 tanker, which was waiting for an Iranian F-4 strike to refuel. The F-14s were flying a race-track pattern, scanning over the front line with their AWG-9 radar. Captain Khosrodad spotted a large number of targets approaching slowly from the west, already within AIM-54 range. Khosrodad ordered his wingman to keep with the tanker and attacked, first firing two AIM-54s, then two AIM-7E-4s some 10 seconds later. According to Iraqi reports, one MiG-21 and two MiG-23s were shot down within a minute, forcing the Iraqi generals to abandon their mission.</p>
<p>On 20th February 1987, an IRIAF F-4 lured an Iraqi strike force into a trap, which was ambushed by two F-14s of the 81st TFS. An AIM-54 was launched at very long range, hitting the lead Mirage flown by IrAF Brig. General Hekmat Abdul-Qadr. The Iranian listening posts recorded the leader of the accompanying Su-22 flight scream "F-Arba-Ashara! Yalla! Yalla!" with the seven remaining fighters turning and fleeing. In English the leader had called "F-14! Run! Run!"</p>
<p>During late 1987, the Soviet Union supplied Iraq with MiG-25BM "Wild Weasel" aircraft. The planes tested the ECM systems against Iranian Tomcats and attacked Iranian targets with new anti-radar weapons. The MiG-25BMs proved they could operate with impunity at up to 69,000 ft, until on the night of 11th November a MiG-25BM was intercepted by an F-14. The Tomcat fired a single AIM-54 in Home-On-Jam mode. The missile guided flawlessly but failed to detonate. Yet, the missile clipped the MiG-25's fin and forced the pilot to bail out.</p>
<p>During March 1988, Iraq launched a major attack against Iranian oil exports. On 19th March, at 0100, the first wave of Iraqi Tu-22B heavy bombers and Mirage fighters, attacked Khark island and the tankers. Half an hour later, a second wave arrived without losses. The Iranian F-14s had arrived on scene for the third wave, though. The US Navy warships patrolling on the area recorded several AIM-54 launches, with at least one Tu-22B bomber and a MiG-25RB being destroyed. According to the US Navy, it is probable that other Iraqi bombers were shot down as well.</p>
<p>During the ending phase of the Iran-Iraq war, a mini war developed between the Iraqi Mirage F1 EQ-5/6 units and the Iranian F-14s between February and July 1988. The F1 pilots hunted the Tomcats aggressively and attacked the Iranians at any occasion. The F1EQ-6s were equipped with good ECM systems, and the Iraqi pilots could deny the F-14s from using their AIM-54 missiles. For example on 19th July 1988 four Mirages attacked two F-14s and downed both, suffering no losses.</p>
<p>The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force was able to keep its F-14 fighters and AIM-54 missiles in regular use during the whole of the Iran-Iraq war, though periodic lack of spares grounded at times large parts of the fleet. - At worst, during late 1987, the stock of AIM-54 missiles was at its lowest, with less than 50 operational missiles available. The missiles needed fresh thermal batteries that could only be purchased from the USA. Iran managed finally to find a clandestine buyer that supplied the Iranians with batteries - though those did cost up to 10,000 USD each. Iran did receive spares and parts for both the F-14s and AIM-54s from various sources during the Iran-Iraq war, and has received more spares after the conflict.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Iran started a heavy industrial program to build spares for the planes and missiles<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> and although there are claims that it no longer relies on outside sources to keep its F-14s and AIM-54s operational, there is evidence that Iran continues to procure parts clandestinely. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>It is estimated that during the Iran-Iraq war 1980-1988, from reports from pilots on both sides, guncamera/TISEO films, examination of wreckage, local and foreign intelligence and other sources, that on total the IRIAF F-14As scored 130 confirmed and 23 probable aerial victories. Iran launched possibly 70 to 90 AIM-54A missiles, and 60-70 of those scored. In one instance four Iraqi fighters were shot down by a single Phoenix. Twice two Iraqi fighters were destroyed with a single missile.</p>
<p>All in all, almost 90% of the AIM-54A missiles fired by Iranian F-14s in combat were used against Iraqi fighters and fighter-bombers. Only about a dozen victories by AIM-54s were against fast, high-flying targets like MiG-25s or Tu-22s. This performance was surprising, especially as the missile was designed for fleet defence, against large targets, not nimble fighters.</p>
<p>Iranian F-14 pilot, Major Ali, made the following conclusion from the Iranian use of F-14s and Phoenix missiles:</p>
<p>"When I look back at our service record with the jet I look beyond its exceptional performance as purely an interceptor. We used it to escort fighters and tankers and flew many radar-reconnaissance missions as mini-AWACS for the protection of others in the air and on the ground. No air defence system has even proven so effective."</p>
<p>Iranian F-14 pilots also regularly engaged enemy forces in traditional dogfights, using their cannon and Sidewinder missiles to good effect.</p>
