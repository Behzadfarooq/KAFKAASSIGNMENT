<p>Wikipedia is a new type of media and it can't be stuck in the quagmire of old paradigms. In a paper encyclopedia, it's not reasonable to expect to get first hand testimony of events, though such things would probably be nice. Wikipedia, however, can expect first hand communication: the person who invented this new device can actually come here and make a page. Do you demand that he first write a magazine article and then reference that article? Why? Why not just let him come here and type it up first hand and cut out the middle man?</p>
<p>The only vandalism I see on that page is you going there to cut out the history of the word simply because the guy who has first hand knowledge of it is the one who wrote the article! Let's see someone show up and actually dispute the origin with another first hand account before we call it "disputed". -- TheCynic</p>
<p>Perhaps you should take your crusade over to the Wikipedia <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">Wiki</a> entry. Clearly, such a first hand account as "WikiWiki" on a train station sign being the origin of "Wiki" is, as you have just proven, not worthy of a Wikipedia entry and should be removed. All it should take is one person saying "I dispute that" and we can remove it from the encyclopedia and leave people in utter ignorance as to where the term "Wiki" started. Good plan. Get right on that.</p>
<p>In reality, saying "I dispute it" is nonsense unless you have a source. We have 1 concrete source (the original author) and a potential source (the original Usenet discussion, assuming it's archived somewhere). You have nothing. You can't go around "disputing" Wikipedia entries based on nothing but being cranky, or if you are going to do that, why not start with official Wikipedia entries, or is that dog too big for you to bark at? --TheCynic 20:20, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're a master of reading the letter of the law without comprehending the spirit of the law. The same rules that keep the main waterways clear can choke off the narrow inlets -- areas where not much information is available and now there's even less, thanks to you. This should be a repository of information and you do it harm by deleting information. Once again, I suggest thinking about what the rules are meant to accomplish. Think with your head.--TheCynic 05:15, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Think with yours. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information, let alone the non-information of the sort that your passage describes.</dd>

<dd>The purpose of an encyclopedia is to summarise human knowledge. As far as can be discerned, the events in your passage did not happen, and there is nobody on the planet who thinks or believes they happened, apart from you. There might be more than one person who thinks that the passage is true, but you're curiously reluctant to actually point to any evidence that this is the case. Did you just make the passage up off the top of your head or something?</dd>

<dd>The salient facts of the article boil down to this:</dd>
<dd>"Someone on the internet says he remembers that 10 years ago, there was a usenet post, that can't be found, that said some anonymous guy remembers how some students in lab concocted a word that sounded like the word that the article's about, but had a different meaning."</dd>

<dd>Really, that's not the sort of 'knowledge' or 'information' that's worth inflicting on anyone. Who on the planet needs to know what you vaguely remember or don't remember? Who cares what some anonymous person says on Usenet, where posts are eminently fakeable and drivel is plentiful? The Wikipedia rules are designed, both in letter and in spirit, to keep worthless crap like this out of the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../a/i/m/User%7EAim_Here_37ff.html" title="User:Aim Here">Aim Here</a> 09:31, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"The purpose of an encyclopedia is to summerise human knowledge". So stop deleting the human knowledge that you arbitrarily disagree with. If YOU have a different account of the origin of the word that you would like to share, then as is the case with <i>MANY</i> Wikipedia entries, both accounts can be included. Just because you decide that the holocaust didn't happen doesn't mean you can delete the Wikipedia entry on it, either. Produce evidence to the contrary or stop vandalizing the encyclopedia.

I believe the more applicable rule is this one: <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/m/User_talk%7EAim_Here_774b.html" title="Edit section: Esker Melchior Deletion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Esker Melchior Deletion</span></h3>
<p>Can you explain why you speed-deleted this page? You cite 'attack' as the reason, but who is it an attack on? Esker Melchior is a genuine (and very funny) example of a Yahoo Troll. I suppose, for an overworked Wiki admin, the article's example of an Esker rant with reference to LIE-NUX COMMIES would trigger some sort of recognition reflex with the example of a personal attack on the Speedy deletion page, since they're both written in <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leet_speak.html" title="Leet speak">Leet speak</a>.</p>
<p>But read the article again. It's not an attack in the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Speed-deletion</a> sense.</p>
<p>If you're seriously suggesting that the article is an attack on Esker by mentioning his poor spelling and grammar then you've completely missed the point of Esker. The bad spelling and grammar is intentional.</p>
<p>If you think that the diatribe against LIE-NUX COMMIES or whatever (I forget which Esker gem was put on this page) was just some sly way of inserting an attack on them on Wikipedia, then again, you've missed thepoint of Esker. Esker is actually making his own inimitable mockery of the arguments of the anti-Linux crowd.</p>
<p>If you think the article was just a way of smuggling an attack on SCO by quoting a full example of a satirical post (the closest to the truth), then you have to remember that's all Esker does - it's hard to talk about him without mentioning the fact that he's a satirical jibe at the actions of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_SCO_Group_b11e.html" title="The SCO Group">The SCO Group</a> and it's dwindling band of supporters. Anyways, that's surely a matter for some sort of NPOV tribunal, not a speed-delete.</p>
<p>I don't see how this article fits into the 'attack' category. If you don't like the article, then 'non-notability' might be a better bet for a non-speedy delete, though there has been the odd instance of Esker getting notification by the mainstream press these days, so you may have a fight on your hands....</p>

OK, perhaps I was hasty in speedying it.

<p>I agree that the heroic dose is almost certainly an hoax but for the sake of due process:</p>
<ul>
<li>what was its previous title when it was deleted before</li>
<li>if it went to BJAODN, where did it go - BJAODN is rather big!</li>

<p>Hi there. To answer your questions</p>
<ul>
<li>what was its previous title when it was deleted before
<dl>
<dd>From the BJAODN page, it seems to be "Music:theheroicdose"</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>if it went to BJAODN, where did it go - BJAODN is rather big!

</dl>
</li>
<li>if it was nominated via the proposed deletion process (with which I am not familiar), why was it deleted within a few hours instead of five days?
<dl>
<dd>I don't know, I wasn't there when it was deleted. Perhaps someone else speedied it (I think that's allowed for previously deleted pages).</dd>

<p>Thanks very much. It was voted off by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Music%7Etheheroicdose_4ebf.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Music:theheroicdose">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Music:theheroicdose</a>. The original article claims they were <i>a heavy metal band from America</i>. The one you nominated claims they were <i>sociological researchers from the 1970's, researching in the south of England</i> but the list of villains is the same. It was not speedied - yours was the last edit - that is why I asked. Dunno why I am wasting my time on trash like that. But at least we have rounded up the antecedents. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 10:29, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a difference, I'm FROM CROATIA, AND KNOW A "LITTLE" BETTER ABOUT THIS, so called "controversy", and how it was managed in the media, and what is much more important, who did this articles about this skyer and why! And there's nothing to hear that "is unacceptable", only to remove what's pure propaganda and spread of hatred!</p>
<p>I had been enough of depicting Croats and Croatia as a pro-nazi state, and as a nationalists!</p>
<p>We're not au pair to some "democratic" and so called "liberal" countries in the matter of nationalism. It's enough to see what's been going on in a past few months in a France, Netherlands, Denmark etc...</p>
<dl>
<dd>None of that matters a toss to me. What matters with this article is whether the facts are verifiable and NPOV and encyclopedia-worthy. In this case, as the article stands, I reckon that's the case, although there may be more pertinent facts that I don't know about. I'm sure not all Croats are Nazis, but that's irrelevant. I've no real opinions on whether this particular sportsman is or not, either.

<p><b>This what I have been doing is to remove something that isn't true, and what's pointless to stay since Kostelić already denied this! Prolongation of this part of article is nothing else than insulting anyone who's fair and just, and is in a manner of cheapest tabloids!</b></p>
<p>Not to mention that this part of article is totally irrelevant from the point of sport! And, if you really do want a better Wiki, than you should remove something that is allready denied!</p>

<dd>Just because there's a denial doesn't mean it's not true. Even if it isn't, the fact that there were allegations is worth mentioning, as is his denial.

<p>I did not reffering to a BBC as a cheap tabloid- that is NACIONAL, but BBC published this exaggerated article ( of which reasons- I'm blank?!) as a verified "truth". It happens that I have watched HRT (Croatian television) on which Ivica not only denied this, yet called all that have been done by the nazis as a horror, and unthinkable evil! But, somehow BBC didn't find that necessary to publish- I wonder why! And something for the end, you know, you shouldn't consider all you see on BBC (or CNN) as a confirmed fact!!! BBC also had it's dark part in a bloody wars in EX YU!!!</p>
<p>MY PROBLEM- THERE'S NO NEED TO FOR THAT KIND OF REMARKS WHEN THEY'RE UNTRUE, AND CAN SERVE ONLY AS TO DEPICT IVICA IN A WRONG LIGT&#160;!</p>
<p><br />
<b>You know, you shouldn't consider all you see on BBC (or CNN) as a confirmed fact!!! BBC also had it's dark part in a bloody wars in EX YU!!!</b></p>
<p>If your facts are holding on a BBC broadcast, then you have a very cheap argument!!! And also, from my point of view this article end is a vandalism! You should think about that!</p>
<p>I don't think article is neutral, since it's making a "case" from something that's highly arbitrary. I don't know exactly when it was, but interwiew has been published on HRT with kostelić explaining things conserning this issue!</p>

<p>I have removed the following from the above article.</p>
<p>"The shootings were initially investigated by other members of the RUC, and the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland decided to bring prosecutions. At the first trial, relating to the shootings of the two INLA men, Constable John Robinson admitted to having been instructed to lie in his statements. The resulting public outcry caused RUC Chief Constable John Hermon to ask John Stalker to investigate the killings."</p>
<p>I have done a lot of reserach on this and have never come across any archival evidence relating or remeber this public outcry. So I think this assertion initailly looks POV. Can you provide background info so we can be sure this is accurate.</p>
<p>No offence is intended.</p>

<p>Hi there. That part of the article I merged/redirected from the old 'Stalker Inquiry' article, though I rephrased it since the original appeared to be a straight copy of this <a href="http://www.charter88.org.uk/publications/violations/lashmar2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.charter88.org.uk/publications/violations/lashmar2.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> on the Charter 88 website. I'm a little young to remember the exact timescale of the public outcry over the Stalker affair assassinations, but there was certainly a HUGE outcry at the time, whether it began after the initial court proceedings or after the Inquiry or after Stalker was suspended is something I can't recall. I remember deciding to shove it in because there was a gap in the article between the shootings and the suspension of John Stalker --<a href="../../../a/i/m/User%7EAim_Here_37ff.html" title="User:Aim Here">Aim Here</a> 00:16, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>just one note about the origin of the term "slipstream": I wrote to CoffeeCup software many weeks ago and never got a reply; we can't even ask the editor who put in the section, as we only have his/her I.P. address (07:13, 15 June 2005 68.118.126.104). Honestly, I don't think CoffeeCup has invented the term, and even if so, the practice to update a software without changing its version number is hideous. Better not even mentioning it&#160;:) Cheers --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGennaro_Prota_b0f2.html" title="User:Gennaro Prota">Gennaro Prota</a> 12:22, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I believe you were right about it all, Holroyd did allegations of a different type. In his book he only ties himself to Wallace after the fact.

<p>The vandalism to the Eric Red article that you recently reverted was almost certainly done by the same vandal (ip 71.107.255.200) that I (as 4.172.186.141--I wasn't signed in at the time) reverted a few weeks ago. This person (who may be Red or someone associated with him) clearly has an agenda and blatantly removes all mention of Eric Red's crime (as was done most recently) or attempts to "minimize" Red's guilt by deleting sourced references indicating that Red intentionally crashed into the billiards bar. This person should definitely receive a vandalism warning.</p>

<dd>Heh, yeah - the original vandal (Eric himself, perhaps?) was the reason I put the <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Red_1697.html" title="Eric Red">Eric Red</a> article on my watchlist. He had been quiet for a while so I didn't bother with any vandal warnings this time, but if he starts his nonsense up again, I'll certainly bring out the vandal templates. --<a href="../../../a/i/m/User%7EAim_Here_37ff.html" title="User:Aim Here">Aim Here</a> 19:35, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
