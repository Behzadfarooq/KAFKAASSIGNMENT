<p>Hi Tobias,</p>
<p>Recently you moved all articles about Mongolian aymags from ___ aymag to ___ Prefecture. However, I believe the standard translation of "aymag" used is "province". Both the CIA factbook and Statoids use this translation.</p>
<p>So do you think it's alright if I moved all of the aymag articles to ___ Province? Please let me know about any concerns or objections that you have.</p>
<p>Thanks -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 17:07, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>how would you call the historical units of Mongolia (<a href="../../../o/u/t/Outer_Mongolia_fe62.html" title="Outer Mongolia">Outer Mongolia</a>)? At that time Outer Mongolia (nowadays state of Mongolia) was itself a province.</li>
<li>statoids is <i>one</i> person</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefecture.html" title="Prefecture">prefecture</a> is also used in a lot of other countries, so it is not that bad english.</li>
<li>a lot of redirects exist, so it is more to edit then one might think (at least I was surprised&#160;;-))</li>
</ol>

</dl>
<p>But the CIA factbook certainly isn't one person. Also, certain common translations are arrived at for countries and you can't change them: Japan has prefectures, for example, and you can't just call them something else, like provinces, or states. (And I don't mind spending some time redirecting all the articles.. it wouldn't take that long&#160;;) )</p>
<p>Mongolia wasn't a province, btw. It was more of a "territory", controlled by a military governor. The only provinces of the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchu_Empire_86dd.html" title="Manchu Empire">Manchu Empire</a> were those in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China_proper.html" title="China proper">China proper</a> (if you don't count the aymags of Mongolia, of course&#160;;) )-- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 17:29, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then at first correct:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mongolia is divided into 21 aymags or provinces. Aimaq (also spelled aimag, and aimak) is the Mongolian word for province. Because Mongolia was a province of China though, it was divided into aimaqs (prefectures of the province of Outer Mongolia). Ths system was continued with even when independence was gained.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>would have saved lot of time, if this would have been correct before. As well it was said on one page <i>aymag is the mongolian term for prefecture</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>it seems you know more about this than me&#160;:-) nevertheless maybe wait a little. and then: fun editing it. (last week I moved a lot, puuh the worst were the database errors, that nearly doubled the time I spent on moving.</dd>

<dd>the wilaya are translated as province in other countries, so to call mintaqah the same is not that good. as far as i rememberat least one country has wilaya and mintaqah <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> 18:15, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think as long as there's consistency <i>within</i> each country then we should be fine. For example, the "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Commandery.html" title="Commandery">commanderies</a>" of ancient China, "<a href="../../../d/i/s/Districts_of_Japan_0d56.html" title="Districts of Japan">districts</a>" of Japan and "<a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_divisions_of_South_Korea_eb94.html" title="Administrative divisions of South Korea">counties</a>" of Korea are all translations of the same word: 郡. In Chinese, Japanese and Korean the same term is used to refer to all three.

<dl>
<dd>I wasn't exactly expecting 4-6 redirects per page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I fixed the re-redirects on the last aymags. But as stated above, without fixing the related articles the aymag stuff is inconsistent now.

<dd>I did not thank you yet, for what you wrote about 郡 - I would have liked to be different&#160;;-) (i.e. no differences in translation).

<p>It's a bit of a pain when the same thing has a few different names depending on which part of history you're talking about. Take a look at <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_of_China_38df.html" title="County of China">county of China</a> (<i>xian</i>) and <a href="../../../z/h/o/Zhou_%28political_division%29.html" title="Zhou (political division)">zhou (political division)</a>. Not only do they have several different translations depending on what kind of literature you're reading, they <i>both</i> use the term "prefecture" in a historical context, which is also used in the modern context to refer to <i>another</i> administrative division of China, the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefecture_of_China_80d5.html" title="Prefecture of China">prefecture of China</a>. (<i>diqu</i>)</p>
<p>When this happens I guess we'll have to use our discretion. What do you think should be done with the prefectures of Mongolia? Are they actually referred to that way in a historical context? -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 19:27, Mar 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for this clarification.</p>
<p>But what really takes my nerves, that you are not correcting the inconsistency you created. <b>Because Mongolia was a province of China though, it was divided into aimaqs (prefectures of the province of Outer Mongolia). This system was continued with even when independence was gained.</b></p>
<p>I would like to do it, but I do not know what Mongolia was, beside a special territory. And maybe it can also be clarified whether whole Mongolia or or only Outer Mongolia or both Mongolias were special territorries with adding the chinese words for it.</p>
<p>I really dislike inconsistency because they can cost people lot of time, e.g. me, who moved the aymags to prefectures because of this wrong statement. If it will be there some more time I am going to delete this info completly. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> 01:59, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There was never a "province of Outer Mongolia". There was a land called Outer Mongolia, overseen by a general, divided into ayimaghs and banners. This was different from China proper with its provinces, prefectures, departments, and counties.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../b/a/n/Banner_%28Inner_Mongolia%29_ef1b.html" title="Banner (Inner Mongolia)">Banner (Inner Mongolia)</a> also mentions ayimaghs.</dd>

<p>...&#160;:-) now I can sleep better&#160;;-) You solved it in a good way, not saying anything about status, beside domination.

I started a template <a href="../../../s/u/b/Template%7ESubnational_entity_23da.html" title="Template:Subnational entity">Template:Subnational_entity</a>, I will certainly have a look on chinese entities, because it seems some people really put afford in organizing the series there. BTW the only articles that use singular are "county of china" and not plural like "provinces of someland".

<p>Hey Tobias, I was just wondering why you moved the article of <a href="../../../a/y/m/Aymguud_of_Mongolia_ffb6.html" title="Aymguud of Mongolia">Aymguud of Mongolia</a> to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_of_Mongolia_21f0.html" title="Provinces of Mongolia">Provinces of Mongolia</a>? The rest of the articles do not cross-reference the use of 'province' - nor is it an overall term. Aymag (singular, or "aymguud" for plural) is the proper terminology and is fully acceptable to use within Wiki rules (see the use of "oblast" with the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_divisions_of_Ukraine_9310.html" title="Administrative divisions of Ukraine">Administrative divisions of Ukraine</a>. I do not necessarily contest this move, however, I feel that if this is to stay as such you must alter the related articles to reflect the use of 'province' (with proper reference to 'aymug'). Thanks! <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 20:56, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tobias - these are technically not called translations, they are transliterations (due to the different alphabet use). In the case where there isn't a translation of sorts (like provincia to province), sometimes it is best to use the local (or unique) version. If <i>Aymguud</i> doesn't seem correct, then <i>Aymug</i> or its equivalent should be used (in your example of the Russian oblast<b>s</b>). The statoids quote above is one that I agree doesn't hold water - I have personally found that, at times, statoids data is old or incorrect. A better reference is the use by the UN (for official use) or CIA (for semi-translated). I just think it's proper to use a correct term rather than one that is 'perceived' to be correct. But so is the spirit of Wiki - to find the 'consensus'. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 14:52, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why you, RareLibra, are transliterating plural form, but not singular? Do you believe usual wikireader knows mongolian grammar? Do you know mongolian grammar? And then why you are creating new mongolian word "sumuud"? In Mongolian Wiki plural form of "sum" is "Сумд" ("sumd" in transliteration). Even native mongolians when they are writing in English use English grammar instead of Mongolian (no sumuud and aymguud). It is not a good idea to use foreign grammar, to my opinion. Bogomolov.PL 16:00, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am no expert on Mongolia. I contribute to Wikipedia where there is missing information - in this case, the 2nd administrative level of Mongolia. When I first created the page, it read "Somon of Mongolia", based on the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_%28subnational_entity%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_%28subnational_entity%29" rel="nofollow">subnational entity page</a> where I saw the plural was supposed to be "somon". If you look at Statoids.com, he lists the plural as "soums" or "sooms" or "sums". I was contacted by someone on my talk page about the fact that the word "somon" was incorrect, and that "sumuud" <i>is</i> correct. This is why I then corrected it to show "sumuud" instead of "somon". As far as the singular form, the singular form is still "sum".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do I know Mongolian grammar? Of course not - or I would annotate such on my user page. You state the plural form of "sum" is "Сумд", but the subnational entity page states it as "Сумууд" or "Sumuud". So if you are giving me a hard time for using the plural term listed on the English wiki subnational entity article, I would ask why you do not go there first to correct it? If there are errors, please state this so we can go about correcting this. Am I understanding that you are saying the correct transliterated plural of "sum" to be "sumd"? Or is it just "sums"? And the correct transliterted plural of "aymag" to be "Aymd"? Or is that also just "Ayms"?</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Note that Statoids.com also states that the next level of administration (below the sumuud) are "bags" (rural) and "horoos" (urban). If this is not correct, we can find the correct word/translation/transliteration to use... once I work on obtaining map information for that level of administration. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 16:38, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, both forms "Sumuud" and "Sumd" are correct and used next to each other, with the former being more regular as far as I understand the systematics of the grammar. In everyday talk even "Sumguud" is used, although that's not technically correct. I was responsible for the previous "Somon", which is not Mongolian but Russian grammar (and used in the russian oblasts Buryatia and Tuva). When I found out my error, I tried to start a <a href="../../../s/u/m/Talk%7ESum_%28country_subdivision%29_d3ab.html" title="Talk:Sum (country subdivision)">discussion</a> about which form to use, but didn't see any echo. Since the correct mongolian plural "Aimguud" was already in use, Rarelibra (I think) then started to change "Somon" to "Sumuud" as well in some articles, and I followed to fix the rest.</dd>

<dd>This means that the current titles are technically correct, but they may or may not be the forms we want to use. If there really is a standard (guideline?) to use english plurals, then we can of course switch to Aymags, Sums, and Bags (the mongolian plural of "Bag" is "Baga", btw.) In the cities there are Duregs and Horoos, not sure about the mongolian plural forms there. I recently updated the relevant entry <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_of_administrative_country_subdivisions_by_country.html" title="Table of administrative country subdivisions by country">here</a>, but it's still formally inconsistent. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 17:37, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is it so critically for English Wiki which mongolian plural form is correct? This question belongs to Mongolians. Only Mongolians will find the correct definition, or not - it will be Mongolian grammar problem. My intention is to use in Enlish language native (English!) grammar. Or we will use "goviyn nature" instead of "govi nature" (suffix "iyn" creates adjective form from substantive) Bogomolov.PL 07:32, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My standpoint is -</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>1. grammar is concrete language part (Mongolian, English, Polish etc)</p>
<p>2. certain language uses only its grammar - in English is not in use Mongolian or Polish suffixes: znamię (birthmark)singular; znami<i>ona</i> (birthmarks)plural. Birthmark<i>ona</i> - it is not correct in English.</p>
<p>3. When instead of provinces we are using aymag and when county we are naming sum - from this time English vocabulary has two mongolian origin words more (loan words, adoptions). Adoptions are in use in English text using English grammar (and vice versa: in Polish language are English origin adoptions declined using Polish grammar rules - <i>komputer</i> (computer)singular; <i>komputery</i> (computers)plural).</p>
<p>4. Very useful is in encyclopaedia (adoption!) in parentheses (adoption!) note Mongolian plural form. But (under tradition) foreign words are adopted in singular form: pogrom (sing.)from Russian, not pogromy (plural).</p>
<p>5. If we are not speakers of Mongolian we are not competent to decide what Mongolian grammar form is correct. But this polymophism we need only to note in parentheses.</p>

<p>Yes, mission complete. 16-color PNG from vectorized map (MicroStation), transformed from cone projection(source) to Mercator with true scales at 48 parallel and true northigs along meridians. All rasters have same scale (if sb wants - can collect and mosaic, mb it will be helpful add BL crosses?). General sums map is of course in two versions - every sum painted with different color (6 colors, no adjacent sums filled with the same color), blue lakes and black borders - and b/w outline map. No offence, but sumuud and aymguud are not acceptable in any language exept Mongolian. Why you pretend that Wikipedia article naming question has no sens? Tylko staram się panu(czy pani) wyperswadować istotność tej kwestii, bo pan(pani) tworzy w Wikipedii artykuły z niewyłumaczalnymi z każdego punktu widzenia nazwami, uporczywie używa tych neologizmów w tekstach Wikipedii. To nie wydaje się kwestją czysto lingwistyczną, to się tyczy rzeczy bardzo a to bardzo istotnych - zasad tworzenia Wikipedii. Gdy wytaczam argumenty, moim zdaniem sensowne, co słyszę od autora(autorki) aymguudów - odczep się pan, nie zawracaj głowy. Niestety, używanie w języku angelskim angelskiej gramatyki uważam za słuszne. Czy argumentów z pana(pani) strony zabrakło?

<p>Latebird - Bogomolov wrote in Polish because he tried to hide his words. Maybe he didn't notice that I speak Polish. He is saying that he cannot argue about topics/aspects with me because I do not know the rules for creating wikipedia. He also states that I do not know the names, and that my arguments do not make sense, and he is ordering me not to do this.</p>
<p>Bogomolov - now I am going to tell you two things. First, if you claim expertise in the area of Mongolian maps and names, SHARE IT to improve the article (with the proper references and sources, of course). Second, do not simply offer up criticisms or insults ... because no matter what language you attempt to do so, you are still in violation of wikipedia rules, and you can very quickly be banned because of this. Do you understand what I am saying? If you wish to converse in your language, by all means I can read it and translate it. But if you turn to insults and such, you are not doing the article or wikipedia any good. Just so you know, Bogomolov, that we have a little history with this article here. If your input is simply from looking at a couple of maps and seeing names, that is one thing. If you come at us with proper sources of names (and boundaries), etc. looking to help correct things, that is another thing. If you notice how Latebird approached the topic, he notified me of errors and offered up possibilities to work at correcting the errors (and improving the article). There were not insults or words exchanged between us, other than words to search for finding the corrections for the article. You state that you have created new maps with the correct borders/boundaries for the Sumuud... do you wish to post those maps to update the maps for the Sumuud? If so, let's get it done and improve the article. If you want me to do the updates with the maps I already have in place, then let me know where we can exchange the updated information you have. If you are merely attempting to criticize the name of Aymguud and Sumuud... what is your suggestion for such names, for the proper transliteration to English? Don't get hung up with statements about how 'only Mongolians' can offer input. This is English Wikipedia, and there are well-knowledged individuals here that can offer up solutions on various topics. So if we follow along the same lines of such logic, you yourself (being native Polish) cannot offer any input on the topic, either. So this is what I mean by "not making sense". Start offering up solutions and sources. Thanks! <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 15:00, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Back to the topic at hand: I'm very glad that we'll get correct maps now. Rarelibra was unlucky to rely on outdated material, but he still gets the honor of having started the process. Any chance that you could produce SVG files from MicroStation? This is the optimal format for this type of map on WP, and would make it a lot easier to translate them to other languages without losing quality or investing a lot of work. Unfortunately (because it's duplicated work), <a href="../../../../de/y/a/a/User%7EYaan_60a7.html" class="extiw" title="de:User:Yaan">de:User:Yaan</a> has just corrected the <a href="../../../../de/h/o/v/Bild%7EHovsgol_sumuud.png_4087.html" class="extiw" title="de:Bild:Hovsgol_sumuud.png">map for Hovsgol</a> manually in the german language Wikipedia, although still untranslated.

<dd>I'm not native Polish, I was trying communicate with Rarelibra using this language. My mistake.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In personal data Rarelibra clame one of his languages Polish. For me more easy to explain my opinion not in English, but in Polish, sorry. I didn't want to hide, but better explain my opinion. Dear Latebird, I will try to translate in my poor English what I'd said in Polish: "I am only trying to convince you of this question importance, because you are creating in Wikipedia articles from every point of view with nontraslateable names, consistently use this neologisms in Wikipedia texts. This is not only lingustic question, but relates very important things - principles of Wikipedia creation. When I reason my opinion with arguments, in my judgment, sensible, what I here wrom aymguud author side - disengage me, stop importune me. Don't you have arguments? I am sure you have, because I am sure you are making decisions only after serious reflection." End of translation. Feel the difference. My intention is to achieve consensus, what means I'm ready for my opinion changing if strong arguments will come from Rarelibra side. That is why I'm not changing aymguud and sumuud into aymags and sums - this act will be against Wikipedia consensus principles, isn't it? I am not any Wikihooligan, I just want to here other side arguments, but... You whant ban me? You don't like my opinion - discuss with me, this is discussion page. This is my understanding of Wiki principles. Imagine - I'm changing aymguud into aymags, but Rarelibra switch them back and so on. Only when we will be able to find consensus, and only if this decision will differ from aymguud/sumuud changes in Wiki are possible. Until this moment everything stays in present form.</p>
<p>About "only Mongolians". As you remember, I noted that in Mongolian Wiki sums are named sumd, not sumuud. I never say - I know truth, because only my opinion is true. I'm putting questions only. If several plural forms are acceptable - OK. But not me, not you will decide what form is correct in Mongolian language. Here, in English Wiki we can leave this problem (mb for Mongolians it is not any problem?) in parenthesis. I think it is much better use wery short and well known English suffix for plurals, but not Mongolian (not well known for Nonmongolians).</p>
<p>About "somon". Somon is singular form in Russian.</p>
<p>About SVG maps in MicroStation. I don't know this conversion in MS, but mb it will be in new XM version? If sb knows how to create SVG from DGN - help us.</p>
<p>Hövsgöl aymag map - only Chandman<b>i</b>-Öndör (Чандмань-Өндөр) transliteration had lost "ь" (transliterated officially "ǐ", but on Rarelibra and my maps "i"). My maps is possible have same type errors. I just put files into Wiki Mongolia_Arhangay_2005_sum.png etc for all aymags Bogomolov.PL 10:38, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>God, this is frustrating. Bogomolov... do you understand what I am saying? I don't think so. I am ASKING you ... WHAT IS THE CORRECT TERMINOLOGY (both singular and plural) FOR THE AYMAG AND SUM IN <b>ENGLISH</b>? You keep trying to correct it... so what is the correct terminology? Tell us, provide a source, and we will correct it - and move the articles to the proper form. We are not trying to keep you from edits... we are asking you to clarify... As for the maps, if you are creating them in Microstation, if you cannot do it in SVG format, simply create them in PNG. Or can you send me the raw files in Microstation format? I can quickly translate them to MapInfo and update the maps. Would this be possible?

<dd>Lemme jump in with a suggestion: why not use "Province" and "District" respectively, and mention the native terms (аймаг and сум) the first time in the article where they're mentioned? Besides, Mongolian Goverment seems to use the word "district" <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=District+site%3Agov.mn&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=District+site%3Agov.mn&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> themselves. While I don't particularly like overly broad application of <a href="../../../u/e/_/WP%7EUE_8b64.html" title="WP:UE">WP:UE</a> guideline, this seems like a natural choice, and it's the format most other countries follow (i.e. translate their subdivision terms into the most appropriate English ones (cf. <a href="../../../d/i/s/Districts_of_Serbia_b70c.html" title="Districts of Serbia">Districts of Serbia</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/States_of_Germany_65c0.html" title="States of Germany">States of Germany</a>), except when the native term already had a certain prominence in English (<a href="../../../o/b/l/Oblasts_of_Russia_8255.html" title="Oblasts of Russia">Oblasts of Russia</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voivodeships_of_Poland_fde0.html" title="Voivodeships of Poland">Voivodeships of Poland</a>).

<dd>Duja - when properly referenced as a subnational entity, it is preferred to use the correct entity name, instead of an 'assumed' form (see the use of raion in the Ukraine, for example). I would rather use the native transliterated form, and we seemed to have agreed on using Aymags of Mongolia and Sums of Mongolia. I guess we could always put this up for a vote. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 14:45, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I've never thought I'd pull <a href="../../../u/e/_/WP%7EUE_8b64.html" title="WP:UE">WP:UE</a> myself in the discussion, but there's always the first time <code>:-)</code>. I'd always support (and have supported) "correct entity name" in <i>proper</i> names such as <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>/<a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay.html" title="Bombay">Bombay</a>, <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gda%C5%84sk.html" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a>/<a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzig.html" title="Danzig">Danzig</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jarom%C3%ADr_J%C3%A1gr_8f74.html" title="Jaromír Jágr">Jaromír Jágr</a>/<a href="../../../j/a/r/Jaromir_Jagr_12cb.html" title="Jaromir Jagr">Jaromir Jagr</a>, but applying it to <i>terms</i> which have proper English translation/equivalent seems like overdoing it. I'm talking about <i>benefit to the reader</i>: when I see "Arhangay Province" or "Whatever district" I'd get a fairly good idea what's that, but not when I see something utterly unfamiliar such as "Arhangay aymag" or "sum". Plus, there is an apparent problem with plurals and grammar. If I wrote the guideline about subnational entities, it would read "use the English form which is used by the country government in English texts". I know that's the case with e.g. <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voivodeship.html" title="Voivodeship">Voivodeships</a> in Poland, and I assume it's also the case with Russian Oblasts, to name a few.

<dd>Mongolian authorities always use "Aymag" in english language text, and never "Province". There's quite a number of countries where the subdivisions are listed under some local name, of which many (eg. arrondissements, departments, cantons, woredas, fraziones, barangays, voivodeships, oblasts, okrugs, krais, comarcas, etc.) have no good english language equivalent. So your argument, as far as I understand it, is not entirely consistent, and seems to overstretch <a href="../../../u/e/_/WP%7EUE_8b64.html" title="WP:UE">WP:UE</a> a bit beyond its intendet purpose. There is no actual problem with grammar, as you'll find if you read the discussion on "Plural forms" below. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 11:57, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Input from Mars is always welcome! According to Google, and trying to filter out WP clones, it seems that in english language texts "Aymag" is used more often than "Province" (compare <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22selenge+province%22+-wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22selenge+province%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> vs. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22selenge+aymag%22+-wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22selenge+aymag%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). I would expect printed publications to show a similar distribution. For what it's worth, Aymag has its semantical origin in the word for "tribe", which is quite different to the notion of "subordinate territory" (provincia) in ancient rome, so one is not really a translation of the other. It also seems that most other language versions use a transcription of the mongolian term. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 16:31, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rarelibra, I think you're the only native english speaker here, so maybe you need to afford some patience with potential misunderstandings.

<p>As far as I can tell, the relevant guidelines don't say anything about foreign language plurals, so they were probably not meant to happen.

<p>If at all possible, I would strongly prefer SVG maps, even if it takes a few days longer to figure out the best way of creating them. Maybe one of you will find a tool <a href="http://wiki.svg.org/Other_Implementations" class="external text" title="http://wiki.svg.org/Other_Implementations" rel="nofollow">here</a> that works with what you already have available.</p>
<p>Bogomolov has pointed me to a sample of what he created: <a href="../../../m/o/n/Image%7EMongolia_Arhangay_2005_sum.png_c43d.html" title="Image:Mongolia Arhangay 2005 sum.png">Image:Mongolia_Arhangay_2005_sum.png</a>. I would like to continue that discussion here, so that we may get more diverse input. As far as I can tell, the result is correct, at least the names all correspond to the lists that I have. As to the spelling, in <a href="http://www.medeelel.mn/index.php?page=tur&amp;sm=287" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.medeelel.mn/index.php?page=tur&amp;sm=287" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, "Ögiy nuur" and "Ih tamir" are written as two words each, which may or may not be better. Then there's a chance that a future WP naming convention for Mongolian will define "Х" as "kh" (current practise varies randomly between "h" and "kh"), but that shouldn't be a difficult change if/once it happens.</p>
<p>Graphically, I'd prefer softer colors (maybe except for the lakes), as recommended by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Maps_fb9d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Maps">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Maps</a>. The strong colors can make the text hard to read. Would it be hard to remove the sum boundaries and settlement locations in the surrounding aymags? They make the whole thing look a bit nervous. The boundaries between surrounding aymags (and national boundaries, where relevant) should stay, though. Maybe it would even be useful to label the neighbour aymags, as Yaan has done in <a href="../../../../de/h/o/v/Bild%7EHovsgol_sumuud.png_4087.html" class="extiw" title="de:Bild:Hovsgol_sumuud.png">his attempt</a>. I think it is ok to leave the country map insert away. After all, we already have maps that show where each aymag is located, and those are included in the respective articles as well. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 16:40, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Latebird - I agree the colors need to be changed (that is why I use a pastel range), and the outside borders and settlement locations need to be dropped. Both attempts look just fine (though the text angles in the one that Yaan did are all over the place and do not follow any standard convention). If someone cannot do the colors, etc. that is what I am saying the whole time - I have the software and the time to burn through this and get the updates completed. I can provide the .png files back to someone who can then turn them into SVG. ? <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 16:56, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>SVG is a vector format. If we go this way, then you don't want to create PNGs first. Any intermediate formats should be vector based as well (eg. DXF). --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 17:52, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not going to have this conversation. Everyone says "SVG! SVG!" when those of us (like myself) use software that doesn't convert/save/utilize SVG format. These are not fly-by-night cheapo software packages, these are full-blown mapping systems. So the maps I continue to create will be PNG... and I will look for something that will convert from PNG to SVG. It's just that way. Microstation is the same (as the MapInfo I use). So unless you have some kind of suggestions... ? <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 18:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You don't want to convert from one vector format (MapInfo/MicroStation) to another vector format (SVG) by going through an intermediate raster format (PNG). That would destroy all the advantages of using a "full blown mapping system" in the first place, as far as the quality of the result is concerned. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 19:53, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Any decent mapping software can export a variety of vector formats. Now we just need to find one where we then have a (fully vector based) path to SVG. There are probably short and expensive paths, and longer ones with free tools. Maybe we should ask the mapping portal or the folks on Commons if anyone has used this specific combination before. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 20:26, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd pastellized colors and will post example (replacing Mongolia_Govi-Altay_sum.png). Is it enough pastel? And one more question. What all Mongolia sum map resolution you prefere? If the same resolution as aymag maps - it is 10150x5100 pixels and 549 KB, but... it is nice. Version 5074x2567 has 242 KB. I mean colored maps with sum names. Binary map (borders and lakes, no sum centers and names) is 311 KB. If difference in KB is so small - color with names is better? Bogomolov.PL 15:41, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The new colors look nice. If we create SVG maps, then the resolution is dynamic at constant (small) file size. It seems that Rarelibra has found a way to create SVG maps from MapInfo. Maybe you can cooperate for him to process your data this way? About that Govi-Altay map: The territory around the capital has a very strange shape. Is that actually what the city administrates, or in which aymag is the capital located geographically? --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 17:22, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>About sum division. Aymag is divided into aymag center and sums. Sum and sum center obligatory have the same name. Very frequently sum center is single settlement in it and rest of population is nomadic only registrated in sum center. Besides sum center in sum are possible bag settlements, but a lot of them are seasonally populated (if exist). There are settlements wich are not bags. Usually only sum center has post-office, school, hospital, set of shops, temple. Sum is not only administrative division, but the way to manage pastures - main economy resource. Bags are sum pastures subdivisions. Sum population is officially rural. Urban population in Mongolia is: Ulaanbaatar municipality population and all aymag centers. So, to my opinion, if aymag center is on the territory of sum with its own sum center, this aymag center have to be excluded from surrounding sum. Uvs, Govi-Altay, Orhon, Dundgovi, Dornogovi and Govi-Sumber aymag centers are sum centers too. What with them? Does surronding sum have own administration located in the city, or it has no own administration, but it is rural part of city administrated territory? Bogomolov.PL 08:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Latebird - Ihtamir and Ögiynuur are written as one word (without hyphen too) in all avaliable for me <i>Mongolian</i> maps of Mongolia (Road map 1:2,5 mln in English, Авто замын атлас 1:1 mln, Administrative map 1:2,5 mln in mongolian). Really, all this maps are made by the same cartographer team, I suspect. They introduced principle: 1) not in two words (only hyphen is possible); 2) sum and sum center are namesakes. Thank you for a good link, I can add an other one <a href="http://gate1.pmis.gov.mn/arkhangai/zurag/1.JPG" class="external free" title="http://gate1.pmis.gov.mn/arkhangai/zurag/1.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://gate1.pmis.gov.mn/arkhangai/zurag/1.JPG</a> where is administrative map of Arhangay aymag 1,5 mln scale - almost all sum centers have their own names different from sum names. On Russian military maps (1973) all sum centers of Arhangay aymag have names of actual sum (but Их-Тамир and Угий-Нур). Bogomolov.PL 07:43, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've never heard of a sum center having a different name than the sum.</p>
<p>That map of Arhangay looks very strange. In the Tsetserleg sum, they have two seperate settlements called Hujirt. In the Hairhan sum, there is a place named Hairhan, but the red dot is placed elsewhere. The Tsahir sum has no red dot at all, but a small dot at the border to Tariat is given two names (one of them Tsahir). The name Jargalant appears at least three times, two of them purportedly a sum center, but not in the Jargalant sum... I don't think I would trust this particular map as a reliable source, even if some local webmaster may have thought it was the best he could find.</p>
<p>Bogomolov, have you received a copy of the map that <a href="../../../../de/h/a/n/Benutzer%7EHangarid_3eec.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer:Hangarid">de:Benutzer:Hangarid</a> has?

<dd>Actually, a lot of sum center's names are officially different from that of their sum. In real life, few (local) people use them, but they are displayed on more detailed maps and can sometimes lead to confusion on bigger maps or in GPS software. For example, in Hövsgöl Hanh might be called Turta, Alag-Erdene's center is called Manhan IIRC, and Bürentogtoh's center has some distinct name that I don't remember (It's not Bürenhaan. <a href="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/MG/13/Bayan.html" class="external free" title="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/MG/13/Bayan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fallingrain.com/world/MG/13/Bayan.html</a> suggests it might be Bayan, but the location seems to far south. From what I have heard, this might be the old location that was left somewhere in the 60s or 50s. The correct location is displayed under yet another name at <a href="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/MG/13/Dzagdza_Dugang.html" class="external free" title="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/MG/13/Dzagdza_Dugang.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fallingrain.com/world/MG/13/Dzagdza_Dugang.html</a>), even though I've slept there once and spent some days in the area. Those are just the examples I remember without looking into a map. I read somewhere (without source) this is all a result of some administrative reform in the 70s.</dd>
</dl>
<p>re. double and triple names, I think this might be a common problem when dealing with Mongolian maps. I think Hövsgöl has 3-4 mountains called Ih Uuls, for example. Unless someone can come up with a definite source, I'd just ignore the sum center's names, since they are pretty irrelevant anyway. I think Hövsgöl's center Mörön is a sum, too, albeit a rather small one. Or maybe it <i>was</i> one some years ago. Yaan 217.188.99.115 11:43, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just had a look at Bogomolov's Hövsgöl map ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Mongolia_Hovsgol_2005_sum.png" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Mongolia_Hovsgol_2005_sum.png" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Mongolia_Hovsgol_2005_sum.png</a> ). It looks great, esp. the Sangiin Dalai nuur, but there are two minor issues: first it's Tsag<b>aa</b>nnuur and Tsag<b>aa</b>n-Uul, and then Mörön is officially a small sum with a slightly (just a little) greater area than covered by the black star. Third, one might think of including Hatgal, since it's apparently an administrative division on the same level as the sumuud. As for the sum centers, their names are probably even more irrelevant than I mentioned previously, so I'm all for omitting the names. Yaan, 85.179.30.25 20:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With Tsagaan-Uul and Tsagaannuur it is my sin - I just fixed this error (Tsagaan - "White" with double "a" always). Thank you, Yaan 85.179.30.25!</p>
<p>Latebird - I'm finising maps correction (pastel colors, removing neighbouring aymags sum boundaries and centers). I'm looking for the ways to converte to SVG. May be Rarelibra will be successful, I sent him MapInfo tabs with sum bounaries and lakes - this makes possible to create outline map for all Mongolia.</p>
<p>Yaan- Mörön can not be any sum: sums are always rural units, but aymag centers are always urban (this is Statistic Office position). Sum is usually former socialist agriculture enterprise headquarters and still is grazeland management unit. And does aymag center fulfil this characteristic attributes? I'd mentioned in discussion that , to my opinion, aymags need to be excluded from surrounding sums. But it doesn not mean aymags will become sum this way. Hatgal - good question. In Авто замын атлас 2005 it is shown by the sum sign, but on adminisrative map it is noted like "other settlement". Usually this sign is used for former sum centers (just lost sum status). Anyway if Hatgal is sum - i have no borders for it. It is very possible this town has post office, grocery stores, gas station etc. I was in 2005 and 2006 in Bayantooroy willage in North Gobi oazis - all infrastructure was present, even house with banner (usually - "сумын дарга" office). But on administrative map - nothing. In Mongolian Wiki this willage name is in brackets, first is the name Цогт (80 km from Gobi desert to the Mongol-Altay tops), like it is on administrative map. Bogomolov.PL 09:21, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Latebird - I didn't received any maps, but if you know how (verification is good idea) - tell me.</p>
<p>Yaan - a lot of sum centers are noted on maps in wrong places. Sum center can move - it happens (even aymag centers moved). But very possible are map mistakes/distorsions. Guchin-Us sum center (Övörhangay aymag) shift is 15 km. Bogomolov.PL 09:46, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think Mörön is nominally a sum, just much smaller (area-wise) than the other sums. Unfortunately I can't go there any time soon and make a picture of what the plaque at the town hall says, but I think (not at home now) that the Hövsgöl aimgiin lavlah tol (UB 2001) lists it under Mörön sum. But then, the author might have it wrong, too.</dd>
<dd>From what I have heard, they <i>did</i> have one (some?) agricultural unit(s) (or bags, anyway) during socialism, too. I guess that book above might also mention how many domestic animals they had in 2000.</dd>
<dd>Hatgal is not a sum,but not part of any sum either. It's a tosgon (~village). Again. this is all according to above source. The area, just some sqkm, is probably too small to be shown on most maps.</dd>
<dd>I think the problem with Bürentogtoh's (the center's) location on that other map is really just old data. But it doesn't matter because you won't find anything at the old place anyway.Yaan 12:04, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yaan - I was confused - on administrative map margins is sum number table and for Hövsgöl aymag number is 24, but on the map are located only 22. It will be nice if missing 2 sums are Mörön and Hatgal tosgon. But we need be 100 percen sure that this suggestion is true (official sources confirmation is needful). If yes, we will think about new signs creation on our maps and new entities in 2-d level administrative division articles in Wiki. I'm really glad, it becomes more and more interesting. Bogomolov.PL 12:52, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If there 22 sums on the map, then the missing two should be Mörön and Hatgal (on older maps, Hanh might be missing too, leaving only 21 'real' sums). I don't have any source available now and won't be home until next weekend. Even then the book is maybe not really an official source. But IIRC some darga from Hövsgöl helped in editing it, so it's probably better than nothing. In the meantime, Mongolian wikipedia seems to have the same number of sums and tosgons: "23 сум, нэг тосгонтой засаг захиргааны 24 нэгжтэй.", from <a href="http://mn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A5%D3%A9%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B3%D3%A9%D0%BB" class="external free" title="http://mn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A5%D3%A9%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B3%D3%A9%D0%BB" rel="nofollow">http://mn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A5%D3%A9%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B3%D3%A9%D0%BB</a> .

<p>Bogomolov, I've asked Hangarid to contact you about his map. I hope there won't be too many changes necessary because of it...</p>
<p>Unless I've miscounted, I think for the moment it's save to assume that Mörön and Hatgal are independent tosgons and not part of a sum. Maybe we can have a notice on the talk page of the article (and/or the map image) as a disclaimer until we're really 200% certain. We may also have to double check all other aymags for extra tosgons besides the aymag centers.</p>
<p>Btw: The numer of sum in the table in each article may or may not be correct in some cases.

<p>Hmmm... most sources seem to think that an aymag center is never a sum (or part of a sum). Where can we get an official word on this? --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 20:01, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From the plates on the aimag center's town hall? Maybe one could also try to retrieve some adresses within the aimag centers. Or some sufficiently official documents. Yaan 17:31, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of the publicly available information is not up to date. This may include plates on buildings and "official" web sites. Addresses probably don't say much about the administrative status of a place either. The problem is that most Mongolians couldn't care less about such administrative trivia, so you'll get many incorrect answers if you ask people... But this is the first time I hear that the Aymag center isn't supposed to be an extra entity, so I'm inclined to go with "conventional wisdom" and list it as a tosgon. If we should happen to get formal confirmation later that Mörön is an exception, we can still change it. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 09:44, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm. But what are your sources (other than hearsay or "I have never heard of such a thing before") to assume that aimag centers are usually supposed to be "extra entities" (i.e. not a sum)? I agree it's a very difficult problem, and much harder to solve than the different names for sums and their centers. Have you had any success in contacting user Hangarid? He seemed quite competent for another aimag - and he claimed to have the ultimate map!</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sum office presence in aymag centre does not mean this city is obligatory sum part. Can be two possible situations: 1. Like Praha (Prague) is the capital, but not the part of Středočeský kraj. 2. City administration is common for both city and surrounding sum. What I don't know: are city administrations separate from aymag administrations? About tosgon. In 1981 was 25 "urban type settlements" (back translation from Russian) and 20 cities in Mongolia. "Urban village" may be better definition, because official statistics add tosgon population to urban one. In Stat.Yearbook 2001 is footnote: "Data from Population and Housing census, 2000. Some settlements, which were clasified as villages in the census are not clasified as them according to the 2000 Resident Population Data". Is it possible tosgon definition is only for statistic use?

<dd>Well, that's part of the problem. I don't have any hard sources about the sum/aymag center question either. Just that most people I've talked to seemed to agree about it.

<dd>I've just read your discussion with Hangarid, and at least back then you seemed more leaning towards "aimag centers are sums, too" - which only means that "conventional wisdom" doesn't really help us here. Hangarid seems to know a lot of people in Hovd, I know some people in Mörön, but without hard and good sources we could both be wrong and are close to <i>original research</i> anyway.</dd>
<dd>At least in Hövsgöl, there are separate administrative structures for the aimag and the sum (I'm still positive that Mörön is a sum), and within Mörön sum either bags and horoos or bags and the whole town might be on the same administrative level.</dd>
<dd>About the administrative status of a tosgon I don't really have a clue. The statistical yearbooks from the nso.mn website seems to list Hatgal as a sum-level administrative unit, otherwise 24 for the no. of sums in Hövsgöl wouldn't make sense. For the other aimags, I don't know.</dd>
<dd>For now, maybe we can at least start the clean-up of the Sumuud of Mongolia and the Aymag pages? After all, whether aimag capitals are sums, and the status of tosgons, are mere details compared to the mistakes these pages currently contain. Yaan 12:43, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yaan - Rarelibra, Latebird and me - we are too far from Mongolia, I think. For our small Mongolian team you discovered tosgons. Tosgon presence changes formrer simple system of 2-nd level administration division, aymag-sum relations also make problem more complex. We need change maps, tables etc, but we need information. For me only online sources are avaliable - but in Mongolian texts I can understand only few keywords. Bogomolov.PL 13:16, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>When I get home next week, I'll do some in-depth research in the two relevant books I have. Unfortunately, they only cover Hövsgöl, so they cannot give anything but hints about the situation in other aimags. Yaan 14:02, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to M.Nyamaa's (the inlet also mentions the aimag's sasag darga as "redacteur") <i>Hövsgöl aimgiin lavlah tol</i>, UB 2001, p.97f, Mörön became the sum center of a sum called Büren in 1931, in 1933 it (additionally) became the center of Hövsgöl aimag, in 1956 its status changed from Büren sum's 8th bag to an independent unit called Mörön horoo, in 1961 it became Mörön hot. In 1994 it became Mörön sum. The area is about 102 sqkm.</p>
<p>I also had a look into a brochure called "Mörön hot", edited probably 2001 in Mörön. From what I understood, they basically say the same (incl. that Mörön has been a sum since 1994), and they have pictures of each the aimag's and <b>sum'</b>s hural and administrative heads (four persons in total). It's not really a surprise since the ultimate sources are probably the same.</p>
<p>As for Hatgal, according to the first source on p.159 it has been independent ever since the aimag's capital was moved to Mörön in 1933 (ene üyees hatgal biye daasan hev shinjid orj högjih bolson yum). in 1975, the status was changed from Hatgal horoo to either hot or 'oron nutgiin har'yaalaltai hot' (not sure if the second might be an official designation). In 1994 its status was changed to tosgon. On p.7, the book, not really helpfully, states that Hövsgöl has 23 sum, one tosgon and 121 bag. Yaan 14:12, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The english language Wikipedia has yet to decide about a standard transliteration system for Mongolian. I've tried to start a discussion about it some time ago, but didn't have the energy to actually get anything decided then. It is probably a good idea to get this discussion started again, but not here. To create an accepted standard for Wikipedia, it must be discussed on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Cyrillic%29_c396.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Cyrillic)">Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_(Cyrillic)</a>.</p>
<p>What I proposed back then was very similar to what you call "Mongolian map transliteration system" (where exactly is that defined?). The only differences were in the "ь" (left away) and the "Х" (kh instead of h). I think this is close enough that we'll find a mutually agreeable solution. Are we ready to convince the rest of the community about it? --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 11:13, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have Road Map of Mongolia (1: 2,5 mln in English), where Mongolian map system is used (may be we will call it MMS) and Road atlas of Mongolia (1: 1 mln Авто замын атлас 2005) in Mongolian. Preparing sum maps all mogolian sum names I'd transliterated manually, so this transliteration system I know by heart. This MMS is transliteration system is most laconic (not KH but H, not OU but U, not DZ but Z). Rejecting of "ь" makes back transliteration into Mongolian impossible. But ideal system does not create conversion losses and is revertable. To meet this requirements we need to save "ь" transliterated by the different character - "ǐ". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bogomolov.PL (<a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogomolov.PL_ccf3.html" title="User talk:Bogomolov.PL">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bogomolov.PL_8cd5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bogomolov.PL">contribs</a>) --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 16:55, 5 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Bogomolov - it is <i>not</i> a requirement by Wiki to have 'back transliteration' as a primary capability. If the transliteration is proper (as is the one that Latebird and I use/used), that is what is important here. I am not going to argue with you about the semantics of 'allowing back transliteration'. If the standard usage is to drop the "ь" character, then that is what will occur (and it is dropped, btw, not 'rejected'). If there is some kind of alternate method, then we can use that - especially if it appears to be more usable - as in the one that you are suggesting. Don't get caught up in semantics. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 15:30, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The requirements of Wikipedia ask for a phonetic transliteration system, that will help the average english speaker to pronounce the names as correctly as possible without help. Back-transliteration is only of concern in articles about linguistic topics, but not here. After all, we'll give the original mongolian spelling as well, either in a table or in the introduction of each article. But this discussion should really move to the naminc convention pages, so that other interested editors will see it as well. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 17:24, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rarelibra - Of course this is not Wiki requirement, but my suggestion: toponims and personal names have to be matched with Mongolian cyrillic words one-to-one. Everybody needs street name, town name, surname, company, hotel names latin-cyrillic confrontation, when city map or address in latin is compared in Mongolia to the real cyrillic names. But it is not any purpose for Wiki, of course. It is only my suggestion. If it is possible (it is possible, isn't it?), it is reasonable.</dd>
<dd>About ь. Of course is possible Gov'. I met several times this transliteration. I have only one question: we need to create transliteration system, or we need to agree with one existing? If we reject Mongolian map transliteration system - may be it will be comfortable for us to use handmade one. Will we introduce order this way? Six (or more) system exist, we will create another one?</dd>
<dd>Latebird - Phonetic... This is transcription task. But we need to be sure we can read mongolian words correctly to start new close-to-phonetic transliteration system design Bogomolov.PL 18:17, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, the established english (and german) name for Говь is "Gobi" (compare <a href="../../../g/o/b/Gobi_Desert_df4d.html" title="Gobi Desert">Gobi Desert</a>). This is <b>not</b> a transliteration of the current mongolian spelling, but a historically grown english name (similar to eg. "<a href="../../../u/l/a/Ulan_Bator_1b5d.html" title="Ulan Bator">Ulan Bator</a>"). We only need an accurate transliteration where no such english name is common. We have done it this way in the german language WP as well, eg <a href="../../../../de/d/o/r/Dorno-Gobi-Aimag_5763.html" class="extiw" title="de:Dorno-Gobi-Aimag">de:Dorno-Gobi-Aimag</a>. I think in all other cases, omitting the ь is unproblematic.</p>
<p>The english term "transliteration" means both literal transliteration and what is usually known as transcription in other languages (eg. German). I was originally confused about this as well, as you'll find documented on the naming conventions talk page. So yes, in your terms, what we need here is a transcription system. Literal transliteration would probably confuse most readers (we write for "normal" people, not for linguists). We don't need to decide about this question now, as it is the established WP naming convention standard. We just need to chose the most suitable transcription system for Mongolian. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 10:44, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. Most suitable is first anything already used (like they do with Italian names - Roma, Rome; Napoli, Naples; etc). When a translation does not exist, we use the proper (and respectful) transliteration - in which case, we will lean heavily on you, Bogomolov. :) <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 13:47, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The absence of a transliteration convention forces us to define one!

<p>I have also read up a bit on Hövsgöl aimag's history. According to the source mentioned above, the Sain Noyon Han and Zasagt Han aimags and their hoshuus were both renamed in 1923 (I suppose the same applied to the other two old aimags), Sain Noyon Han aimag was renamed into into Tsetserleg mandal uulyn aimag and Zasagt Han aimag into Hantaishir uulyn aimag. Additionally, border areas were (gradually?) incorporated into that structure from then on - like the Drahad area in Hövsgöl, but the same might be true for Hovd and Dariganga. Hövsgöl aimag was founded in 1931, it gave some areas to Zavhan and Bulgan aimags in 1938 (which implies that these aimags existed at least from that time on) and got some areas from Arhangai in 1942.</p>
<p>For the history of Arhangai, compare <a href="http://www.silk-road.com/excavation/arkhangai/documents/Arkhangaiaimag.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.silk-road.com/excavation/arkhangai/documents/Arkhangaiaimag.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.silk-road.com/excavation/arkhangai/documents/Arkhangaiaimag.pdf</a> .Yaan 14:29, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That (and the further above) is great material for the Khövsgöl, Mörön, and Arkhangay articles! I see you already wrote some stuff for Khatgal. Now we just need to find similar information about all the other Aymags... --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 16:27, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unfortunately about other aimags (and only about three of them), I have nothing more than picture books. The ones about Hovd and Uvs don't contain any encyclopedic information. The one about Dornogov' says that the aimag was founded in 1931 from the Sain Noyon Khan aimag (or another one of the four old aimags, anyway under the <i>original</i> name), and that it has 14 sums. The included map showed 13 sums if you include the one that Sainshand is in. But then, the english version of the text also says the aimag is as big as Benelux + Sweden. The mongolian version was closer (Benelux + Switzerland), but I still don't think it's a useful source. The pics are nice, though. Yaan 14:18, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Unfortunately, there is a scale, but no date given in the legend, and the author of the site doesn't seem to be entirely sure either. Plus it's written in classical mongolian. But if you like old mongolian maps, check the site out.Yaan 12:50, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow! Very cool maps! And even better, all of them are public domain because of their age. We can only use the information for its historical interest, but the maps should definitively go to Commons (suitably scaled down in some cases). --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 18:56, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
