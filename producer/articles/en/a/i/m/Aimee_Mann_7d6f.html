<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/m/Aimee_Mann_7d6f.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Aimee Mann was born in <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_Virginia_2b80.html" title="Richmond, Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>, graduated from <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_High_School_57de.html" title="Open High School">Open High School</a> and attended the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berklee_College_of_Music_8436.html" title="Berklee College of Music">Berklee College of Music</a> in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>, but dropped out to sing with her first <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a> band, the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Snakes_8a28.html" title="Young Snakes">Young Snakes</a>; the band released the EP <i><a href="../../../b/a/r/Bark_Along_with_the_Young_Snakes_8c86.html" title="Bark Along with the Young Snakes">Bark Along with the Young Snakes</a></i> in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004.</p>
<p>In 1983, seeking a return to "sweetness and melody", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Hausman_1791.html" title="Michael Hausman">Michael Hausman</a> the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Wave_music_2b3e.html" title="New Wave music">new wave</a> band <a href="../../../27/t/i/%27Til_Tuesday_ee23.html" title="'Til Tuesday">'Til Tuesday</a>, which achieved success in 1985 with its first album, <i><a href="../../../v/o/i/Voices_Carry_b790.html" title="Voices Carry">Voices Carry</a></i>. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_video.html" title="Music video">video</a> became an <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a> staple, winning the <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_Video_Music_Award_for_Best_New_Artist_3dd9.html" title="MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist">MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist</a>, although Mann's then-signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_%28band%29.html" title="Rush (band)">Rush</a> on the song "Time Stand Still" (from <i><a href="../../../h/o/l/Hold_Your_Fire_7a77.html" title="Hold Your Fire">Hold Your Fire</a></i>, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, <i><a href="../../../w/e/l/Welcome_Home_34e0.html" title="Welcome Home">Welcome Home</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../e/v/e/Everything%27s_Different_Now_8505.html" title="Everything's Different Now">Everything's Different Now</a></i>. On the final album and tour, musician <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Brion_6a8a.html" title="Jon Brion">Jon Brion</a> joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.</p>
<p>Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with <a href="../../../j/u/l/Jules_Shear_784e.html" title="Jules Shear">Jules Shear</a>; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song "J For Jules." Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums, along with the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnolia_%28album%29.html" title="Magnolia (album)"><i>Magnolia</i> soundtrack</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Solo_career" id="Solo_career"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/m/Aimee_Mann_7d6f.html" title="Edit section: Solo career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Solo career</span></h3>
<p>In 1993 Mann released <i><a href="../../../w/h/a/Whatever_%28album%29.html" title="Whatever (album)">Whatever</a></i>, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's <i><a href="../../../i/27/m/I%27m_with_Stupid_%28album%29_66a6.html" title="I'm with Stupid (album)">I'm with Stupid</a></i>, through <a href="../../../g/e/f/Geffen_Records_6b65.html" title="Geffen Records">Geffen Records</a>. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.</p>
<p>Mann met fellow <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singer-songwriter.html" title="Singer-songwriter">singer-songwriter</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Penn_bb2a.html" title="Michael Penn">Michael Penn</a> in the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980s</a> and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of <i>Stupid</i> (to which Penn contributed vocals), which blossomed into romance and their <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> marriage. Penn and Mann live in the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Feliz_6c5f.html" title="Los Feliz">Los Feliz</a> neighborhood of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. They have no children, but Penn has a son from a previous marriage.</p>
<p>Mann recorded <i><a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_No._2_3876.html" title="Bachelor No. 2">Bachelor No. 2</a></i>, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, film director <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Thomas_Anderson_94a3.html" title="Paul Thomas Anderson">Paul Thomas Anderson</a>, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since "Voices Carry" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnolia_%28movie%29.html" title="Magnolia (movie)">Magnolia</a></i>, including the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Awards_b109.html" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a>-nominated song, "Save Me." Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Mann soon became sought after as a soundtrack contributor.</p>
<p><a name="Independence" id="Independence"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/i/m/Aimee_Mann_7d6f.html" title="Edit section: Independence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Independence</span></h3>
<p>Disillusioned with both the ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song "Calling It Quits", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. Mann self-released <i>Bachelor No. 2</i> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from <i>Magnolia</i> and new material, was widely admired and Mann's "more <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indie_%28music%29.html" title="Indie (music)">indie</a> than indie" success was carefully noted by other musicians.</p>
<p>Mann, Penn, Brion, <a href="../../../f/i/o/Fiona_Apple_128e.html" title="Fiona Apple">Fiona Apple</a>, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the <a href="../../../l/a/r/Largo_%28nightclub%29.html" title="Largo (nightclub)">Largo</a> nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janeane_Garofalo_36d8.html" title="Janeane Garofalo">Janeane Garofalo</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patton_Oswalt_6995.html" title="Patton Oswalt">Patton Oswalt</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Cross_53d7.html" title="David Cross">David Cross</a>.</p>
<p>Mann continued her solo career with <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_in_Space_%28album%29_68a9.html" title="Lost in Space (album)">Lost in Space</a></i> (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as <i>Bachelor No. 2</i>. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> her website released the <i>Lost in Space Special Edition</i>, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2004.html" title="November 2004">November of the following year</a> <i><a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_at_St._Ann%27s_Warehouse_16d5.html" title="Live at St. Ann's Warehouse">Live at St. Ann's Warehouse</a></i>, a live album and <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> recorded at a series of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_2004.html" title="June 2004">June 2004</a> shows in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.</p>
<p>Mann described her next album, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Forgotten_Arm_1fc4.html" title="The Forgotten Arm">The Forgotten Arm</a></i> (2005), as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concept_album.html" title="Concept album">concept album</a> set in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">'70s</a> about two lovers who meet at the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> state fair and go on the run. The <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Henry_f735.html" title="Joe Henry">Joe Henry</a>-produced album, which was recorded mostly live with few overdubs, was released <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_3.html" title="May 3">May 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. The album's illustrations and title reflect Mann's interest in <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxing</a>. The album title derives from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to "forget" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.</p>
<p>Mann also released an EP for <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2005.html" title="December 2005">Christmas in 2005</a> as a cover single of "<a href="../../../h/a/v/Have_Yourself_a_Merry_Little_Christmas_2343.html" title="Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas">Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas</a>" for sale through her website and <a href="../../../i/t/u/ITunes_59e0.html" title="ITunes">iTunes</a>. It also included "Christmastime", the 1996 duet she recorded with Penn for the <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_Eight_d211.html" title="Hard Eight">Hard Eight</a></i> soundtrack, and a cover of "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Christmas_Song_%28Chestnuts_Roasting_on_an_Open_Fire%29_9bf2.html" title="The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)">The Christmas Song</a>". The iTunes version replaced "Christmastime" with a cover of <a href="../../../j/o/n/Joni_Mitchell_0ba3.html" title="Joni Mitchell">Joni Mitchell</a>'s "River" and "I Was Thinking I Could Clean Up for Christmas" from <i>The Forgotten Arm</i>.</p>
<p>Mann's independence from the industry led to more overt political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downloading.html" title="Downloading">downloading</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/l/File_sharing.html" title="File sharing">file sharing</a> of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyrighted</a> music from the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_record_label.html" title="Independent record label">independent music</a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective.html" title="Collective">collective</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Musicians_3d9e.html" title="United Musicians">United Musicians</a>, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2006.html" title="July 2006">July 2006</a>, Mann announced that she would be releasing <i><a href="../../../o/n/e/One_More_Drifter_in_the_Snow_24bc.html" title="One More Drifter in the Snow">One More Drifter in the Snow</a></i>, a full-length <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_music.html" title="Christmas music">Christmas album</a>. The album featured primarily covers of Christmas standards, as well as "Christmastime" and an original song, called "Calling On Mary", written by Mann and bassist Paul Bryan, who produced the record. It was released on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_31.html" title="October 31">October 31</a> in the US, and late <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2006.html" title="November 2006">November</a> in the UK. <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=musicNews&amp;storyID=2006-08-10T003633Z_01_N09348914_RTRIDST_0_MUSIC-MANN-DC.XML" class="external autonumber" title="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=musicNews&amp;storyID=2006-08-10T003633Z_01_N09348914_RTRIDST_0_MUSIC-MANN-DC.XML" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
