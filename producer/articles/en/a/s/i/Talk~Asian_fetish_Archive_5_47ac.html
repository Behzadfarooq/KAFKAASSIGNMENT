<h2><span class="mw-headline">Physical anthropology</span></h2>
<p>This whole section needs to be removed, and I did so. "while the Nordic race is a typical masculine one": what is this supposed to mean? I am new to editing here and sorry if I broke any rules deleting this whole section, but nothing was worth keeping.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><a name="New_definition" id="New_definition"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">New definition</span></h2>
<p>As I suggested that I would earlier, I tried to take a stab at a new definition for Asian fetish according to the discussion so far. Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main point: trying to make a distinction between attraction and fetishism -- suggestion that fetishism is strongly tied to inability to be with a non-Asian woman.</li>
<li>Seems that everybody thinks the term is important enough that it can safely be upgraded from "slang" to "colloquialism."</li>
<li>Kept the "attraction" part, parenthesized "obsession" -- might want it the other way around, or even, to delete one or the other. Seems like both should be there, parenthesizing the latter was the more conservative option.</li>
<li>Keeping both Taiwanese and Chinese in the expansion on East Asian. Seems there's enough cultural differences to warrant it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are all the notes that I have. Let's see some comments. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 07:07, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but I like the new definition less. I find it POV by describing only the most radical form of the phenomenon -- a man who can <i>only</i> find sexual attraction with an Asian must surely represent a small minority. Especially considering that there are many white men who would say "yeah, I have an Asian fetish" but only mean that they like Asian features.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What would you think about something like this --</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>--</dd>
<dd><b>"Asian fetish"</b>, also called "yellow fever", is a colloquialism which generally describes the attraction that many white men have for Asian women (particularly East Asian women). While often applied humorously or non-seriously, it describes a wide range of phenomena -- from a seemingly innocuous attraction to Asian physical features to an intense attraction to perceived Asian cultural features, which can involve racism and stereotyping -- and both the term and the underlying phenonema it describes generate intense controversy, with many Asians in the West experiencing it as another expression of the racism they have grow up with.</dd>
<dd>--</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since I just wrote that off the top of my head and it's late I'm sure that could be much better written. But I think it is a good way to ease into a controversial topic without inflammatory language like obsession or "impossible to form healthy, meaningful relationships". Yes, that is one aspect of the 'fetish' but I think it is vital to acknowledge from the outset that the term describes a wide variety of behavior and that the definition at the top should not single out any one of them. Also, I'd like to think that is a paragraph which would pique the interest of the Average Reader without feeling confrontational.<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeAnswers_dc5d.html" title="User:ThreeAnswers">ThreeAnswers</a> 08:54, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, there have been repeated calls from many, many users -- of all POV's -- for a sharp distinction made between "Asian attraction" and "Asian fetish" at the very beginning of the article. It seems that most people don't want "fetishism" to cover "innocuous attraction," but instead to be defined as something "bad." (Of course, as I said earlier, Asian fetish shouldn't be considered deviant behavior, so how "bad" is the real matter of controversy.) So it seems "fetishism" should stay closer to a qualified form of "obsession" than to "attraction."</p>
<p>Actually, for the record, the most radical POV would be that Asian fetish refers to a situation where a white male can obtain sexual gratification from all and only Asian females, i.e., <i>any</i> Asian will do, but <i>only</i> Asians will do. A little less radical would be to say that Asian fetish means that <i>any</i> Asian will do, but not necessarily <i>only</i> Asians. Another step down is what I've suggested, <i>only</i> Asians will do, but not necessarily <i>any</i> Asian.</p>
<p>Also, it's a valid point that the term is often used humorously and not seriously, but that's probably better placed in the discussion section. As an analogue, "nigger" can also often used humorously, but one wouldn't dream of including that in its definition. Given the number of comparisons that have been made between "Asian fetish" and "nigger," it's important to keep that in mind. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 22:13, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the introduction of <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a> does note that 'nigga' is slang among young American blacks. Considering that they are both very controversial terms, there's no reason that the introduction to Asian fetish can't also be more than one paragraph and give a brief overview of other points of view.<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeAnswers_dc5d.html" title="User:ThreeAnswers">ThreeAnswers</a> 23:47, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, hm, maybe I should have read your recent edits before opening my fool mouth. Actually I mostly like how the intro is now.

<p>I'd like to embed a couple of pictures into the article. Is this possible? Can I use standard html code to do this? For example, on the Asian Manhood section of the article, I'd like to have this cartoon displayed right beneath it that I think humorously demonstrates the point that section is trying to make:</p>

<dd>Thanks. That link explains everything. After reading through it, it may be easier to just link to the image rather than try to obtain copyright permission from the owners. I do think though that the article would benefit from having a few well placed images in it that visually represent the stereotypes that this article addresses. After all, the concept of Asian Fetish is all about imagery and the conclusions and stereotypes that have been derived from that imagery over the years.OneViewHere 19:07, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just noticed there's no article on Secret Asian Man. Why not write the article yourself and put the image there? As it is I think there is too much material in the Asian Fetish article that really deserves to have its own article. <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_American_contemporary_issues_eeb0.html" title="Asian American contemporary issues">Asian American contemporary issues</a>, for example, just as there is <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_contemporary_issues_0746.html" title="African American contemporary issues">African American contemporary issues</a>.

<p>That's a really good idea. I moved "Model minority myth" to its own article, because after thinking about it for quite a while, I could not for the life of me figure out how it was related to Asian fetish. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 05:20, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's a page for <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_minority.html" title="Model minority">Model minority</a> already. What I'd like to see is an article that can touch on that (linking to it to avoid redundancy) and have an in-depth discussion of stuff that this article has, like the sections on Asian-American manhood/womanhood. I do see that as germane to a discussion of Asian Fetish but it shouldn't dominate the article and go off on tangents the way it does. This article isn't the place to refute the stereotype of Asian men being short, but the article I'm thinking of would be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This way we can touch on those issues and explain their relevance to the Asian Fetish theory, without launching into an extended tangent that will confuse the average reader. Also I noticed that someone added back the sections you took out, so I hope he contributes to this talk discussion.--<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeAnswers_dc5d.html" title="User:ThreeAnswers">ThreeAnswers</a> 05:55, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">From the criticisms section</span></h2>
<p>"There are serious claims that Asian women (e.g. belonging to the Nesid race from the Philippines)are the most pedomorphous of the about 40 races, i.e. more childlike both in physique and in character (e.g. stated in the Knu√ümann anthropological manual, 4. rev.ed. 1996,Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart).As very masculine men are said to be attracted by very feminine women this could explain some Caucasian men's asiaphilia."</p>
<p>This is actually very interesting material. However, I don't understand why this would explain some Caucasian men's Asiaphilia. If anything, it would seem to provide a possible link between Asian fetish and pedophilia, and an explanation for the popularity of the Phillipines as a sex tourism destination. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 04:38, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think I buy that theory. First of all, Asian women are often stereotyped as having small breasts and less than voluptuous figures. How does that make them more physically attractive? Secondly Asian Fetishm can encompass more than just physical attraction. It can be a combination of perceived physical and cultural attributes that create it. Also, not all Asian women fit into those stereotypes yet they are still the object of this fetishm. There are plenty of tall, large Asian women out there who are outspoken and hardly submissive. Yet oftentimes they are still perceived in stereotypical ways so I don't think this theory is sufficient explanation nor do I think it belongs in the article.

<dd>There's nothing to buy because this is one man's crackpot theory. The anonymous user who added it clearly has no understanding of anthropology, pedomorphism, or Ahley Montagu. It takes only a basic amount of research and a check of the website he linked to to see this. What scientist could still have a career after claiming that Asians are mentally more like children than white people?</dd>

<p>Once again in easy English: there are more masculine and more feminine races (e.g. Knu√ümann- manual 1996);Asian Palaemongolids are the most pedomorphous&#160;:Martin-Saller-Knu√ümann manual since 1914, setting the world standard ,John Randal Baker , "Race",Oxford University Press 1974, for racial pedomorphosis including brain morphology of the Mongoliform Sanids, Egon Freiherr v. Eickstedt Rassenkunde 1934 etc. , all the major works, take what you want, I am preparing a comprehensive bibliography for the Mongolids' racial pedomorphosis comprising several hundreds of titles then you have thousands of pages to read only dealing with the Mongolids' racial pedomorphosis .That these works are not on the net or in controlled bibliographies does niot mean anything. Denying the obvious is ridiculous. Masculine men are attracted to feminine women, feminine men are attracted to masculine women (Knu√ümann manual, e.g. www.femininebeauty.info.com):The homosexual dominance in the model business e.g. additionally supported the virago ideal being the ideal in general in the West now having malign consequences. Asian Mongolid women in contrast are the most feminine because there is a scale from hard to weak or from feminine-pedomorphous to masculine concerning the facial features which are the most important:the most extreme viragos looking nearly like men are unattracive to masculine Nordids , but the most extreme Asian women with small breasts are 1000 times more appealing to masculine Nordids and vice versa. The indeed existing racial schedule that members of one race favour the looks of his kin is secondary. The future will show that femininity - masculinity is the key in marriage and its balance of power. One even has to say it is a universal important law of history , too.This is the dilemma of the White suprematists nitwits who have the deadly ideal of the Nordid women.Deadly because these viragos are unappropriate to them , Europe will perish , Asia will live. But why on earth did nature do these things&#160;? Because nature is only interested in the survival of the race /species , not in harmonious masculine men - feminine women relationships. In a historic context one has to state that Europe failed because Hitler didn't develop the atomic bomb and the masculine racial virago character of Nordid/Europid women making them extremely prone to the feminist biolgical suicide. I have seen the European tragedy for more than 70 years now with my own eyes.Please don't call me Nazi as I have never been a party member or had affiliation to the regime's racism, a racism which I criticized in 1938 in a personal 48 pages-long sophisticated letter to Heinrich Himmler who was like me very much interested in Asian affairs and peoples.Maybe you know his enthusiasm for Shamballah , a mysterious legendary ancient kingdom in Asia. Probably partly due to my belonging to the Prussian aristocracy with exceptional merits for German science for centuries, obviously partly due to my exceptional knowledge he wrote a acknowledging 10 pages letter back to me. These letters have never been published, but will be. I informed Himmler about the inconsistencies of the National Socialist racialist worldview concerning the Jewish people and the Asians in particular. I think n o other anthropologist or man has dared this in such a direct and scientifically elaborate way during this terror regime.I consider this a maximum effort of a single person in opposing the holocaust others would have been probably killed for, but not me. I can clearly prove that Himmler used four historic details which he only could have got to know through this letter in later writings. When I wrote my nearly deadly letter to Himmler, the Allies did appeasement and later on , they let Auschwitz happen. As I have said before I dislike Hitler,I dislike Himmler, I dislike Egon von Eickstedt , I dislike Kevin MacDonald, I dislike Richard Lynn, I dislike Jean Philippe Rushton and especially David Irving, the idiot.They are no philanthropists.But their works are essentially right (except Irving, the idiot)and partly even unique despite of their faults.And what unique new scientific knowledge could you get from me if you only would listen without prejudice. Yes, you can flush everything down the data toilet, but could you wait a bit and think about it properly. Have you ever wondered why there are no German geniuses after 1950 but hundreds before due to their talent and genes as even Steven Jay Gould admits&#160;? Because what they write or do is flushed down the toilet after World War II being an incredible loss to science.The secret of the universe has been detected by a German genius. Thomas Balwin and "Oxford Bede Rundle"have not detected it. A German man I know personally know has discovered it. Is it arrogant to say that I know someone who is not known to the public having the genius of Aristotle&#160;? Do you want to know why there is something rather than nothing , the most difficult question in the world? You certainly will not hear it from someone else in your lifetime , because a l l others since 1000 B. C. could not cope with the dilemma of the "prima causa" and the "nihil privativum". You want really to know t h e secret of the world American scientists are drooling after&#160;?Incredible stuff&#160;? Why do you know&#160;?</p>

<p>Okay, Martin-Saller-Knu√ümann is available in all major American libraries (www.worldcatlibraries.org).There are the crucial statements e.g. in the 1996 edition that there are more masculine and more feminine (Palaemongolids ) races.If you don't understand German start with Baker on racial pedomorphosis of the Mongoliform Sanids whose pedomorphosis is due to their Mongoliformness because their are a distinct group from the Negrids.Baker chose them because of their Mongoliformness, pedomorphosis and their extreme primitive culture. Recent studies confirm the childlikeness of them who can be diverted easily having a permanent sanguine happiness (see works of e.g. Knu√ümann pupils). Unfortunately , Boasianism denies these findings due to multiculturalists ideology. But I have some hope that you ,Wzhao 553, will agree to me after reading Baker and some google translation supported German sentences from Martin-Saller-Knu√ümann, setting the world standard since 1914.There you can find, too , that according to numerous studies masculine men are attracted to feminine women and the line from childlike-feminine humans to masculine humans according to e.g.Max Hartmann's three laws of sexuality. This manual was one of the highest authorities in the English-speaking world, too. I know Canadian professors personally who taught biology according to this handbook complaining that it was marginalized by Jewish Boasian anthropologists.The relative lack of information on the net is due to this marginalization, too. Classical anthropology deciphering Asiaphilia&#160;?</p>
<p>There have been anthropolgical claims since the beginnings of anthropology that the Asian races and especially the Nesid race from the Philippines and Indonesia are the most pedomorphous of the about 40 races, i.e. more childlike both in physique and in character (e.g. stated in the Martin-Saller-Knu√ümann anthropological manual,setting the world standard since 1914,unparalleled in the Anglo-American world, 4. rev.ed. 1996,Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart).As very masculine men are attracted by very feminine women (cf. Max Hartmann's world-famous and widely accepted three laws of sexuality concerning e.g. the attraction of feminine men by masculine women),this could explain Caucasian men's potential Asiaphilia. Caucasians or Europids have relatively masculine features and are prone to Asiaphilia according to this explanation. It can be assumed that the misandrous feminism in the West and the masculine physical and psychical character of Western viragos will surely fuel Asiaphilia in the foreseeable future.</p>

So far it looks like you're the ONLY one who believes in this. The main flaw I find in your claims is that you are defining masculinity in WESTERN terms. There are different standards for masculinity and femininity all over the world, so for one anthopologist to claim that an entire race of people are "childlike and feminine" is the ultimate in cultural arrogance. In addition to this, you have already admitted to us that your ultimate goal is the deletion of this article. As such, any and all changes you make to this article will be considered malicious in nature and I will revert any change you make. If you think you can wear us down by persistantly changing the article to suit your personal agenda, then I will escalate this issue to the Wikipedia admins.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Race and womanhood</span></h2>
<p>The at least 3500 years old concept of the anthropological virago is notoriously ignored by due to leftist political reasons obviously. From the masculine "salzikrum" women in the Babylonian Codex Hammurapi (1700 B.C.(!))up to Knu√ümann's "Lehrbuch der vergleichenden Anthropologie und Humangenetik" (1996)it has been an important concept as written above. An anthropological virago is a woman with both a physical and psychical masculine disposition (cf. Martin-Saller-Knu√ümann manual, 1996,the only recent manual for biological anthropology).The about 40 human races are more or less masculine (cf. cited manual). The feminine Mongolids (especially the Nesid race of Indonesia and the Philippines) and the masculine Europids (especially Nordid race) are the extremes. The high percentage of viragines in the West has been a critical factor for the success of feminists movements.It is doubtful whether feminism would have ever developed outside the West where it is nearly invisible because there is no orthogenesis (cf.wikipedia article "orthogenesis").It has been suggested by J.Ph. Rushton and others that Negrids have less pedomorphous traits being more masculine than e.g. Europids. This view is in contrast to Count de Gobineau's view of Negrids as a feminine race. In spite of several characteristics of the Negrids which can be classified as masculine (e.g. widespread athleticism due to selection for physical combat fitness, masculine skull traits), there are others which are clearly feminine (energetically lower choleric character in contrast to energetically higher melancholic character; this extraversion makes Negrids statistically more unfit for intellectual work in comparison to introverts (cf. cited manual for the extroverts' failing in intellectual occupation).Additionally, there is a lower Negrid average IQ of 70 (cf.Richard Lynn, "IQ and the Wealth of Nations").</p>

Also, there should be no problem with citing Knu√üman's Lehrbuch in the article, since it is very pertinent, but we do need to point out that there are numerous academics who consider it racist, e.g., <a href="http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/anthro.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/anthro.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> among many others. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 07:28, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I have finally been able to find something on Max Hartmann's theory of sexuality, in the form of a book review of a biography of the biologist, located here: <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/Isis/journal/issues/v96n1/96011035/96011035.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/Isis/journal/issues/v96n1/96011035/96011035.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Of course, it would be ideal if I could obtain the book myself, but nonetheless, it does not seem that Hartmann's laws of sexuality apply directly to humans. So I must ask, what exactly are the three laws of sexuality, and how do they apply to humans? And if it's the case that Hartmann did not intend his laws to apply to humans, then who was the first to do so? --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 02:23, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hartmann has been explicitly applied to humans, too (see Knu√ümann 1996). 1.law: there are two sexes (bipolarity) 2.law: there is a continuum between the two sexes 3.law: every individual human has a special (e.g.hormone induced) position on this continuum Statistically "feminity" seeks "masculinity" to mate, less masculine men seek less feminine women (viragos).The male instinct is to intrude the female, the female one is to be intruded; the more e.g. masculine a woman is (including racial feminity-pedomorphosis) the less she is feeling pleasure to be intruded or dominated by a male (e.g. statistically less heterosexual Nordid Western viragos supporting feminism as an ideology of virago masculinization).</p>

<p>No, you have only general unsupported stuff.You have the burden to prove it.

<p>I've made some more changes to streamline the rhetoric, trying my best to simplify but not alter the underlying meaning.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sexuality and stereotypes</span></h2>
<p>Yes, it is true that there is a lot of superfluous and unverified information in this article that does not make it encyclopedic. The Model Minority and Yellow Peril sections don't actually have anything to do with Asian fetish, except in the broader context of both being Asian American related issues. The negative stereotypes section is loosely associated with Asian fetish, in the sense that (negative) sexual stereotypes may be considered the alleged source of fetishism, but the section itself does not implicitly state this. Plus, while the Platonist division of stereotypes into physical, emotional and cultural levels seemed very cute at the time, I was really just making up stuff then, and I think that after several protracted edit wars, the Negative stereotypes section really serves no purpose anymore.</p>
<p>In my personal informed opinion, the best way to fix this is to remove the yellow peril and model minority sections, and then merge the Asian American manhood and Physical stereotypes section into a subsection, which, along with the Asian American womanhood subsection, would belong under a section entitled Sexuality and stereotypes. The Yellow peril and Model Minority stereotypes would then be mentioned in passing in the introduction to this section, which would then move on to the stereotypes that are of importance to Asian fetish.</p>

<dd>That sounds great. I would probably go further and trim the Sexuality and stereotypes section further by condensing the arguments to their theoretical points rather than having them spend a lot of space trying to refute the stereotypes. It's enough to put it in a few paragraphs that the stereotypes exist, are very controversial, and how they allegedly contribute to fetishism.

<ul>
<li>Introduction and brief overview</li>
<li>Historical and contemporary social contexts

<li>The Yellow Peril</li>
<li>Contemporary media portrayal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Controversy</li>
<li>See also</li>
<li>Sources</li>
<li>External links</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a bit rough but I think you can see what I'm getting at. "The Yellow Peril" would discuss changing perceptions of Asian-Americans through history and mention that even the term 'Asian-American' itself is of recent vintage. "Contemporary media portrayal" would be the place to talk about stereotypes and the disparity in portrayals of AM/WF and WM/AF. In "Controversy" I would discuss accusation of reverse racism and double standards.--<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeAnswers_dc5d.html" title="User:ThreeAnswers">ThreeAnswers</a> 01:04, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In my experience, contemporary medial portrayals are usually presented in two sections, one for AF and one for AM. This avoids some potentially confusing back-and-forth between reference points. That's probably the best way to deal with it. I can't see why an entire section on Yellow peril would help, though. For one, it would necessarily reduplicate information in the <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_peril.html" title="Yellow peril">yellow peril</a> entry itself. Secondly, it doesn't actually have anything to do with stereotypes of AF's -- there weren't any AF's around to be stereotyped at the time. Yellow peril simply states that Asian men are a threat to white men economically and white women sexually.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>According to the postcolonialists, the correct place to find the historical context of Asian fetish is in the consumer culture of 19th century Romantic Orientalism. The basic idea is that the Asian woman is objectified as a commodity, and then consumed as a sexual object. Hence, the "Asian" in Asian fetish comes from the Orientalist perception of the reified Orient, and the "fetish" comes from the Marxist idea of a commodity fetish in consumer culture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With that in mind, the section that discusses that will probably be the last one that we should work on, given how complicated the literature is. Just read the first page of Homi Bhabha's profoundly influential postcolonial work <i>The Location of Culture</i> to see! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0415336392/ref=sib_fs_bod/103-8041926-4221463?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;p=S00Y&amp;checkSum=8B5E1czuOww8t11UpeEi14gVG%2Buh%2FjrWW4c1HK7rv%2BQ%3D#reader-link" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0415336392/ref=sib_fs_bod/103-8041926-4221463?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;p=S00Y&amp;checkSum=8B5E1czuOww8t11UpeEi14gVG%2Buh%2FjrWW4c1HK7rv%2BQ%3D#reader-link" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> So we should probably work on the Stereotypes and Criticisms sections for now. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 05:09, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The fetish of Asian women as little petite submissive cuties ("Nadeshiko Yamato"being the term for the submissive Asian (Japanese)woman ideal ) has its basic origin in the Asian women's anthropological feminine pedomorphous traits. In contrast to that it is not possible feature Nordic virago valkyries (1,9 m,athletic)as little petite submissive cuties.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yamato was used to mean the spirit of Japanese imperialism in. The phrase "Yamato Nadeshiko" was coined during WWII to denote a woman who was completely subservient to her husband but ready to die defending her home and honor from Western aggression. There is no height requirement This ideal was used as imperialistic propaganda to foster nationalism during wartime. It has parallels in the expected conduct of the noblewoman in medieval Europe, who was expected to serve her husband when he was present and to maintain the household when he was away. This concept is by no means exclusive to Japanese or Asian culture. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 03:53, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is usual in history that a much older concept is labeled relatively late (here in a time when the behaviour of the women became problematic and should be redirected to tradition).While the social position of women in Europe was relatively high, the position in Islam, Jewry and Eastern Asia was very low. Women have been thought to be "unclean" in many Asian countries and are not allowed to touch Buddhist monks e.g.Undoubtedly the Asian "Nadeshiko Yamato" signifies a femininity and submissiveness which is unique in the world.As it is a metaphorical name for the fetishized women it should be included here ( Nadeshikos are e.g. shown in "The last samurai" or "You only live twice").</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problems with this article</span></h2>
<p>Over the past few weeks, this article has developed some serious problems. An anon editor (IP 80.138.xxx.xxx) has systematically been adding highly questionable material to it. At first his stuff was reverted by <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeAnswers_dc5d.html" title="User:ThreeAnswers">ThreeAnswers</a> and OneViewHere and there was discussion (above) about including the material. It was noted that this anon has made problem edits on the subject of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virago.html" title="Virago">Virago</a> in both the English and German <i>Wikipedias</i>. The anon has described himself as both a German soldier who "lost two fingers at Stalingrad" and an "anthropology professor." If you think about it for a minute, he cannot be both. An examination of his sources reveals that the material he keeps adding to the articles is about equally valid. Sources he regularly uses, such as R. Knussmann and v. Eickstedt are not acceptable references. They both present theories of race that have not gained acceptance in anthropology. While widely adopted by white supremacists, they are not suitable for an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>The article is in need of major repairs. It now has two reference sections in the middle and several questionable sections. I will proceed to edit it and hope to get some cooperation from the regular editors. Oh, yes, and please, lets all try to keep in mind the dictum: <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Don't feed the trolls</a>! <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 18:48, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now the Rubenstein gang even denies my existence and biography. Funny stuff, isn't it? Your lies don't become more credible with further repetitions. Have you never thought of the possibility that there is a brilliant German granny scientist with unique experience sitting in the back-office being superior to you by far&#160;? Many German anthropologists were in the Wehrmacht or the Ahnenerbe, even v.Eickstedt continued his career in Germany after 1945.Why&#160;? Because inofficially all liked to cooperate with this country's excellent scientists who invented the atomic bomb, the atomic rocket, the jet and the carrier, which fought its enemies bravely and had by far the best anthropologists being the home of physical anthropology beside France. <small>‚Äî<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 80.138.174.234 (talk&#160;‚Ä¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.138.174.234_ca12.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.138.174.234">contribs</a>) 20:35, 28 January 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

Martin, Saller and Knu√ümann are all listed as <a href="../../../../de/a/n/t/Anthropologie.html" class="extiw" title="de:Anthropologie">Ber√ºhmte Anthropologen</a> in the Anthropologie article. There is a 1990 biography entitled <i>Der Anthropologe Rudolf Martin</i>. John Baker Randal was a professor at Oxford. To dismiss these authors as questionable would be akin to claiming that Aristotle is a fraud because parts of his <i>Physics</i> have been invalidated. It would be incorrect to say that the sources present theories of race which have not gained acceptance in anthropology; rather, they are theories which have either been discredited as pseudoscience or have otherwise fallen out of favor among modern anthropologists. Nevertheless, since they are relevant to the historical context of the article, they should be included in their proper context, and so long as sufficient counterarguments from modern anthropologists are provided afterwards.</p>
<ul>
<li>As you correctly state, these theories have been discredited. To use them without peer review and discussion from a recognized journal would be unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So long as the article both accurately reflects and does not assert the truth of Knu√ümann's work, it should be an acceptable reference for the section. However, I do agree that the anthropological material should be constrained to the anthropology section, and should not appear in any sections after that, as this material is not relevant outside of so-called classical anthropology. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 23:58, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The heading "Classical anthropology" is incorrect since Knussmann is not a classical anthropologist. Moveover, his work is not accepted in mainstream anthropology. To include it in such a way as to be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> would require inclusion of the work of several other anthropologists. But this is not an article on anthropology and, as you have said, you are not an anthropologist. I appreciate your efforts to attempt to edit the section to make it readable, but I think you are missing the point. As noted in my edit summary, the way it was written, constitues <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. I am therefore removing it.

<p>As I understand it, Knu√ümann was the institute director for human biology at the University of Hamburg. He was an editor of the <i>Journal of Comparative Human Biology</i> from 1990 to 1998. Those fall well within the realm of anthropology. As you must be well aware, I have already said at least three times in this very talk page that the article should include counterarguments from modern anthropologists in order to maintain NPOV. It's possible, however, that you may be misunderstanding the idea of original research. The 1914 manual by Martin and Saller was considered authoritative in their day. Knu√ümann used his 1996 book as teaching material at the University of Hamburg (which caused a student protest, in fact). There is no dispute that the manual contains a wealth of valid physical anthropological information. Simply put, the POV nature of the section at present is itself quite correctable and is not grounds for deletion.</p>
<ul>
<li>It <i>is</i> original research because the work of Knussmann and others work has not been accurately sumarized in this article. You will need to provide direct quotes in order to use these references. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, those of us familiar with postcolonial studies will understand the importance of including late 19th and early 20th century anthropological research within the historical context of the fetishism of the Other in Western Europe. If you wish to invite an actual anthropologist like Rubenstein to revise any inaccuracies and to help provide NPOV, then I would of course be happy; however, if you wish to dispute the fact that anthropological studies played a role in the construction of stereotypes of Asians, then you would need to provide references to back that claim. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 01:38, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sunray, you sound like a very reasonable person so far. However, I'm not exactly sure what it is that you want. If you were to read through, say, <a href="http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:dZcJoKACyzYJ:schwule.asta.uni-hamburg.de/rass_wise9798.html+%22rainer+knu%C3%9Fmann%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox-a|" class="external text" title="http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:dZcJoKACyzYJ:schwule.asta.uni-hamburg.de/rass_wise9798.html+%22rainer+knu%C3%9Fmann%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox-a|" rel="nofollow">this article</a> harshly summarizing Knu√ümann's <i>Lehrbuch</i>, you will find that the anonymous editor has done a fairly good job at presenting what Knu√ümann has to say accurately enough. You wanted direct quotations, you have been provided with direct quotations. Furthermore, we have agreed that there is a lack of alternate points of view, but I expected that you must be aware that according to the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#What_to_do_with_a_problem_page.2Fimage.2Fcategory" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a>, POV issues are not problems that require deletion.</p>
<p>Now, I can cite sources on cultural relativism that present a different point of view and ignore Knu√ümann's type of research and I can cite sources like <i>Wissenschaftlicher Rassismus</i> which directly criticizes Knu√ümann; or I can sit here and argue with you over whether or not we should delete this section; but I simply do not have the time or effort to do both. If your goal is to get this material off the internet at all costs, then I can't say that I would agree with you, but if you do want to help improve this article by expanding on the section and helping to provide a more balanced POV, then you must know that I have already given you my support in that endeavor. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 18:30, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wzhao553: I'm not sure where you get the idea that POV problems are not problems that require deletion. That is not what the link you provided above states.

<dd>Sunray, if you had actually looked at the link that I had provided, you will find that it says that a problem in which "Article is biased or has lots of POV" should be handled by adding an <i>npov</i> or <i>POV check</i> tag, as it is a problem <b>that does not require deletion</b>. Perhaps you are forgetting that Wikipedia is a public encyclopedia that everybody should contribute to, or perhaps you have simply failed to understand anything that has been written so far. Whatever the reason, it is clear that you have some personal issues with the anonymous editor that I truthfully do not care about. I would advise that you handle this in a private discussion with him, and leave those who are working on improving articles alone.</dd>

<dd>For the last time, the anthropology section <b>will stay</b>. When discussing racism against Asians, the citation of racist sources is not only necessary but also encouraged. If you were to refuse to see this, then, by denying that racist anthropology was ever influential or ever took place, you would be openly racist against Asians as well. Also, the presentation of these sources must be made as strong as possible, without asserting the truth or falsity of the positions. It is immediately necessary to the topic. Moreover, the anonymous editor has never denied that the sources are racist; he simply wants the research expressed. Your complete failure to understand this is a personal issue which you need to work out on your own, and which should not spill over into useless argument on this talk page. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 04:51, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wzhao, I disagree. The way the article is structured now, the anthropology section DOMINATES the article. It's the frist topic listed after the definition of Asian Fetish and it's length is far greater than any other part of the article. By adding that section you have completely changed the focus of the article away from its original intent. If you feel you must include it as an contrasting point of view, then I think the length and scope of the anthropology section needs to be drastically pared down so that it is in proportion with the rest of the article.

<dd>Sunray,the concept of "Asian Fetish" is definitely a valid one, as it does exist and is perpetrated against Asians every day in this country. The whole anthopology section though, is questionable in it's value to the article. Racist anthropology like the one quoted by this Virago wackjob falls into the same realm of research as the authors of that book "The Bell Curve" which tried to claim that blacks are naturally less intelligent than other races. Should an article on black racism use "The Bell Curve" as an explanation of why some people are racist against blacks? This article is taking a bizarre direction and the fault lies with this racist German "anthropology professor" who is trying to expand the scope of the article in directions that are not relevant nor applicable to the topic at hand.OneViewHere 19:46, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello, Wzhao533. For our pertinent and excellent anthropology section, I am now called a "wackjob" and a "racist" by the Rubenstein group again. Those about 20 people described on silsor's page see now that they cannot control the wikipedia any more because more and more people stop to tolerate their censorship.To put it in a greater context, some "groups" have a vital interest in the manipulation of the media which is c r u c i a l for their own survival.80.138.193.187 21:33, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have decided today (on 30th of January 2006) to take over the about 50 most important strategic articles in the wikipedia and to break the censorship on my own. Others are heartly welcomed to join me if their time allows it. From now on will dedicate 14 hours a day to reach this goal. Among the strategic articles is e.g. "relativity theory" where I will contribute unique critical material."Atonal music" and "Ludwig van Beethoven" have just been edited by me. It will take the Rubenstein group now many experts in many fields including some translators for German, French and numerous other languages to cope with this new situation.80.138.193.187 21:44, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

As best I can make out you are a right-wing conspiracy theorist who engages in stream-of-consciousness rants against Jews and "leftist articles". Your tin-foil-hat musings are not appropriate for this article. And most importantly, the fact that you are fancying the idea of "Taking upon yourself" to correct what you perceive are biases in some articles shows that you are not willing to engage in the Wikipedia community in developing a consensus or act in good faith. It's obvious that you are here to promote a personal agenda, not engage in dialogue. OneViewHere 22:29, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, just wanted to say, fascinating stuff in the anthropology part of the article, should be expanded, it could also include some stuff from Steve Sailer, a well-known internet author. Real racial differences are the basis for the interracial trends of having more white male/Asian female and black male/white female pairs than vice versa, that is also my firm opinion. I'm also German, by the way.</dd>

<dd>Here is a well-known piece by Steve Sailer on the subject that should be incorporated into the article:</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why anthropology matters</span></h2>
<p>Very briefly and without lengthy justifications. The Neomarxist, postcolonialist view of "Asian fetishism" is that it is the process by which Asians are invested with stereotypes such as submissiveness, innocence, femininity, etc. In short, to fetishize is to trivialize and stereotype. To understand Asian fetishism is to understand (sexual) stereotypes of Asians. So we need to understand where the stereotypes come from. One proposal is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Asian fetishism means accepting stereotypes of Asians as reality.</li>
<li>Stereotypes come from folk anthropology.</li>
<li>Folk anthropology comes from physical anthropology.</li>
</ol>
<p>We include work such as Knu√ümann's because it reflects folk anthropology. For example, if we were to go out and ask the first 100 people we meet whether they think that</p>
<ol>
<li>Asian women are more feminine than women of other races, and</li>
<li>Southeast Asian women are physically more childlike than women of other races,</li>
</ol>
<p>then we would see that Knu√ümann's theory resonates well with folk anthropology. There exists convincing evidence (which I will not provide here) that people do think like this.</p>
<p>Thus, according to this view, a discussion of folk and physical anthropology necessarily precedes discussion of stereotypes, which themselves are at the core of fetishism. This is why I placed the anthropology section above the stereotypes section. Also, note that I'm assuming here that the article has a terminology section which reflects postcolonialist definitions. Nevertheless, it is correct to state that the Stereotypes section should be the centerpiece of this entry. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 23:33, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These differences really do exist, regarding paedomorphy for example, even in a place like China, if you look at the Southwestern provinces like Guangxi you already have women with very paedomorphic facial characteristics (high forehead, small noses etc.).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding femininity, Asians tend to have less muscle mass on average and commit fewer crimes, show less violent behaviour etc., signs of low levels of testosterone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Websites like modelminority.com only take sociological factors into account, while ignoring possible biological racial differences that may make wm-af couples and bm-wf couples more likely than other way round.</dd>

<dd>Asians commit fewer crimes? Less violent behavior on average? Where are you getting these insipid generalizations? They sounds like the "model minority" stereotype that many Whites like to thrust on Asians. Was the Kmer Rouge non-violent? How about the Japanese soldiers who fought in WWII? Were they known for their submissiveness? Any kinds of behaviorial claims would have to take into account cultural factors regardless. You're essentially arguing that there is a biological basis for violent or "manly" behavior". You might as well take it to the logical extreme and say that Jews are naturally greedy and Blacks are naturally violent because it's just in their "nature". Does this sort of racist psuedo-science have any place in this article? There are plenty of Asian Americans who have grown up in America and are just as aggressive, violent, and testosterone-pumped as the average American male (unfortunately!) Human behavior for any particular race spans the entire spectrum and to claim a genetic basis for this is exactly the type of racist thinking that led to Hitler's rise to power. As a German, I'm sure you are familiar with Hitler.OneViewHere 00:13, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look at the "Color of Crime" report which circulates the internet and is based on FBI crime statistics. Asian Americans actually commit fewest crimes, especially violent crimes. Asian countries like Japan and Korea are also well known for very low crime rates. The communists you are talking about were about politics and not regular "Tookie Williams" type street crime, which is strongly related to testosterone levels, just look at the universally much lower violent crime rates of women compared to men. You also have to differenciate between recognizing racial differences on the one hand and racial hatred on the other. I do not condone racial hatred in any way, in contrast to many folks on Asian American websites like modelminority, by the way.</dd>

<dd>Your ignorance is painful. Just painful. There are many, MANY reasons why the crime rate for Asian Americans is lower than for other demographic groups. Culture plays a big factor. Asian culture emphasizes harmony. That doesn't mean that Asians are genetically predisposed to passiveness. It is a learned, cultural behavior. Also if you want to compare Asian crime rates to American "Street crime", -America leads the world in "street crime", so any comparison is flawed. Europe has a lower rate of crime than America does too. There are other reasons: Immigration is self-selecting. (educated people immmigrate). Educated Asian Americans as a group have higher rates of income and richer people committ less crime. etc. etc. Basically what I see coming from your mouth is an endless stream of racist stereotypes. Your thinkly veiled Tookie Williams "Street crime" euphemism is obviously your way of saying "BLACK CRIME". You're about as racist as they come.OneViewHere 00:34, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I'm sorry Mr. Political Correctness, screaming "racism" won't make racial differences go away, just as screaming "sexism" won't make men and women the same. Also culture reflects biology, the passive, diligent and family-oriented biology of Asians makes for a corresponding culture. Immigrants don't generally have lower crime rates, only Asian immigrants do.</dd>

<dd>If you were actually a real professor, then you would know that immigration is self-selecting. This is, only the most industrious people are willing to emmigrate to a different country. Lazy Asians ain't gonna pack up their bags, get up off the couch and move to a different country. And a high percentage of Asian immigrants are college-educated professionals. They don't reflect the entire Asian demographic. So to draw BEHAVIORAL conclusions from a biased sample is the worst science possible. If you really think Asians are passive, then the obvious truth is that you don't know very many Asians, if any. You're just regurgitating the same racial stereotypes that western media has been perpetuating for over a hundred years. You don't have an original thought in your head.OneViewHere 08:02, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Asians in Asia tend to show rather similar behaviour, but sure there are cultural differences to a degree, and there is also selective immigration, I don't doubt that. Still Asians in Asia show many of the same behavioural traits, I would say they are at least as hard-working as Asian Americans, for example. Passivity was only meant to a relative degree, of course there are hyperactive Asians, just relative to other groups they appear somewhat more passive on average.</dd>

<dd>You're neglecting many factors that contribute to the phenomenon of AF-WM. One huge one is economics. White males from Europe and America are generally much wealthier than the average citizen of an Asian country. Wealth, combined with social/racial stereotypes and fetishism are the main factors at work here. The ridiculous argument that the psuedo-anthropologists are trying to make here is easily disproved by the mere fact that many of these Asian women who date white men are dating white men who are small in stature, lacking in social skills, and can for all intents and purposes be called "nerds". These men have the same physical stature (oftentimes less) than the average Asian man, so this is where their theory falls flat on its face. Physical stature can be considered ONE factor, but not the definitive factor. As it stands now, the anthropology section is given more importance in the article that it deserves as it's relevance is minor when all other factors are taken into account.

<p>Sure, but we can't assert the truth or falsity of biological differences contributing to marriage disparity, since that's just one (some might say, unabashedly racist) view among many. As we all know, according to the cultural relativists (aka mainstream anthropology), biological differences don't matter. As for me, I'm just puzzled as to why people here think that this line of research has no followers; and as for Sailer, he's no anthropologist, but it wouldn't hurt to include his now-infamous article in the external links. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 00:23, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wzhao553 said: "We include work such as Knu√ümann's because it reflects folk anthropology." This sort of generalization is problematic. Knaussman's work is marginal <i>because it is not supported</i> by folk anthropology (which, by the way is a branch of <i>social anthropology</i>, not physical anthropology). While there are many studies on racial prejudice between cultures, Asian fetishism goes against the very strong tendency in human societies to fear and mistrust people from other cultures That is why Knussman's work must be handled with caution.

<dd>Yes, I understand and agree with this statement. I would still argue that the average European citizen accepts the stereotype that Asian women are more feminine and childlike as a reality.

<p>Let's be honest, being supported by Steve Sailor means that it is nothing but bunk. Now as for testosterone levels, they are highly variable with environmental conditioning. To deny environmental conditioning is the mark of the mediocre person, one who believes themself capable of just this much and no more no matter what circumstances would be thrust upon them, one who has proscribed themselves from being the apple of the eye of mainstream society, and perhaps also one who does not wish to see others succeed.

<p>The anthropology section stands for itself. Are there any scientific well-supported objections to it&#160;?Mr Phil, Wzhao533 and me are respectable scholars of medicine, humanities and anthropology and we have given very,very detailed information to you.By the way, the anthropology section is unique on the net as e.g. Mr.Phil's warm comment is a hint for ("fascinating").I will now go on eliminating the bias in the about 50 strategic articles in the English wikipedia on my own. Others are heartly welcome to join me.I have just improved "Ludwig van Beethoven ", "atonal music" and "relativity theory".And it will take the opposing group a lot of experts in different fields including translators to cope with it.I look back on more than 60 years of scientific experience being a member of the Ahnenerbe,too.As I have said above, my intents were always benign to humanity. My opposing the oversimplifying Anti-Asian Nazi racialism in the very dangerous letter to Himmler in 1938 is more than any indivual could have achieved.Given the fact it had changed the plans of Himmler it could have saved the lifes of millions of people. Not too unlikely as Himmler was totally irrational.It was clear to me from the beginning that there is something as individualty. Race is only one constituent of the human, sex and individualty are the two others. Nevertheless, all constituents are very significant.As I share Beethoven's ideals, my vision is a community of all people. But as many scientists and artists have shown us, this is a utopia with only a small chance to be realized. War, fight, rape and greed and average humans determine the human existence.The expeditions to Tibet in 1934,1935 and 1937 in which I took part showed me the attractiveness of the central Sinid women in the Himalaya. Of course, if you google for "Nazi Tibet expedition" you will find that the scientists don't know anything about those mentioned expeditions. Furthermore , I have many files in my archive the NARA would be keen to get. Now, I am a fit, but a very old man. And as the racial model doesn't determine everything, the model that members of the SS or the Ahnenerbe were all gangsters, is not correct. I was called Nazi by you, but I have never been a party member nor did I belong to the Ahnenerbe when it was integrated in the SS. There is never a collective guilt or a simple yes or no, good or bad. As the German Nikolaus von Kues has put it, there is a "coincidentia oppositorum" in everything, one of the deepest thoughts of man.

I don't mean to be rude but I rather doubt you are who you say you are, mr. ww2 dinosaur. Moving on, the fascinations of an individual are not able to be extended to the world, otherwise they would not be treated as fantastical escapes from the regular world. After all, everyone has their own wishes, and there are some that seem mighty strange to others. When explaining the world the truth is the only admissible, not wishful thinking. Not everything can be known right away, how could we presume to explain the entire universe already? we must be comfortable with ambiguity.Heaven's knight 05:43, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is nothing but bunk. For the truth, one needs a real brain, and one who is objective. There are interpretations here that are not supported by the evidence; instead, everything is setup into a nice fantasy story for racists. The whiny insistence on fact is a nice touch&#160;:P. Musculature is hardly a fact, lol, penile size is unknown and imo impossible, testicular volume is unknown and imo impossible, baldness is unknown, life expectancy and perhaps to a lesser extent chronic disease are extremely dependent upon environmental factors. The assumption of negative things, insistence on making it true, willful overlooking of environmental factors, all speak to a troubled mind and wishful thinking. For a white person to fail in white society, that person is a failure indeed.Heaven's knight 05:44, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS I personally have very high testosterone, gigantic balls indeed, however like other asians my facial chest and body hair is not especially pronounced. I can grow goatee like those Qin terracotta statues and burns but not a santa claus beard.. although there are east asians who do, of course they are rare. However, this has not prevent me from and naturally, many East Asians from assuming a masculine body type with well developed musculature, and furthermore, I am supersexy.

<p>This is unnecessary; testosterone has many variables affecting it. One of true capability will recognize this. Furthermore assuming testosterone is so observable in the population there is no reason to assume that Asians have any less testosterone. This is nothing but mud slinging of a racist from the majority population. From a mediocre person who couldn't make it in their own mainstream society.Heaven's knight 05:47, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well again, as before, I think that we need to present the <i>Testosterone</i> section as strongly as possible. As it stands, it'll be far too easy just to ridicule the position of making simplistic, exaggerated claims based on narrow (possibly biased, possibly incorrect) physical evidence, then presenting some equally simplistic, exaggerated counterexamples, and then moving on. Concluding that all white males have larger testicles than all East Asians, on the basis of one study by one person on a small group of Hong Kong and Danish males 20 years ago is just plain bad science. Claiming that East Indians have "physical characteristics more similar to Whites" especially without citations and in a supposed connection to testosterone is just laughable anthropology. If we write a <i>Testosterone</i> section containing parts that are this easy to dismiss as childish pseudoscience, then we might as well not write it at all. I at least tried to make Knu√ümann sound presentable; I hope you'll do the same here. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 05:02, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Try the Steve Sailer article "Is love Colorblind?". Basically higher testosterone levels of Whites leads to an enhanced sex dimorphism of wm-af couples compared to am-wf couples regarding muscularity, aggression etc. For the same reasons you practically don't have any Asian men with Black women.</p>

<dd>The stats are based on FBI statistics, if you want to, you can also get the stats directly from the FBI, American Renaissance just compiled them. But I guess the FBI is White supremacist, since their statistics say Asians commit fewer crimes, that sure makes sense.</dd>

<dd>Oh BTW, do some reading. One factor in the "lower Asian crime rate" is that much crime committed by asians is against other asians and many Asian immigrants are reluctant to go to the police due to a historical distrust of police from their homeland as well as a language barrier. Therefore much Asian crime goes UNREPORTED. Crminals generally prey on their own communities. So you'd better come up with some new facts, because this one is just about out of gas.OneViewHere 00:45, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Transitive Reasoning</span></h2>
<p>I see a lot of spurrious transitive reasoning going on here. ie, if A = B and C = D, then A must equal D. This is false. example. Dr. Phil is claiming that Asian American's lower crime rate is "proof" of their passiveness. This is faulty logic. There are many reasons why Asian crime rate may be lower:</p>
<p>1. Immigration is self-selective. Only industrious and educated people have the financial means to emmigrate to another country. Income and educational levels directly correspond with crime rates. But as Blacks have according to some authorities a mean IQ of 70 (lynn,IQ and the wealth of nations), race and wealth are corresponding relatively well at the moment.80.138.192.206 02:11, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>2. Many Asian criminals prey on their own communities. ie, their victims are Asian. Asian immigrants often do not trust the police and often have a language barrier. Therefore much Asian crime goes unreported. But environmentalists say, too, that the extreme cohesiveness of , e.g. the Sinocentrism, prevents a lot of intra-cultural aggression.80.138.192.206 02:11, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>3. The term "Asian" encompasses numerous racial groups, languages, and cultures. This segmentation means that oftentimes Asians are "the only Asian in the area". Being segmented by race, language, and geography is a disincentive for crime. And unlike other European immigrant groups whose language is based on the Latin Romance language and whose apparence can essentially pass for "white", Asian immigrants stand out.</p>
<p><br />
"Mongolid", "Mongoloid " , "Mongoliform "are sufficient Eickstedtian "Trivialnamen" as numerously explained by me before (and in the anthro-section, see Knu√ümann 1996, too).80.138.192.206 02:11, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So quoting Asian crime statistics really doesn't prove what Dr. Phil is trying to claim. Simplying a complex topic such as crime rates and using it to apply to "Asian Fetishism" is clearly inappropriate.OneViewHere 00:57, 2 February 2006 (UTC). Really&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually I assume that the real East Asian crime rates are even lower than the FBI statistics suggest, since Asian groups that have higher crime rates are grouped alongside East Asians like Koreans, Japanese and Chinese under the rubric "Asian", thereby statistically inflating East Asian crime rates.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>But also, let's say the Black crime rates are lower as there is a general uncertainty in crime stats.80.138.192.206 02:11, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>

<p>Sheridan Prasso is a dolichocranious leptomorph virago, obviously of mainly Jewish descent (Armenoid). She herself is a good example of the correctness of my edits on race and the virago. She competes with males in a male world. She is envious of the Asian femininity,but not for the femininity itself , only for the attention it is paid to by Westerners.She obviously tries to play the woman teacher for the "deviant" European males in revenge, as she only presents them as "sick".Of course, she also has only the best intentions.It is time to re-establish the virago article.The virago article is a logical necessity out of this article (the "antipodes" to the Asian women on the F-M-line)).All others are heartly welcome to help me in building the new Shangri-La in the wikipedia.80.138.192.206 12:18, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

There are hundreds of millions of viragines,too, like the virago Jewess Prasso who is envious of the Asian women's impact on many Western males (the basic envy is the penis envy of the virago, not of the woman as Freud misinterpreted that).It is time to re-establish the virago article as a direct consequence of this article.Everybody is invited to join me .80.138.192.206 20:02, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Who has created and improved civilization&#160;? Western Europid men.Of the 1000 greatest inventions, ca. 990 were made by Europids.And the leftists deny the comparability of culture at all and the uniqueness of their creators and improvers. But why don't they all go back to the Savannah and dismiss computers and mobile phones and TVs? My improving this article is such a cultural improving in a hostile environment.Of course,the article can get much better , but it is scientifically seen the best stuff on the whole net in the moment.80.138.192.206 20:13, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You mean, who has raped and destroyed countless civilizations (including some Bolschewik Jews)? Whites killed off the Native American Indians (and Jews are profitting now from this as they didn't have to do the major efforts of colonizing America). Whites attacked China simply so they could continue selling Opium (and e.g. the Rothschilds and the Sephardic Sassoons in Shanghai earned a lot of money with it). Whites killed millions of Jews, Gypsies, and ethnic minorities in the Holocaust. (Jewish and Jewishly inspired communists killed 80 million people during the 20th century according to the Black Book of communism,world record ).I wouldn't be so quick to go tooting the horn of white men. It's pretty obvious now that not only are you a white supremacist, but you are a sexist one as well.Please do not call people who believe in the inequality of races and the sexes in only doing descriptive science this way.OneViewHere 20:31, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This statement is patently false:</p>
<p>"The higher average life expectancies of women and East Asians, fewer incidences of prostate cancer and coronary heart disease among East Asians"</p>
<p>Asian heart disease ranges from 20-27% in the article that Dr. Phil linked to. This range mirrors the rate of heart disease among whites. It's ridiculous to point to this as an indication of testosterone levels anways, because the single biggest factor in heart disease is DIET. The American white diet is much higher in fat than a typical Asian diet. And there have been studies that have shown that as 2nd and 3rd generation Asians assimilate into American culture, their rates of heart disease have risen as they eat more and more American food. Also, heart disease rates can be directly correlated with income levels. For example: Poor black americans who have a poor diet and can only afford to eat cheap fast food are naturally going to have higher rates of heart disease. Dr. Phil's link doesn't support his contentions and should be removed. OneViewHere 20:31, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The report I linked to gives a 1995 age-adjusted death rate from coronary heart disease of 62,6 per 100000 for Asian Americans and 107,9 for the general population.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here is the report I linked to in the article:</dd>
<dd><a href="http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/aapi_slds/download/aapislds.pdf" class="external free" title="http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/aapi_slds/download/aapislds.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/aapi_slds/download/aapislds.pdf</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course other factors besides testosterone levels are involved like smoking, diabetes etc. and the report also states that Asian Americans engage in less physical exercise than the general population. If you factored out these additional risk factors, the differences would presumably increase even more in favor of Asians, since Asian men tend to be relatively heavy smokers.</dd>

<dd>Diet is THE main factor in heart disease. And you're comparing one ethnic group against the "general population", which includes black americans who have high rates of heart disease due to poverty. A more accurate study would compare Asian Americans who were born in America against whites with similar income levels. Also, I don't know how a report could quantify how much physical activity the average Asian male engages in. Did they do a poll? I wonder if the pollsters called non-english speaking households. So does that mean they had Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Hmong, Vietnamese, Laotion, and Phillipino speaking pollsters? Somehow, I doubt it.143.127.3.10 23:44, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

None of the sources he provides have any relevance whatsoever to the claims being made; neither are the claims linked logically to the main theory.

The testosterone and anthropology parts are the only parts written by the user Dr. Phil and you, the German professor who has stated in this discussion forum that "Jews control Wikipedia", that women fighting for equal rights are "whiny feminists", and that "White men are responsible for most of the important inventions in the world". Dr. Phil refuses to addresses the obvious claim that his links have absolutely nothing to do with testosterone, and the issue of testosterone itself has absolutely nothing to do with the topic of this article.

Why does Knu√ümann, the former president (!)of the German Scientific Society (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,internationally respected no.1 organization in Germany, expert in the John F. Kennedy murder (!))and doyen of the German anthropology , repeat these claims in his unique manual 1996&#160;? Do you not think that Knu√ümann has mentally suffered enough from the unsubstantiated attacks on him by leftists&#160;? Don't you think it is incredible that juvenile leftists can block a whole branch of science (e.g. Asta- Hamburg ) and now justice must be done to him by us all?80.138.192.206 01:49, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For four years, you could wipe away any criticism, but now as some top-class scientists have entered the stage, it's getting quite hard for you.Dr. Phil is an exceptional specialist in his field, me being a former member of the Ahnenerbe with unique knowledge and experience. I know you have really good intentions. And as Immanuel Kant said the intentions are important, too.But you must read much, much more and much , much more experience. Infinity0, I can understand you, you feel offended as a 16 year old Chinese boy. But please take into consideration that I have a high esteem of Mongolids in general (see above).I invite everybody to help us in building a new Shangri-La in the wikipedia.80.138.192.206 01:58, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The direct consequence of Knu√ümann's theory, as is proven in the section itself, is that Asian fetish is a social substitute for pedophilia in Western society. If you take the reasoning one more step, if people are attracted to Asians because they look like children, then those same people are attracted to childlike features. But the point is that they only look like children. Children are the real thing, Asians are just the simulacra. However, there are laws against pedophilia, but not against Asian fetish. Hence, Asian fetish must be a social substitute for pedophilia in Western society; and according to Knu√ümann's logic, all Caucasians who are intensely attracted to Asian women must be racist pedophiles. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 02:27, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Simulacrum&#160;? 70% of the Mongolid women (Nesid subrace) aged 30 look younger concerning anthro- pometric traits than 98% of the Nordic women (e.g.Dalofalid subrace) at the age of 12 (!).The paedomorphosis of a majority of Mongolid female adults is greater that than of Western children (!). So one could conclude that paedomorphosis is a substitute for Asiaphilia.Please do not call Asiaphiles racists, as the belief in the Mongolid women's superiority concerning femininity (i.e. this case paedomorphosis) is e.g. supported by Ashley Montagu and"goldsea.com", which photo-anaylzes Asian beauty in detail.80.138.172.139 11:33, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yesterday , a vandal with the IP 193... number destroyed the whole talk page shortly after a comment of mine. I think it was infinity0 getting angry due to my comment. Please excuse for your behaviour, because it should not be a web admin's behaviour to do technical sabotage as vandalism in its purest sense..80.138.172.139 12:13, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You all forget the major point which I will introduce: Millions of Western males have been rejected and kicked in the ass by racially Europid virago females due to their "uglyness","poverty" or Weltanschauung after years of struggle. Then the men turned to the Mongolid women with statistically overwhelming mutual satisfaction.Pedophilia does not play a major part in it.Western viragos behavior is a hubris which must be eliminated.One way is their self-exclusion from reproduction via the Asian fetish racially softening future females.So , the Asian fetish is very healthy race politics which must be supported by all means.When America has to withdraw from Europe in 30 years, there will be a Northern Europid-Mongolid master race dominating the world as in Harvard even today.

<hr />
<p>This whole article is nothing more than an anonymous contributor's attempt to use wikipedia to propogate a pet theory of his. He cites published sources, some by people who are considered at best marginal minorities in their field, usually drawing on out-dated research and clinging to theories and models long rejected by their colleagues. Moreover, the anonymous user strings together these references to create his own argument, which is a violation of NOR. He originally created an article dedicated to his pet theory. It was eventually proposed for deletion and was then deleted. Now he is using this article to un-do a very recent deletion of his crank theory, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Virago&amp;diff=37994467&amp;oldid=36630989" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Virago&amp;diff=37994467&amp;oldid=36630989" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 14:34, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Assistance professor Steve Rubenstein</span></h2>
<p>Assistance professor Steve Rubenstein (Athens,Ohio), author of the previous comment, has been alleged to be the leader of a leftist cabal in the "wikipedia" of at least 10 people , see e.g. webadmin's "user:silsor"'s (Mr.Bonham's) page who has himself nothing to do with those allegations, but considered them to be worth reporting.Mr.Rubenstein, as numerous others can testify, is trying to ban the virago/Asian fetish concept totally.As a Boasian scientist (see his publications and statements) he is part of a quite doubtful scientific tradition (see e.g. Kevin MacDonald,The Culture of Critique,2002).Now, Mr. Rubenstein has escalated the manipulation as he even refuses to tolerate to report the virago /Asian fetish concept as a major concept which has been contained in the world-famous Martin-Saller -Knu√ümann manual since 1914.No other Boasian dared to deny this concept. E.g. the very influential Meyer's Konversationslexikon 1888 under the name "Mannweib" featured it (digitalized online ).There is an overwhelming amount of evidence.- That denial is comparable to denying other concepts or events , such as the Holocaust or the Nazi racialist concepts, and is aiming at similar goals as Sheridan Prasso does (being herself a virago)&#160;: to undermine the respectability of decent Europeans. 80.138.172.139 19:43, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"...However, it remains undisputed that differences between races exist, even beyond simple appearences. Interestingly enough, there appears to be a sub-population of non-Asian, typically Caucasian, women with a fetish for Asian men. However, this is more pronounced in Central and Eastern Europe, and less so in North America. In Canada and the UK, there seems to have been a shift over the last decade for Caucasian men to fetishize South Asian women as opposed to East Asian women. This is prevalent in the Canadian media, where East Asian women are no longer the dominant "non-white" females portrayed in the Canadian media. In the UK, the presence of South Asian female anchors has been the norm for decades. In Canadian television news stations, virtually all of the female anchors of East Asian descent, who were somewhat numerous a decade ago, have been completely replaced by female anchors of South Asian descent."</p>

<p>Maybe even the masculine men are getting more feminine (worked on by feminism) and get more interested in the somewhat harder Indid women according to Hartmann's theory.Or those people who own the media want to divert from the Eastern Asian women due to political reasons as part of an east-west shift back to the Nordid walkyries.80.138.158.108 01:55, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
