<dd><b>Asian values</b> was a concept popular in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, which argued for a unique set of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asian</a> institutions and political ideologies, involving <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarian.html" title="Authoritarian">authoritarian</a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collectivism.html" title="Collectivism">collectivism</a> in the belief that it was superior to Western values of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Individualism.html" title="Individualism">individualism</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think that your version quite accurately describes the situation. While some Western European states might be more "welfare states" than the East Asian ones, in many ways, the East Asian states were more "welfare states" than the United States. Besides, all the states—Western European, American, <i>and</i> East Asian—all practiced free-market capitalism.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Countries like Hong Kong, Singapore and even South Korea are arguably more capitalist than the United States. One of the core tenets of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong is the introduction of some welfare services, for example.</dd>
<dd>Also, your own version suffers from the inclusion of terms like "collectivism" and "individualism", which, besides being ambiguous, might be incorrectly used here (many would argue that democracy, with its emphasis on <i>power to the people</i>, is much more "collectivist" than an authoritarian dictatorship, especially when that dictatorship involves one individual holding all the power).</dd>
<dd>As a compromise, I propose using only "authoritarianism" and "democracy", with no additional qualifiers. -- Mihnea Tudoreanu 13:22, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article was obviously written by someone with pro-Western tendencies. The links in particular do not incoperate any references to pro-Asian value writers, but everything for the anti-Asian value ones. I suggest a major revamping of this article.</p>

<dd>You want something non-biased? Sounds fine!

</dl>
<p>If you have a basis for those allegations, cite them please. I for one do not know of any Asian philosophy that <i>specifically advocates</i> them. I believe you mixed up the words <i>practices</i> with the word <i>values</i>, with the latter differing from the former in the sense that it has a clear-cut source with specific endorsement. Most of those 'values' you assert are nowhere confined to Asia alone, in fact, they are quite universal. It does not take a genius to figure this out and any attempt to claim otherwise by libelling a specific culture as being responsible merely casts the perpetrator as a narrow minded, racist bigot him/herself. I am not surprised you did this as it tends to be quite fashionable to do so where you are from.</p>
<p>Where I am from, racism is illegal. In places like Malaysia, it's incorporated into the constitution. Aside from racism, I don't think those other things are specifically advocated, simply widespread. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommking_d6d1.html" title="User:Commking">Commking</a> 23:51, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So where does the Philippines stand when it comes to "asian values"? I am inclined to believe that it never really took hold in the country because of the development of western style democracy(you can say that it was heavilly manipulated by the USA) in the early 20th century. This should be added, but I'm not gonna do it since this is just speculation on my part and needs references. I just wanted to have the country at least mentioned since it is arguably an exceptional asian country when it comes to "asian value".--<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicbicyclist_9335.html" title="User:Chicbicyclist">Chicbicyclist</a> 07:50, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Almost every country within Asia has been significantly affected by nationalism. It would be interesting to think about/focus more on how it is that this links into Asian values. I believe that this also has a very deep and meaningful interconnection with the position of women within such societies (either as moral arbitrators, as well as things as obvious as socially acccepted dress codes and the like). Perhaps a few (measured!) comments based upon the importance of ethnicity within Asian would be instructive.</p>

<p>Can there be a synthesis between the two; western and asian systems of thought (or set of values)?</p>
<p>I would say so as a christian atleast; love your neigbour as you love yourself, it´s an unproven proposeall that there has to to be a clash here between the loyalness to society and the freedom of the individual (and the respect for others integrity) - a freedom with respect and with a sense of responsibility for the whole of society. But this is just empty words - without the ability to bring real love with to other persons (witch I belive drove surtain philosophers to the Asian thought) - but i personally believe that this pure love only can come from God - <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agape.html" title="Agape">agape</a>. This agape could however "contamine" us if we pursue a relationship with him.</p>
<p><br />
Just some proverbs here to get you goin':</p>
<p>(Below are my own transelation from a Swedish bible version)</p>
<p>Proverbs (book in the Bible); chapter 28; vers 18:</p>
<p>Without vision (and revalation) the people perissh, delighted - is the one keeping the law. (it's from my memory of the english version of the verse)</p>
<p>[The law is - Gods commands thus both the right thing to do and the loveing thing to do. Respecting integrity - but being uncontent with how the world's caotic and the ofthen unloveing way of the people around us - and to forget the most important thing: DOING THE RIGHT THING YOURSELF (ask God for help - otherwise it atleast impossible for me to motivate myself - it's just not in me. (as said before: the problem is that we people needs gods help with doing the right thing; we just don't have the right amount of motivation; point is all seems to screw it up eventionally - thats why we need help.</p>
<p><br />
Proverbs (book in the Bible); chapter 28; vers 5</p>
<p>Ungodly men can't find out whats the right thing to do, whilst the one that seeks the Lord has insight in everything.</p>
<p>My point with quoteing this is just "pin point that:</p>
<p>The One's that has thinked things out; knows all; created everything; ought to know what the right move is to make; an ought to be able to motivate you; as he has no limits being the source of everything's - being boundless as he seems to bee. (I've personally experienced that, try it out yourself - just asking for help couldn't hurt. So try it out.)</p>

<p>This is in reference to the statement that Asian Values are not uniquely asian. These asian values are actualy quite an artificial construct. Refer to Ang and Stratton's <i>Straddling East and West: Singapore's search for a National Identity</i> Creating something as essentialy east or west is part of a process of othering which basically means smearing others with negative qualities that are opposite to the ones that we valorise. One could refer to the Amartya sen article linked to on the page for an elaboration</p>
