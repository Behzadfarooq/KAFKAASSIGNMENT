<p>I think I should apologize somewhat as I was a bit frustrated at the layout of the page and your statment that because it's "standard" it's somewhat better, when there's some doubt in my mind that it is, in fact, better in any way.</p>
<p>I see huge variation in University articles on wikipedia. When in doubt, I think that information should always come before lists which in and of themselves contain no useful information. Why wikify that entire list of non-articles? Why no lead-in text? If you're so dead-set in keeping the page the way it is, can you at least understand my feeling that the list of unwikied colleges/schools seems to indicate the END of the article rather than a subsection?</p>
<p>We can, in fact, have some variety between articles if the same major points are made in each. I looked at the Cal schools. If you'd like to make the pages more similar, I would, in fact, LOVE to see the UofA page look like the page for <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California_04ab.html" title="University of California">University of California</a>. Its organization is beautiful, flowing, and the infobox works quite well. It provides information and really adds to the article.</p>
<p>Your edits to the UofA page, however, do not quite meet that standard. It breaks up the flow of the page with non-information (it doesn't tell ME anything and I'm somewhat familiar with the breakdown of the UofA). Additionally, the list of alumni is a bit lacking in its organization. In my opinion, either the data should be well structured (simple presentation adds a lot, and HTML is a rich medium). Would you, perhaps, accept either an invisible-table list of alumni or some other better organization? Lumping it all in as a single line with just a space and dash between information makes it quite hard to understand the information contained.</p>
<p>Again, I was just a bit frustrated, but I think we both should discuss changes rather than making them on the basis of "standards" when a standard may in fact make an article LESS useful. I hope we can come to a good compromise that takes the best of both our ideas.

<p>Sure, I would greatly appreciate it if you could work on this article. There really isn't that much that you really need to know about working on the articles. There are two articles which need to be edited, however, for the article to run sufficiently. The first article is at <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_Los_Angeles_Dodgers_season_game_log_5422.html" title="2007 Los Angeles Dodgers season game log">2007 Los Angeles Dodgers season game log</a>, using the code at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Baseball_game_log_2d21.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Baseball/game log">Wikipedia:WikiProject Baseball/game log</a> to insert the data into the table. The second article is <a href="../../../2/0/0/Template%7E2007_NL_West_Standings_8ba0.html" title="Template:2007 NL West Standings">Template:2007 NL West Standings</a>, which is a template for the division standings. The second article, the NL West Standings article, I am monitoring/editing, so you don't have to worry about that one at all. However, I have added your name to the Dodgers' article. I am gonna be spending most of my time with the 4 AL West teams (Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, Texas) so I might not have as much time as I would like to work on the Dodgers' article, so I would love it if you could work on that one.</p>
<p>Secondly, you may work on any article you wish. You may work on any of the 5 unclaimed teams or any of the other 25. There is no limit to how many pages you can work on or how many people can work on any one article. Whatever you want to do is absolutely fine. <a href="../../../k/s/y/User%7EKsy92003_bc45.html" title="User:Ksy92003"><font color="green"><b>Ksy92003</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/s/y/User_talk%7EKsy92003_106c.html" title="User talk:Ksy92003"><font color="gray">talk</font></a><b>·</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ksy92003_f0da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ksy92003"><font color="gray">contribs</font></a></sup> 23:25, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry to bother you. I congratulate you for getting most (if not all) of the game logs made. I haven't looked at all of them to see if they are completed. Anyway, did you do that in Microsoft Word? Because if you do it in Microsoft Word, then the " " marks are different than those used in Wikipedia. Therefore, the aligning doesn't take effect in any of the game logs that you did. I've changed a couple to fix that, but I can't do them all. So, if you find the time, could you please go back and do the quotation marks again, making sure that they will align center? Click on "Show preview" to check before you click "Save page". Thanks for all of your contributions. <a href="../../../k/s/y/User%7EKsy92003_bc45.html" title="User:Ksy92003"><font color="green"><b>Ksy92003</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/s/y/User_talk%7EKsy92003_106c.html" title="User talk:Ksy92003"><font color="gray">talk</font></a><b>·</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ksy92003_f0da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ksy92003"><font color="gray">contribs</font></a></sup> 16:00, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alright, everything looks good so far. I've looked at only the ones that you recently made edits to, but I'm sure that if there are any more that need attention, you will be able to find them and edit them as needed. But good job on making the necessary changes to those articles. I'm not sure if the other teams have a real game log up or if it's just the template for all the other ones. Hopefully as the season progresses I can go and make the changes to those game logs, or the person who's assigned to work the articles can make those changes. Aside from that, you needn't worry about doing any of the other game logs except for the articles which you've assigned yourself to do. I don't want anybody (other than me) to have to overwork themselves. And happy opening day to you too, mate! <a href="../../../k/s/y/User%7EKsy92003_bc45.html" title="User:Ksy92003"><font color="green"><b>Ksy92003</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/s/y/User_talk%7EKsy92003_106c.html" title="User talk:Ksy92003"><font color="gray">talk</font></a><b>·</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ksy92003_f0da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ksy92003"><font color="gray">contribs</font></a></sup> 18:33, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey. We're sorting batting stats according to how they are listed on ESPN.com, which has it by batting average. On the articles at the batters stats area, there is a hidden comment saying "Sort players by Batting Average. Only list players who qualify for batting title until after season ends. On ESPN.com, for the player stats, players whose names are BOLDED indicate that they are eligible for the batting title." Because of this, we can't list the player's stats yet because everybody is eligible for the batting title. But as the season progresses, then we can list players there.</p>
<p>Tonight, I might fall behind on my 5 articles because I am attending the Angels/Rangers game, so if you could back me up on those articles, I would appreciate it. <a href="../../../k/s/y/User%7EKsy92003_bc45.html" title="User:Ksy92003"><font color="green"><b>Ksy92003</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/s/y/User_talk%7EKsy92003_106c.html" title="User talk:Ksy92003"><font color="gray">talk</font></a><b>·</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ksy92003_f0da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ksy92003"><font color="gray">contribs</font></a></sup> 13:06, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
