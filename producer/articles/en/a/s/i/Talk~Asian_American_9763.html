<p><b>All</b> of the demographics subsections need to be treated <i>very</i> delicately. Aggregating the Asian sub-groups can lead to faulty conclusions about what may be a <a href="../../../b/i/m/Bimodal_distribution.html" title="Bimodal distribution">bimodal distribution</a>. The Income section, for example, uses the <i>median household</i> income metric which does not count the number of <i>income-earners</i> within a household, which tends to be higher among Asians. The false impression is one of "wealthy" Asians, when you might have three adults earning moderate incomes living together in a small home.</p>
<p>Also, the link provided points to an AP report republished by MSNBC--but the underlying data are from the Census Bureau. We should link to the Census Bureau report since the data are public and the links are more likely to be stable. At some point I will be editing along these lines. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">Ishu</a> 21:32, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I deleted the section on buying power/purchasing power. This discussion is misleading, since the figures are a combination of income and population size:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Asian American <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purchasing_power.html" title="Purchasing power">purchasing power</a>, currently at $427 billion, is the second-fastest growing after <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispanic.html" title="Hispanic">Hispanics</a>. By <a href="../../../2/0/1/2011.html" title="2011">2011</a>, the Asian buying power is expected to increase to $626 billion, a growth rate of 46%.<sup id="_ref-buying_power_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-buying_power" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>In other words, a reader could infer that incomes are growing at 46%, when most of that growth is a product of <i>population</i> growth. Reading the <a href="http://www.indolink.com/displayArticleS.php?id=091906070247" class="external text" title="http://www.indolink.com/displayArticleS.php?id=091906070247" rel="nofollow">actual reference</a> shows that the context refers to the attention of marketers, not of income. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">Ishu</a> 14:33, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm going to note for future reference that Asian household income <i>declined faster</i> than any other group between 2000 and 2001. See Census Bureau document <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/p60-218.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/p60-218.pdf" rel="nofollow">p60-218</a>, "Money Income in the United States: 2001," page 2. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">Ishu</a> 19:27, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>The <i>entire</i> demographics section should include a discussion that qualifies aggregate Asian American statistics. Relevant considerations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The misleading median for bimodal distributions</li>
<li>Differences among different Asian American ethnic groups</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contribute other considerations. We can draft such a qualifier discussion here. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">Ishu</a> 15:58, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think we need to develop a style guide for this page. Two issues leap to mind, both related to individual Asian American ethnic groups. Let's please discuss any and all style issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Links to individual groups: How often shall we link to an individual ethnic group? Perhaps a reasonable compromise would be only once within each major (level 1) topic.</li>
<li>References to the ethnic group of individuals: This is stickier. Especially in the Asian Americans Today section, there's a lot of clutter. Much of this is the list-y nature of the section that I'm working on. But two sentences from <i>In science</i> are typical:</li>

<dd>I added the encyclopedic content that had been lacking in the article. A lot of the improvements come from a sociologist book about Asian Americans. These were citations and charts. I also found sources over the internet to back up claims made in the history section. The other type of improvement was the removal of original research. The long lists of Asian Americans who have done something in their field and the lists of Asian Americans who blog in the external links section gave no information about Asian Americans. I also removed the Asian pride section which encompased original research, because I couldn't find a sociologist source to back up the claims made in the section. I may go to the library and get a book on Asian Americans from which I can add more sources, possibly re-adding the Asian pride section if I can source it.--<sup><i><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias"><font color="darkslateblue">Dark</font></a></i></sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias"><font color="purple">Tea</font></a> 01:50, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>according to sociologist CN Le few AsAms are into sports</i> (from edit summary explaining removal of Michelle Kwan picture) Whether or not this is true, Michelle Kwan is as widely recognized if not more so than many other people whose pictures remain on the page. I don't understand why the picture should have been removed. I select this example mainly because it is the most recent, but it is emblematic of editorial decisions that override several discussions that have occurred on this Talk page over the past 6 months or so. This I find troubling because the logic of it just escapes me.

<dd>For example, now that I look at the <i>In government</i> section of <i>Asian Americans Today</i>, I'm not sure what's <i>not</i> encyclopedic about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;oldid=101478813#In_government" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;oldid=101478813#In_government" rel="nofollow">previous version</a>, yet all of it was replaced with <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_American_1915.html#In_government" title="Asian American">new copy</a> that discusses voting, but not contributions and accomplishments in government service, which was the main point of the previous version. Both are legitimate subjects for the article (or somewhere in wiki), and deleting the existing copy here (and elsewhere in the article) goes against <a href="../../../e/p/_/WP%7EEP_8f86.html" title="WP:EP">Editing policy</a>, specifically <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditing_policy_7a1c.html#Major_changes" title="Wikipedia:Editing policy">"whatever you do, try to preserve information."</a>.

<p>Here are several concerns I have about <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a>'s recent edits, in descending order of magnitude:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deletion of existing content: I have commented on this earlier. Basically, it violates <a href="../../../e/p/_/WP%7EEP_8f86.html" title="WP:EP">editing policy</a>, specifically <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditing_policy_7a1c.html#Major_changes" title="Wikipedia:Editing policy">"whatever you do, try to preserve information."</a> For example, while a <i>possible</i> reduction of <i>Asian Americans today</i> has been discussed elsewhere on this page, DT <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104041175" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104041175" rel="nofollow">implemented a reduction</a> based solely upon DT's own definition of <i>encyclopedic</i> which <i>has not been discussed on this page</i>. Major changes like that should reflect consensus, per <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus policy</a>.</li>
<li>Edit summaries: Most of the edit summaries labelled <i>added citation</i> in fact contain <i>content changes</i> as well. So at best, it's difficult to follow what happened, and at worst, it's misleading as to what occurred.</li>
<li>Additions to the lead section: It is now too long and unnecessarily cluttered. Some edits to the lead section are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=104021728&amp;oldid=104017693" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=104021728&amp;oldid=104017693" rel="nofollow">good</a>, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=103998662&amp;oldid=103975135" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=103998662&amp;oldid=103975135" rel="nofollow">others</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=104025940&amp;oldid=104025141" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=104025940&amp;oldid=104025141" rel="nofollow">added</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=104030558&amp;oldid=104029648" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=104030558&amp;oldid=104029648" rel="nofollow">too</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=104160637&amp;oldid=104114114" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=104160637&amp;oldid=104114114" rel="nofollow">much</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=104888654" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=104888654" rel="nofollow">information</a>.</li>
<li>Heavy reliance on a single source: 21 of the references come from the web site <a href="http://asian-nation.org" class="external text" title="http://asian-nation.org" rel="nofollow">asian-nation.org</a>, which appears to be credible, but the heavy reliance on this one reference should be reduced.</li>
<li>Flow of prose: More than a few insertions don't seem to care about the flow of prose around them. While this can be addressed by clean-up editors, the more attention to such detail we can put on the front end, the less we have to "fix" later.</li>
</ol>
<p>What to do? No single one of these issues is a big deal by itself, but after 100 edits and probably 30-50 reference additions, it'd be good to pause and try to get something resembling consensus before continuing with such major changes. Of course, if nobody else pipes up, then I guess I'm the only one who has any issues, in which case, more power to DT. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">Ishu</a> 02:22, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It has become apparant that after a couple of weeks User:Ishu and User:HongQiGong never intend on evaluating my 50 citations they have removed. Their stated reason for removing them was that they felt I added too many citations in too short a period. Other than there not existing a Wikipedia Policy even remotely connected with this reasoning, it doesn't make sense. Are citations no good when they have been added too quickly? User:Ishu claims that s/he will evaluate each citation edit-by-edit to determine if they warrant inclusion in this article, but it has been several weeks and there has been no evaluations of this sort. Will these citations ever be evaluated?

<dd>I consider the wholesale removal of citations, because some of them appear weak, to be poor form. I feel the good-faith action would be to change the citation that you consider false rather than reverting all of them. I was in the process of amending the article to appease your qualms with it. I can only do this if I have the 80 citation article on the table and then apply the changes to it. When you revert the article to the 20 citation article, I can't fix your problems with the 80 citation article. I may have run out of revert priviledges for 24 hours, so I can't appease your wishes tonight by amending the article.--<sup><i><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias"><font color="darkslateblue">Dark</font></a></i></sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias"><font color="purple">Tea</font></a> 05:16, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are there any demographers who can chime in on whether it's time to create a separate article for demographics of Asian Americans? As things stand, for each demographic topic (population, income, education, occupation, etc.), there's one discussion for Asian Americans in aggregate, and then a separate discussion for sub-groups, usually accompanied by its own table(s). If we create a separate article, then much of the detailed discussions can go there and the main article can talk to the aggregates and some of the key differences across ethnic sub-groups. If we don't, I'm afraid the article will be 50% demographics at this rate. Also, the new article should be specifically to discuss the commonalities and differences among the sub-groups; otherwise, it would just be redundant with the demographic discussions for each sub-group. Comments, anyone? --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">Ishu</a> 21:05, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not sure that I agree with you. Are you talking about strictly the "Demographics" section? Or are you talking about other sections as well? The Demographics section itself doesn't seem that big to me. And regardless of what we move, it'll take substantial re-write because the sub-sections aren't very big and they could probably be collapsed if we split off the content into their own articles. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 21:34, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let's just say I'm referring to content that "should be" in the Demographics section. For example, the occupational distribution table that's now in Asian Americans today probably belongs in the Demographics section. Wherever it is, it requires some supporting copy, or it should be eliminated. The Education section is almost certain to grow along the lines of the other sections. It's my opinion (as I've noted above) that the demographics often demand discussion by sub-group, since different sub-groups have different immigration histories, for example, that influence levels of education, income, etc. I'm trying to pre-empt a bloated section in an already-too-long article. I'm not committed to this idea, just floating it for discussion. In any event, I have little interest in making major contributions to a demographics article, but there's a constant push to provide too much detail in this article, in my opinion. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">Ishu</a> 22:14, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><s>I was thinking the exact opposite.</s> The main article would have summaries for each category (or maybe just one section that touches on them all). Then the demographics article would go into depth for each category, with appropriate tables. The main article is becoming cluttered with tables and graphs. Is that clearer? --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">Ishu</a> 01:31, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I added a stub lead section, as follows:
<dl>
<dd>The demographics of Asian Americans describe a heterogeneous group of people in the United States who can trace their ancestry to one or more countries in Asia. Because Asian Americans total less than 5% of the entire U.S. population, the diversity of the group is often disregarded in media and news discussions of "Asians" or of "Asian Americans." While there are some commonalities across ethnic sub-groups, there are significant differences among different Asian ethnicities that are related to each group's history.</dd>

<p>I replaced the map with the UN Asia regions map.

<p>Table 2 of Census Bureau document <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf" rel="nofollow">c2kbr-35</a> (dated 2004) notes that ancestries are reported only for individual countries containing more than 100,000 people (in the U.S.) as of 2000. This exclusion means that certain countries will be lumped into an "other" category because of the threshold, and not because the Census Bureau excludes those countries from its definition of Asia. Most likely, this exclusion rule has to do with the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margin_of_error.html" title="Margin of error">margin of error</a>, not with how the Census Bureau defines Asia, since Table 2 is based upon <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sampling_%28statistics%29.html" title="Sampling (statistics)">probability sampling</a>. At any rate, I have seen no document stating that the Census Bureau excludes countries like Afghanistan from its definition of Asia. At least one <a href="http://www.everyculture.com/multi/A-Br/Afghan-Americans.html" class="external text" title="http://www.everyculture.com/multi/A-Br/Afghan-Americans.html" rel="nofollow">reference</a> supports this conjecture, although it does not state its sources. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">Ishu</a> 20:43, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68178.htm" class="external text" title="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68178.htm" rel="nofollow">one definition</a> from the Census Bureau web site (from the 2000 census) notes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Asian. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. It includes "Asian Indian," "Chinese," "Filipino," "Korean," "Japanese," "Vietnamese," and "Other Asian."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Compare the above definition with the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>White. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as "White" or report entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So the Census Bureau definition of <i>Asian</i> is not exhaustive, but the template map implies that it is. Common sense would place Afghan Americans, for example, in the Asian category, but the Central Asians as a group would be a point of debate, since some could be considered more like "Middle Eastern" people.

<dd>What makes this all even more difficult is that the way the term "Asian" is used by the government in things like the census, and how it is used by everyday Americans is two completely different things. In every day life, Americans use the term "Asian" to refer to those people that previously were known an Orientals. People who are Indian or Pakistani etc.. are not considered included when the term "Asian" is used. This gets even more confusing because when Europeans use the term "Asian" they use it the exact opposite way with those people from India being "Asian" but not those people from China and Japan (orientals). It's the same thing in America with people from the middle east. The government will consider those people to be white, when in reality, every day Americans will not. Anyway, it really doesn't matter because when people fill out the census they probably 99% fill in what they consider themselves to be. It's only when they write in a country rather than identify themselves that the goverment will automatically classify them.151.204.130.83AR</dd>

<dd>I don't think the current structure is that bad. It's a pretty logical structure. The article does need a lot of work though, but I think it's mainly copy-editing, referencing, and trimming down some sections that may be unnecessarily too large. Perhaps the thing to do is to coordinate on one particular section at a time. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 07:09, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I used the word <i>structure</i> too broadly. I meant the structure of the content within sections. I basically agree that the current section structure is OK, and you'll see that these featured articles have a similar section structure, but don't have sections like <i>Asian Americans Today</i> and don't dive into as much demographic detail. I post these examples as guides for the content discussions that we've had so that there's some external references instead of just what a small group of editors decides (or disagrees over). Does this make sense? --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">Ishu</a> 11:39, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_African-Caribbean_community_6a6f.html" title="British African-Caribbean community">British African-Caribbean community</a> does have sections that lists notable people, and I think the Asian American article mirrors that because they're both about an ethnic minority population. I think the only subsection in that section that really needs re-work is the arts and entertainment one. That subsection is basically a frivolous listing of names. But I don't think the entire section is absolutely necessary for the article. Are you considering deleting the section? I think at the very least, there's some useful demographic information in the subsections on business and politics that should probably be included, because they have real and practical effects on American society. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 15:49, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm beginning to regret having mentioned this at all. But let me make lemonade, here. I think it's fine to keep Asian Americans Today, although I think it should extend the description of Asian Americans beyond quantitative demographic statistics. Perhaps we can achieve some consensus for that? (<i>I'd appreciate some input from others besides Hong, especially since Asian Americans Today is the "most popular" section for drive-by editors. A strong consensus of focus would help us to avoid refactoring of this section.</i>) I hope that the effort that I've put into editing these sections (vs. deleting them) is evidence of intent-to-keep. My intention in posting the featured articles was to give us some ideas about how to write this article that aren't necessarily <i>my</i> ideas.

But that may be intrinsically difficult to include because most sources about the Asian American population has been on demographics, history, and discrimination. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 17:56, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have rewritten the <i>Terminology</i> section. It now begins with a description of the most common official definition. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=115245735&amp;oldid=115238019" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=115245735&amp;oldid=115238019" rel="nofollow">See</a> for yourself.

<p>This section should have its sub-heads removed, and possibly be merged with other sections. The long-questionable "Asian Pride" section has not been altered in some time, and the article <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_Pride_271a.html" title="Asian Pride">Asian Pride</a> rests on a single tripod web site. FYI, folks, it's ripe for <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">deletion</a>, though I have no intention of nominating it. The Vincent Chin reference probably belongs in the history section, while the model minority discussion might go with the demographics, or possibly in history. Once again, input from other editors would be greatly appreciated. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">Ishu</a> 21:37, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would not be against listing <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_Pride_271a.html" title="Asian Pride">Asian Pride</a> for deletion, because to be honest, good luck finding credible and verifiable sources that define the term and discuss its usage. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 21:49, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no support for the assertion that stereotyping can harm Asian students' performance. This appears to be just speculation, especially in view of Asians' high performance generally. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.4.116.14 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.4.116.14_6c04.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.4.116.14">contribs</a>) 22:14, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Firstly, not all Asian ethnic groups perform well academically. Some groups are very much at-risk groups. Secondly, there's no telling that, for those groups that do perform well, they might not do even better without the stereotyping. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 15:04, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Strictly speaking, there is no support <i>in the article</i> for any assertion in the Asian American Cultural Issues section--as we have discussed previously. But logically, you are correct. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">Ishu</a> 19:09, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
