<p>The explanation of U.S census policy on Americans of Middle Eastern origin must be put forward by one with knowledge in the field, free of bias, or be left from the article all together. <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnajunky_17ba.html" title="User:Technajunky">Technajunky</a> 19:00, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Refering to Middle Eastern Americans as having "neither been sufficiently visibly distinct as a group in America nor have they historically arrived in such large numbers" is both a fallacy, and shows a large degree of misinformed bias. Arabs and Armenians have been arriving in America as immigrants since the late 19th century.

<p>Identity politics are always confusing issues, especially when we get into self-identification. Good luck finding "credible" sources on these kinds of topics. Some Middle Eastern countries are clearly in the Asian continent, but I personally don't know any Middle Easterners that identify as "Asian". However, that's completely anecdotal evidence and not usable. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 19:53, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

As a result, they are not considered by most Americans to be "typical" Asians or Asian Americans, and are classified as "whites" for official racial purposes and popularly referred to as "<a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle Eastern</a>". For these same reasons, northern Asians such as Siberians and peoples from formerly <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asian</a> states are usually not spoken of as "Asian Americans" either and are also considered to be "white" in US Census racial classifications.</dd>

<p><i>Asian women as TV newscasters has reached the point of parody as a character in <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a>.</i></p>
<p>I know what the point of that statement is. It's trying to say that there are a lot of Asian American woman TV newscasters. But this is possibly inaccurate. Do we have any studies to show how well Asian American women are represented as TV newscasters? Without a reliable source, for all we know, they could still be underrepresented. So the statement above is not appropriate. Just because the writers of <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a> chose to parody Asian women as TV newscasters doesn't say anything about how well they are represented as TV newscasters. Family Guy is an animated TV show.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Additions to Health section</span></h2>
<p>Specifically, the first paragraph:</p>
<p><i>The life expectancy for Asian Americans was 83, compared to 79 in Japan in 1996, and 76 for Americans of European descent. For most diseases and cancers, and indicators such as infant mortality that afflict African American at worse rates than whites, Asians have lower rates. Rates of AIDS were 3 times lower than national average in the 1990s, though they are getting closer to parity. In NYC, no births to babies expose to cocaine were recorded. In Massachusetts, the rate of pregnant smoking was only one-quarter the average. In California, the rate of heart disease was onle one-third average. Infant mortality in CA was only half the average rate. Most health studies simply omit figures on Asians rather than publicize health outcomes that are better for Asians, or state that data is insufficient to establish accurates rates for AIDS, even though Asians are a majority or the 2nd largest minority in some states.</i></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Maps and captions</span></h2>
<p>The article needs only one good map and caption. It now has two maps, and both maps and their captions disagree. The caption--if used--should match the article, and both captions do not. I think the map should include <b>all</b> of Asia for reference. The article already discusses why certain parts of Asia are included in "Asian American" and why other parts are not (although the Middle Eastern section is awaiting rewrite by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Technajunky_b85f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Technajunky">Technajunky</a> per <a href="../../../a/s/i/Talk%7EAsian_American_9763.html#Explanation_of_Middle_Eastern_Americans_Within_Article_on_Asian_Americans" title="Talk:Asian American">previous discussion</a>). It goes back to an earlier <a href="../../../a/s/i/Talk%7EAsian_American_Archive_1_9186.html#Asia_redefinition" title="Talk:Asian American/Archive 1">discussion of "redefining" Asia</a> on Talk. The article <i>should not</i> focus only on self-identification as one map definition does. As I've mentioned previously, the definition of Asian American should consider (1) formal usage; (2) common usage by people who consider themselves to be "Asian American" (aka self-identification); and (3) common usage by "people in general." --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 17:06, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I restored and rewrote the Middle Eastern section and changed the map to the Asia map to illustrate all of Asia. The article now discusses which parts of Asia are typically included and excluded. Based on the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Talk%7EAsian_American_Archive_1_9186.html#Asia_redefinition" title="Talk:Asian American/Archive 1">Asia redefinition</a> talk discussion, it's probably better not to say "Asia really means..." Instead, it's better use the formal geographic definitions as the reference, and then explain what's included/excluded when discussing Asian American. I think we should drop the other map, but I'm putting it to Talk first. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 03:44, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Social Identity Theory</span></h2>
<p>Social identity theory (SIT) is far to general and remote from either common or formal (i.e., legal) usage to be interchangeable with race. It certainly is too much so simply to insert it into this article in a search-and-replace mode. If the article mentions SIT, then it should discuss its relevance to race and Asian Americans. Search and replace is not sufficient treatment of this complicated subject. The article should provide some context for readers without forcing them to read incomplete articles on theories that have multiple books devoted both to support and dispute. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 01:30, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>changed race to social identity b/c race is debatable but it is clear that some people self-identify as Asian Americans, so it is clearly a social identity</dd>
</dl>
<p>This comment makes it unclear as to whether DT refers specifically to the article <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_identity.html" title="Social identity">Social identity</a> or to some general concept of social identity. It's also unclear what DT means by "race is debatable." A few possible interpretations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of race (itself) is of debatable validity.</li>
<li>'Asian American' is a debatable racial category.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever DT means, it would be helpful to clarify. However, if one asked 20 random people whether 'Asian American' is a racial category, an ethnic category, or a social identity, few would state it is a social identity, however one defines that concept. This is not to deny the social construction of the race concept, but my comments about social identity theory apply: The article should use commonly understood references, and provide context where the common definitions are discarded or expanded upon. However, a treatment of <i>race as a social identity</i> would be best for the entire Wikipedia, since it could be referenced by the various articles that refer to "racial" social identities. I also agree that the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a> article is severely deficient on this topic, but the social identity article is equally deficient on race. I'd like to change this reference back to <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_group.html" title="Ethnic group">ethnic</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">racial</a> groupings, as follows:</p>

<dd>In anthropology I learned that ethnic group is what one considers themselves to be a part of based upon certain criteria - perceived "race" (controversial term, but identity based on this misconception still exists), religion, language, culture, and common origin.

<p>If this is in reference to the court cases (DT made changes to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=60416002&amp;oldid=60392137" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_American&amp;diff=60416002&amp;oldid=60392137" rel="nofollow">two separate sections</a>), the issue is twofold. First, race was a component of defining 'American' for purposes of citizenship: you <i>must</i> be white. The second part is: "Are Asian [race] people considered to be white [race]?" That's white vs. Asian, not white American vs. Asian American, or caucasian American vs. Asian American or what have you. The decision stated that if you are <i>Asian</i> then you <b>can't</b> be "American." But just read what the article says about the implications of the two decisions:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In other words, Ozawa was light-complexioned, but not white because he was not caucasian. At the same time, Thind was caucasian, but not white because he was not light-complexioned.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Assuming this is a fair summary of the decisions (and clearly I do), 'white' and 'caucasian' are not said to be interchangeable. The <i>Thind</i> decision clearly states that 'white' and 'caucasian' are <i>different</i> since Thind is acknowledged to be caucasian but <i>not</i> white. DT's explanation is not just brief, it's wrong. Or we can discuss the meaning of the decisions, but that requires more than an add-on sentence. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 01:43, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Caucasian American was just a label given to the people in the United States for whom it defined which has changed its definition over the years. The social identity of the people in power at the time refused to accept a brown non-Christian man among other physical differences. This does not mean the social identity that was excluded was <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_American_1915.html" title="Asian American">Asian American</a>. Thind was labeled Caucasian American before the trial, then stripped of being Caucasian American afterwords. This defined the social identity of the people with whom the Supreme Court judge self-identified. The judge felt he knew what people were included in his social identity.

<dd>First off, I agree that <b>all</b> racial labels are "just labels" in the sense that they are arbitrary (i.e., not rooted in objective, mutually exclusive sets of characteristics). And yes, racialized relationships are power relationships. The discussion of these cases illustrates how these racialized relationships become enshrined into the law--but also how the are contested from within the law. The main purpose of the decision in <i>Ozawa</i> and <i>Thind</i> was to define 'white' for the purposes of naturalized citizenship, just like the article states. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a>'s statement above:
<dl>
<dd>Thind and presumeably all people with original origins from the Indian Subcontinent were banned from the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_American_d0b7.html" title="Caucasian American">Caucasian American</a> <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_identity.html" title="Social identity">social identity</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>is not correct. The <i>Thind</i> decision concedes that Thind was caucasian, but goes on to make a 1/10th of a hairline distinction between <i>caucasian</i> and <i>white</i>. In fact, the decision basically excluded anyone with ancestry outside of Europe by appealing to the most amorphous racial term: 'white'. So <i>for the purposes of naturalized citizenship</i>, "white" is a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subset.html" title="Subset">subset</a> of "caucasian," and not an interchangeable term.</dd>
<dd>DT's final comment:
<dl>
<dd>It is true that White and Caucasian are not interchangeable terms like <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">User:Ishu</a> claims, but <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_American_f9ad.html" title="European American">European American</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_American_d0b7.html" title="Caucasian American">Caucasian American</a> are interchangeable terms.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>is not relevant to the particular edit, mainly because 'European American' was not used at all in the 1930s, but also because the decisions refer to 'white' and establish "white" and "European" to be equivalent and "interchangeable." The decision essentially states that the equivalency is obvious by appealing to the "average man" standard.</dd>
<dd>DT's edit:
<dl>
<dd>(4) These cases established <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_American_9a10.html" title="White American">White American</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_American_d0b7.html" title="Caucasian American">Caucasian American</a> to be interchangeable terms for the same people by convention.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>is not correct. We could change it to read:
<dl>
<dd>These cases established 'white' and 'European' to be equivalent racial terms.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>but that would be redundant, and it does not fit with the whole section about the definition of 'Asian American'.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">cleanup</span></h2>
<p>I changed the tag from copyedit to cleanup. The article needs more than copy editing. I will accept my share of blame for wordiness. Here's a list of my to-dos, but let's see what others suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_American_1915.html#Definition" title="Asian American">Definition</a>: section needs streamlining. However, I still feel that many of the issues raised need to be discussed. Specfically:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Asian American</i> initially referred to East Asians only, but over time has come to include other groups, notably South Asians</li>
<li><i>Asian American</i> has different meanings in different contexts, for example, by immigration/citizenship status (American=citizen only sometimes; also, definition of Asia varies by who is using the term)</li>
<li>The court decisions discussion (of which I am so fond) probably belongs somewhere else. I believe it is an important issue, but it is probably overkill for this section.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">copy editing query</span></h2>
<p>I've noticed that this article is very inconsistent in its use of single and double quotes. I'm of the opinion that single quotes are never used unless inside another quotation. I was going to replace all of the single quotes with double quotes, but I have also noticed that many of the quoted words are words used as terms, which should apparently be italicized according to Wiki's format. Does anyone else feel up to determining what's being used as a term and what isn't? I certainly don't. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 20:52, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right, the quotes aren't the only inconsistency. That's just what I notice because I'm a copy-editing type of person. So I guess I'll just replace all of the single quotes and leave the whole italicizing thing to someone else. That said, I also see that there are at least 3 different percentages given for the Asian American population in the US.

<dd>I have just gone through and copy-edited this article. On top of changes to spelling and grammar, I have italicised the first usage of Asian American (other than the bolded one at the beginning) to show the reader that it is a term with a specific meaning. I have then removed all other term-designating things because the capitalisation is enough to tell the reader that we are still talking about the same term. It is actually harder to read if it is italicised or "" all the time. Similarly I have removed the "" for Asian and American as these are like normal adjectives rather than technical terms. In terms of the other instances of "" I have left them there because they are not technical terms as such, which is what would usually get italicised, but they do require emphasis. Also even though Wikipedia does specify using "" for quotes only and using italics for terms, it also often says just go with the original usage and be consistent, which the article now is. I am also removing the copy-edit tag, because in terms of spelling and grammar, etc the article is fine. Other changes necessary come under the heading of clean-up. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenLouise_6ad3.html" title="User:JenLouise">JenLouise</a> 03:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Asian Americans Today</span></h2>
<p>I substantially edited this section. The previous version of the section is now on a <a href="../../../s/u/b/WP%7ESUBPAGE_a6b1.html" title="WP:SUBPAGE">subpage</a> called /notable. I completely removed the section "In Science and Technology" because it was entirely a list. In the other sections, I removed people who aren't "firsts" or, like state legislators, don't seem to fit any coherent pattern <i>by themselves.</i> We can and should note the increased participation by Asian Americans as political candidates, for example, but that <i>should not</i> occur by listing every Asian American elected to state and local offices.</p>
<p>Please note that <b>all of the removed names</b> are still included at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_Asian_Americans_a71b.html" title="List of notable Asian Americans">List of notable Asian Americans</a>.</p>
<p>Whether we favor <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">summary style</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_style.html" title="News style">news style</a>, to help <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_American_1915.html" title="Asian American">Asian American</a> to be a <a href="../../../1/s/p/WP%7E1SP_77c6.html" title="WP:1SP">better article</a>, this section should provide several coherent themes. This section originally started as a jumping-off point to connect the history section to "today." However, there is no clear cut-off between "history" and "today," particularly when several "today" events pre-date some of the "historical" events.</p>
<p>Suggestions for themes and organization are welcome. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 01:21, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We should definitely plan on re-inserting a Science and Technology section though. At the very least, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Ho_f288.html" title="David Ho">Dr. David Ho</a> definitely deserves mention. The guy is influential both in and outside the Asian American community. And I can't believe this, there's actually no article on M.C. Chang. He's the freaking co-inventor of the birth control pill. That's it, I think I'm going to do a little research and start an article on him. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 01:39, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that <i>influential</i> both in and outside of one's field should be a <b>guideline</b> for <i>an individual</i> to be included in this section. David Ho is not only a scientist, but he has taken advocacy positions (leveraging his influence in the scientific community). So many of the Nobel laureates would not qualify, since their accomplishments, though significant, are confined to their field and profession. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 02:08, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not sure we should retain the topic-focused organization of the section. Not that these are unimportant, but I guess I'm thinking the section should be a discussion of the status and contributions of Asian Americans as a group, with select individuals called out as <i>examples</i> of the trends. In politics, the "firsts" are obvious individuals, but someone who "recently" did something might also be noteworthy e.g., <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Locke_e2ee.html" title="Gary Locke">Gary Locke</a>). Outside of politics, when discussing individuals, I think it would be better to stick to people like, maybe David Ho, but more like <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Omidyar_5bbc.html" title="Pierre Omidyar">Pierre Omidyar</a>, for business and philanthropic contributions. (I know, he doesn't "qualify" under the current article definitions as Asian American, but people like him.) When looking at particular areas, we can use individuals to broaden a discussion beyond dry statistics.</dd>
<dd>But look what I just wrote: Maybe we can't escape the categories...? I just want to avoid the list-y-ness that plagues the current revision. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 17:17, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I absolutely agree that we need to avoid making that section and its subsections read like lists. David Ho should be mentioned by name, and then maybe mention that a few Asian American scientists have been Nobel Prize winners, without necessarily naming any names. I also noticed that the arts and entertainment subsection reads like a list also. But it might be difficult to edit that without omitting some editor's favourite singer or actor, only to have him or her add it back in, in a one-or-two sentence mention. - <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> (<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>) 17:25, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The last sentence of the first paragraph ("Some people still advocate use of...") is dangerously close to use of <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel words</a>, since the <a href="http://www.apiwellness.org/article_racial_identity.html" class="external text" title="http://www.apiwellness.org/article_racial_identity.html" rel="nofollow">citation provided</a> is a first-person statement ("My racial identity is...") with no attribution to others whatsoever.</li>

<p>According to the wiki information, "Asian Americans are extremely well represented in the education sector, especially in the college level with the highest average college graduates at around 52% and the whole Asian people constitutes around 20% of Ivy League colleges."</p>
<p>I'm not so sure if those numbers are accurate. i believe that actual percentage of Asian Americans with college degrees is between 44 to 48%. Also, Asians as a whole do not make up 20% of the student population of Ivy League schools. Unless you count Russians and middle Eastern people in that percentage, I'm very sure that Asians DO NOT represent 20% of Ivy League colleges.</p>
<p>The only Ivy League school that meets and surpasses the 20% threshold is Penn, with approximately 22% of its undergraduates being Asian. Harvard has 17%, same with Columbia and Cornell. Yale has approximately 14%, Brown has around 15%, and Princeton and Dartmouth have about 12% Asian population. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 204.52.215.94 (<a href="../../../2/0/4/User_talk%7E204.52.215.94.html" title="User talk:204.52.215.94">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__204.52.215.94_c9fa.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 204.52.215.94">contribs</a>) 07:15, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Terminology: Informal usage</span></h2>
<p>Some concerns I have:</p>
<ol>
<li>The introductory section probably should be removed. The referenced work by Sharon Lee does not provide any evidence for the claim that "non-Asian Americans" equate the term with Chinese and Japanese. The rest of this section is basically redundant with other parts of this section and article.</li>
<li>This section is laden with <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel words</a> such as <i>many</i> and <i>some</i> without any references. The references tag has been on this section for several months now and no support has been provided. Statements with weasel words should be rewritten or removed.</li>
<li>The section combines self-definition by Asian Americans with usage by non-Asians. While intertwined, these two usages need to be differentiated.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will edit along these lines, but comments and assistance would be welcome. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 23:12, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Even though Asian American is now a very widely used term in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, it is mostly the younger generation of Asian Americans who refer to themselves this way. A simple analogy would be the use of terms <i><a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_American_b5d5.html" title="Irish American">Irish American</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_American_4105.html" title="Italian American">Italian American</a></i>. The double allegiance represented in such denominations (Asian and American) was largely discouraged in the early twentieth century. <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford Motor Company</a>, for instance, encouraged all recent immigrants to think of themselves as <i>American</i> and not as <i>Irish American</i>. The American Civil Rights Movement of the 50s and 60s reintroduced the use of such dual-identifier terms of ethnicity. Today, many younger Asian Americans speak of <i><a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_pride.html" title="Asian pride">Asian pride</a></i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first sentence ("younger generation") and last sentence ("Asian pride") have been unsourced despite a reference template on the entire section for months. For the "younger generation" statement to be true (as written), two things must be true: (1) that older generations <i>do not</i> refer to themselves as <i>Asian American</i> and (2) that younger generations <i>do</i> refer to themselves this way. We can restore the claim with adequate references. The "Asian pride" statement also is covered in its own section.</p>
<p>The term <i>double-allegiance</i> is highly misleading, and should be avoided, especially due to the misplaced allegations of disloyalty throughout Asian American history--and immigrant history in general. This entire section <i>may</i> be appropriate if expanded, but it is redundant as-is, and probably more appropriate for an article-length treatment of its own. Without enough context, it just doesn't fit here, and it needs <i>a lot</i> more context. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 15:01, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm fine with either Yamaguchi or Kwan (or no picture). Yamaguchi has won at all levels in the sport; Kwan has more overall titles. As far as I'm concerned, they're both reasonable choices. Anyone else care to voice an opinion? <a href="../../../m/y/a/User%7EMyasuda_0ddc.html" title="User:Myasuda">Myasuda</a> 03:27, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure what these sections add, or how the existing copy can be expanded. As I see it, the sections can spin out to encompass all of the various subgroups, or these sections will be a hopeless, misrepresentative aggregation of data on different groups. I would appreciate comments from others. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 21:07, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I say remove both sections. The first paragraph of crime can be moved to the "Asians as a model minority" section. Health can be removed altogether. <a href="../../../m/y/a/User%7EMyasuda_0ddc.html" title="User:Myasuda">Myasuda</a> 03:41, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I deleted both sections and reworked the crime stat, but the Model Minority section is a mess, so it didn't fit in well at all. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 22:22, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <i>Formal usage</i> section needs to be pared as well. My ultimate goal is to have minimal sub-divisions in the Terminology section--possibly none at all. I'll confess a fondness for the legal definitions paragraph (long-time editors already know this). However, it belongs somewhere else--possibly not even in this article. The <i>Formal usage</i> section should probably be restricted to a discussion of the evolution of the census categories and their effect on government programs, research, and policy development. That would make a good jumping off point for discussions of the development of communities, I think.</p>

<p>I removed the "Legal definitions" section and am placing it here for "safekeeping" until (if) a better place can be found.</p>

<dd>Legal definitions of <i>Asian American</i> were developed in several key <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_b835.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a> decisions that pertain to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_nationality_law_0085.html#Naturalization" title="United States nationality law">naturalized citizenship</a>. Historically, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturalization_Act_of_1790_e8dc.html" title="Naturalization Act of 1790">Naturalization Act of 1790</a> restricted naturalized citizenship to "free white persons". In the 1922 case <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takao_Ozawa_v._United_States_1a0b.html" title="Takao Ozawa v. United States">Takao Ozawa v. United States</a>, Mr. Ozawa, an immigrant from Japan, claimed to be eligible for naturalized citizenship on the logic that his skin complexion fit the definition of "white." The decision held that <i>white</i> referred exclusively to Caucasians, and so Japanese were not eligible for naturalized citizenship.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The next year, in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_v._Bhagat_Singh_Thind_1969.html" title="United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind">United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind</a>, the court reversed this logic. Mr. Thind argued that South Asians should be eligible for naturalized citizenship because they were considered to be Caucasian, consistent with the <i>Ozawa</i> decision. <i>Thind</i> deployed a reverse logic in <i>Thind</i>, writing that "[I]t may be true that the blond Scandinavian and the brown Hindu have a common ancestor in the dim reaches of antiquity, but the average man knows perfectly well that there are unmistakable and profound differences between them to-day". This decision interpreted the term <i>white persons</i> in the Naturalization Act to refer only to people of European descent.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></dd>
