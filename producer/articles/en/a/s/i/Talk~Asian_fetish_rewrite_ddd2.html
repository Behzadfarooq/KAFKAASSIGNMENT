	    <p>I saw the notice on my talk page, so I came here to have a look. I dont see any huge problem with NPOV in the current article, but I wonder about the limitations that have been put on the term. It's possible that a large majority of people pick and choose so that they can make pejorative terms to hit just the right people.</p>
<p>It is possible that there is nothing behind the purported preferences of individuals, i.e., maybe people all just find love with other people without regard to the so-called "races" of their potential mates. It is possible that all people just find love with others regardless of the culture of the objects of interest. But there seems to be a good deal of anecdotal evidence to suggest that race and culture can make some individuals less attractive, and there is also plenty of anecdotal evidence to show that third parties can have very negative attitudes toward mixed couples--even though there can be elements of the double standard in these evaluations too.</p>
<p>To have any kind of an objective report on this phenomenon there would have to be an effective screening test that produces answers something like the following:</p>
<pre>
Subject X.
Erotically attracted to opposite sex members of the other "race" at level _____
Erotically attracted to opposite sex members of the same "race" at level _____
Erotically attracted to opposite sex members of the other culture at level ____
Erotically attracted to opposite sex members of the other culture at level ____
Erotically attracted to same sex members of the other "race" at level _____
Erotically attracted to same sex members of the same "race" at level _____
Erotically attracted to same sex members of the other culture at level ____
Erotically attracted to same sex members of the other culture at level ____
</pre>
<p>Much of what makes a person erotically attractive to someone lies in the expectations felt toward that person. Noticing the physical appearance visually may inform one of some of that person's likely characteristics such as smell, What is a turn-on for one person may be a turn-off for another person. Noticing some indications of a potential mate's cultural background may inform one of that person's likely social characteristics, personality traits, etc.</p>
<p>There are people who proclaim that they will gladly have intercourse with anyone of the right sex. I think that in practice those people are actually much more selective. Anyway, it would be strange if a society were to insist that its members be willingly sexually available to all members of the human race or to all members of some large subset of the human race. Many things done in cultural groups the world over are intended to make the individual more attractive to desired mates, indicating that selectivity is well and thriving. So from a neutral point of view it would be interesting to know what factors seem to be viewed as most salient.</p>
<p>What is it about a member of some Asian population that might make that person more attractive to a person from a non-Asian population? Is it physical? A question of measurements, perhaps? Is it mental? A question of typical attitudes, perhaps? And why would a member of a non-Asian population find his/her experience with an Asian enhanced by these qualities? Is it a question of the Asians being better? In that case the Asian half of such a couple would automatically be on the losing end, would have to put up with a mate whose characteristics are inferior to those of his/her own Asian group. Or is it a question of complementation of characteristics, so the each person is strengthened by the strong points of the other?</p>
<p>The way the article has been written so far seems to suggest to me the picture of people who are deciding fundamental issues in their lives merely on the basis of what is trendy, or on other completely superficial grounds. Whether that is true or not is not known, but it probably should not be simply assumed from the start. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">金 (Kim)</a> 05:43, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Kim -- thanks for weighing in here. However, I've pretty much left this behind (maybe I should blank it). On the discussion section of the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_fetish.html" title="Asian fetish">Asian fetish</a> main page is the argument since I developed this. The primary author of the page has admitted that it represents a particular Asian-American viewpoint, and while I respect that we need to figure out how to make it work in the Wikipedia system of verifiable, citable, encyclopedic fact. This is complicated by the intersection (or conflation) of a line of academic/literary theory with the more basic (and probably important) questions that you ask. One issue of POV/NPOV is whether a term like "Asian fetish" stigmatizes normal interracial relationships, and I think that is the question you are getting at. I would encourage you to participate on <a href="../../../a/s/i/Talk%7EAsian_fetish_c85c.html" title="Talk:Asian fetish">Talk:Asian fetish</a> (if you can bear it). -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 06:34, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
