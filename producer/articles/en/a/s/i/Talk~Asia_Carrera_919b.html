<dd>Some ass keeps reverting my addition that her self-made webpages return hundreds of errors upon W3C markup validation. I'm sick of reverting it back, and I don't want this to turn into an edit conflict for something so trivial. Regardless of whether you think it should belong in the article, as the Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, it wouldn't hurt to have too much information, especially factual, relevant information supported by external sources. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkl222_4b80.html" title="User:Markl222">Markl222</a> Feb 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please try to behave and don't call a fellow wikipedian for "ass". Regarding the number of W3C errors on her website: I don't think it belongs in an article about an adult actress just as I don't think it belongs in articles on lots of other people and websites. You probably know that almost all websites (at least the majority) will return lots of errors of this kind, so it is not anything special. And by mentioning it in this article you will give the reader who don't know about this stuff the impression that Asia Carrera is just an ignorant fool, while it's really not a big deal.

<p><i>She claims to have had her IQ tested at 155 ... and is a member of Mensa, the only one to have worked as an adult actress.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I find claim to be <b>highly</b> suspect. While I'm more than ready to grant that she is remarkably intelligent, quite possibly smart enough to be in Mensa, an IQ of 155 (15<b>6</b> in the linked article) is astronomically high; so high in fact that would make her considerably <i>more</i> intelligent than the overwhelming majority of Mensa members--Mensa membership begins at IQ 130. Moreover it is extremely difficult to test IQs accurately over 150, making a 156 claim highly questionable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What I think is quite probable is that she has scored 156 on an online "IQ test" or one printed in a magazine, which is of course not what is considered a legitimate IQ test in the scientific community. If this is true, however, then her claim of Mensa membership must be called into question since they have strict standards on which tests are acceptable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However since the claims presented in the article have an external source and I only have doubts about the extreme unlikelihood of the claim (especially given that it has been known for even mainstream actresses such as Sharon Stone to lie about being Mensa members), I don't know what changes can be made. But I did want to voice my doubts about the article's claims (and her presence on <s><b>List of Mensa International members</b></s>). --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarlow4_c20f.html" title="User:Marlow4">Marlow4</a> 21:17, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We're an encyclopedia and should only state documented things. Regarding the 155 IQ, I believe we're safe since the "She claims to have had" is acurate (she claims it on her website (or 156, should maybe change it)). And if anyone wants to question her claim we'd need to come up with an authorative source questioning it. (You or me questioning it is not enough (original research)). But I think the "She claims" thing is fine and can stay. Whether or not she is a member of Mensa is hard to document. I'm tempted to include it under the "claim" word here too, which is true and then we wouldn't need to document it further.</dd>
<dd>About the <s><b>List of Mensa International members</b></s>, I didn't know about it and I'm tempted to put the whole list up for deletion or renaming. I seriously doubt it's possible to document the membership of most of the people listed there. So many lists like this have been rejected on afd since they are mostly based on rumours and undocumented heresay. Either rename it to "List of people claimed to be Mensa-members" or police a strict "documentation needed" to have anyone included. But that debate is offtopic here, run it on <s><b>talk:List of Mensa International members</b></s>, and/or just put it up for deletion. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 21:53, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As an FYI, the American Mensa magazine sometime last year (I no longer have the issue) included a list of famous Mensans, including Asia Carrera. Also, the score of an IQ is only relevant if you know the scale. The 98th percentile on the Stanford Binet test may be around 131 or so, but on a different test (and scale) the 98th percentile maybe 150. Stating you have an IQ of XYZ is irrelevant if you do not qualify it with the scale. <a href="../../../d/b/n/User%7EDbnull_167f.html" title="User:Dbnull">Dbnull</a> 22:29, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have a friend who recently got into Mensa and according to their standards, the minimum IQ to join (which is also their definition of Genius) is 150. So according to that scale an IQ of 155 isn't unreasonable.</p>

<dd>This isn't really the place to debate Mensa's rules (go see <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa_International_ed5b.html" title="Mensa International">Mensa International</a> instead). But to quiet the conversation down, here's the actual rule: You have to score within the top 2% of an approved standardized intelligence test. Depending on the test and its circumstances, the actual minimum number can vary. According to the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa_International_ed5b.html" title="Mensa International">Mensa International</a> article, Mensa recently admitted a 3-year-old with a measured IQ of 137, which of course is way off the charts <i>for his age group</i>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossPatterson_2d77.html" title="User:RossPatterson">RossPatterson</a> 00:21, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm a member of Mensa UK, which uses the Cattell tests. I believe Mensa USA also uses them. Cattell has a standard deviation of 24, while most other IQ tests have a standard deviation of 15 or 16. The qualifying score for Mensa membership is 148, which is equivalent to an IQ of 130 or 132 on other tests. Asia Carrera's claimed IQ of 155 is equivalent to an IQ of 134 or 137 on other tests. It places her IQ just on the boundary of the 99th percentile, i.e. above 99% of the US population. There's nothing unlikely about her having an IQ at that level. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_d_bca2.html" title="User:Simon d">Simon d</a> 22:09, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Several comments on the Mensa membership thread of this discussion...</p>
<p>I was once a Mensa member myself, and I know from having met and partied with many othe Mensans that Mensa is a group of people who know how to take an IQ test. That is about all they have in common. There are highly knowledgeable technical people as well as those whose VCRs flash 12:00 (the older ones, before they set the time automatically). So it would not surprise me that Ms. Carrera is indeed a Mensa member, nor would it surprise me that she might not be expert at building a Web site.</p>
<p>Also, anyone who is a Mensa member is entitled to the name and address of any other Mensa member. (I asked for Geena Davis's information when I wrote an essay about an article in which she mentioned her Mensa membership. I wanted to send her a copy.) So, maybe a member can ask for her information if only to confirm that she is in fact a member. You will probably just get an agent's address, as I did for Ms. Davis, but at least it can be verified.</p>

<p>Google for "Asia Carrera mensa". You get over 30 000 hits.

<p>Ms. Carrera's Mensa claim is consistent with her claim that she was awarded a full scholarship by Rutgers University. Mensa accepts SAT scores to qualify. On the SAT scale used in the 1990s, I believe a score of 1250 would qualify for Mensa, indicating an intelligence quotient in the 98th percentile. Her score likely was much higher to earn a full scholarship from Rutgers.</p>
