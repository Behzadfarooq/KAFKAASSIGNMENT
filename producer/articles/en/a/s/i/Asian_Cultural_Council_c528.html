<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_Cultural_Council_c528.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>Now having been operating for more than 43 years, the council takes the role as a medium between donating bodies and worthy artists in need for financial aid. Over the years, the Asian Cultural Council has given unconditional support and effort in developing the shared arts community by creating numerous invaluable opportunities for artists in Asia and America to develop their talents on the opposite side of the globe.</p>
<p>The new movement in the arts community represents a big step for many hidden artists from developing countries in Asia: worthy artists who are awarded with grants or selected to take part in the ACC’s fellowship programs are not only given the chance to learn and broaden their arts knowledge, they also hold the greater duty to expose the more niche subcultures from home to the rest of the world and in turn bringing pride and glory to their country. The ACC has in its years of operation witnessed countless new artistic products resulted from gains in exchange experiences, stimulating new ideas and new works, and ultimately moving the Asian art industry forward to a new generation.</p>
<p>To expand the circle of the existing arts community, the ACC uses endowment incomes and donations to implement specially designed programs that intend to facilitate local artists to reach their greatest potentials in arts: The ACC offers a total of ten fellowship programs, one unrestricted project fund and one grant award so far.</p>
<p>The ten fellowship programs are allocated specific to their location, content or donor body. They include: ACC Residency Program in Asia, Asian Art and Religion Fellowship Program, Ford Foundation Fellowship Program, Hong Kong Arts Program, Humanities Fellowship Program, Japan-United States Arts Program, Mekong Region Fellowship Program, Philippines Fellowship Program, Starr Foundation Fellowship Program. The unrestricted project fund is known as “ACC Fellowships and Projects” and an annual grant award of $30,000 named after John D. Rockefeller 3rd.</p>

<p>The Council's main objective is to provide support for the cultural exchange between <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. The ACC does this by providing grants to Asian applicants in areas of <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research.html" title="Research">research</a>, study and work in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts.html" title="Arts">arts</a> areas of the United States, and similarly, to American applicants who wish to work in the art sector in Asia. In addition, grants are awarded to various educational and cultural institutions in Asia and the United States to promote Asian-American cultural exchange.</p>

<p>Asian-American cultural exchange programs are funded by a range of endowment <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donor.html" title="Donor">donors</a>, ranging from multi-national corporations, to large charitable foundations, to smaller individual contributions from across the globe. The larger corporations who serve as donors are the Asian Oceanic Group and the Seibu Saison Group. Large charitable foundations who contribute include the <a href="http://www.fordfound.org" class="external text" title="http://www.fordfound.org" rel="nofollow">Ford Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/index.html" rel="nofollow">Japan Foundation</a>, the JDR 3rd Fund, the <a href="http://www.starrfoundation.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.starrfoundation.org/" rel="nofollow">Starr Foundation</a>. Loyal individual supporters of the programs are respectively Mr. and Mrs. George D. O’Neill, Mrs. John D. Rockefeller 3rd, Mr. Laurance S. Rockefeller and various anonymous supporters.</p>

<p>Apart from the more detached funding relationships between endowment donors and the Asian Cultural Council (ACC), the ACC Grant program also receives long-term support from annual and multi-year funds, contributed by committed donors. In the past, such contributions have led to major succession in the growth of the Asian Cultural Council by expanding the council works across <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>, allowing such programs to be accessible to <a href="../../../d/e/v/Developing_countries.html" title="Developing countries">developing countries</a> as well as influencing more nations to understand the importance of cultural exchange between <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups.html" title="Ethnic groups">ethnic groups</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, ACC has established a Japan-United States Arts Program. The grant program receives endowment donations from the Seibu Saison Group, a fund donated to the ACC via the <a href="http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/index.html" rel="nofollow">Japan Foundation</a> in 1983. Since 1989, annual contributions were made on the existing fund from the Saison Foundation in Tokyo. In early 1993, a group of former grantees in Japan executed a fund-raising program in memory of Blanchette H. Rockefeller, who served as the chairman of ACC from 1980 to 1990, and the money raised was used to establish the Blanchette H. Rockefeller Fellowship Fund of the Japan-United States Arts Program.</p>

<p>The Philippines Fellowship Program was established by the ACC in 2000 to support talented artists and scholars in the Philippines. The scholarship grants however began in the 1960's, and, as of present, has sponsored more than 100 talented artists and scholars in the Philippines. This Fellowship program allows Filipinos to harness and practice their talents.</p>
<p>Grants in fields such as <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeology.html" title="Archaeology">archaeology</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_history.html" title="Art history">art history</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_criticism.html" title="Art criticism">art criticism</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/i/Painting.html" title="Painting">painting</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photography.html" title="Photography">photography</a>, etc., are offered to qualified individuals. It is important to note however that priority is given to those who are incapable to fund their studies or research in the United States. This also suggests that any recipients of said grants are expected to go back to the Philippines and apply their research and field of study in their hometown. This arrangement not only allows the students and scholars to apply their new found knowledge in their home country, but also, allows the Philippines to develop more as scholars and learned individuals who are given the chance for better higher learning come back to apply their skills.</p>

<p>Established by endowment incomes from the Starr Foundation, Starr Foundation Fellowship Program intends to promote Asian-American art exchange by funding Asian art specialists to visit the United States for art development.</p>
<p>The program is mainly interested in modern-day visual arts in Asia, and supports art devotees from Asia for personal projects and researches, training courses and observation in the United States for one month to one year. Grants are awarded to art-related proposals that contribute to art criticism, arts <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craft.html" title="Craft">craft</a>, filmic arts, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museology.html" title="Museology">museology</a> arts, <a href="../../../p/a/i/Painting.html" title="Painting">painting</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photography.html" title="Photography">photography</a>, print-making, <a href="../../../s/c/u/Sculptures.html" title="Sculptures">sculptures</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video.html" title="Video">video</a>.</p>

<p>The Taiwan Fellowship Program was established in 1995 by the Asian Cultural Council (ACC) and the Sino-American Asian Cultural Foundation (SAACF). The latter established SAACF was purposely set-up to serve as the ACC’s helping hand in raising funds to make grants for art devotees in Taiwan for research in the United States, and to American art devotees to participate in cultural exchange projects organized by local institutions in Taiwan. As a result in efforts to push forward the Taiwan art culture, a support group Group 33 was started by Cecile Shah, director of ACC-SAACF, five years ago and formed by Art fanatics who meet twice a month to organize art-related funding activities and gains are donated to support ACC grantees each year.</p>
<p>The ACC-SAACF office in Taipei, under the chairmanship of Mr. Douglas Hsu, supports up to eight grant recipients each year. This new collaboration is in charge for all fundraising, application procedures, grantee programming for the project and acquires funds from individual, corporate, foundational donors in Taiwan. These donors include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Taiwan Fellowship</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The program funds up to three Taiwanese visual-based and performing artists and scholars to the United States or Asia for research and creative work.</p>
