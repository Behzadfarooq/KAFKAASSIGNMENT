<li>What is West Asia meant to refer to?
<ul>
<li>Usually, the term West Asia is a synonym for the Middle East, or southwest Asia. If the part of Russia west of the Ural Mountains was considered to be part of Asia, that would obviously make up a large part of (north)west Asia, but that's considered to be in Europe. Hope this helped!</li>

<hr />
<p>The description of the seperation between Europe and Asia says "The boundary between Asia and Europe runs via the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dardanelles.html" title="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>, the Sea of Marmara, the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellespont.html" title="Hellespont">Hellespont</a>...". Now, according to the page on <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellespont.html" title="Hellespont">Hellespont</a>, that word is simply the ancient name for <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dardanelles.html" title="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>. So, shouldn't Hellespont be replaced by Bosphorus? <a href="../../../g/y/a/User%7EGyan_5435.html" title="User:Gyan">Gyan</a> 01:30 Apr 19, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the table with area sizes - the area for Turkey mentions the whole area of Turkey, including european part. Maybe this should change to include only the asian part. This is the Asia page, so when we list the area of some country we should list it's ASIAN territory - or at least a note should pe placed that gives explanation: Turkey total XXX sq.km = YYY asian + ZZZ european.</p>
<p>Other cross-continent countries have similar ommissions - Russia, Azerbaidjan, etc. - see Europe page for details. Similar case with Egypth - both asian and african territories, no distiction, no note ...</p>

<dd>I'm afraid I think they need some work. The first one is just confusing. I think I know what you are getting at, but it might be clearer if expanded somewhat. I wouldn't use the term "incorrect". These are overlapping designations used for different purposes. It is not like someone has tried to divide the world into a set of discreet regions and accidently put some countries in two. Some people do not understand the distinctions between the terms, but that doesn't mean the terms themselves are "incorrect", just that some people are bad at geography.</dd>

<dd>I am from Russia and my first thought was to cry that asia is not a continent and that continent by definition is a continuous land mass. But before answering I took a look at wikipedia article "continent" and found out that my point of view is taught in Russia and Japan - thats why me and Shinji think this way. There is written that the other point of view is taught in western europe and USA. However wikipedia also says that "Eurasian" point of view is prefered in scientific society.

<p>Many Americans also take the view that Eurasia is a continent, though admittedly, we are somewhat of a minority. However, commonly in American English, if you really listen to how people use the term, it almost always refers to Asia Pacific, non-inclusive of the Middle East. Middle East, for political reasons, or whatever, is really a region in its own right.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assuwa.html" title="Assuwa">Assuwa</a> etymology does seem more likely, since we are dealing with the etymology of an Ancient Greek term (<i>Asia</i>) applied chiefly to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatolia.html" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>.

<p>That <b><a href="../../../a/s/i/Asios.html" title="Asios">Asios</a></b> name is interesting (that name is in a section of Book II of the <a href="../../../i/l/i/Iliad.html" title="Iliad">Iliad</a> that I've often went over, and I remember the name now; in that section describing the Trojan allies who fought for Troy). I don't know if it supports the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assuwa.html" title="Assuwa">Assuwa</a> etymology, but it makes a Semitic origin less likely for me.</p>
<p>Hmm, you know what, I don't think it's from Akkadian or any other Semitic language, nor is it connected with the "rising" concept. Unfortunately, many references quote that etymology. Alexander 007 20:27, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's okay, I'm just a bit dismayed that we have to mention this widely-quoted Akkadian etymology, which is likely wrong even though it's still given by AHD and other sources. Nevertheless, Wiki should probably mention it alongside other referenced etymologies. Alexander 007 21:42, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I got a question though: do references support the idea that <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assuwa.html" title="Assuwa">Assuwa</a> may be derived from the Akkadian word? If not, maybe we should present them as two conflicting etymologies. Alexander 007 21:52, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>well, let's be agnostic and call them unrelated. I don't have a problem with the Semitic etymology being present, but I do also think it is unlikely.

<p>We need to present this as the way Westerners thought about the world when they didn't know much about anything outside of Europe. Although "Asia" is used in many names and a common word, more properly, people are often referring to East Asia or Eurasian minus Europe, minus the Middle East (i.e. grab bag of stuff out to the East). As it stands, this article is crap.</p>
<p>Wikipedia takes on a world-view POV. Yo Mama is crap. <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPirus_0f49.html" title="User:Pirus">Pirus</a> 03:12, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually yo (your?) mama is crap (because she made you). I agree that Asia basically means all that land over there we don't know anything about. It is an obsolete and ridiculous term. So most people in the world think this or that, perhaps they are all wrong. Wikipedia doesn't reflect the world view, it reflects the truth, and this is the best opportunity to bring things forward.</p>

<p>Cite an example if you'd like. At major US universities, for example, there is often Middle East Studies, South Asian Studies, and East Asian Studies. There is no Asian studies because, now that us Westerners are a little more sophisticated, we don't dump everything we don't know about into a single grab bag anymore.</p>

<dd>Okay, but it seems like you are trying to affect some kind of change in everyone's conventional thinking here, and wikipedia isn't supposed to be a vehicle for that... Asia as understood today and for centuries refers to the entire continent, as depicted on the map, if you have some different understanding you'd like everyone to accept, please make sure it isn't an original theory... <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 16:16, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nope, not at all. You provide the citations if you want to move it beyond a historical concept to contemporary legitimacy as a continent. Wikipedia is not a dictionary. It's not just how people use words. It has to be backed up with scholarly sources or other reliable information.</p>
<p>I want to also add that you also need to have an international POV. I don't know where you're from, but your idea of Asia is a very particular one. It's a POV, and it should be recognized for what it is, not bandied about as if it's neutral. Even if you just think about how people use the word Asia, you realize that what people may define it as actually differs from how it's used. What do you think of when you hear the word Asians? Many people think of East Asians. So you need to recognize the problems and try to write the article from a NPOV.</p>

<p>Ironically, it was not in the traditions of any Asian country to call Asia Asia. Classic (Greek) is not everyone else's classic (ie China's classic is... China). Thus we will be specific and clear in this article and call things what they really are--Greek/Westerner or whatever may be the case.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Classical" as I used it, means as it was used in what is conventionally, and almost universally, called "The Classical World", including Greece and the Middle East. Greeks and Hellenes referred to the (originally Persian) lands East of Greece, as "Asia" -- whether they lived there themselves (as many of them did, hence "Asian Greeks") or whether they lived on the European side. This is the English wikipedia, not the Chinese, and that's what "Classical" means in English. As I stated before, Wikipedia is not the appropriate place or vehicle to try to engineer a drastic change in the standard perception everybody already has of things, whether you disagree with their perception or not... Asia is Asia, and anyone who says the term should suddenly stop being used, is coming out of left field; You actually ask for citation that Asia is still referred to as Asia; I don't think "Reader's Digest" (the widest circulation of any periodical in the USA) calls it anything different, just for starters... <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 18:55, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello folks. I've taken the liberty of tidying up quite a bit in the introduction of what Asia is and is not. Specifically, Asia not a "landmass", nor is it a "vague concept". I have also removed sentences repeating or rephrasing a preceding sentence. Enjoy! <i>=]</i> //<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 20:52, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>These are not reasons for your edits. Asia is a much more vague concept than you think. You have to provide reasons or counter other people's reasons if you're going to make edits like this. What you find "obvious" is exactly what other people challenge.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I appreciate your effort in gathering links that divide or group the worlds regions differently according to their various purposes. But if we start with the first sentence, it should simply state the common usage and extent of what and where Asia is. Whether you consult encyclopedias or school books they do not begin by calling Asia a "vague concept". Anyone whose field of study or interest is geography knows that <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a></i> is an unfortunate term if analyzed etymologically, but - much like the word Anti-Semitism - it has slipped its way into general usage; its meaning is "a large body of land", some of which are connected by a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_bridge.html" title="Land bridge">land bridge</a>, as is the case with Africa and Asia and with North and South America. Shifting sea levels, drifting tectonic plates or man-made canals do not radically change this notion. There are two alternative words used in the German language, namely <i>Weltteil</i> and <i>Erdteil</i>, which convey the meaning of a "part of the world/earth" while avoiding the connotations of the Latin-based term <i>continent</i>.</dd>
<dd>When BBC-world or other global media outlets choose to sort their news by regions such as "Middle East" (<a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Africa_572d.html" title="Northern Africa">Northern Africa</a>+<a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Asia_448f.html" title="Western Asia">Western Asia</a>) and "Asia-Pacific" (<a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Asia_cb20.html" title="East Asia">East Asia</a>+<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australasia.html" title="Australasia">Australasia</a>+<a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_islands.html" title="Pacific islands">Pacific islands</a>), this makes sense since what goes on within these areas is often interlinked.</dd>
<dd>I agree that a discussion of how the continents (as referred to for example in the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_flag.html" title="Olympic flag">Olympic flag</a>) is problematic and that their roots in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiquity.html" title="Antiquity">Antiquity</a> (capitalized) reveals a "<a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurocentrism.html" title="Eurocentrism">Hellene-centric</a>" world view. But that should be explained in a separate paragraph, not in the intro. There is no "vague concept" in what or where Asia is located; it is one of the continents, the one where most of us live; it begins at <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a> and ends at <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chukotka.html" title="Chukotka">Chukotka</a>; it is conjoined to Africa at the isthmus of Suez and to Europe along the Caucasus and the Urals; and it is surrounded by various bodies of water; and some islands are conventionally considered as belonging to Asia; and some states or peoples are conventionally grouped along with states and peoples outside of Asia.

<p>The following is an extensive list of citations for why Asia as a concept is 1) vague 2) not really used the way that people would normally define it. Although this is an English language wikipedia, it is not an American one nor a British one, and it should be written in a way that is as NPOV as possible, regardless of where the English reader is from. Let the citations begin:</p>
<p>1) NYT: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com" class="external free" title="http://www.nytimes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com</a> Click on International, and you see that their division of news separates into 1) Asia Pacific and 2) Middle East.</p>
<p>2) WaPo: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com" class="external free" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com</a> The second of the Big Two newspapers in the US; between them, they ARE US news. Here is a more interesting division of regions, with there being an Asia/Pacific category. But coexisting with Asia + Pacific is Middle East. So is the ME part of Asia or not? Unlike below,</p>
<p>3) CNN: <a href="http://www.cnn.com" class="external free" title="http://www.cnn.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com</a> Asia edition focuses on East Asia inclusive of what is normally thought of as its own continent, Australia. The Middle East does not seem to be a market it caters to within any category. Because CNN is mainly a broadcast medium, these categorizations probably have a lot to do with time zones. Still, this is how the word is ACTUALLY being used by one of the most popular English language tv stations in the entire world.</p>
<p>3) AskAsia.com Check maps at: <a href="http://www.askasia.org/teachers/Instructional_Resources/Materials/Maps/index.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.askasia.org/teachers/Instructional_Resources/Materials/Maps/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.askasia.org/teachers/Instructional_Resources/Materials/Maps/index.htm</a> Notice how Russia doesn't seem to really be included. Notice also that the Middle East is in there but it's not--a lot of it is cutoff. From these maps, if we say what we see clearly depicted in all maps is Asia, then the western part of the ME doesn't appear to be a part of Asia.</p>
<p>4) University of Texas library maps. U of T is one of the largest universities in the US, if not the largest: <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/asia_pol00.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/asia_pol00.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/asia_pol00.jpg</a> Notice first of all, that labelling it Asia is not good enough. They label that category of maps Middle East and Asia. This particular map is only of Asia and guess what--Russia is included, but the Middle East, from the western border of Iran and west is excluded.</p>
<p>5) Asia society: <a href="http://www.asiasociety.org/about/" class="external free" title="http://www.asiasociety.org/about/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asiasociety.org/about/</a> They are one of the foremost organizations dedicated to educating people about Asia-Pacific, which, interestingly enough, also only includes countries up to Iran. It does not include the Middle East in general.</p>
<p>6) Asia Development Bank: <a href="http://www.adb.org/Countries/default.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.adb.org/Countries/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.adb.org/Countries/default.asp</a> They don't include the ME as part of Asia as well, though with so many oil rich countries, admittedly, they might not think they need any help.</p>
<p>This is just for starters. Basic lessons: The ME doesn't apparently get included in Asia much of the time. Russia has quasi-inclusion status as well. Asia is clearly vague and clearly a weak concept in that people use it many times to mean East Asia + South Asia + Southeast Asia. No Middle East.</p>
<p>Here's an additional example: <a href="http://usembassy.state.gov/" class="external free" title="http://usembassy.state.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://usembassy.state.gov/</a> It's really questionable how salient this traditional breakdown of continents is. The US state dept breaks down embassy listings into Americas, East Asia and Pacific, South Asia, Europe, Eurasia, and Africa. Interesting right?</p>

<dl>
<dd>Looking up the real world use of words is a way of verifying whether a dictionary is actually correct or not. Dictionaries are like molasses--slow. That's where a project like wikipedia shines. Words that should've made the dictionary a long time ago are often many years late. You have to be specific with why the above is dismissable. The current intro does embrace ambiguity (it says that it is so), while at the same time, giving the old staid dictionary definition. Merriam Webster for example, only mentions the Ural Mountains, so there's no consensus that the other borders (west of Black Sea) are clear.</dd>

<dd>I beg to differ for numerous reasons. One: from the get-go, you have contended that Asia is a vague "concept", superceding traditional notions and definitions (cited, verifiable, etc.) of Asia as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a>. I do not deny that continents are concepts (as already stated), but you are rebuilding the intro to satisfy your POV and further promoting vagary. I appreciate attempts to open up the intro, but (two) your other edits are badly structured (IMHO) and neither here nor there. Three: you are likely wrong (without "mass" support), as your edits were reverted by one other during our discourse. Until you can demonstrate why your viewpoint should prevail, I'll make edits (and reverts, if necessary) that more equitably reflect real definitions. Good day.

<p>I want to point out that conservative arguments that say the concept of Asia is one that is derived from antiquity are really weak. Asia Minor used to be basically Turkey. But Turkey today is often considered a part of Europe (joining the EU)!</p>
<p>To have a more global perspective is surely one of the goals of an internet encyclopedia, especially one which can be read by anyone who understands the language all over the world. Thus we can very easily clarify what traditional means and what classical means. Classical Greek/Classical Roman/traditionally in the West are all very easy clarifications. If it's so easy, why not use it? It helps to clear up any confusion (classical can mean Greek/Roman/old Europe).</p>
<p>Ok, can we please stop using Antiquity, which itself is just a definitional page that disambuiates between several definitions? It is clearly classical GREECE in this case. No need to muck things up for the reader.</p>
<p>Also, please say WEST. It is traditionally defined this way in the WEST. We make remarks like this further down in the article--why do we not extend the same courtesy to the intro?</p>
<dl>
<dd>For reasons alluded to above, these are <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a> assertions that fly in the face of other sources: by many definitions, Turkey (once known largely as <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>) is both a part of Asia and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, in a physiogeographic and geopolitical sense (et al.). In addition, Asia also has etymological roots from the <a href="../../../n/e/a/Near_East_da5f.html" title="Near East">Near East</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, so <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiquity.html" title="Antiquity">Antiquity</a> is accurate and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_Greek_d820.html" title="Classical Greek">Classical Greek</a> less so. And as for West, one could argue that we should <i>remove</i> notations of West further in the article; in fact, reiterating these viewpoints in the article or ones contrary to it implies an <a href="../../../e/a/s/East.html" title="East">Eastern</a> bias. To that end, I will thoroughly peruse and edit the article to rectify perceived POV. E Pluribus Anthony 16:01, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Um... 1) antiquity almost never means Near East or Middle East so if that's the case, then the language is just wrong. 2) How is that an Eastern bias to point out that this idea has its origins in the West? That makes no sense. It's bias NOT to recognize that in places like Russia and Japan, people don't agree with this scheme of naming continents. Not recognizing that other views exist or that a particular view belongs to a particular group (and hence is not universal) is POV. I'll hold out that you still have some legitimate reasoning out there somewhere, but it hasn't been explained yet.</p>

<dd>The current edition reads fine. I will respond, only to clarify: (1) the prior edition indicated the more general <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiquity.html" title="Antiquity">Antiquity</a> (which embraces more than Greece and Rome) and your later edit (erroneously) indicated only <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a>. (2) East-vs.-West usage isn't inherently POV, but only including one or the other is; this occurs later in the article, for both East and West. <i>All</i> such mentions should be balanced with a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. No accusation intended, but I'll soon make edits that better balance the numerous views and mentions later in the article.</dd>

<p>Let clear this. Historically, ancient European considered that Europe and Asia are separate "continent" in term of physical geography. We are no longer live in medieval era when people thought that the earth is flat. And Europe=continent isn't kosher in term of this definition. The current geography shifted the definition to political, cultural, historical category. However, to define "continent" in term of human geography, i.e. socio, political, historical identity, is problematic in term of linguistic because continent is a geological term. The correct linguistic usage is "region" rather than "continent". At least, in Japan, that is how Europe is refere to. But let say we go along with the definition used in (Western) human geography, and call Europe as a continent. Fine. But then this cause a problem if we apply it to "Asia". There is nothing to definie "Asia" in term of ethinic, sociological, political, historical identity. Some stated in this page that the current geography subcategorise Asia into East (Orient), South (British India), Central (Stans) and West Asia (Arabia/Presia?) but this isn't a definite solution unless each "region" is proclaimed as a continent to have consistency with Europe's status as "continent". Plus, human geography do inded treat each region as distinct, implicitly confering the definition of cotinent. Most modern geography book do mention (dodge) this problem and always state that Asia/Europe is a conventional or historical term. Moreover, confusion already exist in term of linguistic usage of "Asian" in various European language and different version of English. Because a category imply homogenity, which isn't a case here, "Asian" always refer to a subcategory of "Asia". I'm not going to push this as a nuetral POV however, to delete any edit which state this "POV" is a violation of NPOV policy when it is presented as a "view". And it is obvious that this will become a PC issue so censorship is pointless and reactionary. It is merely delaying the inevitable. <a href="../../../f/w/b/User%7EFWBOarticle_a3c3.html" title="User:FWBOarticle">FWBOarticle</a> 10:46, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

East Timor has an exclave on the west side of Timor Island, but it's not listed.

<dd>Hi. I agree: there is no reason to list this exclave separately unless we do so for other countries too, and I think that could get messy.

<p>I think this should be fixed. Under the table of countries for "Asia", there is a catagory of "Eastern Europe". As if this isn't wrong enough, Russia (the one country for this catagory) has only statistics for Asia. So, under the catagory of "Eastern Europe" there are statistics not for Eastern Europe, but Asia.</p>

<dd>These accusations dodge the fact that seven credible citations were removed with for no legitimate reason. I never advocated the use of sock puppets. I encouraged the anonymous IPs to register who agreed with me. The anonymous editors agree with me because they know the Middle East is not part of Asia along with the United States government foreign relations agency, US newspapers and the British Broadcast agency. Yes, many people agree with me, but unfortuneately the ones who spoke their minds are anonynmous. It is very apparant that the numerous citations I have added to support my position have been willfully removed for no apparant reason.

Just because India wanted to organize a sporting tournament called the "Asian games" and later on the Middle East wanted to host the event in their homeland does not mean they also consider themselves to be part of Asia.

<dd>Hi DarkTree, I dont think any of these websites try to be authentic source of demarcation of continents. First map does not have pakistan and a bunch of other countries AND it is a wine company website!!. Second one is a travel website and this map is their travel zones (Again, I can point out a hundred mistakes in this map). Same with the third... I can go on and on. The point is none of these "proofs" are authentic enough to shown that middle east is not a part of Asia.

<dd>You have just proven that they are credible sources. Yes, some people do not consider Pakistan to be part of Asia. Yes, it is the travel website and a wine company, but could you shoot down the other sources? The Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean sources are the most credible as they are actually Asians unlike the United Nations run by Europeans. It is absurd that the only source this article has been using to define Asia isn't even part of Asia. I wonder if on the Japanese-language Wikipedia they have a Japanese organization define the boundaries of Europe rather than listening to Europe itself? I already brought up governmental sources from the US and Australia whereas the only opposition to these sources has been a single United Nations source. Really, in all fairness my point of view should have been accepted by the NPOV policy when I had seven sources to your one source, but when I find you think twenty-seven sources vs. your one source is not enough, I question the value of Wikipedia policy. What good is a tried and true policy if a bunch of Wikipedians choose to flagrantly violate it?--<sup><i><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias"><font color="darkslateblue">Dark</font></a></i></sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias"><font color="purple">Tea</font></a> 02:58, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
