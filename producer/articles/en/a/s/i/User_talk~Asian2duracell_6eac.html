<p>Vanakkam. What exactly is your problem with the picture of Sri Lankan Tamil children which is being used in <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_people.html" title="Tamil people">Tamil people</a>? This is the second time you've replaced it with another picture. The problem with the picture you're putting in its place is that it's a picture of Indian Tamil children (which we obviously can't use to illustrate a section on Sri Lankan Tamils) and secondly that its license is of uncertain status, which means that it's likely to be deleted soon. If you could explain exactly what you dislike about it, we might be able to do something to sort things out. -- <a href="../../../v/a/d/User%7EVadakkan_8a7e.html" title="User:Vadakkan">Arvind</a> 20:39, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the explanation. The idea was to have something typically Sri Lankan for the section - I've now put in a picture of the Nallur Kandaswamy koil, which I hope is OK with you. Incidentally, I have many SL Tamil friends (and some relatives), so I know you folks are basically the same as us.

And why do you care about that? I dont think ur "Dravidian" at all. <i>The topic on Dravidians talk more about the Indo-Arya <br />
people</i> Its because people seem to understand that there are actually not much diffrence between both ethnicities. It <br />
would be better for u and everyone else if u let others, who atleast know a little bit, write this article. Rather than <br />
writing ur own POV.<a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsian2duracell_79e8.html" title="User:Asian2duracell">Asian2duracell</a>

<p>dear BostonMA</p>
<p>The Tamil People and Dravidian People pages get vandalised by user deeceevoice and WikiRaja, their contribute to those pages are extremly political motivated. Additions from other user get deleted in seconds. It would be nice if u would take a look at both pages.

<dd>Hi Asian2duracell, I will look at the pages and the edits that you would like to make. However, I would like to make some preliminary points. First, I assume that the other editors involved are editting in good faith. Good faith efforts to improve the encyclopedia are not vandalism, even if they are factually inaccurate or introduce bias. Second, a quick look at the material that you removed shows that much of it was supported by sources. The material may be biased and/or it may be inaccurate. However, the solution is not to simply excise that material. Wikipedia needs to express the significant views of experts on the subject in question. So, what needs to be done is to determine what are the significant views of experts in anthropology etc. and give appropriate weight to each of those views. If you could provide sources for the views which contradict those of the material to which you have objected, it <i>may</i> be the case that the material to which you object should be removed as representing a fringe point of view. However, it may be that the material to which you object is a significant point of view that deserves mention in Wikipedia. So, while I am looking over the articles, please try to supply sources that meet Wikipedia standards to support your case against the material to which you object. Thank-you. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 21:27, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will have to disagree with you on this since I warn those who break the rules of Wikipedia and mistreat others including myself. Also, regarding those whose opinions may differ from mine at times, I have had open dialogue with them and resolved any misunderstandings.

However, with the latter three users, have had nothing but insults, acusations, name calling, personal attacks, and arrogance from all three of you. It seems the further I discuss things in a logical way with you all, it just gets worse. Do you expect me to sit back and take all of this abuse? Are certain users on Wikipedia exempt from rule breaking and abuse of other users? As for <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a>, I have offered the olive branch to him and even suggested that we work together collectively <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ARYAN818&amp;diff=97261180&amp;oldid=97092651" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ARYAN818&amp;diff=97261180&amp;oldid=97092651" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Not any "Non-Aryan" is a Dravidian. And "Untouchables" are not Dravidian either. A Dalit from UP is "Aryan". A Brahmin of TN is ,like u call us, "Dravidian". Because they speak that language. When did we South-Indians get ripped off our Culture and Language? Or can u atleast say how that culture was "before" the Indo-Aryans destroyed our culture? U make a lot of comments about Ethiopians and Australian Aboriginies. U sometimes mentioned that we look like those people. I'M NOT SAYING, NO WE DONT LOOK LIKE THEM, HELL NO.</td>

<p>You are correct. Not every "Non-Aryan" is a Dravidian since we have the Mon-Khmers of Assam, Nagaland, Manipur and other states of Eastern India. I disagree with you that "Untouchables" are not Dravidian, since there are "Untouchables" throughout the sub-continent, or at least within the borders of India. Answer to your question about South-Indians getting ripped off of our Culture and Language, Sangam literature such as the <i>Purunanuru</i>, <i>Silappadikaram</i>, <i>Manimekalai</i>, <i>Thirukkural</i> are being forgotten. By the way, on the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian_people.html" title="Dravidian people">Dravidian people</a> page, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sangam.html" title="Sangam">Sangam</a> literature is described as "Tamil lore". WOuld we consider the Vedas of the Indo-Aryans just a simple folk lore? or the writings of Shakespere, Ovid, or Homer who wrote the Illiad simple folk lore? I don't think so. Also, there is a tendency to credit the mythological character of Agastya for teaching the Dravidians how to read, write, think, fight, and even speak! Furthermore, Sanskrit has been given higher priority than the indigenous languages of Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, and Malayalam. I am in no way putting Sanskrit down or any other language, culture, or history down. I am just answering your questions. There was literally a fist fight in parliament back in 2004 over getting Tamil to be recognized as the second classical language of India. The accepting of caste system discrimination. Ex: after the tsunami, "Untouchables" were forced to wait at the back of the line for aid and pick up dead bodies.<a href="http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=29458" class="external autonumber" title="http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=29458" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Discrimination against Dalits (Untouchables) during the tsunami relief took place in both <a href="http://www.indianet.nl/tsunamiendalits_2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.indianet.nl/tsunamiendalits_2.html" rel="nofollow">Tamil Nadu</a> and <a href="http://www.dalits.org/PHTsunamikerala.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dalits.org/PHTsunamikerala.htm" rel="nofollow">Kerala</a> There is much more I can say, but that would be a book. Yes, I do make mention of East Africans and native Australians of the possiblity of a connection with the Dravidians thousands of years ago in regards to anthropology. There is evidence in ancient Tamil literature such as the <i>Silappadikaram</i> and <i>Manimekalai</i>, mother nature which was the 2004 tsunami (this was the fourth tsunami in the history of South Asia, and archeological evidence of sunken cities (for example the 7 pagodas of Mammalapuram (Mahabalipuram - Sanskritzed name), 6 of which are buried in the Bay of Bengal)<a href="http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/apr05/NN_tsunamiarcheology.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/apr05/NN_tsunamiarcheology.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4257181.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4257181.stm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1923794.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1923794.stm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.
