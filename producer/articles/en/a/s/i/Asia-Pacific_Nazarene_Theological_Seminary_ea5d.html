</div>
<p>Asia-Pacific Nazarene Theological Seminary is incorporated legally as a corporation in the republic of the Philippines. Governance of APNTS is tasked by the articles of incorporation to the Board of Trustees who are elected usually every four years by members of the Church of the Nazarene in the Asia-Pacific Region. <i>Ex-officio</i> members are the APNTS President, Regional Director of the Asia-Pacific Region of the Church of the Nazarene, and the Regional Director of the Eurasia Region of the Church of the Nazarene. Members from each of the following fields of the Church of the Nazarene are elected to represent their geographic areas: Australia-New Zealand, Chinese Ministries, Japan, Korea, Melanesia (including Papua New Guinea), the Philippines, Sealands, South Asia, South East Asia, and South Pacific. The Board of Trustees meets annually in Manila, usually prior to the annual graduation ceremony in late March or early April, and elects from within its own group a chairperson, vice-chairperson, secretary and treasuer (the latter two being citizens of the Philippines as required by Philippine law). The current officers are chairperson Rev Steve Walsh of Australia (since March 1996), who is an APNTS graduate; vice-chairperson Dr Daniel Saengwichai of Thailand; secretary Dr Julie Macainan-Detalo, president of Visayan Nazarene Bible College; and treasurer Rev Lucinda "Luz" Tamayo.</p>
<p>Administration of APNTS is tasked by the articles of incorporation to the President of APNTS, who is a member of the Church of the Nazarene, and the Administrative Council. The President is a member of the Church of the Nazarene elected by the Board of Trustees usually for a four-year term. The current President is Dr Hitoshi "Paul" Fukue from Japan. The Administrative Council is nominated by the President and approved by the Board of Trustees.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia-Pacific_Nazarene_Theological_Seminary_ea5d.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>History</b></span></h2>
<p><i><b>Foundation and Presidency of Donald D. Owens (1977-1984)</b></i><br />
In 1977 the General Board of the Church of the Nazarene approved a plan to establish a graduate Seminary to serve the Asia and Pacific regions of the church because of the particular needs of the church in that part of the world. Dr. Donald Owens, Professor of Missions at <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazarene_Theological_Seminary_d91a.html" title="Nazarene Theological Seminary">Nazarene Theological Seminary</a> (NTS) in Kansas City and formerly a missionary to Korea, was elected to head the new seminary, which would become the first master's-level theological institution of the Church of the Nazarene located outside the United States.</p>
<p>In 1979, the church purchased a site in Tay Tay, Rizal, Philippines. Formerly the Children's Garden orphanage, the location consisted of ten acres with 22 wooden frame buildings. The proximity of the location to Manila was a deciding factor, as leaders hoped that the cosmopolitan setting would provide models for evangelism for the other cities of Asia and the Pacific. The Church of the Nazarene had directed its attentions to Metro Manila since 1976.</p>
<p>Beginning in January 1980, extension seminars of two fortnight long inytensive modules were held in January each year, involving several NTS professors as well as Dr. Angelito Agbuya, pastor of the Angeles City, Philippines, Church of the Nazarene. Students represented various countries in the Asia and South Pacific regions. Meanwhile, Dr. Owens became Director of the Asia Region and moved to Manila. As extension classes were held over the next few years, general church leaders decided that the new Seminary should become autonomous from NTS, with its own board of trustees and corporate identity. In preparation for the opening of a residence program, Dr. Owens searched for faculty members and initiated construction of an administration and classroom building (later named Owens Hall after his retirement), the ground breaking ceremony for which was held in January, 1983.</p>
<p>The buildings on the campus were renovated for student and faculty living. The Commission on Immigration and Deportation, Department of Justice, Republic of the Philippines, gave its approval for APNTS to begin as an educational institution for non-immigrant students. Regular classes began on November 14, 1983. The faculty included Dr. Owens, Dr. Agbuya, Dr. Ronald and Mrs. Neva Beech (long-time missionaries in the Philippines), and Dr. Floyd Cunningham. The Seminary was formally dedicated and the faculty installed on January 15, 1984.</p>
<p><i><b>Presidency of E. LeBron Fairbanks (1984-1989)</b></i><br />
In April, 1984, Dr. E. LeBron Fairbanks, formerly Academic Dean of European Nazarene Bible College and at the time teaching at Southern Nazarene University, was elected President of the Seminary. He began serving in the office in July, 1984, and he and his family moved to Manila later that year. Fairnbanks would continue as the second president of APNTS until July 1989, at which time he accepted election as president of Mt Vernon Nazarene College (now Mt Vernon Nazarene University) in Mt Vernon, Ohio.</p>
<p>In 1987, APNTS received its permit to operate from the Philippine government's Department of Education, Culture and Sports (now the Commission on Higher Education), and full recognition from the same Department came on June 13, 1988. Accreditation for degree programs was also granted by the Asian Theological Association (ATA) in 1988, and by the Association for Theological Education in South East Asia (ATESEA) in 1991.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the library was strengthened with the addition of several important collections centering on Wesleyan and holiness studies, and came to number over 32,000 volumes by 2005.</p>
<p>At the same time, extensive renovation and building programs on campus continued. Those who have served as Campus Development co-ordinators have been:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rev Gordon Gibson (1984-1902)</li>
<li>Mr. Terry Sanders (1992-1998)</li>
<li>Mr. Greg Taylor (1998-1999, 2004 to current)</li>
<li>Mr. David Hendrix (1999-2004)</li>
</ul>
<p>The faculty was strengthened in succeeding years. APNTS also has used a number of distinguished adjunct and visiting professors.</p>
<p><i><b>Presidency of John M. Nielson (1989-2001)</b></i><br />
After the resignation of Dr. Fairbanks in July 1989, Dr. John M. Nielson, then Vice-President of <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Nazarene_College_5881.html" title="Eastern Nazarene College">Eastern Nazarene College</a>, and formerly a missionary for the Church of the Nazarene to Denmark, was elected third President of APNTS in November 1989. He and his wife Janice Nielson settled in Manila in February, 1990.</p>
<p>Nielson's philosophy of administration stressed: 1. Transition and progress by continuity;<br />
2. Building consensus rather than operating by decree or by majority;<br />
3. Commitment to delegated authority;<br />
4. Accessibility to faculty and students (with recognition as well for the need for privacy);<br />
5. Unity, equitability, fairness;<br />
6. The Servanthood model;<br />
7. Facilitation of the purpose of the institution.<br /></p>
<p>Nielson placed a high priority on worship and took personal interest in chapel services. With a donation of funds in honor of Anna Wooten, Nielson set about renovating the outdoor chapel so that it could be used for regular chapel services. He began having national culture days that would convey understanding among students from various nationalities. Janice Nielson played the organ, taught Christian education of children courses, and began Kid's Klubs.</p>
<p>Over the 12 years of his presidency, Nielson raised about US$200,000 for endowments, scholarships and various projects. At the same time he secured additional funds from the general church. He also oversaw the beginnings of computerized systems in accounting, in registrar's records, and in the library, and secured better funding for regional faculty members. He initiated agreements with sister holiness denominations for scholarships for students. Discussions with the Wesleyan Church culminated in that denomination's appointment of and support for Dr. Stanley Clark who served full-time from 2000-2004 teaching Christian Education. In exchange, Wesleyan students received the same tuition and housing benefits as Nazarene students.</p>
<p>In 1993 the Asia-Pacific region established a media center on campus, the Fairbanks Media Center. This enabled APNTS to begin a communication major within the Master of Arts (Religious Education) (MARE) program. In 1996 the Commission on Higher Education gave recognition to a Master of Arts Christian Communication (MACC)degree program.</p>
<p>In 1996 the faculty publication of <i>the Mediator</i> began. The Philippines' CHED required graduate schools to issue a journal. The Mediator seeks to communicate to the APNTS constituency and graduates. It provides a forum and vehicle for faculty publications and seeks contributions from graduates and other interested parties.</p>
<p>The Nielsons left in 2001 for European Nazarene Bible College (now European Nazarene College)where Dr Nielson became the Academic Dean.</p>
<p>Dr Floyd Cunningham, a foundation faculty member, and academic dean of APNTS, was appointed Officer in Charge in September 2001. In 2002 the Master of Science of Theology program was developed to help prepare graduates for teaching courses at undergraduate Bible and Theological Colleges and for further graduate work by requiring a thesis.</p>
<p><i><b>Presidency of Hitoshi "Paul" Fukue (2003 to 2007)</b></i><br />
In January 2003, the Board of Trustees chose Dr Hitoshi "Paul" Fukue as President of APNTS, thus becoming the first president indigenous to the Asia-Pacific region. In 2001, Dr. Hitoshi and Mrs. Mitsuko Fukue had became full-time faculty at APNTS. Fukue had served as a pastor in Japan for more than 20 years, and had earned a ThD at Boston University, studying sociology of religion. He began serving as an adjunct professor at APNTS in 1992. Mitsuko had earned a MEd at Boston University and taught both interpersonal and intercultural communication. Dr Fukue was inaugurated as the fourth President of APNTS in April 2003.</p>
<p>Through adjunct professors Dr Charles and Dr Carolyn Seiffert, the Free Methodist Church signed an agreement with APNTS, similar to the agreement that the school had with the Wesleyan Church, that Free Methodist students would receive the same privileges as Nazarene and Wesleyan students so long as the Free Methodist Church sponsored an APNTS faculty member.</p>
<p>Since 2001, extensive campus development has taken place. At the center of campus now stands the Nielson Center for Education and Evangelism, a large, 5 storey multi-purpose building which houses the media center for the Asia-Pacific region in the basement, and the seminary administration and the offices for the Philippine Field of the Church of the Nazarene on the first floor. The second floor will be a large auditorium, the third floor a new state of the art library, and the fourth floor more offices and classrooms. Other projects have been new and renovated housing for students and faculty. Completion of the NCEE building and more development is in the plans for the coming years.</p>
<p>In 2004 the Donald D. Owens School of World Mission was inaugurated by the Board of Trustees as a resource for training students for effective mission service. Its goal is to become the premier missionary training institution for the Church of the Nazarene. Each year it sponsors the Owens Lectures. Those giving the Owens Lecturers have been Dr Donald Owens (2004), Dr Robert Coleman (2005) and Philip Parshall (2006).</p>
<p>During 2006 an Accelerated English Program was introduced to teach English but also to train APNTS students in teaching English as Second or Foreign Language as part of the denomination's mission strategy in evangelising creative access nations.</p>
<p>Dr Fukue announced his resignation as APNTS President in January 2007 and will conclude his responsibilities in May 2007. He will return to Japan to pastor a church in his homeland.</p>
<p>APNTS graduates have gone on to pastoral, teaching, missionary, administrative and many other forms of ministry in various countries, including: Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Myanmar, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Samoa, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Ukraine, and the United States of America.</p>
<p>After 22 years of service to the church, the leaders of APNTS are proud that so many of its over 250 graduates remain in ministry in Asia and the Pacific and that the purpose of the school, to offer a quality graduate theological education to the people of Asia and the Pacific, has borne and continues to bear fruit.</p>
