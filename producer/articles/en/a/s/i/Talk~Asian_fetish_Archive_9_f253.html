<h2><span class="mw-headline">Historical causes</span></h2>
<p>To what extent does the prevalence of prostitution and the low status of women in some Asian countries, especially during the colonial era and mid 20th century, contribute to stereotypes? Case in point: Thailand. Prostitution is very common and many if not most Thai men visit them. This created a huge population of prostitutes that were exploited by Western sex tourists and military stationed in or near Thailand (eg. US military stationed during Vietnam war). These men then brought back stories of prostitutes willing to do all sorts of degrading things for money. A similar phenomenon occured during Shanghai in the 1930s. In strong contrast, US miliary in Iraq and Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have little access to Arab prostitutes. Even if there are prostitutes in Arab countries, it is most certainly kept discreet, and foreigners would be forbidden from using them. Thus, Arab women are less "eroticized" than Asian women. My point is that the stereotype of "Asian women" seems to come from a handful of historical situations like Thailand during the Vietnam war, Shanghai during pre-war colonial era, and so forth. This could be comparable to the US military experience with French women during WWII, which resulted in France being synonymous with sensuality. Asian nations are , broadly speaking, very conservative, so I think that these historical anomalies resulted in a grossly distorted image. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Soda80 (<a href="../../../s/o/d/User_talk%7ESoda80_0ba7.html" title="User talk:Soda80">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Soda80_0dce.html" title="Special:Contributions/Soda80">contribs</a>) 13:42, 3 June 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>To what extent does prostitution reinforce negative stereotypes? Quite a bit, actually. However, the stereotypes of East Asians were created before the 19th century, before any widespread contact with prostitution. If one were to study colonial era popular literature, historically speaking, the French associated prostitution and licentious sex with Arab women in the 18th century, the British associated them with South Asian women in the 19th century, and the Americans associated them with East Asian women in the early 20th century, and then with Southeast Asian women in the 2nd half of the 20th century. (Of course, this vastly oversimplifies many, many details, but that is the general idea.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, in essence, while it's true that prostitution in the 20th century did heavily reinforce the sexual stereotypes, I would further add that the stereotypes themselves are centuries-old, and are deeply rooted in colonialism itself. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 00:22, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting point. So it would seem that prostitution in the 20th century influenced the dynamic but you claim it is older. Can you give some examples or specifics. Kubrik's Full Metal Jacket's portrayal of a Vietnamese prostitute saying "me love you long time" etc. is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Stories like this were brought back by vets. That movie itself spread this ugly image, which was then in turn spread by Two Live Crew with their song "me so horny". This image was latched onto by the pornography industry who created a whole subindustry of "love you long time" and "sucky sucky" porn. It seems like a domino effect from the vet's experience of paying 5 dollars for sex with desparate, poor Vietnamese women to the internet age with sickening Asian fetish porn. While you are correct that Arab women were exoticized by the French, the 20th century experience with Arab nations has offered no opportunity for similar exoticism. Arab prostitutes are at least not available to US marines, and Arab porn is either non existent or not exported. Compare this with Japan which has a HUGE porn industry, number 5 in the world, including some disturbing aspects like rape and very young girls. Saudi Arabia doesn't do this. This is why you never see Arab porn floating around, and no "fan boys" types ogling lewd Arab comics. Someone who knows Japan only through these cartoons would have a seriously warped view of an actually very conservative nation. That's the most interesting part -- the gap between these stereotypes and the reality that Asian societies are generally more conservative and Western societies much more promiscuous and licentious. Today, the dominant factor in distorted stereotypes would definitely have to be the media and internet. If people actually travelled and met real people, people would see each other perhaps a little bit more as equally human.Soda80 13:54, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you've done a good job at summarizing the spread of stereotypes. We can find the necessary academic references in due time, but it looks correct and better than what is currently in place in the article. My point was that, insofar as this section of the talk page is about the "historical origins", many historians would find parallels between 20th century American representation of East Asian women and 18th century French representation of the Orient. For example, when French Orientalists (who were usually quite wealthy) traveled throughout the Muslim world, they were able to gain entrance into the palaces of powerful rulers, from which they brought back stories of harems as symbols of licentious sex. These images were then reproduced in literature and art (e.g., <a href="../../../h/a/r/Image%7EHaremPool.jpg_b5dc.html" title="Image:HaremPool.jpg">Image:HaremPool.jpg</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/g/Image%7EIngresBainTurc.jpg_6f50.html" title="Image:IngresBainTurc.jpg">Image:IngresBainTurc.jpg</a>), which Europeans mistakenly viewed as representative of all women in the Muslim world.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So in this view, the misrepresentation of Vietnamese women based on the narrow experiences of American GI's with Vietnamese prostitutes has direct parallels with the narrow experiences of French and British Orientalists and Arab, Turkish, Persian, etc., women in the 18th and 19th centuries. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 23:49, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think one important point here is realise that a lot of this is more to do with the American point of view. In the US, probably because of it's abnormally large religious population sex is viewed as a bad thing. Hence the anomally that extreme violence in US TV and Film is far more exceptable than the mildest sex. Outside the US, if you look at Europe, Britain, Canada, Australia, Japan or Thailand sex is not such a big deal and is generally seen as a more positive, natural and important part of life. Therefore perhaps some of the eroticism assigned to Asian women and French women is due to the clash between American prudishness and the culture of these other countries where people have a more balanced view of sex. I don't think that most Thai women get a worse deal than American women because of this, and I have no doubt that they are far better off than women living in Arab countries. Women living in very religious countries like parts of the US and the Muslim world often end up repressed and left subordinate to men, this often results in various forms of abuse.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 03:03, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't speak for Thai culture, but I do know that the concepts behind things like "Asian fetish" and "white-worshipping", though obviously not the English terms themselves, have been extensively discussed in Japanese media and academia. (See <a href="http://modelminority.com/article713.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://modelminority.com/article713.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.) I don't know much about comparative media representation in the US and UK, but what I have read leads me to believe that they have about the same level of sexual content. In any event, phrases like "more balanced view of sex" are by definition POV, although I have read of authors who strongly advocate that position and defend practices such as sex tourism in Thailand as natural and mutually beneficial.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Korean and Chinese American phenomenon</span></h2>
<p>An interesting and unexamined facet of the debate is why the issue predominates in Chinese and Korean-American communities especially. Korea is 99% ethnic Korean. China is diverse but one culture clearly dominates. The lack of multicultural give and take, "race-mixing" etc. might produce exclusivist attitudes not seen in other Asian populations. I've even heard of mixed foreign couples on vacation in korea being harassed in public.</p>
<p><i>“Korea is the epitome of a nationalistic nation. Or so it would seem. Koreans will violently defend their nation against any perceived external slight or insult, against any percieved encroachment on tradition or territory." (from a Univeristy of Chicago study.)</i> Coincidence?</p>
<p>Maybe some of these attitudes have crossed over into the CA and KA cultures and exacerbated by minority status. The point is that the majority and most vocal critics of Asian fetish seem to be CA and KA, not other Asian groups. Why is that? <b>And can anyone find statistics about opinion / opposition to interracial dating broken down by specific ethnicity?</b></p>
<p><a name="Steve_Sailor_Exposed" id="Steve_Sailor_Exposed"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Steve Sailor Exposed</span></h2>
<p>I removed Godfrey Daniel's new addition regarding muscle mass. He references Steve Sailor as a source, who is a well known white supremacist and racist:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/sailerfraud/ir.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/sailerfraud/ir.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/sailerfraud/ir.html</a></p>
<p>A little bit about Steve Sailor:</p>
<p>Once of his most (in)famous works for the National Review which boosted his publicity was the 1997 article on interracial marriages, "Is Love Colorblind". In the article, he believes Asian males and Black females are so inherently inferior and unattractive by birthright, they will be at a significant disadvantage in finding relationships and will be breeded out of society. This overexaggerated article was known to create gender divides among the races. Knowing the stir initially created by this article, he wrote another article in 2003 where he flat out lied about the 2000 Census stats on interracial marriages to repeat the havoc initially created so he can profit.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, Sailer made two more accomplishments in the name of scientific racism. First, he created the Human Biodiversity Group, a right-wing eugenics thinktank where people with the mindsets of Steve Sailer can discuss and promote academic racism, homophobia, xenophobia, and eugenics policies. Among the worst members of the HBD group, whom Sailer Primarily bases his scientific research upon, are Charles Murray, Vincent Sarich, Arthur Jensen, John Derbyshire, Chris Brand, Philippe Rushton, Jim Woodhill, Steve Pinker, Jon Entine, and Peter Brimelow.</p>
<p>Second, Steve Sailer left the National Review to join the VDare internet publication. VDare is notorious for it's pro-fascist, anti-immigration stance and racist views to rid America of anyone who is not white. VDare's president, Peter Brimelow, declared the 1965 Immigration Act as "Hitler's revenge". As a note, VDare labels itself as a non-profit organization to avoid paying taxes and to give tax breaks to its contributors, but it profits anyway to employ exclusively right-wing biased journalists and racists so they can make a living.</p>
<p>Sailer's racist views and true colors became more prevalent after writing articles for VDare. Whether declaring that Latinos are no-good trash and Latino immigration must end, or that Blacks are genetically inferior in mental capability and do not deserve equal educational and economic opportunities, or that Asians are genetically inferior in physique and do not deserve opportunities in professional sports, Sailer has used VDare as his flagship to carry out his racist agenda of white supremacy and to trash on anyone who is not white like him.

<p>It seems that a user by the name of <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatsume_Soseki_3503.html" title="User:Natsume Soseki">Natsume Soseki</a> is attempting to insert statements sourced by a personal website on Tripod, possibly his own. Interestingly, he attempts to cite anti-racist articles to support his contention that Asian American anti-racism is in fact racist, without producing any credible sources saying why.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Other Asian Americans have labeled these arguments, and the term "Asian fetish" as used by activists, to be thinly-disguised calls for <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">racial separatism</a>. <a href="http://kennethomura.tripod.com/asiaphile_racist_asian_fetish/" class="external autonumber" title="http://kennethomura.tripod.com/asiaphile_racist_asian_fetish/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Indeed, some writings by Asian American activists lend credence to this view. <a href="http://www.modelminority.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=269" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.modelminority.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=269" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://www.modelminority.com/article296.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.modelminority.com/article296.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.modelminority.com/article289.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.modelminority.com/article289.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://www.modelminority.com/article1026.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.modelminority.com/article1026.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></dd>

<p>Since this is against Wikipedia policy, namely <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, I have removed this opinion. In general, adding such opinions is <b>encouraged</b> as it promotes NPOV, so long as the opinions are published in credible sources, but sourcing such opinions with personal websites is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 19:19, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My position is and has been that the ModelMinority website, itself an activist site, is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for this article, except when citing editorial opinion and viewpoints of particular authors. Thusly, if the editor were to say "Joe Schmo says <i>blah, blah, blah</i> in an article on "woof" ...", that could be sourced there, otherwise not. I think this applies to opinions from across the spectrum. As an aside, I am surprised to see <a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> deleting opinions sourced from MM, as he has used it often to source his own positions. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 19:40, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So much in the article is opinion, and supported by opinion pieces. A sentence or two stating another opinion, and supported by opinion piece surely is not out of place, especially when Omura's opinion seems to be supported by the activist literature itself, which is linked to elsewhere in the article. I put Omura's name in the disputed sentence for added legitimacy. Deleting this sentence while leaving in an entire article supported mainly by opinion pieces seems to me to be vandalism, blanking out sections to push one POV. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatsume_Soseki_3503.html" title="User:Natsume Soseki">Natsume Soseki</a> 20:10, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Natsume, you are taking random posts from various users from MM.com and implying that they are representative of the "activist literature" when in fact they are not. You might as well cherry-pick certain extremist statements by searching through thousands of post on craigslist's political forums and claim that they are representative of US politics. I am familiar with the MM.com site and you are grossly misrepresenting their views and cherrypicking statements. "Racial separatism" is beyond the scope of this article and should be relegated to a different article. I'm also a bit offended that you chose to add this section without even consulting any of the regular contributors in this discussion forum. The fact that you chose to do this with no discussion makes me suspect you are a troll. OneViewHere 17:22, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When I came across this article, about a month ago, its blatantly POV nature was obvious to me. To balance the POV overwhelmingly pushed in the article, I put in one sentence indicating another POV on this subject exists.

<dd>My sentence has been in the article without complaint for a month. Yesterday, Wzhao553, with no discussion, removed this sentence not because it is POV (the entire article is POV) but because it is not Wzhao553's POV. When he deleted this sentence, I added references to articles in MM to back up Omura's position. These were not randomly cherry-picked articles, but articles used in this article. Wzhao553 again deleted this sentence. I then put the sentence back in, adding direct quotes from the MM articles to bolster this view. Wzhao553 has again deleted all reference to Omura's opinion because it does not support Wzhao553's opinion.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia policy</span></h2>
<p>There appears to be some confusion about Wikipedia policy. Here's a paragraph from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources. Exceptions may be when a well-known, professional researcher in a relevant field, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material. In some cases, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as their work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications. However, exercise caution: if the information on the professional researcher's blog is really worth reporting, someone else will have done so.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So personal websites (such as those on Tripod) are unacceptable sources unless they are directly about the person in question. Hence, citing Omura's website in an article about Omura is acceptable, but citing it for other purposes is not. I hope that clears everything up. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 20:32, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with that sentiment. However, it will mean taking out a good bit of what is currently in the article if we stop using non-<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources such as MM. Are you up for that? -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 22:10, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, MM rarely publishes original content. The articles which <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatsume_Soseki_3503.html" title="User:Natsume Soseki">User:Natsume Soseki</a> referenced were originally written by Hoyt Sze for the Berkeley-run paper, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Californian_502c.html" title="The Daily Californian">The Daily Californian</a>. In this case, you are discussing whether a college newspaper such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Californian_502c.html" title="The Daily Californian">The Daily Californian</a> is a reliable source, not whether MM is reliable. If you don't think the paper is reliable, then I am curious as to why you believe so, but saying that a reference is unreliable just because it was republished on MM is of course a bit silly. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 22:36, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fighting 44s</span></h2>
<p>Here is something that should interest any editor who claims to want a NPOV in this article.</p>
<p>An activist group calling themselves the "Fighting 44s" is monitoring this article, has edited this article in the past, and has stated its intention to overhaul the article to their own POV.</p>
<p>A few posts from the site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mon Oct 24, 2005: BboyDestructiveD recently alerted me to our presence on Wikipedia under "Asian Fetish"... HAHAHA, holy crap, we're NOTABLE!! We pulled a fast one on these motherf*ers, huh boys?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Posted: Wed Nov 02, 2005: ^^ As I recall, 3line was the one who wrote that paragraph and inserted in the definition of CCB. Don't expect it to last though. We really want to do a complete overhaul of that section.</li>
</ul>

<p>and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mon Apr 03, 2006 The definition of Model Minority on Wikipedia has recently been modified by whites and people who deny AA-racisim to something that is not in our favor... The same still goes for Asian Fetish, where the war is still raging&#160;:</li>

<p>So, you have a group calling for a "complete overhaul" of the article to be written "in our favor." The same month that this call goes out, Wzhao553 begins editing the article to push the POV of this group, and to suppress other POVs. Now that he's "owned" this article for four months he claims to be an "experienced editor" and can delete, without comment, even one sentence that presents a POV he resents.</p>
<p>By tolerating Wzhao553's obvious POV vandalism, the other editors of this article are just as responsible for the black spot it puts on Wikipedia. The standard for Neutral Point of View at this article is: When people get disgusted and give up arguing with Wzhao553, NPOV has been achieved. Congratulations, all. I am disgusted and am leaving. Now pat yourselves on the backs that NPOV is here again, at least until someone else is foolhardy enough step in and write a sentence Wzhao553 does not like. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatsume_Soseki_3503.html" title="User:Natsume Soseki">Natsume Soseki</a> 18:57, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Look, <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatsume_Soseki_3503.html" title="User:Natsume Soseki">Natsume Soseki</a>, you're new here, so I'll try not to <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>. If you think this page is a complete whitewash (pardon the metaphor), then please go back and read the archives. I'm not saying the page is perfect -- far from it -- and I think there is quite a bit of POV, but you <b>do</b> need to adhere to Wikipedia policies when correcting it. But most importantly, your diatribes -- here, and on my personal talk page -- make it vastly less appealing to try to help you. In your rant on my talk page you threatened to leave Wikipedia. If you're going to stay, then please work cooperatively and within the policies of the place. Go read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and other policies and then make your points.</p>
<p>Specifically to the fighting 44's -- their POV has been battled before and if they try to "take over" the page it will be battled again. Most of the things you quote are prior to the most recent edit war. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 20:30, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Natsume, you're gonna have to come up with something more substantial than that. I've been watching this article for some time now and wzhao553's history of contributions to this article have been pretty substantial and even-handed. If you can come up with any edits of his that promote the "Fighting 44" POV I'd be glad to see it. As it is, there are extremists on every user forum. If Wzhao joined the craigslist politics forum, would you accuse him of having the same extremist POV that some KKK craigslist contributer had? Bottom line: This is not guilt by association. You VIOLATED wikipedia's terms of use and the longtime contributers to this article called you on it. You made signficant changes without consulting anyone else or talking about it beforehand in this dicussion forum. And then you sit back and get all offended when people call you on it?143.127.3.10 18:51, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some might remember <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a>'s suggestion a while back that the article contain a sourced section detailing the origins of the term, similar to the <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testosterone_poisoning.html" title="Testosterone poisoning">testosterone poisoning</a> article (see <a href="../../../a/s/i/Talk%7EAsian_fetish_Archive_7_ef0c.html#Coined" title="Talk:Asian fetish/Archive 7">Talk:Asian_fetish/Archive_7#Coined</a>). After some thought, I decided to follow up on this suggestion. The section has now been added. It also seems like a good candidate to completely replace the unsourced and poorly sourced popular and academic terminology sections. I'm going to go ahead and delete those sections in a few days, absent serious objections. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 04:18, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reverted the section. It is well-written (and researched), but is fundamentally <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

<dd><i>The concept of sexual fetishism is central to psychoanalysis, of which Freud is considered a founder. For Freud, fetishism is a denial of sexual difference: the male fetishist, confronted with the female's lack of a penis, is traumatized by the fear of castration. To alleviate his castration anxiety, the man imagines a surrogate penis, which may be a plait of hair or an undergarment or a shoe, and projects it onto the female body.</i></dd>

<p>Has there been a Request for Comment on this article before? I'm going to read through the history, but maybe somebody already knows. That might be helpful. I see there is <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Asian_fetish_0b85.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Asian fetish">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Asian fetish</a> although I was thinking <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html#Article_content_disputes" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC#Article content disputes</a> - I'll add it to one or more.</p>
<p>There's relatively little in the article about the fetish itself and the people who may be said to have it (or market to it). It seems to be more about stereotypes of asians and speculation that those fuel the fetish. That may sometimes be true; go to an online porn retailer and look up some asian titles; Hustler's Asian Fever for example has "We love you long time" on the cover and the back cover synopsis plays to stereotypes, though this may not be indicative of what the video's content actually portrays. The article also seems to focus on a WM/AF fetish when there are members of other "races," sexes, and sexual orientations with the fetish; even some asians may have an asian fetish. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 18:19, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You still completely don't get it, do you? The usage in pornography is not the popular use. It is completely off the radar. Everyday usage of the term does not refer to pornography. Therefore, claiming that it does is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Hence, every single person, myself included, has stated that the popular terminology section is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Just because there exist some links out there somewhere that refer to it, does not mean that it is not <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 08:00, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am an Asian American. I know more about this subject than you. I hear the term used every day. All of my friends hear the term every day. Never do we hear it in reference to pornography. That is not debatable. There exists a website with that URL. However, if you do a comprehensive search of the web as I have, you will find that 95% of the references do not refer to pornography. Therefore, stating that the pornographic usage is the popular usage is not only <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, but it is just plain incorrect. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 08:07, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've glanced over the talk page; seen the two versions. Here are my thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "use in pornography" is not "*the* definition" like it is made out to be in Gnetwerker's version. However, it is ommited in Wzhao's version. Asian fetish as a sexual fetish should be mentioned, but not primarily as pornography.</li>
<li>Sections 1 and 2 should be named "As a sexual fetish" and "As used in social activism". I myself have not come across the latter usage but that's just my personal experience and means nothing.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pornography</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure I understand the above discussions of whether pornography should be mentioned in the article or not. It seems to me the subject is being very narrowly defined by being about relationships between non-asian (primarily white) men and asian women. As I mentioned above, it's not limited to that.</p>
<p>Anyway, Excalibur.com (for example) has two different DVDs titled <i>Yellow Fever,</i> another titled <i>New Yellow Fever,</i> and a <i>Yellow Fever 3-pack.</i> There is also the Hustler series <i>Asian Fever</i> which is up to its 28th DVD (Hustler also has a website and a magazine titled "Asian Fever" but I don't know what issue it is up to), and Excalibur also has several other DVDs with "Asian Fever" in the title. There's also <i>Fetish Fanatics 7 - Asian Girls who are Only 18.</i> 876 DVDs altogether with "Asian" in the title.</p>
<p>An "asian fetish" has been mentioned several times in the pornography usenet discussion group rec.arts.movies.erotica going back to 1997. 4,240 results for just "asian."</p>
<p>Incidentally, the oldest usenet post mentioning "asian fetish" is from 1989 in the group soc.culture.asian.american <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.culture.asian.american/browse_thread/thread/39764bd5ead1a0b6/19dba82a41ac8126?lnk=st&amp;q=%22asian+fetish%22&amp;rnum=4&amp;hl=en#19dba82a41ac8126" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.culture.asian.american/browse_thread/thread/39764bd5ead1a0b6/19dba82a41ac8126?lnk=st&amp;q=%22asian+fetish%22&amp;rnum=4&amp;hl=en#19dba82a41ac8126" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> Other mentions that year were in soc.culture.japan and soc.culture.hongkong <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 17:01, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the research, <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a>, that was really helpful! We are not talking about whether pornography should be mentioned or not -- there's no question there needs to be some mention. We are, however, talking about how the term is primarily used. The argument here between me and <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> is simply over which usage came first and is most prominent -- the pornographic sense or the sense used by Asian American activists, authors and academics. I've tried to explain to <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> that it was Asian Americans who first coined the term and that the porn industry later reappropriated and marketed it, but he is convinced that it's been used in the porn industry since the 60's. He simply accuses me of being biased when I kindly explain to him otherwise. I mean, come on. This concept is controversial, but this argument is ludicrous. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 17:46, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I misunderstood the disagreement about porn then. I'm not sure where or when the term originated, but I think it could have originated among non-asian people (who either have the fetish or observed others with it) just as easily as with asian people, perhaps independently and simultaneously. That first usenet use (oldest archived, anyway) I mentioned above, while in an asian-american discussion group, was by a white guy; where he heard it (or if he simply recoined it) we do not know.</dd>
<dd>I would tend to doubt if pornographers appropriated the term from "Asian American activists, authors and academics" simply because I would doubt most pornographers would read that sort of material. I suppose it's possible, but I think it more likely they saw a market for porn featuring asians and used an obvious term for it (perhaps one mentioned in letters to their company). <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 18:13, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, since we can't figure it out by our own research, I've suggested many times that we use secondary sources. See, e.g., in chronological order:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Similarly, heterosexual Asians have long been aware of "Yellow Fever" -- Caucasian men with a fetish for exotic Oriental women. I have often heard it said that "Oriental women make the best wives."</i> (Hwang, <i>M. Butterfly</i>, 1986, publ. 1988)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>In my study, many Korean American women encountered White men who, for whatever reasons, pursued and dated exclusively or predominantly Asian/Asian American women. These men were so common and identifiable that the women had special names for them; they were called "Rice Kings" or "Asiaphiles," or men with an "Asian fetish" or "Asian fixation."</i> (Pang, "Intraethnic, Interracial, and Interethnic Marriages among Korean American Women", 1998)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>When Caucasian or other non-Asian males are attracted to Asians with more intensity or frequency than is shown for other groups of women, Asian-Americans refer to this as "Yellow Fever" or "fetish"; nicknames for those who exhibit such behavior include "Fetish guys," or "Rice Kings," or "Rice Queens."</i> (Prasso, <i>The Asian Mystique</i>, 2005)</dd>
</dl>
<p>All these sources explain that the term is specifically Asian American. I am simply basing my opinion that the term is used primarily by Asian Americans on these, and other, sources. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 18:25, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This entire argument is utterly beside the point. When and how the term originated is perhaps (and only perhaps) interesting historically, it is the description of its uses that is encyclopedic. The section on the term "Asian fetish" in pornography does not take the position that it is "original" in some sense, but that it is what it is easily observed to be: an obvious descriptor, following on from (e.g.) foot, breast, or leather fetishism, wihout regard to the incongruity between those more clinically-correct Freudian fetishs and this fetish toward stereotypes of Asian women. Further, the definition in that section is the dictionary definition, so I do not understand why WzHao is so anxious to replace it with his tendentious essay. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 19:22, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

I owe you one. Well, from my own POV, basically, in the very beginning (<a href="../../../a/s/i/Talk%7EAsian_fetish_Archive_9193.html" title="Talk:Asian fetish/Archive">Talk:Asian fetish/Archive</a>), the article focused on porn and did not include references to how Asian Americans actually use the term. There were a lot of complaints about this, so it migrated toward Asian American usage, and included references to Asian American literature. Now, the article seems to be moving back in the direction of porn and away from standard Asian American usage and referenced literature, which is somewhat frustrating, for obvious reasons, to an Asian American editor trying to accurately represent how the term is actually used in his own community. Again, this is my personal POV about a term that was coined and is used primarily in my own community, and is not (yet) the Wikipedia consensus. Thanks again. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 00:00, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, the version before Wzhao begain inserting his essay had been structurally stable for over two months (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_fetish&amp;oldid=42022145" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asian_fetish&amp;oldid=42022145" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>), and without any discernible drift "in the direction of porn". It is WzHao's attempt to insert the Asian American social activist POV that is destabilizing he article. There is no problem with representing that POV, but what is being pushed is a "hostile takeover" of the article. Wzhao should cut down his "Origins" essay to a single paragraph (or two) that is directly relevant to this article, and move the rest somewhere else, as most of the references (by admission of the text) do not directly reference "Asian fetish". -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 01:13, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I still haven't gone through all the history of the dispute, sorry. It seems like the article should be able to accomodate both porn and asian-american activism, and I would think there is probably some substantial overlap too (i.e. at least some of the porn containing some of the things that activists criticize). I have been trying to look for other references. Google scholar, news, and book searches, and Amazon "search inside this book." Some of the news search hits brought up different uses. One on tattoos used it in the sense of asiaphilia, while another referred to "asian fetish videos" which is ambiguous since it could refer to things like <i>Asian Fever</i> or to things like bukkake, cosplay, tentacle rape, etc. videos.</p>
<p>Some of the book hits may merit inclusion. <i>How To Attract Asian Women: An Asian Woman Reveals It All</i> by Ming Tan critiques broad accusations of asian fetishism and defends non-asian men who are attracted to asian women and vice versa, while acknowledging some problematic attitudes exist among some.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I had Comedy Central on last night and comedian <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Gaffigan_8f41.html" title="Jim Gaffigan">Jim Gaffigan</a> said during his stand-up "I wish I was Korean because then my interest in Asian women wouldn't be so creepy." <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 20:35, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the update, <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a>. I'm glad you're working on this. I would consider Ming Tan's book to be Asian American literature. I forgot about that book, but it does contain a viewpoint which should be cited. I would consider Tan to be an activist as well. Based on the literature available, you can see that an important point to get across is that not all Asian American activists are critical of Asian fetish, and critics of Asian fetish aren't always activists. The article currently doesn't represent that, because it doesn't represent the entire range of Asian American opinion and literature. I'll try to compile some references and quotations that represent a wider range of opinions and post that. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 23:42, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Penis size again</span></h2>
<p>I deleted this, another version of the perennial penis-size paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Aside from the issue of height, one of the most controversial topics is the issue of penis size, in which people of Asian descent are perceived as being smaller than Caucasians and men of African descent. The only reliable studies of penis-size commonly cited are the Kinsey study, the <a href="../../../u/c/s/UCSF_2f3d.html" title="UCSF">UCSF</a> study, and an Italian study, none of which even attempted to correlate size with race. There have been many other studies with claims of varying rigor such as the LifeStyles condoms study, but these are generally flawed by selection bias. Frequently cited is the study of <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Phillipe_Rushton_f9b1.html" title="J. Phillipe Rushton">J. Phillipe Rushton</a> (1987), but Rushton's data are questionably fitted to his personal theories of racial behavior, including his claims that blacks are inherently inferior in brain size and are thus prone to criminality. Despite the unproven nature of the penis stereotype, it nonetheless leads to the perception that interracial relations are based more on penis size compatibility than simply on personal attraction, which also parallels the popular beliefs surrounding white female/black male relationships.</i></dd>

<dd>Wzhao asked me to weigh in so here I am. Frankly I think these penis size sections have represented exactly what is wrong with this article: it is being used as a soapbox to construct a unified theory of media representations of Asians and Asian Americans and how those representations cause harm. An article with the title "Asian fetish" should be strictly limited in scope rather. Instead it keeps veering towards something like <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_American_contemporary_issues_eeb0.html" title="Asian American contemporary issues">Asian American contemporary issues</a> which seems to be what many are after but insist on turning this article into, rather than creating a new article which would be the appropriate thing to do.

<p>I really don't see how penis size have to do with asian fetish. I think that should be place in an article called asian stereotypes or misconceptions. I am asian and is well awared of the personal issues asian americans faces in the U.S., but I imagined an article labelled "Asian Fetish" would be a rather 2 paragraph small article that says something like "non asians who have a fetish for people of asian descent. This concept is normally used in the media....." --Doomzaber 22:24, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Non-Asian men with a "fetish" for Asian men are called "<a href="../../../r/i/c/Rice_queen.html" title="Rice queen">rice queens</a>." There exists substantial literature in Asian American queer writing that deals with this, but I am not personally familiar with much of it. I agree that non-Asian women could have a fetish for Asian men, but there exists far less literature and evidence of this (in the US).

<p>I think having a fetish with any race is possible. It depends on how the media depicts it. If they were more movies with a passionate asian male towards, the stereotype of them being asexual will become a myth. the media has the power to protray any race in a negative or positive light. In the past, asian males were regarded as hypersexual, though this was a bad thing, back then.--Doomzaber 09:10, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It works vice-versa too. Asian women are hot, that's all there is too it. It probably has something to do with the color of their skin and the fineness of their hair. Also, factor in that Asians in America tend to be more wealthy and intelligent than thier Caucasian counter-parts, therefore being a more desirable mate. This can be attributed to sampling bias: while intelligent and well-to-do Asians may have the resources and motivation to move to the U.S., poor Asians have to stay abroad (out of the sampling pool). There is also the immigration are by their very nature more self motivated (otherwise they wouldn't have immigrated) and the fact that many Asian countries such as China and Japan have tougher schools, and you can have relatively non-racist explanation for why Asian-Americans are more successful. Whatever the case, I'm am going to ask out a smart, beautiful, disiplined Asian woman out and I don't want to be bothered by people who accuse me of being "fetish".

Gosh that is just ignorance! Most asian americans do not fit the model minority. I guess that is why you are single and maybe never even talk to a girl of any ethnicity, so you have to use the media as your guide of how people of different ethnic groups act. A common stereotype of foreign women is that they are discipline and passive. The media exploits this idea, which is why people who are of a different ethnic group would want to date an asian, latina, or any other third world country women. they believe they are the perfect women since they do what they are told. I have news for ya, it doesn't work like this since asian and latina women are quite strong. I am sorry that you may have gotten that idea from the Last Samurai, but it is the media playing iwth your head. Your comment about the wealthy asians comming here is true to a degree, but not all asians are Chinese or Japanese descent. Some immigrate here because of the war in southeast asia, which includes poor chinese families as well. The media exploits asian females as being very sexual and such while exploiting asian males as the opposite.--69.236.66.75 05:56, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Allow me to clairify. The "smart, beautiful, disiplined Asian woman" I was referring to was a specific person I know by name. She's got near perfect grades, and everyone knows she is a nice person. Of course, I know Asian women who are at the opposite end of the spectrum. I consider myself equal opportunity when it comes to dating, which is why I try to get to know people of all races. I am just frustrated with accusations of Asian fetish, because it implies that just because I am asking an Asian girl out I have fetish. This happened last time I asked a girl out (she was Arab) and it is really annoying.Single guy 01:01, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

However and this applies to anyone who is planning to date someone of another ethnic group, just be ready to deal with other people's blacklash about dating someone of a different race.

<dd>My own take on it is that people may be identified or self-identify, jokingly or seriously, as having an asian fetish when they only have a preference. That preference might be more accurately be labeled a fetish when it is their primary or exclusive attraction. That attraction might be based on (1) appearance or (2) supposed behavioral and/or ideological characteristics or (3) some combination thereof.

<p>Another point worth remembering is that often people will be attracted to individuals with a more exotic appearence, accent or culture. This is quite probably because of the benefits of outbreeding. It is well documented that children of so called "mixed-race" are healthier than children born from couples of the same "race". It would be possible to make arguments critising those who only date within their own "race" as being inbreeders or to some degree incestuous, that sounds more like a fetish to me... --<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 02:20, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I read through that section. What is being covered there is, entirely as far as I can see, pseudoscientific and would not be taken seriously by most evolutionary biologists and psychologists. It is all conjecture and theory with no solid evidence whatsoever. It is clearly designed to be racist. Although I don't doubt that these things have been published I think reproducing pseudoscientific theories can be dangerous in itself. A bit like the disproportionate amount of attention given to creationism, which can make it seem to outside observers like such pseudoscience is on an equal footing with more proven science when it clearly isn't. I don't think what I was suggesting above is linked to these theories. --<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 00:13, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Firstly how do you define whites and asians? Secondly, there would be no more extinction of whites than there would be Asians, the offspring would inherit equally. However, I'm sure in the very long run, if Humans survive long enough, "races" as we know them today will become meaningless and personally I don't think that would be a particularly bad thing. Remember the Roman empire ran from scotland to north africa. Soldiers were recruited in africa and sent to defend Hadrians wall in Scotland, those soldiers often married locally and died there. The result of all this was that it is quite hard 2000 years later to spot the different ethnic groups that originally made up europe, hence we now say European looking, before the Romans the British natives had red hair and pale skin, the French had brown hair and green eyes and the Germans blond hair and blue eyes (to simplify).--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 01:21, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I used to live in Japan and there "White" women are idolised by a large number of men.

<p>I also know a number of Asian men who have only dated "White" women since high school, they almost always go for stereotypical blonds. I know this is only anecdotal evidence, but I'm sure that other contributers to this discussion must also have come across such individuals. There maybe more "White" mean marrying "Asian" women in the US than the other way around, but this may not be down to a lack of desire on the "Asian" men's part but more a lower rate of success in converting these relatioships to marriage, perhaps not least because "White" women are more likely to come from cultures where marriage is not as desirable as it is in asian cultures.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 00:35, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sure there are people with a preference for, or a fetish for, every "race" there is. "White fetish" doesn't get many hits, and at least some are for other things (e.g. cinephiles with a b&amp;w fetish), but having such a fetish may be called something else. There might be less writing about other fetishes; why that would be, I don't know. "Caucasion fetish" brought up practically no hits at all, though it did bring up a <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Love_b882.html" title="Savage Love">Savage Love</a> column in which <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Savage_35e0.html" title="Dan Savage">Dan Savage</a> differentiated between people with an attraction to Asians (or others) versus people with a racist attraction.<a href="http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/SavageLove?issue=23877" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/SavageLove?issue=23877" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 01:28, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sounds like Mr Savage agrees with me. One interesting part of those letters, is that someone talks about individuals who only want to "bang a stereotype", I guess this would mean a relationship where demands are constantly put on somone to behave in a stereotypical way rather than their natural behaviour, especially during sex. I suppose this might be the elusive definition of where normal attraction becomes a fetish? Somehow though, I'm not sure all the "Asian" "Activists" (possibly read "racists") that support this article could sign up to this definition as it might not quite give them the ammunition they are looking for?

<p>Interracial dating is a tricky thing. I am asian and know some people who are caucassian and have an asian wife. However, I am cool with that since the guy didn't date here because of the asian stereotypes. Furthermore, with the stereotypes in Hollywood, interracial dating is a form of power where the man is more dominate than the woman. What I mean is that in the movies, the women usually give up their identity and their background to please the man and this symbolizes that What I don't like is hollywood's skew view of interracial dating. It is more shallow than the real thing.</p>
<p>Dating is an odd thing really. If you think about it, a person dating a particular race is the same thing as one only going out with another of the same race.</p>
<p>For me, I prefer all races. However, I usually prefer looks as the first thing to go out with someone. To be honest, I find asian,latina, and caucassian(in no order) women(bruettes) the most attractive. It has nothing to do with their personality that makes me attractive to these two ethnic groups the most, but just their face.</p>
<p>What irks me is that people would date only because of what the TV told them how a certain race acts. As for the caucassian guy has a asian wife, I look up to him. Unlike the hollywood stereotypes where they usually make the man dominate teh woman have her and her kids to sumbit with the white culture, this person doesn't do this. To me, the way hollywood protrays interracial dating symbolizes dominance and power based soley on race. However, as for a few I knew, they doesn't seem to do that. They usually speak both tongues, in english and another language. they also teach their kids both cultures and not just be limited to western culture.</p>
<p>There are white fetishes. Have anyone seen jungle fever. However, with the way, Hollywood does it(which I read on newsweek) they try to tone this down in hiphop movies by having a latina woman for the lead black character instead. I find it interesting from reading the article is that from the lead AA characters has to demand for a AA wife for the film. --69.236.66.75 06:39, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Amen, brother. I live in Japan, and the western women here ALWAYS use that term because the male foreigners here (at least in my city) almost exclusively date Japanese women (myself included). And it has NOTHING to do with stereotypes - I personally think, in general, Asian women are more physically beautiful, an opinion which, sadly, seems to baffle most Japanese women here. I believe that there are idiots out there who will date Asians exclusively because they think that the stereotype is true, but the term gets thrown around way too much, and it does seem to be stemming from jealousy when western women use it.

<p>There may be men or women who particularly seek out Asians, but I doubt that those men or women are interested in <i>all</i> Asians. Similarly, some men or women are attracted to people with blonde hair, blue eyes; African or African-Americans; big muscles. No one questions Asian predilection for white skin (both men and women), no one questions a man who consistently brings home women with long brown wavy hair. This article seems to me to be unfounded and simply the result of personal sentiment and point of view. With Google's suggestion that it is relevant, I would say people are keen when a white person consistently dates an Asian person -- it is simply less apparent or affects others indifferently when any of the other afforentioned cases occurs. <a href="../../../d/b/u/User%7EDbulwink_8d34.html" title="User:Dbulwink">Dan</a> 21:19, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The argument from Wzhao, which you can read in the archives, is that the fetish is not toward a person by a stereotype of a person. From there it devolves into complex arguing based around this notion of a "post-colonial racial fetish", which doesn't follow the dictionary definition at all. This doesn't mean that I agree with the argument. However, as Wikipedia is "the dictionary that everyone can edit" we strive to include all remotely plausible views that are supported by sources. The Asian social activist version of the term is certainly in reasonably wide use, whether you agree with its definition or not. As a non-Asian, I do not pretend to understand the full extent of the outrage felt by Americans who feel stigmatized by racism. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 23:06, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you'll find definitions of "fetish" that are not so limited. There are fetishes for particular kinds of people, e.g. <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acrotomophilia.html" title="Acrotomophilia">acrotomophilia</a> (amputees). Whether fetishes are objectifying probably depends on the specific nature of an individual's fetish, the definition of object and one's politics. While there doesn't appear to be an article on blonde fetishism, there is the stub <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trichophilia.html" title="Trichophilia">Trichophilia</a> which as defined appears to cover it, and also <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redhead_fetishism.html" title="Redhead fetishism">Redhead fetishism</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depilation_fetishism.html" title="Depilation fetishism">Depilation fetishism</a>. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 00:38, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I confess I'm not sure where the distinction between a fetish and a paraphilia is. From an Amazon search, e.g. acrotomophilia is described as a fetish in <i>Sexual Health across the Lifecycle: A Practical Guide for Clinicians</i>, <i>Useless Sexual Trivia: Tastefully Prurient Facts About Everyone's Favorite Subject</i> and <i>The Mammoth Book of Vampire Stories by Women</i>, but appears to be described as a paraphilia in most others. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 02:59, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's an oversight. People can be attracted to Asians and still treat them like human beings, just like I could have a thing for girls with long brown curly hair and not treat them like objects.

<dd>I also want to add, after reading some of the articles via external links, that there are indeed levels of obsession. People may obsess about Asians in a similar way they obsess about a foot fetish or even a similar way to women with large breasts. I still see no clear reason for this article, at least without the addition of other articles on Amazon Woman Fetish, White Woman Fetish, etc. The only reason I can find that the article has not been deleted after two recommendations for deletion is something related to a theme I observed in the articles: Asian men or white women (since the wikipedia entry focusses on white men + asian women) feel threatened or that someone from another race is 'stealing' their opposite sex. <a href="../../../d/b/u/User%7EDbulwink_8d34.html" title="User:Dbulwink">Dan</a> 07:50, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mongoloid Asians, Not South Asians</span></h2>
<p>Although I think they should change this, people from Indian Subcontinent (South Asians) are generally described as "Asian" in United States. I think it is important that we specify that this article refers to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongoloid.html" title="Mongoloid">Mongoloid</a> Asians because as far as I know, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Americans_39e9.html" title="Indian Americans">Indian Americans</a> aren't usually thought of as "Asian" (they are often looked as a race closer to Persians and Arabs who are generally characterized as "white"). So I am going to specify this in the article. <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachorious_df65.html" title="User:Zachorious">Zachorious</a> 06:31, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I don't think south asians are often referred to as asians in the US, nor do I think they are seen as closer to persians and arabs. The question to be answered is, among people who use the term "asian fetish," do they apply it to south asians as well - and can that be verified. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 12:02, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually you are correct to a certain extent, South Asians are classified under the US Census as "Asian". However most of the public do not look at Indians as Asians. Most Indians are often mistaken for Persian, Arab, and sometimes even Italian (but never mistaken as a Chinese, Japanese, ect.). So I assume when an Asian fetishist thinks of an Asian they think Mongoloid. <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachorious_df65.html" title="User:Zachorious">Zachorious</a> 15:25, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I still don't think South Asians are often mistaken for those other groups. Maybe light-skinned ones would be sometimes. Regarding an asian fetish possibly including south asians, the UK magazine <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_Babes_7332.html" title="Asian Babes">Asian Babes</a> includes indians in with far easterners. The <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_stereotypes_in_pornography.html" title="Ethnic stereotypes in pornography">Ethnic stereotypes in pornography</a> article claims that "In modern visual pornography: Black males and [...] Asian girls (women of Subcontinental origin) in Britain," is common.

<dd>Several points, first of all as I mentioned before, Asians in the UK often refers to just Indian Sub-continental Asians. Also don't forget that <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a> is just a myth and there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race#The_rejection_of_race_and_the_rise_of_.22population.22_and_.22cline.22" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race#The_rejection_of_race_and_the_rise_of_.22population.22_and_.22cline.22" rel="nofollow">clines</a> between China and India for example, so that the Nepalese are essentially half Far-eastern, half indian in appearence. Also I don't really thing Mongoloid is an acceptable term, though I'm sure you meant it in good faith. Let's not forget that many editors here would question whether there is such a thing as Asian Fetish and if there is, the definition is certainly up for grabs.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 00:17, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This page suffers regularly from being used as a poster for activists with a message to spread, and for white Americans and Europeans who think racism doesn't exist at all ("what are they worried about") or worse, is excused or explained by something. Good-hearted editors have been driven away on several occasions by the endless arguments, insults, and pettiness.

<p>This article has degenerated. The article originally spoke of the Asian fetish in a generally non-biased term. Now it actually is an article that has been written to basically deny the existence of the asian fetish or to actually promote that the asian fetish is a good thing. There are more statements in the article that state how the idea of the asian fetish is not a racist phenomenon (or that the idea of talking about its existence is racist) and how it does not exist than there are statements that discuss it's existence. Further, a lot of the supposedly unique contributers who are changing the article to make it a horrible article that denies the existence of the asian fetish seem to be coming from one or two IP addresses.

<dd>Well, this article is still a work in progress. It seems to me that most of the criticisms of the term are more about defending and promoting Asian American interracial marriage than criticizing Asian fetish, which is often not even mentioned. Which is perfectly fine, so long as it's properly sourced (as it is) and it's contained in Asian American interracial marriage. But until we get around to creating that article, the information is simply stuck here. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 05:51, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree that this article has degenerated. I still don't particularly like the existence of this article, but the article is far more balanced than it was before. It seems you are essentially complaining because the article is no longer just a soapbox for one extremest point of view. Unlike before there is some proper cited scientific research to refute aspects of the Asian Fetish assertion and explain other aspects of it. There is also some important material to more clearly define Asian fetish and distinguish it from normal relationships between asians and other ethnicities. There is no reverting to the old article, just because you don't like the tone of the article. If you have an issue with specific points, feel free to find independent, credible research that counters those points and add it in point by point.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 00:42, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Half of the criticism section doesn't even make sense or it's not even about Asian fetish. And it's in terrible need of citation. The detracting editors here are too busy defending interracial relationships, when, in reality, that is not even under attack. "Asian fetish" applies to those that have an unhealthy and racist attraction to Asian women, and sometimes to Asian men. Obviously not all interracial relationships are the result of Asian fetish, and the article never makes the claim that all interracial relationships are the result of Asian fetish.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Criticism of the usage and term "Asian fetish" should discuss how the sexual attraction of someone specifically Asian is not unhealthy, that it's perfectly normal, etc etc. But right now the criticism section concentrates on defending interracial relationships.

<dd>The problem is that the term "Asian fetish" is so poorly defined and unsupported itself by valid scientific research that it is hard to say anything is "off-topic".

<dd>Sure, we can discuss how the term is used, and that sometimes it's used unjustly and incorrectly to label normal interracial relationships. But that's not a criticism of the term itself. A criticism of the term would have to discuss how there is nothing wrong with having a specific sexual preference for Asian people. You're defending something that's not under attack in this article when you defend interracial relationships in general. It's very simple:
<ul>
<li>Being against Asian fetish does not automatically mean you are against interracial relationships.</li>
<li>Supporting interracial relationships does not automatically mean you support Asian fetish.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The article does not make any claims to the contrary of the two points above. And in fact, there are a lot of interracial couples that are very against Asian fetish, because they don't want to be associated with interracial couples that were conceived by Asian fetish. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 06:28, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Couple of points
<ul>
<li>Where is the line between "Asian fetish" and normal interracial relationships (I'm sure you can find extremes, but where is the line in the middle?)</li>
<li>If you can answer that, where is the line between natural attraction to features and culture that happen to be most asssociated with asians and fetish related sexual preference for Asian people.</li>
<li>To define asian fetish adequately you would have to define Asian. Again, it is very difficult to define a race as they don't exist in absolute terms. (see clines in <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a>)</li>
<li>I'm not convinced that there are couples where one person can be reliably said to have an Asian fetish. Most people I have ever seen or heard of, who could be labled as having an Asian fetish have either been total social pariahs or who have little chance of pulling anyone or they are total weirdos who visit prostitutes in foreign countries. I'm not sure a couple with any kind of long term relationship could base their relationship on stereotypes as these evaporate in days if not minutes. I would need to see some evidence that substantiates what may be a myth. Therefore it is possible that much of what people are labeling Asian fetish is infact just an incorrect label for people in interracial relationships therefore it is legitimate that interracial relationships are discussed in the context of this article.</li>
<li>I would also urge you to remember that Wikipedia is an encylopedia of knowledge, that means it must reflect the balance of proven research.</li>
<li>Finally remember that Wikipedia is an international project and therefore things you feel you know are true where you live and in the circles you move in may not be true universally. I too have to remember this and have been guilty of making asumptions in this way. But I have admited when I am wrong and when I only have part of the answer.</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've had discussions about interracial relationships before, and they're never enjoyable to me. Like I keep saying, this topic is about Asian fetish, not interracial relationships. Yet you keep concentrating on the topic of interracial relationship. Let me try to respond to you:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Where is the line between "Asian fetish" and normal interracial relationships (I'm sure you can find extremes, but where is the line in the middle?)</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The answer to that doesn't matter to this article. The article is not about interracial relationships.
<ul>
<li><i>If you can answer that, where is the line between natural attraction to features and culture that happen to be most asssociated with asians and fetish related sexual preference for Asian people.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>That also does not matter for the purpose of this article. Again, the article does not claim that <b>all</b> interracial relationships with Asian people are the result of Asian fetish. Much of the current criticism section doesn't actually criticise Asian fetish at all. <b>Much of it is simply in defense of interracial relationships - something which the article never attacked.</b> The article claims that sexual attraction specifically to Asian people is unhealthy or otherwise socially negative. The criticism of Asian fetish should concentrate on how sexual attraction specifically to Asian people is perfectly healthy, socially normal, not negative, etc etc.
<ul>
<li><i>To define asian fetish adequately you would have to define Asian. Again, it is very difficult to define a race as they don't exist in absolute terms. (see clines in <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a>)</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Yet, academia in the world all over manages to discuss and study race and racial issues. The topic of Asian fetish, in the scope of how well-defined the concept of race is, is no different from any other topics involving race and racial difference.
<ul>
<li><i>I'm not convinced that there are couples where one person can be reliably said to have an Asian fetish. Most people I have ever seen or heard of, who could be labled as having an Asian fetish have either been total social pariahs or who have little chance of pulling anyone or they are total weirdos who visit prostitutes in foreign countries. I'm not sure a couple with any kind of long term relationship could base their relationship on stereotypes as these evaporate in days if not minutes. I would need to see some evidence that substantiates what may be a myth. Therefore it is possible that much of what people are labeling Asian fetish is infact just an incorrect label for people in interracial relationships therefore it is legitimate that interracial relationships are discussed in the context of this article.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Again - off topic. The article is not about interracial relationships. It's about Asian fetish. Asian fetish exists, at the bare minimum, as a concept, as evidenced by the sources in the article. If you want to talk about how long term relationships are not based on Asian fetish, that belongs in a topic about interracial relationships.
<ul>
<li><i>I would also urge you to remember that Wikipedia is an encylopedia of knowledge, that means it must reflect the balance of proven research.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Yes, and you're also talking about an encyclopedia with an extensive directory of porn stars. Again, if you want to provide balance in the form of criticism of Asian fetish, then do so instead of defending interracial relationships, which is a different topic.
<ul>
<li><i>Finally remember that Wikipedia is an international project and therefore things you feel you know are true where you live and in the circles you move in may not be true universally. I too have to remember this and have been guilty of making asumptions in this way. But I have admited when I am wrong and when I only have part of the answer.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>That's why sources are important. Much of the criticism section is not sourced, nevermind that it's off-topic.</dd>

<dd>Who said that "Asian fetish" only refers to sexual attraction specifically to Asian people which is unhealthy or otherwise socially negative."? Who's definition is that? How do you define "unhealthy" in this context or "socially negative"?</dd>
<dd>You can only say interracial relationships are off topic if you can adequately define "Asian fetish".</dd>
<dd>I don't see how saying that interracial relationships are not based on asian fetish can be in any article other than one about asian fetish.</dd>
<dd>Again, is there a clear definition of "Asian fetish"</dd>
<dd>One of the problems here is that "Asian fetish" is not a very developed concept and has very little evidence to back it up, let alone a water tight definition. Therefore it is not really possible for you to say what is and what is not relevant in this article - personally I have long argued that this article is not worthy of existence, but given that it is going to be here, it's vague nature is going to attract a lot of material from a broad spectrum.</dd>
<dd>Some of the criticism may not be sourced, but the arguments for the concept are either not sourced or very poorly sourced too.</dd>
<dd>I think you will find that most modern academia is very careful in its use of the term race and within science the term is carefully qualified where it is used. The only valid material which uses races, as they are colloquially refered to, would have to be studying race as a social construct, where in some places it does exist in such a way.</dd>
<dd>As the article stands now I think it is quite balanced in its coverage of the concept. I would be genuinely interested in what you think the article should consist of, what subsections and containing what?</dd>
<dd>Seems "Asian fetish" as you are advocating is more a belief than a scientific concept.</dd>
<dd>Personally I am happy for the article to detail the case for the concept of "Asian fetish" and then to list the counter arguments. This seems only fair when it comes to such a poorly researched and ill-defined concept. It feels like (correct me if I'm wrong) that you will only be happy when the article presents "Asian fetish" as fact, completely unchallenged.</dd>
<dd>This article has previously been the site of major edit wars and deletion battles. It had recently reached a state of stability with editors from both sides agreeing on the broad layout and content as it is now, if you make sweeping changes this consens will collapse. The article must remain balanced and cover all aspects that people feel are reasonably connected to the term "Asian fetish".</dd>
<dd>I am genuinely open to having my mind changed about this article, but I'm not yet convinced.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 02:36, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Asian fetish is defined in the beginning of the article. I don't know how many times I have to repeat this - the article never attacked interracial relationship. No matter how "vague" you seem to think the definition of Asian fetish is, the article never criticises interracial relationship. A defense of interracial relationship is not even relevant. You and others are ruining this article by insisting on a defense of interracial relationship as if it's under attack when it's not at all under attack. Being against Asian fetish does not mean you're against interracial relationships.</dd>
<dd>You've already made it clear that you don't like the existence of the article. Everything you just said in your previous statement confirms that. But it's been through two deletion nominations already, so get over it. Put some relevant criticism in the section if you're so critical of the idea that Asian fetish is negative. So far all it does is defend interracial relationship, something that was never under attack in the first place. The Controversy section of the article, for example, has some great opposing views. The Criticisms section of the article, on the other hand, is crap. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 04:27, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Use of term inbreeding in exogamy section</span></h2>
<p>The use of the term inbreeding here is technically correct. People of the same "<a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a>" are more closely related than those from two different races. It is correct in this context to describe it as inbreeding, as mentioned further down the paragraph, it is undeniable that where there are offpring from intraraccial relationships there is a higher rate of genetic abnormalities, albeit lower than that found where even more severe inbreeding takes place such as those found between cousins or siblings.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 12:39, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The sentence in question says "dating" someone of your own race. "Inbreeding" is defined as procreation with a close relative. Furthermore, it's been found that there is more genetic difference and variation between two random individuals of the same race, then there are between genetic difference that differentiates two races. In fact, that entire paragraph about inbreeding and outbreeding, and how it supposedly ties into dating, amounts to a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 15:44, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Good point regards use of the term dating - I guess it is used to emphasise the attraction part which precedes procreation but it is not the term used in the sources referenced (I have changed it on your suggestion). As for "No original research" I agree, but there is nothing in the paragraph which could be called original research - it is well referenced.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 23:24, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's original research because nothing in the sources (correct me if I'm wrong) say that if you are attracted to or date someone of your own race, that is an unhealthy tendency. That's the first thing that the paragraph claims. The section came to this conclusion on its own based on cited research on inbreeding. Firstly, like I said before, greater genetic variation has been found between two randomly picked individuals of the same race than there are genetic variations between two different races. Secondly, the article never tried to define "Asian" on purely genetic terms, and you yourself have already said that "Asian" is a social construct.</dd>
<dd>I'll try to lay it down for you in a simple example - an Asian person could have a white grandparent, yet look fully Asian and self-identify only as Asian. This same Asian person could then be related to any random white person through his or her grandparent and runs the risk of inbreeding by procreating with a white person related to him by his grandparent. You simply cannot jump through logic holes and go from attraction to someone of your own race to inbreeding. This would be original research.</dd>
<dd>Simply to say, unless there is a source to say that attraction to or dating someone of your own race is unhealthy compared to attraction to or dating someone of another race, you cannot make that claim. That's why I put the citation tag there. In fact, I think the whole paragraph should be deleted or edited. But it's obvious that you are not willing to compromise on what I personally think is a completely illogical claim since you keep reverting even a simple citation tag.</dd>
<dd>And still, that paragraph remains irrelevant to the topic of Asian fetish. It tries to make the claim that it is healthy to date someone of another race, but how does it defend Asian fetish as a perfectly normal tendency, that is to say, sexual attraction specifically to Asian people as perfectly normal, and not someone simply of a <i>any</i> race other than your own? It doesn't even go as far as to defend interracial relationships for Asian people, which is what seems to be the entire purpose of the Criticism section. It defends interracial relationships between ANY races. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 01:12, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Firstly, like I said before, greater genetic variation has been found between two randomly picked individuals of the same race than there are genetic variations between two different races.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>You are going to have to get a reference for that. I agree there is not a huge genetic difference between different "races" but the statement you have made is not true in more than 99.9% of cases, genetic divergence increases roughly in line with geographic separation. "Races" are generally separated geographically.</p>

<li><i>Simply to say, unless there is a source to say that attraction to or dating someone of your own race is unhealthy compared to attraction to or dating someone of another race, you cannot make that claim.</i></li>

<p><a name="Definition_of_Fetish" id="Definition_of_Fetish"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Definition of Fetish</span></h2>
<p>It seems like we're having trouble defining "Asian fetish". I can't find an online definition of "Asian fetish" but there are definitions of "fetish" from respected sources. www.dictionary.com defines fetish as:</p>
<p>1. An object that is believed to have magical or spiritual powers, especially such an object associated with animistic or shamanistic religious practices. 2. An object of unreasonably excessive attention or reverence: made a fetish of punctuality. 3. Something, such as a material object or a nonsexual part of the body, that arouses sexual desire and may become necessary for sexual gratification. 4. An abnormally obsessive preoccupation or attachment; a fixation.</p>
<p>I think definition 3 is what applies to this article. In this case, the fetish is race. How we fit "Asian" into this definition is beyond me, but maybe this is a start. Plan B: Can we just put something in the Wiktionary and say that that for the purposes of editing this articler, it is our official definition? Either way, it would be could if we had a clear idea of what we were talking about. Single guy 02:42, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree this is a major part of the problem. Obviously, non of the definitions listed is very satisfactory. Don't be too quick to state that the fetish here is race either, it could just as well be Asian culture as it could be race, and is most likely to be combination of the two, or race is used as a marker for culture. Then again as I've said repeatedly, I think the term "Asian fetish" is most often used as an attack on interracial relationships - though I do acknowledge that there is are some people who have a stereotypical sexually orientated attitute to Asian women. Finally we cannot make up our own definition of the term as this would be original research and would be misleading.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 11:36, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bravo, Logoi</span></h2>
<p>Bravo, Logoi, on making an attempt to state what this article is really about. Your paragraph was unsourced opinion, but that really doesn't matter because this whole article is a string of one unsubstatiated opinion after another. As anyone who bothers to read them can tell, the "sources" used in this article are completely biased opinion pieces.</p>
<p>The one by Frank Chin and Jeffery Paul Chan is particulary idiotic and funny-- Whites intermarry with Asians due to white supremacy. Right. We all know white supremacists want nothing more than mixed-race children. And I supposed if pressed, the authors can cook up some "facts" (sourced by more opinion pieces) to prove this idiocy. The truth, of course, is that racial supremacists, both white and Asian, are against mixed-race marriage. And the purpose of this whole article is to paint mixed-race marriage as one of those carefully cataloged <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_crimes_against_Asian_women_in_the_United_States_4666.html" title="Sex crimes against Asian women in the United States">Sex crimes against Asian women in the United States</a>. (Asian/Asian, white/white sex crimes don't matter to the racial supremacist, of course.)</p>
<p>And don't you love that disclaimer at the top? <i>This article is not about love and/or interracial relationships...</i> when that's exactly what every "source" refers to? Just assert without evidence that the white partner is completely brainwashed by some media stereotypes, and voila, their relationship is not "love," but a "fetish."</p>
<p>It's kind of amusing to see these guys red-faced and sputtering against mixed-race marriages while claiming they're fighting racism. If the authors of this article were really concerned about the real racism facing the Asian-American community, they certainly wouldn't be attacking those who marry into that community. The true agenda behind this article is apparent to anyone who reads it. It's best to just sit back and watch it grow more and more obvious. -- Human Fetishist 20:15, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I've said, being against Asian fetish does not mean you are automatically against interracial relationships. It just means you are against Asian people being sexually objectified.

<dd>Your objection is noted. However, it is refuted by the sources cited, and indeed by the entire history of editing this page.</dd>
<dd>(Pardon the repeated edits, but I'm still getting used to wikipedia) I agree with you in principle: if we define "asian fetish" to mean an attraction to asians, then this is a separate matter (although not entirely separate, since attraction forms the basis of most modern relationships) from whether that attraction leads to a relationship or not. However, if we do this, we cannot logically contrast "Asian fetish" with "normal healthy relationships" since the two are incommensurate _by definition_. Also, simply saying that it has to do with attraction to asians doesn't distinguish what would make this attraction "healthy" or "unhealthy." This is just basic logic. However, for an encyclopedia, we are not allowed to define "asian fetish" to mean anything we want it to mean. We are constrained to reporting on how it is used, which happens to be all over the map. Logoi 08:10, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Check the sources referenced, Asian fetish is always described as an attraction to Asian people. And any negative connotations attached to Asian fetish has been to describe such an attraction, not to describe interracial relationships. We <i>already</i> cannot logically contrast Asian fetish with interracial relationships of any sort. The repeated edits, by virtue of the fact that they are repeated, do not make them valid.

<p>That said, I've also removed three of the more outrageous "criticisms" in the section:</p>
<p>"Exogamy": As said previously, this is a means of pronoting interracial marriage on a genetic basis, and so does not deal with Asian fetish at all, but solely with Asian American interracial marriage. The section could belong there, but first that article would have to exist.</p>
<p>"Vagueness": First of all, the concept of fetishism lies within pscyhoanalysis. There is no scientific or medical basis at all for psychoanalysis, and moreover, fetishism is not an accepted concept outside the psychoanalytic community. Insisting on scientific evidence is an argument against fetishism in general, not of Asian fetish in particular. Secondly, the difference between Asian fetish and a normal interracial relationship is the dfiference between "abnormal" and "normal." This is made clear at the beginning of the article. Now, if someone wanted to believe that all interracial relationships are abnormal, that would be within his or her right to freedom of speec, but that wouldn't be placed on Wikipedia either.</p>
<p>"Hypocrisy": As I said earlier, there is a difference between an opinion sourced by an article and an opinion aobut an article. The former is acceptable and encouraged, but the latter amounts to adding one's own original opinion and thus constitutes a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. This paragraph amounts to the latter.</p>
<p>All in all, this article does seem to be getting better, although several editors are starting to become uncivil and making personal attacks.

First, if the exogamy section can be linked to a criticism of Asian fetish, then it should by all means stay. This need not be a complex link, but it does need at bare minimum a reliable source that discusses both in the same context. If such a source can be found, then we should add it promptly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fetishism is part of psychoanalytic theory, which is a literary theory as well. This is why academics like Homi Bhabha and David L. Eng who discuss it are literature professors and not psychologists. The definition can be found in many reliable sources, which all agree with one another. If you feel strongly that the definition is vague, then it is up to you to find reliable sources which describe it as such. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 08:51, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wzhao553: those guys you talk about are so out there that to claim this is found in reliable sources is ludicrous. (I'm not aware of anyone considering a post-colonial theorist a reliable source on anything except perhaps post-colonial theory.) The article <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_fetish.html" title="Racial fetish">racial fetish</a> (which you edited) states: "Homi Bhabha defined the idea of a racial fetish in contrast to the idea of the Freudian sexual fetish which he describes a denial of difference, where the male sees the female as a castrated male, seeing missing parts rather than a different anatomy. Similar to Freud's idea of a fetish, Bhabha defines racial fetish to be a fixation on other races being not different, but lesser or "mutilated" versions of the white male."</dd>
<dd>If you are going to use a specialized academic definition of racial or sexual fetish (and I'm still not sure if this is what you are arguing) at least lets bring it out into the open so we can discuss it. You are saying something is clear when almost everyone will disagree; all this does is strengthen the claim that there is no consensus as to the definition of "fetish" let alone "asian fetish."</dd>
<dd>Regardless of whether the word "fetish" is well defined, "asian fetish" is not. It seems like you are arguing with the criticisms and trying to inject your own views into the article. Read the articles in the references and links starting with the first one: they contain these criticisms. I see your removal of this material as trying to suppress legitimate criticism, silence viewpoints that are well-documented and therefore not NPOV. Logoi 09:25, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, Logoi, let's compromise. Let's let the "Vagueness" section stay, but there's also no reason not to include a section on the academic, psychoanalytic discussions of Asian fetish, which would contain more specific definitions. We can place this in a separate article such as Asian fetish and psychoanalysis (due to the technical details), but we can place a summary paragraph in this article as well. However, it will take a few weeks to gather up all the sources needed to write that entry.

<p>The point about the exogamy section (which was re-written yesterday) is that it raises the question as to whether "Asian fetish" is a fetish (unhealthy) or something else. It provides a scientific argument which challenges the validity of the concept of "Asian fetish" - though personally I can see both sides of the argument, it should be here though.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 18:07, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is tangled issue since on the one hand, there is the desire which can be healthy or unhealthy, and on the other hand, there is the mating which can be healthy or unhealthy. No one can question that exogamy is a healthy form of mating. And both sides seem to agree that desire is healthy when it promotes healthy outcomes.</dd>
<dd><b>Tradeoffs</b> on the one hand there is the healthy mating, on the other hand there is the potential for damage due to stereotyping.</dd>
<dd>Also, on the one hand there is preserving cultural identity through endogamy, and on the other is the giving of good health to offspring.</dd>
<dd>The debate centers around how to weigh these tradeoffs. Some Asian American groups give more weight to the damage of stereotyping and to preserving their group identity than to the risks to the health of their children.</dd>

<p>The quote is too short and doesn't support what was read into it, although I haven't looked at the whole goldsea site. The movie is actually correct in portraying Asian men in Asia like this. It happens to be a matter of fact that should probably go into this article (under American bias) that in parts of Asia, Western white women become courtesans/bar hostesses/entertainers and are sought after by Asian men there for their race and racial attributes that are thought to be attractive (like white skin, height, larger breasts etc.). I'm not aware of a negative label for them doing this. (Trivial point in case it's reverted: The movie reference should have been to Rising Sun). It is also fairly clear that some people are using the label "asian fetish" to discourage interracial relationships in order to empower Asian men in America. I think there should be a section on the politics of this term. Logoi 08:43, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can't stress enough that the subject of Asian fetish is not about interracial relationships, nor <i>should it be</i> about interracial relationships. It is a term to describe a certain type of sexual attraction.</p>
<p>But yes, it has certainly been used to attack interracial relationships. However, defending interracial relationships is not a criticism of term Asian fetish. What should be mentioned is its usage and how the term is offensive to some people.</p>
<p>A lot of the editors of this article is missing a very important point - that a criticism of the negative connotations of this article needs to concentrate on that some people consider it perfectly normal and healthy to have a sexual attraction specifically for Asian people. That would be a real criticism and a real opposing view.</p>
<p>The Exagomy section is especially off topic as it doesn't even deal specifically with Asian people. Some editors may think that Asian fetish is about interracial relationships involving Asian people, but the section deals with interracial relationships involving people of <i>any</i> races. It doesn't even defend interracial relationships with Asian people, it defends relationshiops involving any two people not of the same race, regardless of what races.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why "asian fetish" is slang</span></h2>
<p>It is used in a specialized way by a certain group or groups of people. It is not part of standard English, or medical or other jargon. "Asian" is not merely an adjective describing fetish, (or a specific type of fetish like a foot fetish) since "fetish" is not being used in its usual scientific sense to describe an object or body part. I'm unclear why there is a debate about this. Logoi 19:44, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Asian fetish is NOT slang. It does not appear in the dictionary because it is two words. It is no more slang than the terms "oral fixation", "large camel", or "red apple". It isn't used in a specialized way by certain groups of people. It is intelligible to anyone who understands what the words Asian and fetish mean. Your example of a two worded slang, "wiked good" is slang because it is gramatically incorrect, and "wicked" in this case means "very" or "extremely" rather than what it would mean alone, "evil". Compared to Asian fetish, "Asian" means in this case... "Asian", and fetish means "fetish"! How is it slang?!<a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethereds_5a92.html" title="User:Bethereds">Bethereds</a> 20:41, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethereds_5a92.html" title="User:Bethereds">Bethereds</a> you say <i>It isn't used in a specialized way by certain groups of people.</i> which ignores that is being used (in its non-porn/alcohol context) currently only by a small group of Asian Americans possibly to enhance their group cohesion. If you look at the ethnicity of nearly all of the primary sources in the references for this term, you will see that this is the case. You yourself have made edits to this effect.</dd>
<dd>You also say <i>It is intelligible to anyone who understands what the words Asian and fetish mean</i> This is also not the case. Would an average person know that it referred to "attraction to stereotypes of Asians, esp. asian women"? Would they know it was even referring to the colloquial use of "fetish" qua <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_fetish.html" title="Sexual fetish">sexual fetish</a> as opposed to a <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetish.html" title="Fetish">fetish</a> (man-made object with magical powers)? Marxists and postcolonialists would have still a different take on the word fetish--see Wzhao's article <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_fetish.html" title="Racial fetish">racial fetish</a> or scroll up to his discussion of this. For some people "asian fetish pornography" (three words, which I'm sure you would maintain are all well defined) means Japanese women tied up with ropes and flogged, and is therefore used in marketing these materials. This so-called fetish is not a precise thing you can point to like a camel or an apple (oral fixation is not slang mainly because it is Freudian jargon). Also, some people argue that Asian in this context only means East and Southeast Asian, and fetish means strong attraction. This is in part why there is no consensus about the meaning of these two words compounded together. If you look at the official/unofficial internet source for slang, urbandictionary.com you will find several definitions of asian fetish, some with more thumbs up than others. If you look in a really big dictionary under "fetish" the word asian doesn't appear, nor does it appear in jargon dictionaries or medical/psychological works under "fetish."</dd>
<dd>Regardless of whether you are right or wrong about this, I think we can agree that it is informal, non-standard and not jargon. I think we can also agree that it originates from a particular ethnic subculture. Hence, I'm not sure why you are claiming it's not slang. In your future posts, perhaps you could elaborate under which criteria you believe it is not slang. I enjoy debating words, and thank you for continuing to dispute these points.

<dd>Taken from <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a>. Yes, I know wikipedia isn't a good source for proving or disproving anything, but this paragraph pretty much sums up what slang is.
<dl>
<dd><i>Slang necessarily involves deviation from standard language, and tends to be very popular among adolescents. To one degree or another, however, it is used in all sectors of society. Although slang does not necessarily involve neologisms (some slang expressions, such as quid, are very old), <b>it often involves the creation of new linguistic forms or the creative adaptation of old ones.</b> It can even involve the <b>creation of a secret language understood only by those within a particular group</b> (an antilanguage). As such, slang frequently forms a kind of sociolect aimed at <b>excluding certain people from the conversation.</b> Slang words tend to function initially as a <b>means of encryption</b>, so that the <b>non-initiate cannot understand the conversation</b>. The use of slang is a means of <b>recognizing members of the same group, and to differentiate that group from society at large.</b> In addition to this, slang can be used and created purely for humorous or expressive effect.</i></dd>

<dd>It seems like you're not even reading what I did there. The criteria that I find to be most important to deem something as slang are highlighted. You claim that the multiple definitions of the two words which make up the phrase "Asian" and "fetish" are ambiguous to the point that it would not be universally intelligible, this is wrong because it can be gathered from context. You also claim that it is a term used and understood exclusively by a small group of Asian-American men, whereas this is not the case. Asian women, White Men, multiracial men, and probably people who aren't Asian men have used the term while editing this page. My own mother knows exactly what it means and the first time she'd ever heard of it was today. I don't understand what is so non-standard about it. It's two seperate words, both of which are standard, even when coupled together. I am also convinced at this point that you really only enjoy arguing, or getting people to argue with you by adding ridiculous things to the article like "kawaii" for example. You arguments are still weak and I have addressed them all. Thank you.<a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethereds_5a92.html" title="User:Bethereds">Bethereds</a> 04:43, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This link is not really applicable anywhere on the article, but for the benefit of many of the editors, here is a blogring of mostly Asian women who oppose Asian fetish. It shows that plenty of Asian women oppose Asian fetish, contrary to what the deleted section was trying to claim.</p>

<dd>good point. I think the consensus is that some hate it, some think it's annoying but don't hate it, some think it's benign but don't like it, and some enjoy the attention, or exploiting males who have it. Of course, we don't have hard numbers on this. I think there is also the group dynamic of it, where even if the female/male in question doesn't mind, it may be unacceptable among her/hisfriends and family. Logoi 22:05, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At the moment, many of the participating editors feel that the term is an attack on interracial relationships, and this has unnecessarily polarised the editors into two groups. The existence of Asian fetish is pretty much unrefutable, as seen from the sexual stereotyping of Asian women, Otaku culture, the disproportional amount of Asian porn available in the US where only 4% of the population is Asian, etc etc. Whether or not this trend is healthy is obviously debatable. But if someone is offended at the use of the term or disagrees with its negative implications, then he or she should contribute to sections about how it is perfectly healthy to have a sexual preference for Asian people. That would be a real and logical opposing point of view. Interracial relationships are not under attack here, or at least, that's certainly not MY purpose for editing the article. Like I said, I'm in an interracial relationship myself. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 22:34, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The existance of a large amount of Asian porn does not equate to the existance of an Asian fetish. If we separate the Asian porn made in America from the porn made in Japan by Japanese the number of Asian porn shrinks. Furthermore, if we remove the porn from Americans going to Southeast Asia the number also shrinks. The porn actually made in America featuring Asian women is actually not disproportionately numerous. If we assume that Asian and non-Asian men feel compelled to have an equal amount of social identities featured in porn, they would have to have their Asian porn archive equal all other categories, establishing that they were not racist. This places financial incentive on the numerically small <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_American_1915.html" title="Asian American">Asian American</a> population to enter the porn industry. If Asian American pornography is numerous like <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">User:HongQiGong</a> claims, it does not imply the existance of the Asian fetish and could imply that many Americans have taken the ideal of equality to heart.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 23:05, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you mostly. I'm not sure if it's used directly to discourage interracial relationships, but it is certainly used to create a climate that is hostile to them. For example, the Harvard Crimson article in the references reports that it is a spectre that lurks over an interracial relationship. The burden of proof somehow shifts to the people in the relationship to justify that it was not a relationship born of an Asian fetish. It is part of the fabric of malicious gossip that lurks like a cloud around people in relationships, as in "I can't believe she's dating him, he dated another asian girI, I bet he's got an asian fetish...eww." It causes well-meaning people in interracial relationships to question their own motivations and general sanity (see the salon.com advice column in the references). And, to the people in a relationship, there is always the dim threat of racially motivated attacks, or being yelled at or given dirty looks, or getting crappy service at a restaurant etc., and movies like "yellow fever" that ask "why are all the white guys taking our girls" don't help allay this feeling. The general feeling of society on both sides of the racial divide is to be uneasy about these relationships, and this is just another word that is used to impugn the characters of people in these relationships, a racial slur if you will. In this sense, it is an attack--a personal attack on the validity of their feelings, and therefore an attack on their feelings for each other. It is like saying to a couple, "your relationship is a joke, that guy/girl only likes you for your racial characteristics. He/she is an asian fetishist." To say that it is indisputable is only to say that there are people (both men and women) who will exclusively have attractions to members of Asian ethnic groups (no one can disagree that such people exist); I don't know of a single instance where someone was actually attracted to a stereotype although I think most non-Asians have illusions about asian people and may cite these illusions as reasons for intially liking them, when the real reason is probably something shallow like "she/he was hot."</dd>
<dd>I don't think the same thing is true for most mail-order brides however. I don't think people who buy mail-order brides would even mind it if you said they had an asian fetish, although they may try to justify that it has since turned into real love.</dd>
<dd>There are of course other contexts when it doesn't mean this at all, like in the context of sexual harassment, in which case it's an attack on the motivations for sexual harassment, which I think we can agree is a good thing. The Princeton case is cited a lot, but it's not clear to me that he wasn't just crazy, and based on his behavior, can we be sure he actually liked asian women? My theory is that he didn't like them at all. Likewise with that weird guy in the Northwest who learned about bondage in Japan and started that S&amp;M community--do these guys really like women? Not clear to me. In dealing with these murky matters of the mind and heart, especially other people's subjective mental states, there is no way to ever be sure.</dd>
<dd>I'm not aware that there is a disproportionate amount of Asian porn. From what I understand, Japanese porn is imported not necessarily for its asian-ness but for certain kinks.Logoi 23:45, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In response to <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">User:Dark Tichondrias</a>. It is not the mere existance of Asian porn in the United States that shows there is an Asian fetish. Rather, it is the way it is marketed. For example saying things like, "Exotic Asian jewels from the Far East..." and things of that nature. 71.124.114.26 06:09, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Stereotypes in Asian porn are like catch phrases in marketing, but they do not mean that the pornsite creators had an Asian fetish. Marketing campaigns frequently incorporate catchy phrases which they think will boost sales of their products. Taco bell has recently had the catch phrase "I'm full!" while Burger King has used "Have it your way." Their hope is that these positive descriptions of their product will increase demand. Similarly, pornsites market their product. Catch phrases such as "Exotic Asian jewels from the Far East" are written by the pornsite creators to deliberately boost membership, stimulating demand for their product. This neither means that the pornsite creators had an Asian fetish when they wrote the phrase nor does it mean the members will get an Asian fetish from hearing it.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 17:11, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dark T., that only proves that the Asian fetish is more prevalent. Everyone keeps saying that ads with Asian fetish element don't cause Asian fetish, which may or may not be true, but the fact of the matter is that they play on an existing condition within the minds of buyers of porn, not the makers or distributors of it. People with an Asian fetish then would most likely want to buy porn with Asian actors in it. The way that so much Asian porn proves that there is an Asian fetish is because it is so marketable due to this widespread existing condition or attitude of the people who buy or watch it. Fetish based ads with stereotypical depictions in them would not exist if porn buyers didn't have an Asian fetish to begin with.<a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethereds_5a92.html" title="User:Bethereds">Bethereds</a> 19:12, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, that isn't what I said at all. I didn't say that the porn would satiate the Asian fetish, I was simply saying that it is there because there is a demand for it. This demand for Asian porn is what I used to prove that an Asian fetish exists. Previous editors criticize Hwang's argument by saying that ads and porn don't cause Asian fetishes. That isn't what Hwang was saying, he was saying there is a demand. This demand, in and of itself, proves that there is an Asian fetish. Or at least a strong demand amongst non-Asian men to see porn featuring Asian women... which is a... fetish.. for Asian women.<a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethereds_5a92.html" title="User:Bethereds">Bethereds</a> 00:23, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sound reasoning <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a>; very nicely laid out. Intuitively, if Hwang's argument is as <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethereds_5a92.html" title="User:Bethereds">Bethereds</a> says, then it is bankrupt since the presence of marketing slogans doesn't mean people consume the stuff for that reason ( or they may consume it in spite of that reason), and it would be wrong to assume that someone who watches an asian movie (not necessarily just a pornographic one) enjoys it only because they are attracted to stereotypical asian behavior or even to asians (as opposed to just beautiful or charismatic stars). Just out of curiousity, do asian americans consume asian pornography? And, if so, do they find that the actresses/actors are able to act sufficiently well that they can portray stereotypes of asians? And if so, do they, the observers seek out these stereotypes? Logoi 04:53, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Use of Yale Daily News article.</span></h2>
<p>For those who want to use the article as a reference. Will you please actually read the article first? It keeps getting used incorrectly to say that Asian women think Asian fetish is benign. Firstly the title says that it is "less than benign". Secondly, if you actually read the article, you'll realise that it was written by two women talking about how sex crimes against Asian women are caused by Asian fetish. What the article claims is the <b>exact opposite</b> of the comments that's trying to use it as a source.</p>

<dd><a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> good point. It's not the best article for it, but it does seem to be a call to arms to women who do see it as essentially benign i.e. the authors note that other women may see it as benign, and the authors want them to stop doing this. Probably another article should be cited for the proposition as well. As for the authority of the <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_Daily_News_0a3c.html" title="Yale Daily News">Yale Daily News</a>, it is claimed to be the oldest college daily newspaper, and has an impressive list of alumni. It should be considered a reliable source with respect to articles written by reporters who work for the Yale daily news. However, this piece is written by members of an asian american women's organization, ostensibly reporting on their recent meeting, but actually editorializing the issue under the guise of reporting what was said at the meeting. While no one would dispute that these things were said at the meeting, the reliability of the things said have about the same reliability as a website for this organization.

<dd>That is precisely why opposing POVs are offered throughout the entire article. There is no such thing as an entirely unbias source of information.</dd>
<dd>Plus, it is a bit contradictory of you to first say that Yale Daily News is a credible source, but then single out one particular article as questionable. If one article at that newspaper may be questionable, then arguably a number of their articles could also be questionable, thereby making the newspaper not at all credible. I'm certain this is hardly the one and only article at the newspaper that was written by members of organizations with specific social and/or political agendas.

<li>The blog entry does not even talk about Asian fetish. It does, however, partly talk about the interracial dating disparity.</li>
<li>It is an article about why Asian American people lean to the left politically.</li>
<li>It does not say that Asian American Studies are dishonest, nor does it say that East Asian men misattribute the dating disparity issue to racism.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">It's not only Asian men who criticise Asian fetish</span></h2>
<p>There seems to be a prevailing attitude amongst opponents of the usage of the term Asian fetish that it's only Asian men who are complaining about Asian fetish, and only as a way to discourage interracial dating amongst Asian women. I can't stress enough how incorrect this is. And why shouldn't they be? They are being racially and sexually objectified. From my personal life I have known plenty of Asian women who are against it. But you shouldn't have to take my word for it. If I spent time on it, I could probably find even more sources. But of those that are already available in this article, we see that there are Asian women who are not only against it, but are vocal about it.</p>

<li><i>Get off it! It is really not attractive when you tell an Asian girl that you have a "thing" for them. We want to know that you think we're hot as individuals and not cuz you have a "THING" for us. We don't want to be a dating trend. We're not exotic little sex kittens so stop! It is so sickening..</i></li>
</ul>
<p>And again, I also stress that this is not an attack on interracial relationships. But in your editing of the article, please be aware and in consideration that it's not only Asian men who are against Asian fetish. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 21:31, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These men actually do have a "thing" for them strictly as individuals even if their general preference is Asian women, but this "thing" is not a fetish. A general preference for Asian females would discriminate between attractive Asian females and unattractive Asian females. Some people prefer Asian women in general, but would only have a "thing" for the attractive ones. This is not a fetish, but the sum of mutliple points of evaluation, possibly comprising facial structure, skin tone, make-up, etc. A general preference for a group of people would play into this list of factors, but is not the exclusive factor. In this context, "thing" is synonymous with individual enamoration. If she wants to know that "you think we are hot as individuals", she should ask her partner not to speak in ambiguous terms.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 23:35, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article never claims it is scientific fact in the first place.

<p>I agree with <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">User:HongQiGong</a> on this point. If it is not proven, then it is not a theory.

<p>Whatever. Just please discuss it before you rename it again. Otherwise, I will just rename it back. You can't just rename an article that is so heavily debated without concensus.

<p>Also, another very important point - the term that is used is called "Asian fetish", not "Asian fetish hypothesis" or "Asian fetish theory". That is why the article should be called "Asian fetish". There is no rule or precedence to say that anything that is not scientific fact should be called X Theory or X Hypothesis in the naming of the articles. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 17:13, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The hypothesis is that the attraction is to stereotypes, i.e. not to a person, but to their race or perceptions about their culture, and that somehow this is a mental pathology of the person who feels this attraction. This is the thing that is strictly psychological and that hasn't been proven to exist, and this is where all the controversy is. Logoi 00:04, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If we are to start renaming articles to X Theory or X Hypothesis, then we'd have a whole lot of articles to rename in wiki. There is no policy for it, and there is no precedence to it.

<dd><a href="../../../m/a/r/Martian.html" title="Martian">Martian</a> is indeed an analogous article. The first sentence of the article reads: "The word Martian is a <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypothetical.html" title="Hypothetical">hypothetical</a> native inhabitant of the planet Mars." The term is used more widely than what we can be called the "asian fetish hypothesis"--the hypothesis that people are attracted to asians due to racial stereotypes, as opposed to say, their beauty. As long as we label the hypothesis as a hypothesis, there's no problem.Logoi 04:30, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reverted to previous introduction</span></h2>
<p>I've reverted the introductory first paragraphs to an older version. The version that was there was simply terrible. You can't start an article by talking about how it doesn't exist when you haven't even defined it yet. You need to start an article with a definition of the subject matter. And the disagreements on the subject are thoroughly covered in the body of the article. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 05:57, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You have reverted the page back without any arguments for your actions. I've reverted to Asian fetish hypothesis because your reason that the version is "terrible" is not an argument, but a personal feeling. Your other reason that "you can'start an article about how it doesn't exist" is not an argument, but a mere point of view statement. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 19:46, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually that is precisely my argument. What was your argument for adding it in the first place? And why isn't it also "not an argument, but a mere point of view"? <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 20:03, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If anyone was actually here to read this article back when it came online last year, you'd have read an article about racist stereotyping and the ways in which it shaped perceptions of those of Asian ethnicity. As it stands, this article has completely deviated from its original intent, largely due to the workings of determined <small>(<a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Personal attack removed</a>)</small> who are trying to steer the topic away from racism and towards bullshit speculations about inner psychology. Asian fetish, the exotification of the "Orient," is a socio-cultural condition like racism and white privilege, not psychoanalytic speculation. Only on wikipedia where the <small>(<a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Personal attack removed</a>)</small> rule can someone accuse a concept so well rooted in conventional paradigms of historigraphic critique--ie Edward Said's Orientalism--or being non-existent because of the lack of study on the part of cilinical psychologists. I say revert this article to the way it was several months ago, when it actually addressed issues of race and racism, rather than this fragmented, incoherent nonsense that contradicts itself at every turn. And then make moves to ban these disruptive <small>(<a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Personal attack removed</a>)</small>. And then marginalize them to the point of irrelevance.

<dd>It's really not our place to ignore how the term "asian fetish" is being used if we are going to be encyclopedic about it. Your opinion is that the behavior that is given the label "Asian fetish" is just racism, which in your opinion is just a socio-cultural condition. Other people use it differently and make different arguments. There is no consensus. Ultimately though, you are correct: the whole asian fetish hypothesis is "fragmented incoherent nonsense that contradicts itself at every turn." This is just how it is.

<p>I reverted the intro because the intro was simply a bad one. I read half of it and then was still wondering when it was going to define "Asian fetish". It was ambiguous and unclear. I am absolutely open to having content that discuss how it is not a scientifically defined term, but putting that much amount of content about it right in the beginning of the intro without first even defining what it refers to is just simply bad form. Read the more popular articles on wiki on subjects that are not scientific fact. How many of them start out by discussing the disagreements on them without first defining it? No offense, but it was simply ridiculous. Look at <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexism.html" title="Sexism">Sexism</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a>, <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a>.

<dd>Certain articles are not labeled as hypothesis because they are accepted as fact. People do not doubt that racism or sexism exist. The Big Bang and Evolution have scientific backing. On the other hand, the Asian fetish has no scientific backing, so it should be labeled as a hypothesis to distinguish it from established truths.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 19:32, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we need to be careful about what is established and what isn't. It's well established that certain people have a very particular attraction to asians or sometimes to specific subgroups. The first sentence of the article is neutral as to why they are attracted, so I think just this much is not in controversy. Once we start getting into why they are attracted, then it's totally not well-established, and completely unstudied. Any attempt to explain why they are attracted is just a hypothesis. Like the hypothesis that for some people it's due to racial stereotypes (are Asians so unattractive that the only way to explain attraction to them is by being deluded with positive stereotypes?) . And, I agrree this hypothesis does not have the currency and weight of racism and sexism which have both been extensively studied. Logoi 04:45, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Listen. There are racist loser nerds out there with no lives who will go to great lengths to justify their masturbatory fantasies. Wiki has no police. There is no sense in conversing with dorky racist white boys and their fellow societal rejects; it only gives losers an opportunity to air their foolishness. They are biased and will not accept truth and logic but instead use this media and forum as nothing but an opportunity to cry about their place in society and shout down their psychological specters. Of course, they are unsympathetic to the minority cause because they themselves are mediocre and begrudge the seemingly charitable and unfair spirit of minority advancement - "I'm a loser according to mainstream society and so [they believe] are you, *sniff* we are losers it's what we are we don't deserve help" ROFL</p>

<dd>Both the supporters and opposers to the Asian fetish's existance have diverse reasons and backgrounds. The exact characterization of the poeple who oppose the Asian fetish's existance are not easily determinable, since they have been shown to come from a variety of socio-economic factors. Their reasons for not believing the Asian fetish exists are also diverse, preventing them from being attributed to one point of view.
