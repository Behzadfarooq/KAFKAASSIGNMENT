<p>Not a fansite. Quotes like "scotching [sic] guitar hooks" are not neutral. Quotes like "Early on the Asia debut produced outstanding reviews" need to include links to the reviews in question (I can't find any. I looked) and quotes like "is known as one of the tightest albums in rock history" need A LOT of backup, which I don't see. If want to make a claim, especially a superlative one ("Greatest", "Worst", etc.), but can't find a web site to back it up, don't make the claim. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 21:58, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>People turn to these sites for facts, you can find bashing on any album if you look for it, but that is not the overall view of the legendary Asia debut. The Asia debut has topped out it's critics. We are not bashing JP or his era. Brag all you want about how great he is, fine, we are not going to bring him down. If you can't say anything nice please don't say it at all. People don't agree the SGT. Peppers is the greatest LP of all time, but it is not the general perspective of the mainstream world. So peoples opinions that differ from the general view of a classic LP should not be included in what is supposed to be an encyclopedia. People turn to these sites for facts, and it shouldn't be a battle between the Payne and Wetton fans, or one era trying to bring down another. Peace out &#160;:)</p>

<p>I'm not an Asia fan or non-fan at all. I think I have a cassette of the first album in a drawer somewhere. I haven't listened to it in over 10 years. To me, it was a mildly entertaining artifact that got old like almost all music does. I'm simply standing up for a neutral point of view, which means including links to ALL opinions, positive or negative, without favoring one or the other. It is a neutral, verifiable fact that some people think "Asia" is a classic album. It is also a neutral, verifiable fact that some people don't care for it at all. Most opinion falls in the middle.</p>
<p>Does the fact that classic rock stations still play old Asia songs mean it's a classic? They still play "Hey Mickey" from time to time. It's their job. If Progfreaks is an acceptable inclusion, so is Starling. My real name -&gt; -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 18:22, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I doubt Hey Mickey is on over the air classic rock radio stations around the world that play the Guess Who and Boston, but more likely on oldies &amp; 80's stations. There are many indicators that prove the Asia debut is accepted as a classic and legendary album, such as the Boston/Asia winning combinations CD, their genre is compared to Boston Kansas and ELO, (Classic Legendary bands), also, if a classic rock radio station plays deep cuts (non hit's) from an album over 20 years later, is proof that it has been accepted as a classic album. Sole Survivor and Wildest Dreams still get heavy radio play along with HOTM &amp; OTWT on CLASSIC and Quality rock stations throughout the world, NY, to LA, etc. Why do you not hear any deep tracks (non hits) from the Quiet Riot debut or a Ratt LP, or the 1987 Starship LP? This is the difference. Songs like, Led Zeps, Battle of evermore, The Who's, Join Together, Beatles, Tomorrow Never knows, and Asia's Sole Survivor are all non hits that are played this very day because they are considered classic. The album is also legendary in the sense that it is the Biggest debut album of all time for a progressive rock band, It is even bigger than the Beatles, The Who's or Led Zeps debut. Spending 9 weeks at the #1 position selling over 10 million units worldwide. They are also known as phase 2 of progressive rock, leading the way for 90210, Big generator, and others, it was the spark of the dawn of a new generation, and that in itself is a major legendary and nostalgic accomplishment. Do you really believe the experts and prog freaks would include the Asia debut as a masterpiece along with Floyd's dark Side if it was not? When you see stations playing it's tunes and prog experts saying this 23 years later, is a clear indication that the Asia debut topped out it critics and is the more popular view of the mainstream world. It is the general view that should be presented as fact, like SGT Peppers, and Dark Side, not the reviews from critics that can be found about any band or album. Recently Nissan in Japan chose a track from the ASIA debut for a commercial. Program directors &amp; critics have off the bat in 82 said there no doubt this will be one of greatest, along with Skinnerds first and the White album. From it's conception in 82 until today the reviews of it being classic and legendary are there. We are well aware of the bias reviews from disgrutled ELP and YES fans and the critics who were fans of those bands, or fans of progressive rocks first era. But the Asia album won out. Some bashing consisted of labeling the Asia debut as fake, because they didn't believe they or any band can play that polished or tight, but they did, I have the quotes. Bias and false reviews from these types of critics should not be listed in a page that is to be of fact and the general mainstream view of what is, classic rock. Remember, whenever an album sits on top of the world and the US for 9 weeks, and or, breaks up 3 bands,sells 10 million units you can rest assured some people are not going to be happy about it. This should not be included in a page that people turn to for facts.</p>
<hr />
<p>I'll grant your point about classic rock stations.</p>
<p>Here's a quote from the review you keep pulling:</p>
<p>Asia is a pretty nice album! Out of its nine songs, not a single one is unmemorable. Not a single one is un-elaborated. Also, not a single one is a ballad: even the sappiest, most sentimental stuff is normally served under a tough rockin' sauce, with occasionally unexpected musical transitions and great drumwork from Palmer.</p>
<p>The overall point is that it has good points and bad points. The final evaluation is "Just Very Good" (click on the "Overall Rating" link). Have you even read it?</p>
<p>For the record, I believe that what we are currently experiencing is a rare instance of "Positive Creative Tension". The article as it stands is actually quite exceptional. I don't think it would be nearly as good without our current squabble. Let's not cross the line into open flames (it hasn't happened, I just wanted to make the point.) Also, you keep pulling the categorizations when you pull the link. Don't do that. They're harmless. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 20:15, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>If that's from the article you keep posting that is the nicest thing said, that article was bashing at is best. No I wish not to make an enemy, but the way this article looked a week ago was bias to the extreme. Statements like, Wetton leaving is the best thing that ever happened to Asia, (like they had muti platinum albums when Wetton left) or luckily the Asia reunion didn't take place. Saying that the Astra LP was a commercial failure when it reached Billboards top 60 when a Payne era LP never broke the top 100. The bias and bashing of the Wetton era will not continue, as an entire community is pretty P..O .. If I'm removing something else I should not when I remove the link I apologize, but as long as I'm alive, that link will not be there. Peace out. &#160;:)</p>
<hr />
<p>The concert from Japan with Greg Lake on vocals is available on CD, I own it. The existing versions could use a remaster but that isn't the point of this post. You can find it on Amazon and I'm sure other sites carry it as well. WOlson17</p>
