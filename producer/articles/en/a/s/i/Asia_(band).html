<p>Asia began with the apparent demise of <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yes_%28band%29.html" title="Yes (band)">Yes</a> and <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emerson%2C_Lake_%26_Palmer_d58d.html" title="Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer">Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer</a>, the two flagship bands of British progressive rock. After the break-up of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Crimson_a676.html" title="King Crimson">King Crimson</a> in 1974, various plans for a supergroup involving bassist <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wetton_827d.html" title="John Wetton">John Wetton</a> had been mooted, including the abortive British Bulldog project with <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Bruford_586c.html" title="Bill Bruford">Bill Bruford</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Wakeman_286c.html" title="Rick Wakeman">Rick Wakeman</a> in 1976. In 1977, Bruford and Wetton were reunited in <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_%28band%29_31f0.html" title="UK (band)">UK</a>, along with guitarist <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Holdsworth_47b0.html" title="Allan Holdsworth">Allan Holdsworth</a> and keyboardist/violinist <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Jobson_f15b.html" title="Eddie Jobson">Eddie Jobson</a>. Their <a href="../../../e/p/o/Eponymous.html" title="Eponymous">eponymous</a> debut was released in 1978. By 1980, after UK's demise and Wetton's departure from <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_%28band%29_31f0.html" title="UK (band)">UK</a>, a new supergroup project was suggested involving Wetton, Wakeman, drummer <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Palmer_4986.html" title="Carl Palmer">Carl Palmer</a> and (then little known) guitarist <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trevor_Rabin_ec20.html" title="Trevor Rabin">Trevor Rabin</a>, but Wakeman walked out of the project shortly before they were due to sign to Geffen and before they had ever played together. In 1981, Wetton and guitarist <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Howe_%28guitarist%29_676e.html" title="Steve Howe (guitarist)">Steve Howe</a> were brought together by <a href="../../../a/%26/r/A%26R_c2d6.html" title="A&amp;R">A&amp;R</a> man <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kalodner_c3c1.html" title="John Kalodner">John Kalodner</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/f/Geffen_Records_6b65.html" title="Geffen Records">Geffen Records</a> to start working and writing, Howe having come out of the break-up of Yes in early 1981.</p>
<p>Howe and Wetton were soon joined by Buggles/Yes keyboardist <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoff_Downes_c839.html" title="Geoff Downes">Geoff Downes</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Palmer_4986.html" title="Carl Palmer">Carl Palmer</a> joined the band later in the process. <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trevor_Rabin_ec20.html" title="Trevor Rabin">Trevor Rabin</a> was considered for the group and some demos were recorded with him, but he dropped out to accept an offer to join <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Squire_2fa8.html" title="Chris Squire">Chris Squire</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_White_%28Yes_drummer%29_66ab.html" title="Alan White (Yes drummer)">Alan White</a> in what became a new Yes and the other Asia members decided to stay as a quartet. Trevor Rabin, in a filmed interview from 1984 and included in the recently released and updated <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> <a href="../../../9/0/1/9012Live_0b92.html" title="9012Live">9012Live</a>, said that his involvement with Asia never went anywhere because "there was no chemistry" among the participants.</p>
<p>The band's early offerings, under the auspices of the record empire of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Geffen_57d9.html" title="David Geffen">David Geffen</a> and Kalodner, were considered disappointing by music critics <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/165/biography" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/165/biography" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and fans of traditional progressive rock, who found the music closer to radio-friendly <a href="../../../a/l/b/Album_Oriented_Rock_d154.html" title="Album Oriented Rock">AOR</a> pop. However, Asia clicked with fans of arena acts such as <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journey_%28band%29.html" title="Journey (band)">Journey</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_%28band%29.html" title="Boston (band)">Boston</a>, and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Light_Orchestra_bf45.html" title="Electric Light Orchestra">Electric Light Orchestra</a>. Rolling Stone gave <i>Asia</i> an indifferent review <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/_/id/101939" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/_/id/101939" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, while still acknowledging the band's musicianship had been a cut above the usual AOR expectations.</p>

<p>Asia's eponymous debut album enjoyed considerable commercial success, spending nine weeks at number one in the U.S. album chart. The singles "Only Time Will Tell" and "Heat of the Moment" became huge <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_40.html" title="Top 40">Top 40</a> hits, with the latter cracking the Top Five, and remaining a stadium favourite at U.S. sporting events.</p>

<i>Asia</i>, 1982</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The tracks from the Asia debut have stood the test of time and are played on classic rock stations throughout the world today. The Asia debut has become legendary in the genre of classic rock. "Sole Survivor" also received heavy air play on rock stations across the US.</p>
<p>The US tour also did extremely well, selling out every date on the '82 and '83 tours, while the <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a> channel played their videos on heavy rotation. Billboard named the Asia debut as album of the year.</p>
<p>Asia became known as pioneers of <a href="http://www.cd-services.com/prog_symph.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cd-services.com/prog_symph.htm" rel="nofollow">phase two</a> of the progressive rock era by avoiding long winded forays that included, to at least a greater extent than phase-one, enough commercial polish to attract radio airplay outside of album-rock circles. Yes' <i><a href="../../../9/0/1/90125.html" title="90125">90125</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Generator_c013.html" title="Big Generator">Big Generator</a></i>, <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emerson%2C_Lake_%26_Powell_3db4.html" title="Emerson, Lake &amp; Powell">ELPowell</a>'s <i>Emerson, Lake &amp; Powell</i> in 1986, and the <a href="../../../g/t/r/GTR_%28band%29_57af.html" title="GTR (band)">GTR</a> album would all follow in the Asia debut album's footsteps.</p>
<p>However, neither the second nor any following Asia album repeated the chart success of the first. The power ballad "Don't Cry" entered the Top Ten in 1983, while "The Smile Has Left Your Eyes," a <a href="http://www.asiaworld.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=995&amp;" class="external text" title="http://www.asiaworld.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=995&amp;" rel="nofollow">fan favourite</a> for John Wetton vocal performance, charted inside of Billboard's top 40. But <i>Rolling Stone</i> panned <i><a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_%28album%29.html" title="Alpha (album)">Alpha</a></i> as an over-produced commercial album <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/165/albums/album/133986" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/165/albums/album/133986" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, while others lamented that Howe and Palmer were effectively reduced to session musicians. However, many Asia fans favour <i>Alpha</i> over the debut. The tracks "Eye To Eye" and "My Own Time" became huge fan favourites. "Open Your Eyes" and "The Heat Goes On" became concert staples. <i>Alpha</i> received indifferent reviews from various critics, while still attaining <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platinum.html" title="Platinum">platinum</a> status. <i>Alpha</i> reached #6 on the USA Billboard album chart.</p>
<p>In 1983, Wetton was forced out of the group on the heels of the comparatively disappointing sales of <i>Alpha</i>, while ELP frontman <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Lake_44c8.html" title="Greg Lake">Greg Lake</a> replaced him for the highly publicised "Asia in Asia" concert in Japan, which was the first concert broadcast over satellite to MTV in the US, and later made into a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_video.html" title="Home video">home video</a>. Asia reformed with Wetton in 1985 to start work on their next album, but Steve Howe soon left to be replaced by <a href="../../../k/r/o/Krokus_%28band%29.html" title="Krokus (band)">Krokus</a> guitarist Mandy Meyer. However, Howe would enjoy brief and very minor success with <a href="../../../g/t/r/GTR_%28band%29_57af.html" title="GTR (band)">GTR</a>, another supergroup formed with <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Hackett_3ecb.html" title="Steve Hackett">Steve Hackett</a> of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis_%28band%29.html" title="Genesis (band)">Genesis</a>, produced by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoff_Downes_c839.html" title="Geoff Downes">Downes</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_%28band%29.html" title="Edit section: Astra to the USSR">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Astra to the USSR</span></h3>
<p>The third Asia album, <i>Astra</i>, was not as commercially successful as the first two. Geffen cancelled the tour due to lack of interest. Howe's replacement, <a href="http://www.mandymeyer.ch" class="external text" title="http://www.mandymeyer.ch" rel="nofollow">Mandy Meyer</a> of <a href="../../../k/r/o/Krokus_%28band%29.html" title="Krokus (band)">Krokus</a>, provided more of a hard-rock guitar approach. The band enjoyed a modest hit single, "Go," with Meyer's guitar heroics center stage. In 1985, this Asia line-up ended, although Wetton resurfaced with a 1987 solo album, Wetton-Manzanera, based on Asia material. Asia were also credited with a contribution to the <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvester_Stallone_7277.html" title="Sylvester Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a> film soundtrack to <i>Over The Top</i>, although Wetton was the only original band member involved. Wetton formed a band line-up without Downes for a short tour in 1989; keys were played by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Young_8c2c.html" title="John Young">John Young</a>, guitars by german Holger Larisch. Unlike Wetton's later anger at Asia continuing without him in the 1990's, this project was viewed favourably by other Asia band members.</p>

<p>Asia returned to the studio in 1989 with Toto guitarist <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Lukather_7766.html" title="Steve Lukather">Steve Lukather</a> and other musicians (see discography below) and released "Then &amp; Now". <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Thrall_3b6c.html" title="Pat Thrall">Pat Thrall</a> joined Downes, Palmer, and Wetton, on tour who performed classic material and even <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Crimson_a676.html" title="King Crimson">King Crimson</a> and <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_%28band%29_31f0.html" title="UK (band)">UK</a> songs. The band toured the former Soviet Union in 1990 to play in front of 20,000 fans, two sold out nights, while <i>Then And Now</i> featured their previous hits and new singles. "Days Like These" charted briefly in 1991, generating a small amount of MTV airplay. Asia received the RIAA gold album award for <i>Then and Now</i>. A DVD and CD can be bought of the Asia concert in the USSR. John Wetton left in 1992 to focus on recording solo albums, none of which have yielded any hits.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_%28band%29.html" title="Edit section: The Payne era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Payne era</span></h3>
<p>Downes found a new lease of life with Asia by teaming up with vocalist/bassist <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Payne_5093.html" title="John Payne">John Payne</a>. Enlisting new musicians, he led Asia through to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
<p>The comeback album, <i>Aqua</i> (1992) also seemed to feature Steve Howe and Carl Palmer, as stated in the booklet. But Palmer did not record for Aqua. All the drum sounds were re-recorded from previous works. They merely did this to credit Palmer and made it seem as if three of the original members were still around. His picture in the album was not even a studio picture like the rest of the band (including Howe), it was taken and enlarged from an ELP promotional photo.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Steve Howe made minimal contributions to Aqua. Downes' environmentalist single "Who Will Stop The Rain?" attracted some radio attention, but the "Aqua" club tour featuring Howe (whose presence was heavily promoted) was well received by most of the band's supporters, with Howe taking the stage after the 5th Song. However, the tour was successful enough to warrant the band's continuation.</p>
<p>The group released <i><a href="../../../a/r/i/Aria_%28album%29.html" title="Aria (album)">Aria</a></i> in 1994 and <i><a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_%28Asia_album%29_4c7f.html" title="Arena (Asia album)">Arena</a></i> in 1996. Aria featured former <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danger_Danger_2e5e.html" title="Danger Danger">Danger Danger</a> and then future <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megadeth.html" title="Megadeth">Megadeth</a> lead guitarist <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Pitrelli_0d09.html" title="Al Pitrelli">Al Pitrelli</a>, who would leave Asia during the short Aria tour. This underscores the fact that the keyboard-driven band often faced trouble keeping a regular guitarist. Furthermore, <i>Arena</i> featured three different session guitarists, including Ian Crichton of Canadian prog rock band <a href="../../../s/a/g/Saga_%28band%29.html" title="Saga (band)">Saga</a>. In the late 1990s, Downes and Payne opened the Asia vaults, releasing the double-disc <i>Archiva</i>, a collection of unreleased tracks recorded during the first three Downes/Payne albums.</p>
<p>In 1999 there was talk of a reunion of the original lineup (minus Howe). This did not take place and John Payne continued to carry on Asia with Downes uninterrupted. Wetton and Palmer did, however, get together to form <a href="../../../q/a/n/Qango_%28band%29.html" title="Qango (band)">Qango</a>, although the band was short-lived.</p>

<p>Marking a departure from convention, for the first time a studio release was not titled as a single word starting and ending with the letter A. 2004's <i><a href="../../../s/i/l/Silent_Nation_%28album%29_9743.html" title="Silent Nation (album)">Silent Nation</a></i> (name influenced by the <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Stern_a7e1.html" title="Howard Stern">Howard Stern</a> vs. <a href="../../../f/c/c/FCC_a44b.html" title="FCC">FCC</a> incident) picked up some unexpected exposure on the Internet.

The album managed to chart better than 1992's <i><a href="../../../a/q/u/Aqua_%28album%29.html" title="Aqua (album)">Aqua</a></i>.</p>
<p>There was an <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel-string_guitar.html" title="Steel-string guitar">acoustic</a> tour featuring only Downes and Payne. In early 2005, the full band toured in Europe and the Americas, playing settings ranging from small clubs to medium-sized arenas. In August 2005, Slade left the group to be replaced by Schellen. The new band started work on an album, tentatively entitled <i>Architect of Time</i>, for release in 2006.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wetton and Downes had released some archival Asia material under the name <b>Wetton/Downes</b> and they then reunited to record an album, accompanying EP and a DVD. The album <i><a href="../../../i/c/o/Icon_%28album%29.html" title="Icon (album)">Icon</a></i> was released in 2005.</p>

On 1 February 2006, after the news had been trailed on John Wetton's website, Steve Howe's website announced that the original line-up were planning a CD, DVD and world tour to celebrate the band's twenty-fifth anniversary. While Downes' website confirmed this, Carl Palmer was initially more cautious. In a number of announcements in January and February, he denied any specific plans for touring or recording, while conceding that the four men have been discussing the possibility. <a href="http://www.asiaworld.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.asiaworld.org/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.carlpalmer.com/index01.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.carlpalmer.com/index01.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>In May 2006, Carl Palmer announced in an in-studio appearance on U.S. cable channel VH-1 Classic that the original lineup of Asia would tour the United States - the territory in which the group enjoyed its greatest success - in late summer of that year. Palmer stated the set list would include the entire <i>Asia</i> album, and that band members would likely "throw in" selections from their respective earlier projects (specifically giving "Roundabout" as an example), to give younger fans a sense of where they had come from prior to forming the supergroup. The drummer said that once the agreement had been reached, everyone was eager to move forward on the project in advance of the anniversary. Palmer added that, should the tour be a success, a live DVD release could mark that anniversary in 2007.</p>
<p>In July 2006, tour dates were announced with the 1st leg of the tour beginning on August 29 in Rochester, NY and ending in London on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">December 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. The setlist will feature most or all of the first album as well as a couple of songs from the second. In addition, as mentioned previously, one selection each will be played from <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yes_%28band%29.html" title="Yes (band)">Yes</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emerson%2C_Lake_%26_Palmer_d58d.html" title="Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer">ELP</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Crimson_a676.html" title="King Crimson">King Crimson</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Buggles_0ef5.html" title="The Buggles">the Buggles</a> to acknowledge the history of each member of the band. There will be dates in 2007, as well, with venue size based on the success of the 2006 shows where the band is mainly playing in clubs and theaters. According the <a href="http://www.theasiawebsite.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.theasiawebsite.com/" rel="nofollow">the Asia website</a>, they have sold out various venues.</p>

<p>Many musicians participated through the years, especially during the 1990s, when the band consisted essentially of Geoff Downes and John Payne plus an ever-changing set of guests. The current reunited original lineup is highlighted in bold.</p>

<ul>
<li>Although Asia has not recaptured the success from the early Eighties in its later years, the band's legacy endures, and occasionally Asia references are found in the media. Some of these references are not altogether flattering. The <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000_b5cb.html" title="Mystery Science Theater 3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a> episode "Overdrawn at the Memory Bank" features Professor Bobo (played by Kevin W. Murphy) singing part of verse two from "Heat of the Moment". In an episode of the animated TV series <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a></i>, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Cartman_34c6.html" title="Eric Cartman">Eric Cartman</a> and the United States Congress sing "<a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_Of_The_Moment_bdab.html" title="Heat Of The Moment">Heat Of The Moment</a>" <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_cappella.html" title="A cappella">a cappella</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Asia's hits and some deep tracks from the debut can be heard today on various classic rock stations around the world and on Satellite radio like XM's channels 46 and 8. In 2005, DJ Manian's dance remix of "Heat Of The Moment" was released to nightclubs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Asia is mentioned also in the dialogue of the comedy film <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_40-Year-Old_Virgin_b1fe.html" title="The 40-Year-Old Virgin">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a></i>. Carrell's character is also seen to have an Asia poster decorating the walls of his apartment (one character asked Carrell's character "You framed an Asia poster? How hard did the guys at the frame store laugh at you when you did this?"). The joke is affectionate in nature and the movie also featured "Heat Of The Moment" in its soundtrack.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Heat of the Moment" is also featured in the film <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matador_9f77.html" title="The Matador">The Matador</a></i> in the scene in which Pierce Brosnan's character must commit an assassination at a horse race. Since horse races are run in "heats," this usage could be considered a musical <a href="../../../p/u/n/Pun.html" title="Pun">pun</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In reference to Korean scientists successfully cloning an Afghan hound, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy_Central_c9d4.html" title="Comedy Central">Comedy Central</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Colbert_Report_3547.html" title="The Colbert Report">the Colbert Report</a></i> held a special <i>Bring 'em Back or Leave 'em Dead: Asian Edition</i> offering the studio audience the chance to decide which deceased Asians should be brought back to life. After clamoring to bring back military strategist <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Tzu_68bf.html" title="Sun Tzu">Sun Tzu</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>'s first emperor <a href="../../../q/i/n/Qin_Shi_Huang_ece5.html" title="Qin Shi Huang">Qin Shi Huang</a>, the studio audience decided to leave the 80's supergroup Asia dead.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/x/THX_84ba.html" title="THX">THX</a> certified videos play a distinctive audio logo called <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Note_bdc4.html" title="Deep Note">Deep Note</a>. Apart from the key in which it is played (differing by as much as a whole step), it is identical to the synthesized crescendo played during the intro to <i>Countdown to Zero</i> on the 1985 album <i>Astra</i>.</li>
