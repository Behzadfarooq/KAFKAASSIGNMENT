<b>LETS HELP SPREAD AWARENESS ABOUT THIS ALMOST EXTINCT SUBSPECIES: THE "ASIATIC CHEETAH"</b></p>
<p>There are only 50 to 60 of Asiatic Cheetahs left in the world all in Iran and they are fast walking towards their extinction, but there is hardly any awareness about the existance of this subspecie amongst the general public who can make a difference and protect them. Mostly everybody thinks that the Cheetah is an African Animal. I want to spread awareness about this almost extinct subspecie of "Asiatic Cheetah" and hope some body will notice it here on this "Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" website and get interested in working for its consrvation or write about it in media. We need to create as much awareness as possible for our littleknown wildlife wonders which are being forced into their extinction.</p>

<li>Almost Extinct only 50 or 60 are alive today in IRAN, and India desperately wants to clone some Asiatic Cheetahs for reintroduction in INDIA from where they went extinct about half a cenctuary ago. But controversy still dogs the Indian effort to clone the Asiatic Cheetah with Irans help. And as some sort of partnership may develop between Iran and India in the future to co-operate in reintroducing both Asiatic Lions &amp; Cheetahs to eachothers countries it makes sense to make ourselves aware about the Asiatic Cheetah.

<li><b>Asiatic Cheetah in India Book: "The end of a trail, Cheetah in India", by Divyabhanusinh</b></li>
</ul>
<p>About this title: This is a pictorial history of the cheetah in India from the pre-historic period to the present. It provides a comprehensive account of the animal's interaction with man through the ages, reconstructing the life of the cheetah in captivity and its use by Indian royalty as an aid to hunting. Divyabhanusinh examines anew the process of the Indian cheetah's decline in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, charting its path to extinction and analysing the causes of its disappearance. In this impression, the 'Epilogue 2001' provides a complete update on the information in the book, including detailed new findings on the evolution of cheetahs from Africa and Asia. It also gives fresh evidence about the sadly declining numbers of cheetah in Iran, and the existence, albeit not very optimistic, of the animal in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The epilogue also documents cases of the killing of the cheetah for rewards, a practice performed in British India, leading to its extermination. Finally, the author proposes a reintroduction of the cheetah in a select part of India. But if the cheetah is to survive at all on the Indian subcontinent, it will require the unconditional support of the governments of India, Iran, and Pakistan. The author mines a wide range of sources -- from prehistoric cave paintings, Sanskrit, Classical Greek and Roman literature to Mughal miniature paintings, rare photographs, shikar literature of the British Raj, and interviews. Containing several illustrated book is an indispensable reference work and has led to a renewed interest in the cheetah's reintroduction in India.

<p>1 - The Asiatic cheetah is a critically endangered subspecies once found throughout Southwest Asia and into India, and now restricted to a few locations in Iran and perhaps Pakistan and Afghanistan. In Iran, biologists have estimated that perhaps as few as 50 cheetah remain. The Cat Specialist Group is developing a research and conservation program in cooperation with Iran's Department of Environment. The Iranian Cheetah Society's website features current news about the efforts to save this rarest of the big cats. 2 - "The environmental limitations and future of the Asiatic cheetah in Iran": <a href="http://www.felidae.org/PROJECTS/Asiatic_Cheetah/asadi1997/asadi1997.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.felidae.org/PROJECTS/Asiatic_Cheetah/asadi1997/asadi1997.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.felidae.org/PROJECTS/Asiatic_Cheetah/asadi1997/asadi1997.htm</a> <a href="http://www.felidae.org/PROJECTS/Asiatic_Cheetah/asiatic_cheetah.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.felidae.org/PROJECTS/Asiatic_Cheetah/asiatic_cheetah.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.felidae.org/PROJECTS/Asiatic_Cheetah/asiatic_cheetah.htm</a></p>

<p>This is Marita. She was saved as a cub after her mother was killed by livestock herders. We are sorry to say that the beloved Marita has passed on at 11pm on December 23, 2003, of respiratory failure. She had two veterinarians and Hormoz Asadi with her. On a good note, she lived a full 9-1/2 years, which is a reasonably full lifespan in captivity. There is no longer a captive Asiatic cheetah, however, wild cheetahs have been spotted in Iran and are currently being studied.

<b>"Diet of ASIATIC CHEETAH":</b></p>
<p>Info on Diet of Asiatic Cheetah and I have mentioned the quoted references:</p>
<p>(1 see below) Diet: In Iran Asiatic Cheetah's diet consists mainly of Jebeer gazelle, Goitered Gazelle, wild sheep, wild goat, and cape hare.</p>
<p>(2 see below) The Asiatic cheetah’s range is restricted to the Central Iranian Plateau, with an estimated population of 60 adult cheetahs remaining. The main threat to the Asiatic cheetah is loss of their primary prey species, gebeer gazelle (Gazella dorcas), goitered gazelle (Gazella subgothrosa), urial sheep (Ovis orientalis) and wild goat (Capra aegagrus), due to poaching and grazing competition with domestic livestock. Habitat loss from mining development and poaching of Asiatic Cheetahs also threaten their populations in Iran. "Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS)" and the "Department of Enavironment , Iran (DoE)" hope to begin collaring Asiatic Cheetahs in the fall of 2006.</p>

<p>This Asiatic Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) Page has been originally created by ATUL SINGH NISCHAL - atulsinghnischal@yahoo.com, I am a Life-member of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS): <a href="http://www.bnhs.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.bnhs.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bnhs.org/</a> and a Life-subscriber of WWF-India: <a href="http://www.wwfindia.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.wwfindia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wwfindia.org/</a>.</p>
<p>I am an "Asiatic Cheetah" and "<a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiatic_Lion_3ad2.html" title="Asiatic Lion">Asiatic Lion</a>" fan originally from India, naturelovers &amp; wildlifers in my country and in Iran love both these species and we used to have plenty of them till a few hundred years back in both India and Iran. Today all the Asiatic Cheetah are extinct all over Asia and also extinct in India now, just the last 50 to 60 are said to be remain in Iran.</p>
<p>The same fate befell the "<a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiatic_Lion_3ad2.html" title="Asiatic Lion">Asiatic Lion</a>" all over Europe and Asia they were exterminated by man. Iran also lost them eventually in 1942. From the handful that survived in India in 1900 in a single forest, a population of about 300 odd has been conserved and built up. It is felt now that all the Asiatic Lion are cramped together in a single Indian forest of Gir which is hopelessly overpopulated and Lions have started to spill out to unprotected adjoining areas coming in regular conflict with man with many of them being killed/poisened regularly. Since all the Asiatic Lions of the world are cramped together in the Gir region of the Indian State of Gujarat and face complete extinction because of an epidemic or natural calamity that may strike, the Government of India has made arrangements to re-introduce some to Kuno-Palpur Sanctuary in the neghbouring State of Madhya Pradesh in India. Even though the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiatic_Lion_3ad2.html" title="Asiatic Lion">Asiatic Lion</a> is on the official seal of India and all Indians are proud of them, unfortunately the State Government of Gujarat and some people in Gujarat feel that <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiatic_Lion_3ad2.html" title="Asiatic Lion">Asiatic Lion</a> are state property and are opposing the re-introduction of some wild Lions to Kuno-Palpur Sanctuary in the neighboring State of Madhya Pradesh in India. For the time being it looks like that Gujarat wants to keep its monopoly on tourism revenue generated by the Asiatic Lions.</p>
<p>Naturelovers sincerely hope that both "Asiatic Cheetah" and "<a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiatic_Lion_3ad2.html" title="Asiatic Lion">Asiatic Lion</a>" can be pulled from the brink of extinction and eventually be re-introduced back to their original remaining habitats all over Asia. Maybe it may take a few centauries but presently Iran and India can co-operate on bringing the "Asiatic Cheetah" and "<a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiatic_Lion_3ad2.html" title="Asiatic Lion">Asiatic Lion</a>" back to their countries. Iran should help India in re-introducing the "Asiatic Cheetah", even though it may have to be through "Cloning" if needed, and India should help Iran to re-introduce the "<a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiatic_Lion_3ad2.html" title="Asiatic Lion">Asiatic Lion</a>" to their country.</p>
<p>Long live the "Asiatic Cheetah" and "<a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiatic_Lion_3ad2.html" title="Asiatic Lion">Asiatic Lion</a>" who had shared, shoulder to shoulder, much of the same habitat ranging from North Africa to India...........</p>

<p>INDIA NATURE WATCH (INW) - A non-commercial website that focuses on sharing the joy that nature has on offer. We welcome all nature lovers to join us in sharing that joy. The INW website is intended to serve as an online resource for nature lovers of all skill levels from beginners to professionals. Our focus area is India. We hope the content generated here will help showcase the work of nature photographers in India to the world, as well as help initiate the uninitiated to the wonders of nature. Currently we have a "Image Gallery Section" where a member can showcase an image and a "Discussion Forum" where various topics can be discussed. While we continue to strive to improve features on INW, We take great pride in the professional, non-commercial environment we provide for all visitors.

<p>(ATUL’s NOTE: Please note that not so long ago wild Asiatic Lions ranged over most of the “Indian sub-continent”, where they came in contact with and their paths regularly crisscrossed with most of our wildlife including Tigers. Unfortunately the last surviving 300 or so wild Asiatic Lions left today in the whole world are only found in the Gir forest area of Indian state of Gujarat where the Tiger has been hunted to extinction for quite some time now. In fact the Tiger is entirely missing from Gujatat’s forests where they may someday again be reintroduced as suitable habitat is said to exist. Meantime there are plans to re-introduce 2-3 prides of wild Asiatic Lions to Kuno-Palpur Wildlife Sanctuary in the neighboring Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Asiatic Lions and the Asiatic Cheetah shared most of the same habitat in India and southwest Asia, but alas the Indian/Asiatic Cheetah is now extinct in India, the very last 50 or 60 fight their final extinction in nearby Iran. Iran had lost all its Asiatic Lions to senseless hunting by 1942 &amp; their Tigers had met the same fate too.)</p>

<p>How about all those lions and tigers who work in circuses? I thought all felines can be tamed if they get human contact early enough in their lives. <b><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font color="blue">Durova</font></a></b> 04:42, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are lions that have been raised by humans, the same goes for all big cats, but these are still dangerous and even more so when they grow up. The big cats will still possess behviour which is impossible to tame regardelss of the human contact they recieve. Unfortunately, other big cats raised by humans are unable to be controlled by their owners when they becomes adults and cannot be released into the wild since they did not grow up there and do not have the necessary survival skills. Often, these ones are put down. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenPhil_21c5.html" title="User:BenPhil">Ben</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenPhil_e641.html" title="User talk:BenPhil">talk</a>)</sup> 20:29, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
